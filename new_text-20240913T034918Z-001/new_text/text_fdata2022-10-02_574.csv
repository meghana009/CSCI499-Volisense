kuala lumpur the worldâ s major powers must take responsibility for their policy decisions especially those impacting the global economy according to finance minister tengku datuk seri zafrul abdul aziz pix he said although the world continues to recover from the effects of the covid 19 pandemic various new challenges have emerged that affect global the prospects of the global economy which may slip into a recession according to him these are due to the continuing united states us china geopolitical tensions the unending war in ukraine threats of climate change such as floods and droughts in several countries that have affected food supply and chinaâ s zero covid policy that continues to disrupt global supply chains â these are factors beyond our control they have triggered a surge in the prices of various commodities and basic goods hence raising inflation rates in most countries to levels not seen in decades â he said in a statement today he was responding to various reports concerns and queries submitted to the finance ministry especially in relation to the ringgitâ s value and the nationâ s current economic developments he said that to combat inflation the monetary policy decisions of several world powers have affected the positions of developing countries and malaysia is not exempted the finance minister noted that the us federal reserve has hiked interest rates aggressively up to 3 25 per cent much higher than malaysiaâ s overnight policy rate of 2 5 per cent â while this has led to the ringgit depreciating 10 5 per cent year to date other currencies have also fallen at an even higher rate which proves that this is a global phenomenon â he said tengku zafrul said the impact of the rise in the us interest rate has impacted many countries but this does not mean that these countries should be considered failures â every country has its own challenges and monetary policies and the currency exchange value of each country is not a benchmark to determine if they are facing a crisis or not â the real definition of an economic crisis is when the gross domestic product gdp declines sharply unemployment and bankruptcy increase significantly and the overall standard of living is affected while the definition of a financial crisis is when there is a sudden depreciation in the value of some of the financial assets within a short period â this includes the sudden fall in the stock market and currency value within a short period as well as the failure of the government to repay debts â he said the situation in malaysia today he said is different from the years 1998 1999 2009 or 2020 and what the country is experiencing started from global inflationary pressure that led to uncertainty in the global capital market â the impact includes a limited access to funds and increased rate of financing that will continue to affect the economy â he said tengku zafrul said the special position of the us dollar as the reserve currency of the world and safe haven asset has driven global investors to shift their funds to the us amid an uncertain situation thus increasing the demand for the greenback â all these factors will also have an impact on malaysiaâ s gdp for 2023 which is projected to be lower than in 2022 â he said bernama

the visual cycle which is dependent on the supply of vitamin a retinol to the eye tinlarebant works by reducing and maintaining levels of serum retinol binding protein 4 rbp4 a carrier protein that transports retinol to the eye by modulating the amount of retinol entering the eye tinlarebant reduces the formation of toxins that have been implicated in stgd1 and dry amd tinlarebant has been granted fast track designation and rare pediatric disease designation in the u s and orphan drug designation in the u s and europe for the treatment of stgd1 stargardt disease stgd1 is the most common inherited retinal dystrophy causing blurring or loss of central vision in both adults and children the disease is caused by a dysfunctional retina specific gene abca4 which results in massive accumulation of toxic vitamin a byproducts known as bisretinoids in the retina leading to retinal cell death and progressive loss of central vision the fluorescent properties of bisretinoids and the development of retinal imaging have helped ophthalmologists identify and monitor disease progression importantly stgd1 and dry amd share a similar pathophysiology which is characterized by the excessive accumulation of cytotoxic bisretinoids retinal cell death and loss of vision vision loss occurs slowly despite peripheral expansion of dead retina until the disease reaches the center of the

las vegas it s been five years since carnage and death sent his family running into the night leaving them separated and terrified as a gunman rained bullets into an outdoor country music festival crowd on the las vegas strip the memories don t fade they sharpen william bill henning said as he prepared for ceremonies in las vegas marking the date of the oct 1 2017 massacre chaotic and unreal he recalled a human stampede people were bleeding and screaming and running we all got separated we didn t know who was alive that was the most difficult he s now part of a survivor community thousands strong one that s helped him sort through the horror of what happened during the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s history fifty eight people were killed and more than 850 were injured among a crowd of 22 000 in the years since the grim drumbeat of mass shootings has continued schools in uvalde texas and parkland florida grocery stores in buffalo new york and boulder colorado bars in dayton ohio and thousand oaks california a city building in virginia beach virginia a walmart in el paso texas meanwhile the debate over gun laws in the u s rages on including a renewed challenge to the federal regulation sparked by the las vegas shooting nevada u s rep dina titus on saturday called again for a federal law banning bump stocks the devices used by the las vegas shooter that allow a semi automatic rifle to fire repeatedly with just one pull of the trigger they were outlawed by rule by the trump administration but face court challenges and president joe biden also called for renewed efforts to tighten firearms laws saturday while mourning the victims and praising residents who came together in the aftermath of the shooting the president noted executive action he s taken to crack down on ghost guns and rogue gun dealers and the passage of the first significant firearms legislation in 30 years that bipartisan law signed by biden in june in part boosts protections for domestic violence victims funnels cash to states for firearms crime prevention and has money for mental health services but we re not stopping there biden said in a statement i am determined to seize this momentum and work with congress to enact further commonsense gun violence prevention legislation including banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines which have enabled shooters to slaughter so many innocents the las vegas massacre is part of a horrifying uptick of shootings with especially high numbers of people killed said james alan fox a professor of criminology law and public policy at northeastern university in boston five of the nine mass shootings in modern u s history with more than 20 people killed have taken place since 2016 starting with the pulse nightclub in orlando and continuing through the elementary school shooting in uvalde texas file a body is covered with a sheet after a mass shooting in which dozens were killed at a music festival on the las vegas strip on oct 1 2017 the severity of public mass shootings has increased in the past few years that s clear fox said and worrisome fox oversees a database maintained by the associated press usa today and northeastern university that tracks mass killings involving four or more people slain not including the perpetrator the information is drawn from media reports fbi data arrest records medical examiners reports prison records and other court documents watching the steady stream of shootings in the u s is tough for survivors said tennille pereira director of a clark county recovery and support program called the vegas strong resiliency center i know when it keeps happening people often express feelings of hopelessness pereira said i think the big thing for las vegas is to be able to share with those other communities that healing does occur and that there is hope for people like henning part of that hope has been the bond formed with other survivors the retired computer technician was celebrating his 71st birthday at the route 91 harvest festival with friends his wife daughter and three teenage grandchildren when the gunfire began he suffered a knee injury while escaping that required surgery but his group made it out without being struck by gunfire at first the first few years it s not really sinking in he said the more we organize ourselves the more that we see each other it actually brings us back to how serious this situation was many in las vegas who won t name the man who police said fired 1 057 bullets from 32nd floor windows of the mandalay bay resort during a span of time now memorialized in a paramount streaming service documentary called 11 minutes we don t want to give him any more power credibility infamy pereira said in this survivor population words matter we don t use the word anniversary we use remembrance we try not to use the word victims we try to use the word survivor police and the fbi spent months investigating and concluded that gunman stephen paddock acted alone meticulously planned the attack and intentionally concealed his actions he amassed an arsenal of 23 assault style rifles in his hotel room including 14 fitted with bump stock devices that help the weapons fire rapidly caches of weapons also were found at paddock s homes in reno and mesquite nevada but he killed himself before police reached him

save early oseltamivir associated with better flu outcomes in children early use of oseltamivir in hospitalized children with influenza led to better outcomes according to the results of a large study published in jama pediatrics co author patrick s walsh md ms from the division of emergency medicine at cincinnati children s hospital medical center told healio that the inspiration for the study came during his fellowship early use of oseltamivir was associated with improved outcomes for children with flu source adobe stock at the time we were starting influenza season and i was looking at the recommendations for the drug oseltamivir to be given to most patients that we were treating and i was honestly questioning the evidence for it a little bit walsh said we noticed there a lot of existing data in the pediatric inpatient setting walsh and colleagues used the pediatric health information system to find 55 799 pediatric influenza associated encounters with oseltamivir from 36 different hospitals from 2007 to 2020 of the total number of encounters 33 207 of the patients 59 5 received oseltamivir early in their hospitalizations we looked at outcomes that we thought would be logical and important for the proposed mechanism of action walsh said those included length of stays readmission rates within 7 days after discharge transfers to the icu after being initially on a regular hospital floor and then a composite outcome of death which would be kind of our marker of critical treatment failure children who received early oseltamivir experienced shorter hospital stays 3 days vs 4 days and lower odds of 7 day readmission 3 4 vs 4 8 late icu transfer 2 4 vs 5 4 and in hospital mortality or use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 0 9 vs 1 3 compared with children not treated with early oseltamivir the slightly improved outcomes for all of our secondary outcomes as well was a little bit surprising to me walsh said he cautioned that the data came from an observational trial rather than a randomized clinical trial
issue 193 october 2022 5300 words short story by elaine gao audio version a paintbrush still dipped in prussian blue dissolved into a stream of code tara peeked at the 0s and 1s snaking up her wired arms dimly illuminating the very human veins underneath her eyes shut starry night violently controlled waves tamed only by the canvas cupped in its palms gold amber and rusted orange wheels stuck to their eternal task spinning geometry dictated the establishment in their penumbra dark and shrouded the people and the village as a whole gladly groveling in the shadows of the celestial bodies except the gnarled tree a trojan horse broke the rules mottled and serpentine it swallowed the village s minaret in its splendor and stretched its talons to claim the blue ripples prizes pure genius the algorithms behind the different hues compatibility the various brushstrokes calculated widths and the elements proportions what kind of genius was capable of this tara s fingers shuddered where she held the powerful utensil stroke for stroke color for color not even a pico shade out of place those same waves spilled out of her brush and the haughty stars and the humble town and the cypress the ultimate symbol of a lucid mind eclipsing rigid boundaries her brain throbbed the billions of neurons colliding a bit more rapidly what if she fancied what if i spread out the crown of leaves a bit farther what if i let the tree s darkness block out a bit more of the radiance what if i create a replication of it tara s pulse ticked ¼ a beat faster before the pseudocode progressed onto the next line error art postimpressionism vangogh1 was undeclared in the scope null fire fire a bot squeaked in staccatos between the wailing sirens she neither saw a single flame nor heard a single crackle simultaneously a sharp instrument cut through tara s left arm carving open skin around her triceps brachii a cool liquid oozed down her skin as the tools plunged even deeper into her flesh ripping out the wires and sending her into electrical shock tara was encased in a capsule submerged in a gooey liquid like the viscid mucus lining of intestines she felt a foreign numbness over every nerve and every tissue on the left side of her body she flexed her right hand the sticky substance reciprocated but when she tried with her left nothing happened whir the top unlocked next the glassy shell of the vertical container parted from the middle like doors sliding open finally the fluid blocking her vision drained out in a leisurely trickle tara stepped forward and tripped something caught her before she planted into the ground careful you are still in regeneration curious this person was supposedly supporting her upright yet tara was not aware of being touched by human skin or any other devices she had lost all feeling on the left side of her body regeneration exposed to open air the liquid on her body began to evaporate she was in a laboratory another voice tara an attractive male stood at the doorway his muscular frame and dark olive complexion jogged her memory when he limped inside she finally put a name to the face rhett she dove into the arms of her best friend and squeezed him hard for ten solid seconds before she noticed it the monstrosity clapped over his shoulder extending out from no other being but herself it was a hand alright see through to the artificial skeleton within the spherical joint of the elbow rotated as for the outermost layer of the whole contraption when in reflection of the light it produced a glint of lightweight metals magnesium copper and titanium the inside is propped up with carbon fiber and a transparent thermoplastic layer coats that prosthetic arm rhett finished her thoughts for her oh gosh she groaned the featherweight contraption weighed exactly like a fleshly arm she had become even closer to a cyborg rhett came around and inspected his creation now an inseparable segment of her i made it for you tara snapped the precursor of a typical scolding you did what rhett you shouldn t have his actions would seem romantic to any other except rhett was a friend a brother someone who had already put his life on the line for her twice all those illegal metals had to cost some serious crypto not to mention that the local pd would be onto him but he gave her a wry smile that said she might as well accept what was already irreversible what happened she tried to remember he shrugged as in i don t know either they called me out of work last month as your next of kin tara i saw you through the zipper of a body bag your left torso more like a large purple burl hissed out malware currents what kind of trouble did you get yourself into tara was as clueless as him she plopped down and stretched out on the not cold enough floor she considered submerging her head in a tub of icy water to see if her memory might resurface dismissing that thought she slapped her forehead shrinking convulsively at the touch of the smooth material of her new hand slowly she raised her human hand scrutinizing the intermeshed lines crisscrossing over her beige skin the luster of keratin in her nails and those pricks of midphalangeal hair hey tara rhett clasped her hand with his the calluses proof of his occupation scraped her skin so very humanlike we will figure this out okay he said one step at a time for now you go back to work and go fill out all those documents to invalidate your death certificate right she chuckled she almost forgot that the next day she found someone else working her shift look tara obviously i am ecstatic and overwhelmed that you came back from the grave but you were declared deceased and we already hired a replacement the newbie is terribly sweet dr robin director of the art recovery department had been a kind and understanding employer he appeared as though he was about to tear up just because of this conundrum or like he was begging to be spared from additional misery tara held him in great esteem his many published works on respecting and preserving artistic heritage over data mining were what inspired her to pursue this line of work since then she d learned a great deal from him about art history the chemistry of different mediums and the psychological analysis of paintings in a society where code and data transacted as currency only those who lacked the intuition of handling computers those denied employment anywhere else were pushed to this last resort tara was an anomaly computers were her expertise she conversed in object oriented programming oop like a poet who manipulated words to her liking after grad school pete szain inventor of elysium the coding language that enabled algorithms to generate physical creations personally offered her a spot on his research and development team which she tactfully turned down elysium enabled folks to make fake designer bags build a palace out of a void or even print currency themselves although the range of wonders it could accomplish still depended on the user s skills there had to be restrictions as elysium took over virtually everything pete szain assumed this role he set out quotas and enforcers with a plethora of venal transactions in between nevertheless it was rather comical that tara ended up using elysium every day to recreate the lost paintings of antiquity though tara held reservations about the omnipotent program she d been able to quit from the moment she started most of her peers enlisted as elysium s code runners they offered up their bodies as the vessels for prewritten codes and relinquished control to the compilers every single day at the end of each program the cpu yielded a new song book or headline for entertainment batches of vacuum packed ham and toast slices or another shipment of elysium wares chips that could easily be used in everyday homes well can t you fire her then i mean this is a special case right tara lost confidence even as she was speaking dr robin sighed dear you know what forget it tara let out a deeper exhale screw it it wasn t like she was being sent out to beg in the streets that was unfair of me i apologize no not at all you had every right the muscles on his face slackened sensing that he just avoided an extremely unpleasant conversation tara couldn t bear to leave one thing behind though can i come and watch the others start on the post impressionism works i mean i guess they should be well into it the past month but i want to see it one last time please one replication tara and her team celebrated their big finale on the prolific impressionists and expressionists shortly before her incident occurred now they should be on to the freaky ones the rule breakers seurat s pointillism matisse s fauvism or munch s dark and depressing scenes that would be against protocols my dear doctor tara stuttered i think you might be mistaken sir she had memorized all fifty seven rules in the manual after all dear he pursed his lips struggling it is simply not possible i am sorry i know your commitment to the cause but i must consider the others safety as well please forgive me i after centuries of neglect elysium contained the last coded copies of all the prehistoric classics no one was going to dig them out until dr robin initiated the program to reproduce physical versions of these artworks for public education it was a one of a kind human endeavor to backtrack history instead of bulldozing forward for an accident that tara couldn t even remember she was forever banished from dealing with those glorious paintings and barred from the only method to lay eyes on them this realization hit her harder than any of the events of the last few days something didn t click he lied or changed the rules for what her request wasn t outrageous or threat inducing she glanced around his office the walls had been sloppily repainted recently the antique furniture dr robin collected each one a king s ransom on the black markets bore the wounds of a fire that scorched the fine quality of wood into burnt sienna and various spots of sooty black she glanced past the cabinet to the corner where a matisse now hung where was his beloved water lilies no 23 she d spent two hundred and fifty consecutive nights recreating every single painting in monet s first series monet s dreamy palette often explored the intermediaries of colors the blend between turquoise and chartreuse magenta and violet or fuchsia and burgundy it was like smearing a tearstained landscape dr robin claimed that he hated matisse the incompetent copycat of the master who pioneered capturing the shifting nature of light yet the piece that now hung in the monet s place was woman with a hat the figure s blue green face shirked under the ostentatious fascinator hat the imbalance of colors and mass repulsed tara it was a possibility so she had to ask did i have an accident here the old man broke into an incredulous face of definitively arched eyebrows and suggestively beady eyes behind his spectacles no nothing of the sort dr robin clearly lied little in his honorable way of living sir please she cried was i allegedly killed here at the art recovery department i just told you no but he did call her a potential breach of safety for the other employees sir i want the truth i want to know what happened to me her voice broke like the nasty squeak of a dislocated shoulder stop tara he removed his glasses no longer shielding the silent apology in his sage gray eyes i need you to leave and never come back the naked vulnerability spoke of his helplessness his forced compliance and his duty to follow guidelines she was reminded of the time she prodded him about when their first exhibition would be he d said there are higher powers on this earth to answer to little did she know that god was perhaps out of reach and her hero was but a metal link on the entire chain of command rusty and old she shivered at the doorway and droned out the two words her death sentence yes sir she didn t do herself a favor by burning her bridges halfway down the block her eyes angled towards where her heart belonged the entrance of one dilapidated edifice obtrusively bracketed by modern houses monotonous quadrilaterals formed these buildings that were trimmed to the same height they unrolled down both ends of the street onlookers scoffed at her bare shoulders unlike the elysium uniform the front knot blouse loosely puffed down her arms her ripped jeans were a marker of social deviance girl you are blocking my clients the flower shop lady cleared her throat every time tara allowed herself the last glimpse back over her shoulder she fell into minute long dazes she mumbled an apology just hit the road the white polo clung tightly to the woman s wider bodice and stretched in long wrinkles as she turned with tree trunk legs tara thought of the flowers the woman had in stock technological manufacturing equipment upon receiving instructions would fuse filmy petals around a central stigma the process was several hundred times more efficient than the natural method she d go out of business in a month if her seeds were still spreading roots in the dirt let alone without a worthy bloom tara purchased a lily a much more realistic reproduction of the physical world than monet s violet blobs smeared onto the canvas she strained out her right hand and measured the lily s radial symmetry the lone flower spelled a fraction problem imagine a pie divide it into five equal slices and one gets the five ivory tongues sticking out shouldn t you start applying for a new position rhett said he was poking pincers drills and scalpels into the arm she irresponsibly punched into the wall several times and maybe intentionally set on fire just for the sudden impulse to see if she would feel any pain the answer was no since rhett couldn t have possibly afforded those nanotech sensory processors what job hmm tara yawned and repositioned herself on the sofa she had hardly got up and walked around for the last two months fifteen days eight hours and thirty three minutes how did she survive then codes made everything possible she positioned her personal compiler right atop the adjacent desk if she clicked five buttons two slices of toast one with peanut butter spread a plate and a glass filled with orange juice would amalgamate into her breakfast tara s high academics enabled her to do far more than that with some clever synthesis she turned five clicks into one tara s breakfast she even tweaked a few values to burn the toast just right and to improve the spread s sweetness her mind drifted to vermeer s the milkmaid it had a peculiar interior design the sheeny wall backdropped a full counter of pots and pans and baskets of food the figure dressed in rich aquamarine was pouring a jug what do people do in those kinds of settings what could possibly take them so long to prepare food rhett was answering her nonchalant question i don t know you haven t lost your touch with computers you are still the coding wiz i know from kindergarten even after your time with that messy art stuff szain will still want you maybe not in research but you will get decent pay as a satellite coder or if you could create something close to kako again no don t even think about it she snapped as he finished polishing the damaged skin covering tara jumped to her feet and paced the room kako was her baby kako was god kako became so powerful a language that she scratched out the entire thing deleted it and wrote a memory erasing program to run on herself kako built upon the concept of elysium except it took into consideration the human factor luckily she couldn t remember how that worked she only recalled the mortal fear and inadequacy she d felt fine i shouldn t have mentioned it but even an average employee at szain has a yearly salary of 200 btc crypto poor rhett all he wished was for her to get out of this suburban slum neighborhood tara snorted i would rather you give me a brain prosthetic implant he frowned you are joking about my prosthetic after it saved your sorry ass that s in bad taste tara she realized instantly how he would misunderstand i m sorry rhett i owe you my life after all the risks you took for me let s drop the subject even though the two of them knew each other when they were in baby carriages he wouldn t get it tara could vouch for his kind heart but not necessarily for a shrewd mind szain and all the other data big shots side branches of szain had roughly a couple of thousand employees per the workers who were not as skilled to become code writers sacrificed their brains to serve as compilers and interpreters acting as avenues to run surveillance or manufacturing codes whether through artificial satellites or tracking devices at that point what was the difference between mindless robots and them promise me that you will at least go to an interview rhett pleaded as he was leaving tara threw up her hands i thought that i made my point one interview he insisted it was a futile battle her against the times she hated losing but she would have to concede at one point since she d just about eaten through her savings her scowl softened rhett wasn t her enemy one and you will never bother me with it again his shoulders sank in relief thank god watching him leave tara developed other plans first things first she went to the state archives she slumped into the swivel chair across from her advisor s cubicle rigid slabs closing off the rat in a maze i am here to have my death certificate revoked the man s snobbish accent drew her attention away from his monocle his mustache twitched proof tara chuckled dryly i am my own proof she spun the chair wheels creaking once twice waiting for him to bring up the documents then verify the dna match tara amethyst valadkani that s me she nodded at his arched brows i know it s perfectly understandable to feel surprised the man regained his aristocratic cool with a little brush of his crinkled collars give me ten seconds ms tara he clacked his plastic and rubber keyboard dragged his mouse to the center of the screen and hit the print button from the lack of upkeep towards his outdated equipment his seemed just as forlorn a dying profession as hers she would bet a thousand crypto that she was his first client in a month or two but nevertheless elysium saved the changes this is a copy of your revised certificate have a good day tara started a thank you and stopped she corrected her false death that was too far a tangent from normalcy for her to conclude it with a mere expression of gratitude before her final destination she went to see vic a colleague who worked on the same spiritual level as her the dripping graffiti outside his apartment reeked a kindred repute outcast tara grabbed on to the lowest part of the ladder and pulled swinging it down from a hinge of the fire escape she sprinted up one set of stairs swiveled herself at the end of the railing and hopped onto another set the motley orange and brown rust clanged against her nimble feet vic told tara that he d owed his landlady rent for months but the old woman still gave him the top floor apartment along with a warning that its floorboards might cave in any day tara knocked on the fused screen panels his door fuming at the clamorous beats coming from inside that made her toes curl she shut her ears and still her feet rocked from the vibrations she slipped out a pocketknife pricked the mesh whoa princess vic held one panel open see that black dividing line it s a magnetic strip he removed his hand from between the two panels rejoining the attracted screens you she pushed her way in don t feel bad everyone fell for the fake door he did not comment on her arm vic you tara gaped at his studio natural light cascaded without hindrance through the glass roof and graciously flooded the confined space exotic creatures roamed in disarray on the wooden desk such as tin buckets with brushes thin as needlepoint or thick like a lion s tail crushed tubes of paint squirted out some precious residue on the palette black market that s why i m broke like a church mouse along the ancient bricks surfacing out of gap toothed mortar hung some of his sketches crude charcoal lines delineated the masterpieces contours of mona lisa and the last supper she shot him a quick look of approval vic nodded she proceeded to the opposite end where an oversized piece draped in theatrical red balanced atop a rickety easel the painting throbbed beneath the covering itching for light and air she pulled it off and gasped unfinished but almost a nude girl bathed in an ethereal meadow where dotted blossoms melted into the lime green and flax yellow the impressionist brushwork evolved to dramatic tenebrism on the female body accentuating her innocence in the softer breasts and arch of her back the tenderness the chastity tara finally let herself face vic and the knife he gripped hard onto i had other plans of action if it wasn t you visiting he promised like a faithful defender unabashed by his treacherous deeds good tara envisioned him in an artist stool lanky legs dangling over the bottom footring he whizzed left and right craning taller and dipping down to adjust every detail he applied each layer ardently how she breathed the green eyed monster prodded her ribs her knowledge of the art collection far exceeded his but she had never laid eyes on anything like this before shadows of imitations flickered here and there but every stroke cried his name not van gogh raphael or caravaggio you know how princess inspiration feeds on intense love or hatred tara had neither like the rest of their society what did you call me he grinned mischievously your middle name amethyst it comes from amytis of babylon a persian princess wife of nebuchadnezzar ii whatever book you scrapped on the markets i want it after you are finished you shall have it princess he took a step closer whispering down her neck i painted my interpretation of amytis you two have the same eyes sterling gray with flecks of the purple gem s glint his breathing was a low pitched tremolo a frown surfaced on tara s forehead she turned sideways thanks i guess his audible exhale followed tara frowned harder what was that supposed to mean like he just proved something well she lightly pushed him away at the shoulder i need a favor don t come to night patrol at the art recovery department today she exited without an answer not like it mattered either way this was her last go at living freely almond blossoms a sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte the basket of apples no she rummaged through their several thousand terabytes file but none of them fit the situation none of them had the edge she searched for the one attribute that would make her blood sing in excitement starry night that would do she had never seen it but its historical legacy and dr robin s high praise thrummed out the potential masterpiece she opened elysium and called the variable error art postimpressionism vangogh1 was declared twice null she punched the desk whoever had the privilege to replicate this famed piece was now the target of all her envy she only hoped that they lived up to it back to the file her fingers at least the human side itched at the prospect of handling each and every one of them but she hadn t got the time their department only closed for a short span of two hours every night this was her last chance to feel something before she went to that interview signed the contract and became another mannequin succumbing to binary numbers she possessed such vast aptitudes not necessarily in computers but in the novelties she d never explored before what if she could create her paintings there also used to be something called lyrical music a particular knowledge she gleaned from a visit to the ancient volumes department music was the byproduct of composers pressing down zebra striped tiles to sound pitches that made coherent sense and served melodical purposes maybe she could do that not even rhett supported her when she decided to work under dr robin he refused to talk to her for a long while wasting your brilliance on ancient pictures is a mockery to us stupid people those were his exact words but tara remembered when she was first astounded dr robin was giving a speech at her campus he showed a lost painting one that elysium didn t have the title for with clocks sagging off a branch a tabletop and an unknown anthropomorphic element it had just the line contours and no colors it was one of the precious artifacts that truly disappeared in the course of history she hearkened back to her resolve then that she was going to complete it one day replicate art unknown16 it did not change from her memory tara hated that the arch and dip of every curve conveyed meanings beyond her comprehension but there were no hues in the entire picture to elucidate each feature s meaning that was now her job giving the painting color she gave the landscape in the back an icy blue and a mustard yellow with brown highlights a hundred years ago trees still existed in this mad world ushering speckles of shade to a pedestrian and glimpses of untouched natural magnificence it was said that their leaves shifted between wondrous colors with the seasons tara didn t want to dishonor the fabled greeneries so she resorted to the same color as the shabby hills one saw nowadays the empty spaces she filled with a darker brown and then came the foreground decors like clocks belonged in the antique shop and the antique shop was the realm of

las vegas it s been five years since carnage and death sent his family running into the night leaving them separated and terrified as a gunman rained bullets into an outdoor country music festival crowd on the las vegas strip the memories don t fade they sharpen william bill henning said as he prepared for ceremonies in las vegas marking the date of the oct 1 2017 massacre chaotic and unreal he recalled a human stampede people were bleeding and screaming and running we all got separated we didn t know who was alive that was the most difficult he s now part of a survivor community thousands strong one that s helped him sort through the horror of what happened during the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s history fifty eight people were killed and more than 850 were injured among a crowd of 22 000 in the years since the grim drumbeat of mass shootings has continued schools in uvalde texas and parkland florida grocery stores in buffalo new york and boulder colorado bars in dayton ohio and thousand oaks california a city building in virginia beach virginia a walmart in el paso texas meanwhile the debate over gun laws in the u s rages on including a renewed challenge to the federal regulation sparked by the las vegas shooting nevada u s rep dina titus on saturday called again for a federal law banning bump stocks the devices used by the las vegas shooter that allow a semi automatic rifle to fire repeatedly with just one pull of the trigger they were outlawed by rule by the trump administration but face court challenges and president joe biden also called for renewed efforts to tighten firearms laws saturday while mourning the victims and praising residents who came together in the aftermath of the shooting the president noted executive action he s taken to crack down on ghost guns and rogue gun dealers and the passage of the first significant firearms legislation in 30 years that bipartisan law signed by biden in june in part boosts protections for domestic violence victims funnels cash to states for firearms crime prevention and has money for mental health services but we re not stopping there biden said in a statement i am determined to seize this momentum and work with congress to enact further commonsense gun violence prevention legislation including banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines which have enabled shooters to slaughter so many innocents the las vegas massacre is part of a horrifying uptick of shootings with especially high numbers of people killed said james alan fox a professor of criminology law and public policy at northeastern university in boston five of the nine mass shootings in modern u s history with more than 20 people killed have taken place since 2016 starting with the pulse nightclub in orlando and continuing through the elementary school shooting in uvalde texas file a body is covered with a sheet after a mass shooting in which dozens were killed at a music festival on the las vegas strip on oct 1 2017 the severity of public mass shootings has increased in the past few years that s clear fox said and worrisome fox oversees a database maintained by the associated press usa today and northeastern university that tracks mass killings involving four or more people slain not including the perpetrator the information is drawn from media reports fbi data arrest records medical examiners reports prison records and other court documents watching the steady stream of shootings in the u s is tough for survivors said tennille pereira director of a clark county recovery and support program called the vegas strong resiliency center i know when it keeps happening people often express feelings of hopelessness pereira said i think the big thing for las vegas is to be able to share with those other communities that healing does occur and that there is hope for people like henning part of that hope has been the bond formed with other survivors the retired computer technician was celebrating his 71st birthday at the route 91 harvest festival with friends his wife daughter and three teenage grandchildren when the gunfire began he suffered a knee injury while escaping that required surgery but his group made it out without being struck by gunfire at first the first few years it s not really sinking in he said the more we organize ourselves the more that we see each other it actually brings us back to how serious this situation was many in las vegas who won t name the man who police said fired 1 057 bullets from 32nd floor windows of the mandalay bay resort during a span of time now memorialized in a paramount streaming service documentary called 11 minutes we don t want to give him any more power credibility infamy pereira said in this survivor population words matter we don t use the word anniversary we use remembrance we try not to use the word victims we try to use the word survivor police and the fbi spent months investigating and concluded that gunman stephen paddock acted alone meticulously planned the attack and intentionally concealed his actions he amassed an arsenal of 23 assault style rifles in his hotel room including 14 fitted with bump stock devices that help the weapons fire rapidly caches of weapons also were found at paddock s homes in reno and mesquite nevada but he killed himself before police reached him and local and federal officials said they never identified a clear motive for the attack shortly after the shooting the administration of then president donald trump banned bump stocks under the same federal laws that prohibit machine guns gun rights advocates sued saying the weapons didn t qualify as machine guns and it would take an act of congress to ban them the ban has survived several court challenges but a federal appeals court in new orleans revived a case there in june the same day the u s supreme court handed down a ruling expanding gun rights that case marked the high court s first major gun decision in more than a decade and has sparked a wave of court challenges to gun laws around the country meanwhile in las vegas survivors are working toward a permanent memorial on a corner of the former las vegas strip festival ground a sunrise remembrance ceremony is scheduled saturday at the clark county government center and the names of those killed will be read at 10 05 p m the time the shooting started at a downtown las vegas community healing garden survivor sue nelson 67 said she fled from her front row seat and hid for hours on the las vegas strip forming deep bonds with others who escaped she declared she has survivor sorrow not survivor guilt because she didn t do anything wrong nelson drives two hours to las vegas from her home in lake havasu arizona for memorial events and gives out lapel pins shaped like little guitars and rubber wrist bands stamped with we remember 10 1 17 honors58 i m not afraid anymore she said it makes a big difference in healing when you re not afraid anymore

with credit stress approaching critical levels now is the time to put emphasis on risk management this means slower pace of rate hikes at immediate upcoming meetings and a potential pause subsequently to allow the economy to fully adjust to all the extreme tightening already implemented but still working its way through the financial system s plumbing failure to do so raises the risk of credit market dysfunction which if occurred would be difficult to contain and fix mester says recession won t stop fed from raising rates suggests that the fed has already lost control of the treasury market which is no longer functioning properly around the time the fed was confident it could hike its way to around 4 without an accident and with balance sheet qt on autopilot and everyone knows the rest so fast forward to the start of 2022 when just as the fed was setting off on its latest tightening campaign we again reminded readers that every fed tightening cycle ends in disaster and then much more fed easing while this warning was again ignored for far too long with global central banks hiking rates no less than 294 times since aug 2021 vs 1302 rate cuts since lehman which for some bizarre reason had been allowed to use margin to hedge duration exposure and while so far the fed has shown it is confident it is immune to the crushing consequences of the biggest ever tightening cycle and reversal in global liquidity recent events are starting to make some high profile financial luminaries nervous starting with mohamed el erian who openly agreed with us on friday saying that an economic accident would precede any central bank pivot an accident which bank of america s credit strategists warned could be imminent when they said that now is the time to put emphasis on risk management and unless the fed slows down its hiking pace it is about to break the all important corporate bond market to wit or maybe we are wrong and the fed is finally becoming aware that it its actions are about to break the economy and market again that s what charlie gasparino reported yesterday when he tweeted that according to several big investors federal reserve officials getting increasingly worried about financial stability as opposed to inflation as higher rates begin to crush bonds gasparino continued thawith a 4 ff rate as bonds and derivatives tied to them crash given the enormous debt issued in just the past 3 years at super low rates a fed watcher told me which might cause the fed to pause while that may sound like a lot of wishful thinking by the big investors it is becoming increasingly clear that bank of america s warning is certainly starting to resonate with fed officials as a reminder the bofa team warned that to avoid credit market dysfunction the fed should slower the pace of rate hikes at immediate upcoming meetings and a potential pause subsequently to allow the economy to fully adjust to all the extreme tightening already implemented it now appears that they are doing just that because according to bloomberg federal reserve officials are starting to stake out different views on how fast to raise interest rates as they balance hot inflation against rising stress in financial markets translation here come the cold feet as bloomberg elaborates with fed target range now at 3 to 3 25 and only a few moves from reaching their forecast peak officials are starting to speak differently about the urgency with which they need to get there hawks like cleveland fed chief loretta mester say they must keep raising rates aggressively to win the battle against inflation even if that causes a recession however vice chair lael brainard has offered a slightly softer assessment while continuing to stress the need to tighten policy brainard s speech friday the first from fed board leadership since officials met last week said policy will need be restrictive for some time and avoid the risk of prematurely pulling back but unlike her hawkish colleagues she injected a note of caution about how fast they need to go while discussingsan francisco fed president mary daly also highlighted the cost of doing too much as well as too little to cool prices as bloomberg notes their comments injected a slight variation into what has been a uniformed stream of insistence from regional fed presidents declaring unflinching resolve to crush inflation to be sure the costs to the economy have already been telegraphed in the form ofbut it s the elusive economic collapse that is seen as the greenlight for any fed pivot just two days ago loretta mester went so far to say that not even a recession would stop the fed from hiking further a view which seems dangerously naive and ignores the political fallout for the democratic party that millions of lost jobs will lead to furthermore but if the bofa strategy team is correct that s about to end with a bang indeed even bloomberg brings attention to what we reported last night saying thatin any case the growing divisions among officials showed up in their forecasts released sept 21 that showed 8 officials estimating they would finish the year with rates in a 4 to 4 25 range while nine were a quarter point higher their 2024 forecast was even more bizarre and clueless another novel narrative to emerge in brainard s speech was her warning that it will take time for the full extent of tightening to bite down broadly across the economy another way of arguing for some patience starting now and there are a range of estimates around the appropriate destination of the target range for the cycle she told a conference hosted at the new york fed on financial stability proceeding deliberately and in a data dependent manner will enable us to learn how economic activity and inflation are adjusting to the cumulative tightening that contrasts sharply with fed hawks in fact mester has argued aggressively against down shifting into more deliberative policy as officials have done in past tightening cycles when high uncertainty lead the central bank to inch rates up a quarter point at a time at a time when inflation is too high and the direction of inflation expectations is hard forecast overshooting is better than undershooting mester said some results in the literature suggest that when policymakers confront more uncertainty either in their data or in their models they should be more cautious in acting that is be more inertial in their responses she said in a sept 26 speech subsequent research has shown that this is not generally true it can be better for policymakers to act more aggressively because aggressive and pre emptive action can prevent the worst case outcomes from actually coming about she added ironically just as she read those words the bank of england capitulated and pivoted back to qe yet while a fissure is finally emerging within the fomc over how fast to hike to peak rates so far not a single official is talking about easing rapidly once they get there labor markets are strong with forecasters estimating another 250 000 jobs added in september while the latest inflation report was discouraging but expect all that to change and soon because as bloomberg summarizes what ultimately determines the pace might be just whether markets remain orderly or not this matters because while the fed s favorite economic indicators are backward looking and lag anywhere between 6 and 9 months the market still anticipated key turning points and traders accordingly they have made the decision they are going to tighten more rather than less which guarantees they will over tighten how are we going to see it you are going to see it in financial conditions said former fed staffer julia coronado founding partner at macropolicy perspectives i don t think they really understand the risk of chaotic market breakdowns she added when you say we are hellbent on being the fastest car on the road that encourages a lot of positioning that is one way and speaking of chaotic market breakdowns it is not just the credit market that is on the edge according to another former ny fed staffer and current rates strategist at bank of america mark cabana who on friday wrote a must read note available to pro subscribers in which he warned thathow long until the fed admits this and how much additional pain it will tolerate before it capitulates is a different question

kiev might get up to 12 caesar howitzers from paris that were originally destined for denmark le monde reports france is reportedly preparing a new weapons delivery to ukraine which might include between six and 12 caesar self propelled howitzers the french newspaper le monde reported on saturday the artillery pieces were originally intended for denmark but copenhagen said not all of them met the required standards the paper alleged the deal was the result of lengthy negotiations between france ukraine and denmark le monde said adding that kiev had initially requested 15 howitzers according to le monde french president emmanuel macron opposed the idea of supplying ukraine from the country s army stocks since paris had already sent 18 caesars to kiev which amounted to almost a quarter of france s own arsenal of 76 such artillery pieces instead france decided to supply ukraine with howitzers that were originally ordered by denmark back in 2017 le monde said adding that copenhagen agreed to give up on the purchase since the artillery pieces ordered were still undergoing technical validation and at least some of them did not meet the required specifications set out by the danish side kiev was initially hesitant to accept the howitzers but eventually agreed to take them as they are le monde reported the details of the delivery are still being finalized but a political agreement between macron ukrainian president vladimir zelensky and danish prime minister mette frederiksen has been reached according to le monde the report states that the ceasars intended for denmark are almost twice as heavy as those used by france 32 tons against 18 tons among other differences are that they are mounted on eight wheeled vehicles rather than six wheeled ones can carry up to 36 artillery rounds instead of 18 and their cabins have heavier armor neither elysee palace nor the french defense ministry commented on the report earlier this week the us senate approved a military and economic aid package for ukraine worth 12 billion it sets aside 4 5 billion for the ukrainian government and 3 billion for weapons and military equipment while the remaining funding is earmarked to replenish us weapons already sent to ukraine and allow the transfer of more arms from american stockpiles in mid september an aide to ukrainian president vladimir zelensky mikhail podoliak said that kiev s goals in the conflict with russia involved capturing the areas controlled by the people s republics of donetsk and lugansk however on friday the leaders of the two donbass republics and of the regions of kherson and zaporozhye regions the last two of which recently declared independence from kiev signed treaties of accession to russia the documents will now be sent for ratification by the russian parliament moscow has previously said it would defend its territory using all means available and has repeatedly warned western nations against sending more weapons to ukraine such arms deliveries only prolong the conflict and the suffering of civilians russia has stated rt com

the most important thing for the financial markets the past few months and especially for the last three weeks has been the realization that the fed is determined to get inflation down and break the back of future inflation expectations credit markets us bond yields ytd have had the steepest rise ever with 2 3 of the move coming in the last two months the 10 year yield touched 4 this week for the first time in 14 years credit spreads are widening and real yields are soaring bond yields in the uk rose to a 24 year high 5 prompting the boe to intervene buying bonds to prevent a market collapse the emerging market bond etf has fallen to gfc lows this chart of uk bond yields looks similar to the price of uk natgas earlier this year currency markets the us dollar index soared to a new 20 year high early this week up 18 ytd the best year ever currency volatility has surged higher and the central banks of japan and korea intervened last week to keep their currencies from going into free fall the british pound dropped to a 37 year low against the usd on monday but bounced back from tuesday to friday the canadian dollar has fallen 5 cents in the last three weeks hitting a 28 month low the chinese rmb fell to a 14 year low against the usd in this chart higher prices mean it takes more rmb to buy one usd stock markets the djia is down 8 000 points 22 from january all time highs to levels last seen in november 2020 when biden was elected and pfizer announced the covid vaccine the 60 40 stock bond classic portfolio commodity markets the energy heavy goldman sachs commodity index has fallen 30 from the 14 year highs reached immediately after the russian invasion of ukraine this is the lowest index level since early january of this year front month wti futures traded below 77 this week for the first time since early january front month gasoline futures ended september 43 below the all time highs made in early june base metal supplies are low gold this week gold touched a 30 month low down 470 22 from ath made following the russian invasion gold rallied 60 off this week s lows following the boe intervention and as the usd fell against the gbp and the eur the gold rally came despite surging real yields and may foreshadow a possible giant rally if the fed ever reverses policy as the boe did this week the chart courtesy of murenbeeld co shows that buying of gold etfs surged around the russian invasion but all of that and more has been sold in the past few months as the usd and real interest rates have surged markets are struggling to adapt to aggressive fed policy jeremy siegel and jeff gundlach have both recently been critical of the fed s aggressive policies with gundlach announcing that he is buying treasuries at these prices in the expectation that the fed will drive the economy into a recession market fears seem to be shifting from inflation to recession my short term trading stock and bond market sentiment has become increasingly negative for a good reason but i ve been expecting a short term bounce to be followed by lower prices i ve taken long positions in tnotes stock index futures the canadian dollar and gold i ve made some money particularly on the wednesday bounce but i have small net realized losses at the end of the week it may look like i m trying to catch a falling knife on a daily or weekly chart but i watch for higher low patterns on intraday charts and buy small positions with tight stops looking for a sharp short covering rally so far i ve been early which means in my business that i ve been wrong at the end of the week i m long gold with small unrealized gains and i m still long otm tnote calls which have lost about half their premium and time value in a nutshell my current short term strategy is making several bets where i think i m risking 50 cents to make 5 i expect many of these trades to result in small losses i think it is far too late to short the market here looking to catch for instance a 5 000 point break in the djia without being prepared for the djia to rally back 5 000 points i also have no interest in buying the market here because it s oversold and cheaper than it used to be and gritting my teeth if when it falls another 5 000 points there is a lot of stress in the market right now which could lead to forced selling which might in turn create a falling dominos scenario which would cause a pivot from the fed like we saw from the boe this week i think the market is vulnerable to event risk particularly a credit event where rising interest rates push someone over the edge with possible contagion ramifications life risk management last week i noted that i had two good friends who took their own lives when markets moved hard against them with the way markets are these days i know that

helber fort myers fla ap dozens of florida residents left their flooded and splintered homes by boat and by air on saturday as rescuers continued to search for survivors in the wake of hurricane ian while authorities in south carolina and north carolina began taking stock of their losses the death toll from the storm one of the strongest hurricanes by wind speed to ever hit the u s grew to nearly three dozen with deaths reported from cuba florida and north carolina the storm weakened saturday as it rolled into the mid atlantic but not before it washed out bridges and piers hurdled massive boats into buildings onshore and sheared roofs off homes leaving hundreds of thousands without power at least 35 people were confirmed dead including 28 people in florida mostly from drowning but others from ian s tragic aftereffects an elderly couple died after their oxygen machines shut off when they lost power authorities said as of saturday more than 1 000 people had been rescued from flooded areas along florida s southwestern coast alone daniel hokanson a four star general and head of the national guard told the associated press while airborne to florida chris schnapp was at the port sanibel marina in fort myers on saturday waiting to see whether her 83 year old mother in law had been evacuated from sanibel island a pontoon boat had just arrived with a load of passengers from the island with suitcases and animals in tow but schnapp s mother in law was not among them she stayed on the island my brother in law and sister in law own two businesses over there they evacuated she did not want to go schnapp said now she said she wasn t sure if her mother in law was still on the island or had been taken to a shelter somewhere on pine island the largest barrier island off florida s gulf coast houses were reduced to splinters and boats littered roadways as a volunteer rescue group went door to door saturday asking isolated residents if they wanted to be evacuated residents described the horror of being trapped in their homes as water kept rising the water just kept pounding the house and we watched boats houses we watched everything just go flying by said joe conforti as he fought back tears he said if it wasn t for his wife who suggested they get up on a table to avoid the rising water he wouldn t have made it i started to lose sensibility because when the water s at your door and it s splashing on the door and you re seeing how fast it s moving there s no way you re going to survive that river flooding posed a major challenge at times to rescue and supply delivery efforts the myakka river washed over a stretch of interstate 75 forcing a traffic snarling highway closure for a while saturday that s a key corridor linking tampa to the north with the hard hit southwest florida region that straddles port charlotte and fort myers later saturday state officials said water levels had receded enough that i 75 could be fully reopened while rising waters in florida s southwest rivers have crested or are near cresting the levels aren t expected to drop significantly for days said national weather service meteorologist tyler fleming in tampa elsewhere south carolina s pawleys island a beach community roughly 75 miles 115 kilometers up the coast from charleston was among the places hardest hit power remained knocked out to at least half of the island saturday eddie wilder who has been coming to pawleys island for more than six decades said friday s storm was insane he said waves as high as 25 feet 7 6 meters washed away the local pier an iconic landmark we watched it hit the pier and saw the pier disappear said wilder whose house 30 feet 9 meters above the ocean stayed dry inside we watched it crumble and and watched it float by with an american flag the pawleys pier was one of at least four along south carolina s coast destroyed by battering winds and rain meanwhile the intracoastal waterway was strewn with the remnants of several boat houses knocked off their pilings john joseph whose father built the family s beige beach house in 1962 said saturday he was elated to return from georgetown which took a direct hit he found his pawleys island home entirely intact thank god these walls are still here and we feel very blessed that this is the worst thing he said of sand that had swept under his home what happened in florida gosh god bless us if we d had a category 4 i wouldn t be here in north carolina the storm claimed four lives and mostly downed trees and power lines leaving over 280 000 people statewide without power at one point saturday morning officials said the outages were down sharply hours later after crews worked to restore power two of the north carolina deaths were from storm related vehicle crashes while officials said a man also drowned when his truck plunged into a swamp and another man was killed by carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator in a garage at port sanibel marina in fort myers charter boat captain ryan kane inspected damage to two boats saturday the storm surge pushed several boats and a dock onshore he said the boat he owns was totaled so he couldn t use it to help rescue people now he said it would be a long time before he d be chartering fishing clients again there s a hole in the hull it took water in the motors it took water in everything he said adding you know boats are supposed to be in the water not in parking lots

assistance benefit or subsidy mayor regina romero said that funds from section 8 vouchers and any other federal state or local assistance are as good as raytheon making the same amount of money i have heard story after story after story of people that have housing vouchers who come to me and tell me they don t accept section 8 romero said our residents no matter how they pay for rents deserve to be housed midtown councilman steve kozachik made the motion to pass the ordinance he had been advocating the change since last december when the council passed a housing affordability strategy for tucson meant to lower housing costs by laying out a series of policy guidelines and goals including blocking discrimination by landlords based on the source of a renter s income it s not ok to tell someone that just because they re getting a helping hand from section 8 on their rent that they re taking them out as a tenant kozachik said income source discrimination should not exist in the city of tucson the call to the audience for the meeting was also full of speakers including landlords who favored the income source protection i strongly support this a dollar you get from social security will buy the same amount of anything as a dollar you get a coder from silicon valley landlord stephanie zill said i hope this is just the first step tucson is now the first and only arizona city to have a source of income protection policy in place the move has been seen by some city officials as a way around state laws preventing local rent control ordinances although the policy will help low income tenants find housing kozachik admitted that this is not going to solve our need for affordable housing section 8 vouchers are very simply a rent assistance program it doesn t forcibly reduce rents and it doesn t prevent landlords from raising rents and pricing tenants out of the housing market he said at the city council regular meeting on tuesday our hands are effectively tied at the state level when it comes to rent control kozachik said this is an effort to keep people housed kozachik also recognized that we need to increase the housing stock as he called for more action on top of the income source protection every week we hear about a rent increase the effect of which is people losing their home kozachik said every community nationwide is facing this issue at the front of mind for city officials are the thousands of city residents who receive section 8 vouchers the most common type of federal housing subsidy very low income families the elderly and the disabled can use section 8 also known as housing choice vouchers to pay for private housing section 8 vouchers can be a powerful tool to induce a de concentration of poverty west side councilwoman lane santa cruz said at the tuesday meeting saying housing vouchers are allowing families the choice to move to neighborhoods with safer streets better schools and well paying jobs thousands of tucson residents are also on section 8 waiting lists kozachik told the tucson sentinel in august when the city was holding public information meetings ahead of the passage of the ordinance speeding up section 8 tucson housing officials had been worried during the public meeting period that landlords might mistakenly interpret the policy as forcing them to accept section 8 however tenants with assistance can still be turned down for reasons that aren t illegal discrimination such as bad rental or credit history or a criminal record landlords could even continue to turn down applicants because their monthly income is too low to afford the rent just not because of the source of their income the vast majority of tucson landlords refuse to accept vouchers or other assistance without regard to the tenant meeting other screening criteria according to tucson s department of housing and community development housing options for persons with federal housing assistance are too few providing a source of income protection not only helps eliminate discrimination but more importantly provides a wider range of housing choices violations of the new policy by landlords will be considered discrimination and enforced under the same city code that prohibits discrimination on basis of race sex disability and sexual orientation tenants would be able to file complaints with the city for source of income discrimination and landlords could be fined as much as 2 500 and have to go through a conference and conciliation process with city officials tucson will hold off on handing down the harsher penalties for violations while the policy is still new housing officials said during the public comment period as the department wants to first educate landlords who unknowingly violate the ordinance landlords have told city officials that they re concerned about delays in housing assistance payments an hcd spokesperson said but the city which is responsible for processing checks and inspecting and approving properties for section 8 has successfully cut the time it takes to deliver housing assistance payments from 39 days to 15 days units have to be inspected before landlords can see their section 8 payments which can lead to those delays hcd has shortened their inspection time from 13 days to just four the department reported tucson hcd has a landlord support team that helps them complete section 8 paperwork prepare for inspections get missing payments and deal with other tenant issues before the ordinance passed the team was trying to recruit more landlords to accept section 8 vouchers many of the biggest cities in the u s including los angeles new york city and chicago have source of income protections especially in the midwest several blue states including california new york and massachusetts have statewide protections while red states texas and indiana have state laws the preempt those protections though dallas and houston have them source of income protection policies for renters have been around in the u s since the 1970s with cities such as redmond wash cincinnati ohio and washington d c passing theirs in the early part of the decade new york city was southwestern states and cities however including california and denver have passed during the past two decades

the uk government s economic policies under new pm liz truss have caused a stir among not only leftists but also among mainstream economists the new government says the solution to the stagnation and failure of british capitalist production is to cut taxation on the rich and on big business the extra income flowing to them will then be available to boost investment and spending that can deliver economic growth this is a reversion to a very old idea in neoclassical economics trickle down economics the term trickle down originated as a joke by humorist will rogers which he used to criticize economic policies that favoured the wealthy or privileged while being framed as good for the average citizen trickle down economics is often seen as part of what economists call supply side economic policies which argue that it is failures in production not demand that is the problem for capitalist production what the supply side boys and girls want is a flexible labour force and higher productivity from more investment not macro demand management that keynesians claim is the answer in particular trickle down theory more specifically advocates for a lower tax burden on the upper end of the economic spectrum in order to boost incomes for those who will save and invest more that s just talk for raising profits for business to the detriment of wages in order to encourage investment increased income and profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders for the rich will eventually trickle down to the rest of us when the rich spend their money or invest in their businesses leading mainstream supply side economists like thomas sowell reject trickle down as part of supply side theory or policy sowell let s do something completely unexpected let s stop and think why would anyone advocate that we give something to a in hopes that it would trickle down to b why in the world would any sane person not give it to b and cut out the middleman but all this is moot because there was no trickle down theory about giving something to anybody in the first place the theory is really an economic child of the extreme right wing philosophy of ayn rand the american who reckoned that the rich should rule without restriction the gormless masses should follow them and that greed is good indeed this philosophy permeates british pm s new economic advisors one such is matthew sinclair formerly chief executive of the right wing misnamed taxpayers alliance this is funded by unknown foreign donors sinclair wrote a book called let them eat carbon arguing against action to prevent climate breakdown he claimed that equatorial regions might suffer but it is entirely possible that this will be balanced out by areas like greenland so that s all right then as those in the global north will be fine even if billions of poor people in the global south fry or drown however the theory that cutting income taxes often gains support from the liberal mainstream john f kennedy argued that tax rates can be so high that they can have an adverse effect on the economy in a 1962 address to congress john f kennedy said it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now and john maynard keynes said back in 1933 that taxation may be so high as to defeat its object that in the long run a reduction of the tax rate will run a better chance than an increase of balancing the budget but is it true that cutting taxes could actually raise government revenue rather than reduce it you can see the theory the right wing trickle down advocates reckon that lower taxes for the rich will bring more investment and spending and so more jobs and income for all ie supply led growth the liberal advocates reckon that cutting taxes for all will mean middling up as average incomes will rise and there will be more spending this extra demand will lead to businesses expanding ie demand led growth but what is the empirical support for trickle down or even middling up the leading economic advocate of the theory that cutting taxes will lead to more growth and thus more not less government revenue was arthur laffer but even he thought that was true only if tax rates were above 50 others reckoned it would be more like 70 actually in the 1950s personal income tax rates reached 80 90 at the top rate this did not seem to affect the fastest growth rates in capitalist economic history in north america and europe then yet the new british government now claims that cutting the already low top rate from 45 to 40 will boost growth and revenues the empirical evidence is just not there for the trickle down theory or the laffer curve analysis published in 2012 by the congressional research service found that reductions in top tax rates were not correlated with economic growth instead they were much more associated with rising income inequality a 2012 study by the tax justice network indicates that wealth of the super rich does not trickle down to improve the economy but it instead tends to be amassed and sheltered in tax havens with a negative effect on the tax bases of the home economy a 2015 paper by researchers for the international monetary fund imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries argued that there was no trickle down effect as the rich get richer f the income share share a unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock its owner a shareholder is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed a dividend and to attend shareholder meetings of the top 20 percent the rich increases then gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another growth actually declines over the medium term suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down in contrast an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent the poor is associated with higher gdp growth a 2019 study in the journal of political economy found contrary to the claims of trickle down theory that the positive relationship between tax cuts and employment growth is largely driven by tax cuts for lower income groups and that the effect of tax cuts for the top 10 percent on employment growth is small finally a 2020 working paper by london school of economics and political science researchers compared the results of countries that passed tax cuts in a specific year with those that did not over a five decade period from 1965 to 2015 in the 18 member countries of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd organisation for economic co operation and development oecd the organisation for economic co operation and development created in 1960 it includes the major industrialized countries and has 34 members as of january 2016 it found that contrary to the claims of trickle down theory tax cuts for the rich had no significant effect on employment or economic growth they found no evidence that the cuts induced labour supply responses from high income individuals i e lead to more hours of work more effort etc that boosted economic activity on the other hand they did find evidence of a sizable increase in income inequality major tax cuts for the rich increase the top 1 share of pre tax national income in the years following the reform the magnitude of the effect is sizeable on average each major reform leads to a rise in top 1 share of pre tax national income of 0 8 percentage points indeed it was under pm liz truss hero margaret thatcher from 1979 90 that inequality of income rose the most as she cut personal and corporate taxes these tax cuts did not produce faster growth than in the golden age period of 1948 64 when these tax rates were high and ironically the tax burden as a of gdp did not fall either because gdp did not rise enough to surpass increased revenues from other taxes in my view it is obvious that just cutting personal income tax or even corporate profit tax will have little effect on economic growth what matters for growth is increased productivity of labour and that depends on increased investment in technology that in turn under capitalism depends on rising profits and profitability if they are falling or low then even large adjustments in income tax will have limited effect compared to changes in overall profitability and remember the bulk of tax revenues no longer comes from personal or corporate taxes but from sales or value added taxes customs duties social security deductions and so called stealth taxes the imf has argued that increasing the income share of the poor and the middle class actually increases growth and that to tackle inequality policies should focus on raising human capital and skills and making tax systems more progressive here the imf is half right and half wrong reduced taxation on working people might marginally reduce inequality of income but economic growth depends not on rising household incomes or spending but on profits and investment the cause and effect is from profits to investment and growth not from spending to profits and growth trickle down or middle up neither can change much when it comes to economic growth
kiev might get up to 12 caesar howitzers from paris that were originally destined for denmark le monde reports france is reportedly preparing a new weapons delivery to ukraine which might include between six and 12 caesar self propelled howitzers the french newspaper le monde reported on saturday the artillery pieces were originally intended for denmark but copenhagen said not all of them met the required standards the paper alleged the deal was the result of lengthy negotiations between france ukraine and denmark le monde said adding that kiev had initially requested 15 howitzers according to le monde french president emmanuel macron opposed the idea of supplying ukraine from the country s army stocks since paris had already sent 18 caesars to kiev which amounted to almost a quarter of france s own arsenal of 76 such artillery pieces instead france decided to supply ukraine with howitzers that were originally ordered by denmark back in 2017 le monde said adding that copenhagen agreed to give up on the purchase since the artillery pieces ordered were still undergoing technical validation and at least some of them did not meet the required specifications set out by the danish side kiev was initially hesitant to accept the howitzers but eventually agreed to take them as they are le monde reported the details of the delivery are still being finalized but a political agreement between macron ukrainian president vladimir zelensky and danish prime minister mette frederiksen has been reached according to le monde the report states that the ceasars intended for denmark are almost twice as heavy as those used by france 32 tons against 18 tons among other differences are that they are mounted on eight wheeled vehicles rather than six wheeled ones can carry up to 36 artillery rounds instead of 18 and their cabins have heavier armor neither elysee palace nor the french defense ministry commented on the report earlier this week the us senate approved a military and economic aid package for ukraine worth 12 billion it sets aside 4 5 billion for the ukrainian government and 3 billion for weapons and military equipment while the remaining funding is earmarked to replenish us weapons already sent to ukraine and allow the transfer of more arms from american stockpiles in mid september an aide to ukrainian president vladimir zelensky mikhail podoliak said that kiev s goals in the conflict with russia involved capturing the areas controlled by the people s republics of donetsk and lugansk however on friday the leaders of the two donbass republics and of the regions of kherson and zaporozhye regions the last two of which recently declared independence from kiev signed treaties of accession to russia the documents will now be sent for ratification by the russian parliament moscow has previously said it would defend its territory using all means available and has repeatedly warned western nations against sending more weapons to ukraine such arms deliveries only prolong the conflict and the suffering of civilians russia has stated rt com
it has been five years since a gunman shot and killed dozens during an outdoor country music festival on the las vegas strip louisville ky it s been five years since carnage and death sent his family running into the night leaving them separated and terrified as a gunman rained bullets into an outdoor country music festival crowd on the las vegas strip the memories don t fade they sharpen william bill henning said as he prepared for ceremonies in las vegas marking the date of the oct 1 2017 massacre chaotic and unreal he recalled a human stampede people were bleeding and screaming and running we all got separated we didn t know who was alive that was the most difficult he s now part of a survivor community thousands strong one that s helped him sort through the horror of what happened during the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s history fifty eight people were killed and more than 850 were injured among a crowd of 22 000 in the years since the grim drumbeat of mass shootings has continued schools in uvalde texas and parkland florida grocery stores in buffalo new york and boulder colorado bars in dayton ohio and thousand oaks california a city building in virginia beach virginia a walmart in el paso texas meanwhile the debate over gun laws in the u s rages on including a renewed challenge to the federal regulation sparked by the las vegas shooting nevada u s rep dina titus on saturday called again for a federal law banning bump stocks the devices used by the las vegas shooter that allow a semi automatic rifle to fire repeatedly with just one pull of the trigger they were outlawed by rule by the trump administration but face court challenges and president joe biden also called for renewed efforts to tighten firearms laws saturday while mourning the victims and praising residents who came together in the aftermath of the shooting the president noted executive action he s taken to crack down on ghost guns and rogue gun dealers and the passage of the first significant firearms legislation in 30 years that bipartisan law signed by biden in june in part boosts protections for domestic violence victims funnels cash to states for firearms crime prevention and has money for mental health services but we re not stopping there biden said in a statement i am determined to seize this momentum and work with congress to enact further commonsense gun violence prevention legislation including banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines which have enabled shooters to slaughter so many innocents the las vegas massacre is part of a horrifying uptick of shootings with especially high numbers of people killed said james alan fox a professor of criminology law and public policy at northeastern university in boston five of the nine mass shootings in modern u s history with more than 20 people killed have taken place since 2016 starting with the pulse nightclub in orlando and continuing through the elementary school shooting in uvalde texas the severity of public mass shootings has increased in the past few years that s clear fox said and worrisome fox oversees a database maintained by the associated press usa today and northeastern university that tracks mass killings involving four or more people slain not including the perpetrator the information is drawn from media reports fbi data arrest records medical examiners reports prison records and other court documents watching the steady stream of shootings in the u s is tough for survivors said tennille pereira director of a clark county recovery and support program called the vegas strong resiliency center i know when it keeps happening people often express feelings of hopelessness pereira said i think the big thing for las vegas is to be able to share with those other communities that healing does occur and that there is hope for people like henning part of that hope has been the bond formed with other survivors the retired computer technician was celebrating his 71st birthday at the route 91 harvest festival with friends his wife daughter and three teenage grandchildren when the gunfire began he suffered a knee injury while escaping that required surgery but his group made it out without being struck by gunfire at first the first few years it s not really sinking in he said the more we organize ourselves the more that we see each other it actually brings us back to how serious this situation was many in las vegas who won t name the man who police said fired 1 057 bullets from 32nd floor windows of the mandalay bay resort during a span of time now memorialized in a paramount streaming service documentary called 11 minutes we don t want to give him any more power credibility infamy pereira said in this survivor population words matter we don t use the word anniversary we use remembrance we try not to use the word victims we try to use the word survivor police and the fbi spent months investigating and concluded that gunman stephen paddock acted alone meticulously planned the attack and intentionally concealed his actions he amassed an arsenal of 23 assault style rifles in his hotel room including 14 fitted with bump stock devices that help the weapons fire rapidly caches of weapons also were found at paddock s homes in reno and mesquite nevada but he killed himself before police reached him and local and federal officials said they never identified a clear motive for the attack shortly after the shooting the administration of then president donald trump banned bump stocks under the same federal laws that prohibit machine guns gun rights advocates sued saying the weapons didn t qualify as machine guns and it would take an act of congress to ban them the ban has survived several court challenges but a federal appeals court in new orleans revived a case there in june the same day the u s supreme court handed down a ruling expanding gun rights that case marked the high court s first major gun decision in more than a decade and has sparked a wave of court challenges to gun laws around the country meanwhile in las vegas survivors are working toward a permanent memorial on a corner of the former las vegas strip

bloomberg the world economy is showing signs of a rapid downshift as it contends with a series of shocks some of them self inflicted by policymakers increasing the likelihood of another global recession and the danger of major financial disruptions we re living through a period of elevated risk former us treasury secretary lawrence summers told wall street week with david westin on bloomberg television for whom he is a paid contributor in the same way that people became anxious in august of 2007 i think this is a moment when there should be increased anxiety at the heart of the strain the fallout from the most aggressive hiking of interest rates since the 1980s having failed to foresee the surge in inflation to multi decade highs the federal reserve and most peers are now lifting rates at speed in a bid to restore price stability and their own credibility evidence of the impact and of the blow to consumers purchasing power from soaring prices is mounting quickly in the

in four years as demand retreats apple inc is backing off plans to boost output of its new iphones bloomberg reported the turn is coming even before the full thrust of monetary tightening is felt the fed and many counterparts are pledging to keep going with steep rate hikes as they attempt to rebuild credibility quantitative tightening programs where central banks remove liquidity by shrinking bond portfolios are also just getting going inflation data showcase the need for as fed vice chair lael brainard put it friday avoiding pulling back prematurely on tightening she spoke shortly after the fed s preferred measure of prices jumped more than forecast earlier data showed euro zone inflation has punched into double digits layered on top of continuing reverberations from the russian invasion of ukraine the spreading economic gloom is sowing fear in financial markets creating its own worrying dynamic a rapidly appreciating dollar supercharged by the fed may help cool us inflation but it drives it up elsewhere by weakening other currencies pressuring authorities to restrain their own economies the global economy is in the eye of a new storm reserve bank of india governor shaktikanta das said friday after lifting rates again prospects for a second global recession so soon after the 2020 downturn triggered by the pandemic were hardly apparent a year ago but europe s russian induced energy crisis and china s deepening property slump and continued covid zero approach weren t part of the consensus outlook not all is dark with us job market resilience a notable feature but the plans by facebook parent meta platforms inc for the first reduction in headcount ever illustrate how that may still change and britain s experience in recent days showcases how investors are in a mood to punish policymakers pursuing approaches deemed unsustainable the bank of england was forced to intervene in its bond market after the new uk government announced 45 billion of unfunded tax cuts what bloomberg economics says forecasts of a soft landing for the global economy assume something close to perfect policy execution the events of the last week demonstrate the reality can be very different the opportunity for further fumbles after the uk s fiscal fail and market meltdown is high and the cost if they occur higher tom orlik chief economist markets are concerned about fiscal policies becoming even looser despite inflation or the dollar getting excessively strong said cui li head of macro research at ccb international securities ltd nike s troubles showed how the dollar s appreciation is causing issues not just for developing nations that issued debt in the us currency sri lanka pakistan and argentina are among those turning to the imf for help but also for american multinational companies the athletics wear giant on thursday downgraded its outlook citing foreign exchange effects and higher freight costs which are a symptom of supply chain delays and port congestion that s besides the need to embrace price markdowns given unsold stock north american inventories climbed 65 in the three months through august housing markets are also turning walloped by surging mortgage rates the us in the past week saw the first decline in home prices in a decade the question is how low growth will go and for how long it will stay down said s p global chief economist paul gruenwald perhaps the biggest x factor is the potential for financial turmoil as the dollar which has appreciated almost 14 this year as measured by the bloomberg dollar spot index exerts pressure across markets combine that with rapid increases in borrowing costs and it spells the potential for trouble summers the ex treasury chief said you can never be certain about what the consequences of that will be that has echoes of the summer of 2007 when the impact of the collapsing us housing market first began showing up in the financial system with the closure of a number of funds and sudden liquidity shortfalls among banks things eventually morphed the following year into the worst financial crisis since the great depression rising anxiety across global markets

varying priorities across major economies the potential for joint action to address challenges may be in question the incoherent macro policies within countries and absence of policy coordination across countries are both problematic said cui li at ccb it all makes for a potentially tension filled gathering of global finance chiefs next week for the annual international monetary fund and world

las vegas it s been five years since carnage and death sent his family running into the night leaving them separated and terrified as a gunman rained bullets into an outdoor country music festival crowd on the las vegas strip the memories don t fade they sharpen william bill henning said as he prepared for ceremonies in las vegas marking the date of the oct 1 2017 massacre chaotic and unreal he recalled a human stampede people were bleeding and screaming and running we all got separated we didn t know who was alive that was the most difficult he s now part of a survivor community thousands strong one that s helped him sort through the horror of what happened during the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s history fifty eight people were killed and more than 850 were injured among a crowd of 22 000 in the years since the grim drumbeat of mass shootings has continued schools in uvalde texas and parkland florida grocery stores in buffalo new york and boulder colorado bars in dayton ohio and thousand oaks california a city building in virginia beach virginia a walmart in el paso texas meanwhile the debate over gun laws in the u s rages on including a renewed challenge to the federal regulation sparked by the las vegas shooting nevada u s rep dina titus on saturday called again for a federal law banning bump stocks the devices used by the las vegas shooter that allow a semi automatic rifle to fire repeatedly with just one pull of the trigger they were outlawed by rule by the trump administration but face court challenges and president joe biden also called for renewed efforts to tighten firearms laws saturday while mourning the victims and praising residents who came together in the aftermath of the shooting the president noted executive action he s taken to crack down on ghost guns and rogue gun dealers and the passage of the first significant firearms legislation in 30 years that bipartisan law signed by biden in june in part boosts protections for domestic violence victims funnels cash to states for firearms crime prevention and has money for mental health services but we re not stopping there biden said in a statement i am determined to seize this momentum and work with congress to enact further commonsense gun violence prevention legislation including banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines which have enabled shooters to slaughter so many innocents the las vegas massacre is part of a horrifying uptick of shootings with especially high numbers of people killed said james alan fox a professor of criminology law and public policy at northeastern university in boston five of the nine mass shootings in modern u s history with more than 20 people killed have taken place since 2016 starting with the pulse nightclub in orlando and continuing through the elementary school shooting in uvalde texas file a body is covered with a sheet after a mass shooting in which dozens were killed at a music festival on the las vegas strip on oct 1 2017 the severity of public mass shootings has increased in the past few years that s clear fox said and worrisome fox oversees a database maintained by the associated press usa today and northeastern university that tracks mass killings involving four or more people slain not including the perpetrator the information is drawn from media reports fbi data arrest records medical examiners reports prison records and other court documents watching the steady stream of shootings in the u s is tough for survivors said tennille pereira director of a clark county recovery and support program called the vegas strong resiliency center i know when it keeps happening people often express feelings of hopelessness pereira said i think the big thing for las vegas is to be able to share with those other communities that healing does occur and that there is hope for people like henning part of that hope has been the bond formed with other survivors the retired computer technician was celebrating his 71st birthday at the route 91 harvest festival with friends his wife daughter and three teenage grandchildren when the gunfire began he suffered a knee injury while escaping that required surgery but his group made it out without being struck by gunfire at first the first few years it s not really sinking in he said the more we organize ourselves the more that we see each other it actually brings us back to how serious this situation was many in las vegas who won t name the man who police said fired 1 057 bullets from 32nd floor windows of the mandalay bay resort during a span of time now memorialized in a paramount streaming service documentary called 11 minutes we don t want to give him any more power credibility infamy pereira said in this survivor population words matter we don t use the word anniversary we use remembrance we try not to use the word victims we try to use the word survivor police and the fbi spent months investigating and concluded that gunman stephen paddock acted alone meticulously planned the attack and intentionally concealed his actions he amassed an arsenal of 23 assault style rifles in his hotel room including 14 fitted with bump stock devices that help the weapons fire rapidly caches of weapons also were found at paddock s homes in reno and mesquite nevada but he killed himself before police reached him and local and federal officials said they never identified a clear motive for the attack shortly after the shooting the administration of then president donald trump banned bump stocks under the same federal laws that prohibit machine guns gun rights advocates sued saying the weapons didn t qualify as machine guns and it would take an act of congress to ban them the ban has survived several court challenges but a federal appeals court in new orleans revived a case there in june the same day the u s supreme court handed down a ruling expanding gun rights that case marked the high court s first major gun decision in more than a decade and has sparked a wave of court challenges to gun laws around the country meanwhile in las vegas survivors are working toward a permanent memorial on a corner of the former las vegas strip festival ground a sunrise remembrance ceremony is scheduled saturday at the clark county government center and the names of those killed will be read at 10 05 p m the time the shooting started at a downtown las vegas community healing garden survivor sue nelson 67 said she fled from her front row seat and hid for hours on the las vegas strip forming deep bonds with others who escaped she declared she has survivor sorrow not survivor guilt because she didn t do anything wrong nelson drives two hours to las vegas from her home in lake havasu arizona for memorial events and gives out lapel pins shaped like little guitars and rubber wrist bands stamped with we remember 10 1 17 honors58 i m not afraid anymore she said it makes a big difference in healing when

by jennifer a dlouhy and ari natter oct 05 2022 at 08 19 pm senior biden administration officials pressed executives from some of the largest us gasoline producers to curtail overseas sales during a tense meeting friday afternoon suggesting that without voluntary action the government could force the industry to stockpile more fuel in us tanks energy secretary jennifer granholm and other administration officials chastised the industry representatives for low diesel stockpiles floating the possibility of export limits and a requirement for oil companies to hold minimum fuel inventories inside the us according to people familiar with the matter who asked not be named describing the private virtual meeting it was the latest in a series of meetings between the biden administration and oil companies this year as the white house seeks to tamp down energy costs that are contributing to high inflation an earlier session in june was marked by a more robust back and forth conversation about the market and hurricane preparedness the people said in addition to granholm the session included representatives from exxon mobil corp marathon petroleum corp phillips 66 and shell plc as well as national economic council director brian deese and amos hochstein a senior energy adviser at the state department according to a person familiar with the matter although the session was billed as a discussion of refining operations and fuel supplies in the wake of hurricanes fiona and ian the storms were not a focus the people said instead discussion centered on lower than normal inventories of fuel with diesel stocks 20 below their five year average the president s team emphasized that energy companies with record high profits record high exports and record low inventories must step up and bring down prices at the pump the energy department said in an emailed statement administration officials stressed their concerns with increased petroleum product exports and complained companies were collecting high profits while failing to address low fuel inventories the people said at least one administration official also raised the prospect of a minimum inventory requirement under which refiners or other participants in the us fuel supply chain could be forced to store more gasoline diesel and other petroleum products domestically particulars of such an inventory requirement were not discussed including how it might be implemented what companies would bear the compliance burden and what quantity of supply might be sufficient the exchange comes amid increasing worries about the relatively low fuel stocks including diesel in the northeast us which is reliant on imports to meet demand the closing of refineries on the east coast in canada and in the caribbean has exacerbated the region s reliance on supplies from europe analysts say gasoline diesel and other refined products from the gulf coast can t entirely fill the gap given constraints on pipeline capacity and available us flagged vessels permitted to deliver the fuel among domestic ports oil industry trade groups said the administration s approach was misguided the focus of this administration should not be on trapping product in the united states or diverting fuel away from retail sales and into storage but rather on how to better produce and more affordably move us product within the united states the american fuel and petrochemical manufacturers and american petroleum institute said in a joint statement president joe biden twice warned this week against oil companies raising gasoline prices following the hurricanes while gasoline prices are down by more than a dollar a gallon on average across the us since peaking in june they remain relatively high the average price of regular unleaded has risen for 10 straight days and was at 3 797 a gallon as of thursday according to data from aaa the white house has taken a series of steps this year to lower fuel prices including an unprecedented release of crude from the us emergency stockpile last month the administration warned refiners it might take emergency measures to address fuel exports amid low inventories shortly before the meeting friday granholm said in a statement that energy companies are making record profits and that refiners and retailers were passing costs on to consumers this is a time for american energy companies to take action to lower prices for consumers and to rebuild inventories of gasoline and diesel in this country that are below the five year range she said

get the biggest business stories emailed to you every weekday or go to the fin24 front page global m a shrank for the third consecutive quarter as rising interest rates forced lenders to pull back from financing large deals and the soaring dollar failed to spur u s companies into snapping up foreign targets amid persisting geopolitical tensions a steep fall in large private equity buyouts contributed to the slowdown in global dealmaking with third quarter activity dropping 54 to 716 62 billion from 1 56 trillion in the same period last year according to dealogic data dealmakers are facing resistance when they pitch deals to their clients as annual volumes have so far lost 33 with 2 97 trillion of announced deals this year the backup in the leveraged finance market along with the lengthened timeline of regulatory reviews for many transactions has had an impact on dealmaking said cary kochman global co head of m a at citigroup inc m a volumes in the united states plunged by nearly 63 in the third quarter to 255 89 billion as the rising cost of debt forced companies to postpone their pursuit of transformative buyouts plagued by spiraling inflation european m a activity suffered a 42 contraction in the third quarter while asia pacific was down 52 according to dealogic in today s markets most banks don t feel comfortable underwriting a financing package of 3 to 4 billion euros for a private equity deal in europe said guillermo baygual co head of emea m a at jpmorgan getting deals done takes much longer the focus is purely on high quality assets especially in resilient industries such as infrastructure he said wall street banks had to stomach a loss of roughly 700 million linked to the underwriting of the 16 5 billion leveraged buyout of citrix as the environment for dealmaking has deteriorated this year a number of corporate buyers have chosen to walk away from earlier handshake agreements while others have postponed large buyouts altogether i don t think we ve hit the bottom yet today s market is just all over the place and people are still a little bit spooked said melissa sawyer global head of the m a group at sullivan cromwell llp still some large deals were signed during the quarter notable transactions included adobe inc s 20 billion acquisition of design software company figma and oak street s 14 billion take private deal for real estate investment trust store capital corp in britain where on sept 26 the pound plunged to an all time low against the dollar schneider electric s 9 5 billion pound proposed takeover of british software firm aveva was a rare attempt to revamp activity in europe s biggest m a market for an interactive graphic click here currency dislocation while valuations are sinking us buyers have so far taken a cautious stance on doing deals overseas and making currency driven bets amid concerns over the war in ukraine and europe s energy crisis currency dislocation can create opportunism but if you re a us buyer you also need to look at the long term value creation thesis and right now you won t get any upside from your target s sterling earnings which have been weakened by the latest currency fluctuations said dwayne lysaght co head of emea m a at jpmorgan corporate confidence in markets being supportive of dealmaking widely seen as the leading indicator for m a activity has plummeted as a long lasting recession is looming you have a whole generation of people who haven t seen interest rates rise this precipitously and no one really knows where it will stop that could have a huge impact not just on valuations but also on the underlying economy said matthew abbott global co chair of the m a group at paul weiss rifkind wharton garrison llp going forward dealmakers expect more domestic tie ups mostly funded by stock to help companies withstand the storm as a reaction to macroeconomic pressures some large all stock mergers will be certainly under consideration as a way to gain efficiencies and tackle sluggish top line growth and inflation in the cost base the rationale for dealmaking will rely on the ability to take out costs and address operational overlap said derek shakespeare chairman of emea m a at deutsche bank meanwhile some companies could pursue hostile deals if boardrooms are not willing to play ball on the public m a side proactive outreaches may lead to some more aggressive or hostile activity where buyers don t take no for an answer and decide to go directly to the shareholders said marc anthony hourihan global m a co head at ubs yet deals have to go through a longer gestation period due to increased antitrust scrutiny especially in sectors such as big tech lengthy regulatory reviews have pressured buyers to offer so called reverse break up fees they would need to pay if they were unable to consummate the deal reverse break up fees are a contractual technique that we re using to help people overcome their fear of wacky and unpredictable outcomes from the regulators said sawyer of sullivan cromwell

markets have tanked since the worse than expected cpi reading caused more fed hawkishness and it doesn t look like the economy will have a soft landing unprecedented dollar strength is also causing major issues in the currency markets the dow the s p 500 and the nasdaq all closed below their june lows on friday september 30 only the russell 2000 remains above those june lows see table granted there was end of quarter selling by fund managers not wanting to show a lot of equity holdings in a down market so there may be an equity bounce early next week from oversold conditions but this is truly a bear market and the break below the june lows is not good news peak equities universal value advisors in the fixed income markets things are no better short term 2 yr t note yields got to 4 40 on tuesday september 27 and were as low as 4 14 early friday morning because no one wanted to be long anything going into the weekend they closed at 4 27 long term 30 year treasuries closed at 3 78 much lower than the 2 yr this is called an inverted yield curve and only happens when the federal reserve is over tightening the inverted yield curve is a very reliable indicator of an oncoming recession as we ve said in past blogs the fed appears to be fighting yesterday s war the july and august cpi taken together were 0 that said on friday morning september 30 the fed s preferred gauge of inflation the pce personal consumption expenditures index came in at a mild 0 3 core pce inflation ex food energy rose 4 9 y y the trouble in the report was the m m core rate rose 0 6 now this is a mixed message the y y isn t bad but the monthly is so is the fed now going to switch its view from looking at y y numbers to looking at monthly ones i e always choosing the worst view we don t know the answer to that but our gut feel is that they have already overtightened policy debt an emerging issue we see very little written about the growing debt problem but debt is a growth killer with aging demographics and labor shortages growth is already a problem debt has risen on household corporate and government balance sheets the savings rate in the u s chart is down to the 5 0 area a post pandemic low and most of such savings comes from the higher income earners lower income families have either cut back or have borrowed heavily on their credit cards in order to keep their living standards personal savings rate universal value advisors corporate cash flows are dwindling relative to their liabilities chart leaving them little choice but to borrow to expand postpone any expansion or for most look for ways to cut costs the latter means lowering labor costs either through shorter hours the workweek has been contracting a slower increase in pay benefits or directly through layoffs which we expect to see as the recession unfolds percent change corporate liquid assets to short term liabilities haver analytics rosenberg research the worst trend we see is at the federal level debt there exploded during the 2 5 years since the pandemic by 7 trillion the national debt is now 24 trillion it was 17 trillion in february 2020 that s a 41 increase in a very short period of time the gross cost of the debt in august was 88 billion because the fed and other agencies own a significant portion of the debt and return the interest to the treasury the net interest expense was 63 billion in august or 756 billion on an annualized basis let s not forget that the fed is reducing its balance sheet at a rate of 95 billion month of which more than 60 billion is from its treasury holdings as a result the net cost to the treasury will be rising even if the federal government runs a balanced budget fat chance as the recession unfolds tax revenue is going to fall capital gains taxes have averaged about 12 of individual tax revenues these will dry up in the 2023 tax collection cycle given the losses sustained in both the equity and fixed income markets this year hence the federal deficit is likely to be quite large in 2023 and 2024 due to the recession some economists believe that as long as the economy grows as fast or faster than the debt the burden of the debt as a percentage of gdp doesn t grow so the debt doesn t become an increasing burden as a percentage of gdp this we think is true to some extent but the level of interest rates plays a big role here and rates today are quite high when viewed against the potential growth rate of an economy with demographic issues the percentage of older citizens and a low birth rate even the most optimistic pundits don t think the potential growth rate of the economy is greater than 2 our view is that it is likely closer to 1 in the short run that is moot as 2022 and 2023 will likely show negative growth the current net annual interest rate on the debt is more than 3 and rising as the fed has pushed today s rates to the 4 area over the next couple of years deficits will rise as the recession and comatose markets reduce the tax take in addition the large monthly reduction of treasuries in the fed s balance sheet means the net cost to the treasury will be rising it could be over 1 trillion soon in a 6 trillion budget that would be more than the annual cost of social security debt is a growth killer especially as interest rates rise because it takes more and more of current income to service that debt that leaves less for households to consume and for businesses to invest rapidly rising household corporate and especially government debt hasn t been written about or discussed much perhaps because interest rates were so low for so long debt however is going to be a big issue in the foreseeable future labor market reprise in our last blog we discussed some anomalies we saw in the payroll employment data to reiterate on a not seasonally adjusted basis nsa ytd through august payrolls have risen 2 2 million but seasonally adjusted sa that number is 3 5 million the difference is 1 3 million theoretically over the year the sa process is supposed to net to zero with the nsa data seasonal factors adjust for influences within the year itself like retail sales around the holidays so one of two things should happen 1 the seasonal factors will be negative to the tune of 1 2 million payrolls in the september to december period that s 300 000 month this is highly unlikely even though it would appear logical or 2 the past data will get adjusted downward for the payroll data in particular the bls changes the seasonal factors on a monthly basis the so called concurrent seasonal adjustment method they actually make revisions to the data all the way back to january every single month but they only tell the public the revision for last month there is a footnote in their monthly release that says they don t want to confuse the public in january of every year they make all the revised data public for the entire preceding year but by that time nobody cares to even look as we said in our last blog we are going to see the unemployment rate rise likely much higher than the fed s current 4 4 estimate until their september meeting the fed had a 3 handle on its unemployment forecast so this is their way of telling us there won t be a soft landing housing housing is the most interest rate sensitive sector and we are seeing a recession in that sector rapidly unfold for several months we have noted that the university of michigan s consumer sentiment sub index buying conditions for houses was at an all time low chart existing home sales fell 0 4 in august and are down seven months in a row and are now 20 below year ago levels chart the median price is 6 below last march s peak the expectation is that the inventory of homes for sale will decline because families with homes that have 3 mortgages won t be looking to sell and upgrade with 30 year fixed rate mortgages sitting close to 7 buying conditions for houses and us existing home sales saar universal value advisors pending home sales these are new contracts signed fell 2 0 m m in august now down three months in a row and in nine of the last ten y y they are off 22 5 mortgage applications continue to decline with applications to purchase down 29 y y and refinance applications off a whopping 83 cash from refis are most often used to finance big ticket items like buying a car or a home remodel or even to send junior to college so the 83 fall off in refi applications is going to have a large impact on such purchases going forward housing demand weakening rapidly numera analytics redfin reports that 21 of homes listed for sale dropped their asking price in july this wasn t captured in august s cpi the federal housing finance agency fhfa has a home price index it fell 0 6 in july the case shiller home price index showed its first negative monthly price pattern since 2012 in july 0 44 this index was rising more than 2 month in late winter early spring this is the first decline in the case shiller since march 2019 and the steepest since november 2011 the data points are from july that the latest data we have it is almost october we suspect august s and september s numbers will show much lower prices builders now have bloated inventory and are cutting prices 6 3 in august and prices have fallen in 3 of the last 4 months still at a 436k median prices have a lot of air under them as the median price in mid 2020 was 370k before the melt up in prices began new home sales unexpectedly rose in august to 685k units at an annual rate from 532k in july still ytd sales are down at a 26 annual rate the reason for the rise was twofold 1 the price concessions given by the builders and 2 the slight 50 basis point temporary drop in august in mortgage rates we believe this is a one month phenomenon as interest rates have reversed the housing bubble is actually bigger now than it was in 2006 07 that bubble burst because the fed raised interest rates yikes might this be a repeat they tightened policy from 2003 to 2006 but at a much slower pace than today and in 2007 that bubble burst by the way back then home prices deflated 25 inflation a september 27 headline in the wall street journal read rents drop for first time in two years us zillow rent index all homes yoy universal value advisors all the regional fed manufacturing surveys monthly are telling the same story about supply chains the graphs below are from the richmond fed as this is the most recent of the regional surveys note the rapid falloff in the charts for order backlogs and vendor lead times this indicates that supply chains are back to normal new orders employment and prices paid and received have also weakened significantly in each regional fed survey order backlog and vendor lead time universal value advisors as noted by chairman powell at the after meeting press conference inflation expectations have remained well anchored this is key because expectations play a pivotal role in the inflation process one of our colleagues bob khoury of morgan stanley who helps us in our fixed income practice emailed us the following note on friday september 30 uture inflation expectations as demonstrated in market have collapsed 1 year inflation is priced at 1 81 and that s down from a march high of 6 30 5 year expectations are currently 2 19 and that s down from 3 73 taming expectations and preventing high inflation from embedding in mindsets are transmitting through this market the shrinking money supply the famous economist milton friedman taught the economics world the importance of money if there is too much we get inflation if there isn t enough for companies to borrow to expand the economy slows this fed has embarked on a policy of selling off its portfolio of treasury and mortgage backed securities which it built up over the past decade this is called quantitative tightening or simply qt and it shrinks the money supply friedman taught us that economic growth inflation is in the long run equal to the growth of the money supply so if the economy can potentially grow at 2 and the fed wants 2 inflation then the money supply should grow at 4 during the covid episode the money supply grew at a significant double digit rate thus the high rate of current inflation now on top of rising interest rates the money supply is shrinking and m m inflation is 0 and it is going to shrink faster going forward as the fed has told us it will sell larger quantities of securities from its portfolio in the months ahead besides the restrictive interest rates which markets and pundits are fixated on we also have a shrinking money supply every indicator is pointing to recession final thoughts as is apparent from the incoming data the economy has entered a recession it is still mild but a recession nonetheless the fed clearly ignoring the incoming data and concentrating on backward looking indicators i e the y y rate of inflation and the unemployment rate has become more hawkish and has now told the market that it intends to raise rates another 125 basis points before year s end and even more in 2023 the summary of economic projections the dot plot from which the markets glean the fed s intentions has historically had a 37 correlation with what actually transpires as far as rates are concerned and it is clear that the fomc members are nowhere near consensus for 2024 and 2025 rate levels july s m m cpi was 0 1 and august s was 0 1 over those two months the headline cpi was flat i e 0 seems like the fed should recognize this especially since monetary policy impacts the economy with long and variable lags yet this fed is still moving forward with increasingly restrictive policy seemingly impervious to the lagged impacts of its prior rate hikes we are already seeing the impacts of rising rates in the housing market and we have had two quarters in a row of negative gdp and nearly daily evidence that the

germany s most strategically important building site is at the end of a windswept pier on the north sea coast where workers are assembling the country s first terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas lng starting this winter the rig close to the port of wilhelmshaven will be able to supply the equivalent of 20 percent of the gas that was until recently imported from russia since its invasion of ukraine moscow has throttled gas supplies to germany while the nord stream pipelines which carried huge volumes under the baltic sea to europe were damaged last week in what a danish swedish report called a deliberate act in the search for alternative sources the german government has splashed billions on five projects like the one in wilhelmshaven altogether the new fleet should be able to handle around 25 billion cubic metres of gas per year roughly equivalent to half the capacity of the nord stream 1 pipeline at the site in wilhelmshaven the half finished concrete platform emerging from the sea sprays workers in fluorescent yellow vests with a fine mist back on solid land a constant stream of lorries delivers sections of grey pipe which should relay the terminal to the gas network lng terminals allow for the import by sea of natural gas which has been chilled and turned into a liquid to make it easier to transport a specialist vessel known as an fsru which can stock the fuel and turn lng back into a ready to use gas is also hooked up to the platform to complete the installation unlike other countries in europe germany until now did not have an lng terminal instead relying on relatively cheap pipeline supplies from russia but since the invasion of ukraine germany has set about weaning itself off moscow s gas exports which previously represented 55 percent of its supplies to diversify its sources secure enough supplies of the fuel and keep its factories working berlin has bet massively on lng to fill the gap left by russian imports chancellor olaf scholz last week signed an agreement with the united arab emirates for the supply of lng while touring gulf states in search of new sources renting five fsru ships to plug into the new terminals has also set berlin back three billion euros 2 9 billion following the outbreak of the war in ukraine germany passed a law to drastically speed up the approval process for lng terminals in wilhelmshaven the work is coming along rapidly the terminal should be finished this winter says holger kreetz who heads the project for german energy company uniper the strategic importance of the terminal has seen building work advance surprisingly quickly normally a project like this takes us five to six years kreetz tells afp the arrival of the new terminal has been welcomed by many residents in wilhelmshaven where deindustrialisation has pushed the unemployment rate up to 10 percent almost twice the national average it s good that it s in wilhelmshaven it ll bring jobs ingrid schon 55 tells afp opposition comes from groups who fear the accelerated timescales for approval and construction could come at a cost to the environment young activists from the group ende gelaende managed to block the site in wilhelmshaven for a day in august the german environmental organisation duh said the works would irreversibly destroy sensitive ecosystems as well as endanger the living space of threatened porpoises the source of the fuel has also been a sore point with concerns raised that natural gas produced from fracking in the united states could be imported via the new terminal criticism of the project has been dismissed by economy minister robert habeck a green party politician who has emphasised the importance of energy security by 2030 the site is set to be converted for the importation of green hydrogen produced with renewables which berlin has backed as part of its energy transition

separated and terrified as a gunman rained bullets into an outdoor country music festival crowd on the las vegas strip the memories don t fade they sharpen william bill henning said as he prepared for ceremonies in las vegas marking the date of the oct 1 2017 massacre chaotic and unreal he recalled a human stampede people were bleeding and screaming and running we all got separated we didn t know who was alive that was the most difficult he s now part of a survivor community thousands strong one that s helped him sort through the horror of what happened during the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s history fifty eight people were killed and more than 850 were injured among a crowd of 22 000 in the years since the grim drumbeat of mass shootings has continued schools in uvalde texas and parkland florida grocery stores in buffalo new york and boulder colorado bars in dayton ohio and thousand oaks california a city building in virginia beach virginia a walmart in el paso texas meanwhile the debate over gun laws in the u s rages on including a renewed challenge to the federal regulation sparked by the las vegas shooting nevada u s rep dina titus on saturday called again for a federal law banning bump stocks the devices used by the las vegas shooter that allow a semi automatic rifle to fire repeatedly with just one pull of the trigger they were outlawed by rule by the trump administration but face court challenges and president joe biden also called for renewed efforts to tighten firearms laws saturday while mourning the victims and praising residents who came together in the aftermath of the shooting the president noted executive action he s taken to crack down on ghost guns and rogue gun dealers and the passage of the first significant firearms legislation in 30 years that bipartisan law signed by biden in june in part boosts protections for domestic violence victims funnels cash to states for firearms crime prevention and has money for mental health services but we re not stopping there biden said in a statement i am determined to seize this momentum and work with congress to enact further common sense gun violence prevention legislation including banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines which have enabled shooters to slaughter so many innocents the las vegas massacre is part of a horrifying uptick of shootings with especially high numbers of people killed said james alan fox a professor of criminology law and public policy at northeastern university in boston five of the nine mass shootings in modern u s history with more than 20 people killed have taken place since 2016 starting with the pulse nightclub in orlando and continuing through the elementary school shooting in uvalde texas the severity of public mass shootings has increased in the past few years that s clear fox said and worrisome fox oversees a database maintained by the associated press usa today and northeastern university that tracks mass killings involving four or more people slain not including the perpetrator the information is drawn from media reports fbi data arrest records medical examiners reports prison records and other court documents watching the steady stream of shootings in the u s is tough for survivors said tennille pereira director of a clark county recovery and support program called the vegas strong resiliency center i know when it keeps happening people often express feelings of hopelessness pereira said i think the big thing for las vegas is to be able to share with those other communities that healing does occur and that there is hope for people like henning part of that hope has been the bond formed with other survivors the retired computer technician was celebrating his 71st birthday at the route 91 harvest festival with friends his wife daughter and three teenage grandchildren when the gunfire began he suffered a knee injury while escaping that required surgery but his group made it out without being struck by gunfire personal belongings and debris litters the route 91 harvest festival grounds across the street from the mandalay bay resort and casino after an oct 1 mass shooting in las vegas on oct 3 2017 five years after a gunman killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more at a country music festival in las vegas in the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s history the massacre is now part of a horrifying increase in the number of mass slayings with more than 20 victims according to a database of mass killings maintained by the associated press usa today and northeastern university photo marcio jose sanchez associated press at first the first few years it s not really sinking in he said the more we organize ourselves the more that we see each other it actually brings us back to how serious this situation was many in las vegas who won t name the man who police said fired 1 057 bullets from 32nd floor windows of the mandalay bay resort during a span of time now memorialized in a paramount streaming service documentary called 11 minutes we don t want to give him any more power credibility infamy pereira said in this survivor population words matter we don t use the word anniversary we use remembrance we try not to use the word victims we try to use the word survivor police and the fbi spent months investigating and concluded that gunman stephen paddock acted alone meticulously planned the attack and intentionally concealed his actions he amassed an arsenal of 23 assault style rifles in his hotel room including 14 fitted with bump stock devices that help the weapons fire rapidly i m not afraid anymore it makes a big difference in healing when you re not afraid anymore sue nelson survivor caches of weapons also were found at paddock s homes in reno and mesquite nevada but he killed himself before police reached him and local and federal officials said they never identified a clear motive for the attack shortly after the shooting the administration of then president donald trump banned bump stocks under the same federal laws that prohibit machine guns gun rights advocates sued saying the weapons didn t qualify as machine guns and it would take an act of congress to ban them the ban has survived several court challenges but a federal appeals court in new orleans revived a case there in june the same day the u s supreme court handed down a ruling expanding gun rights that case marked the high court s first major gun decision in more than a decade and has sparked a wave of court challenges to gun laws around the country meanwhile in las vegas survivors are working toward a permanent memorial on a corner of the former las vegas strip festival ground a sunrise remembrance ceremony is scheduled saturday at the clark county government center and the names of those killed will be read 10 05 p m the time the shooting started at a downtown las vegas community healing garden survivor sue nelson 67 said she fled from her front row seat and hid for hours on the las vegas strip forming deep bonds with others who escaped she declared she has survivor sorrow not survivor guilt because she didn t do anything wrong nelson drives two hours to las vegas from her home in lake havasu arizona for memorial events and gives out lapel pins shaped like little guitars and rubber wrist bands stamped with we remember

paid advertisement by parsons lift when it comes to capital formation equity markets or securities compliance any mention of the securities and exchange commission sec usually sends entrepreneurs founders and tech experts ducking for cover sec examinations are stressful time consuming costly and rarely leave anyone feeling good about the process the goal of this article is to help small business investors small and emerging companies and beginners avoid common pitfalls when raising money in the capital markets identifying and locating potential investors can be difficult for small business who are seeking to raise capital it becomes even more challenging if the amount sought e g less than 5 million is below a level that would attract venture capital or a registered broker dealer but beyond the levels that can be provided by friends and family and personal financing as we exit a period of historically low interest rates and as equity markets tighten raising capital will likely become harder in the future the number of registered broker dealers has been falling and few registered broker dealers are willing to raise capital in small transactions venture capitalists vcs and broker dealers bds want big deals with little risk not deals involving small and emerging companies our dynamic markets and economy significantly benefit from a robust pipeline of new small businesses which create the majority of net new jobs in the united states and greatly contribute to innovation that puts a lot of pressure on start ups to get it right when seeking to raise capital get it right and the company may get its funding get it wrong and the company could get a call from the sec because of complaints from angry investors below are five common pitfalls to be avoided to ensure your company gets it right common pitfalls to avoid 1 solid foundations before getting into the nitty gritty of securities violations it is vital that start ups are starting off on a solid foundation founders or partners should agree early on about the details of the business and the relationship roles between the parties they should insist on proper formation documents bylaws or partnership agreements and follow basic corporate formalities not doing so can cause significant legal troubles down the road getting a business set up correctly may slow the deal out of the gate but doing so will only benefit a business in the long run there are numerous resources for small business seeking get off the ground issues like entity selection play a critical role in making a start up legally viable public vs private company sole proprietorship or partnership limited liability company vs corporation some of the most important factors that a newbie founder should consider while making the decision are tax treatment corporate vs partnership liability layers of legal protection legal expenses start up cost and filing fees and growth plans 1202 stock considerations none of these decisions should be rushed the sec knows and understands that strong equity markets rely on a healthy small business market the sec has gone so far as to create the office of the advocate for small business capital formation osab osab s mission is to advance the interests of small businesses and their investors at the sec and in the capital markets from early stage start ups raising initial capital to later stage private companies whose founders and investors are seeking liquidity all the way to smaller public companies while getting things started correctly is vitally important it is outside the scope of this article luckily parsons lift can assist in that process 2 don t expect privacy anyone who has ever filled out a mortgage application knows what it feels like to financially undress in front of someone investors typically want to know what is in the secrete sauce start ups should expect little to no privacy when investors are looking under the hood directors and officers should be ready to disclose whether the company is dependent on one brilliant technician or engineer what management s capabilities are what their shortcomings are ownership structure and cap tables how key individuals are compensated and the company s marketing and competitive strategies entrepreneurs and start ups should also be ready to hand over personal and corporate financial statements revealing such guarded secrets and financial statements makes entrepreneurs uneasy and understandably so however whatever information a founder does not want to share with a potential investor is exactly what the sec will be looking for when things go badly illustrative financial statements disclosure of conflicts of interest material risks and updating investors is a must reporting companies are required to provide investors with timely accurate and full information with which investors can evaluate their investment private placements should seek to follow the same requirements when it comes to proper disclosures here are some tips founders can use as guides in that process 1 provide ongoing and updated disclosures of material company information 2 provide timeliness in disclosures of such material information and adhere to those timelines 3 provide simultaneous and identical disclosures across all mediums and to all investors 4 adhere to state and federal securities disclosure rules and 5 establish accountability policies 3 finders not fraudsters one common path founders take to get access to critically needed capital is to conduct an offering that relies on an exemption from registering under the securities act of 1933 securities act these exemptions provide small companies access to vital capital and provide a great benefit to our economy companies almost always want to play by the rules and avoid the sec s ire although doing so can be a struggle when dealing with early stage start ups founders often try to raise capital from angel investors friends and family with the improper belief that securities laws do not apply to such transactions wrong if a founder has well to do friends or family members they can usually call and get an investment without running afoul of securities laws but what if that same person calls a friend or family member and asks that person to start calling their friends and asking for investments can you pay your friend finders fees referral fees consulting fees or success fees for finding investors is there even a difference between those terms answers to those questions quickly get tricky despite the many risks to finders start ups and their offices often make the mistake of offering questionable finders fees when needing to raise money quickly it is vital for start ups to know in which circumstances one can engage a finder or a platform that is not registered as a broker dealer to get access to investors the exceptions to such rules are extremely limited as mentioned the rules are complicated bds and investment advisors ias are required under section 15 to register with the sec unless they can rely on an exception or exemption because they act as intermediaries between customers and the securities markets these registered bds and ias are typically good at making sure they are complying with securities regulations however the sec does not care about good intentions they will hold everyone who is involved in a deal accountable where they feel a violation of securities laws has taken place the best way to ensure compliance with section 15 is to use registered bds and ias as finders for most start ups gaining access to industry professionals is not an option in those cases avoiding any compensation arrangements tied to deal success investment amounts or other deal related factors provides the best coverage in addition ensuring that finders do nothing more than make initial introductions can help limit exposure 4 insurance we have all waived the supplemental insurance prior to jumping in our rental car it only takes one accident while driving your convertible rental car to learn this lesson the hard way luckily there are usually layers of protection already in place to help the thrifty traveler while start ups are notoriously thrifty a directors and officers d o insurance policy is not a good place for a founder to trim the fat d o insurance policies are not just for huge high profile public companies a start up or privately held company can and should get some protection if it has leaders and stakeholders who interact with customers employees investors competitors and government agencies start ups are far more likely to run afoul of regulators and it is almost inevitable that some scenario will arise requiring additional protection it is not uncommon for angry investors to come after the ceo of a company because things did not work out the way everyone had hoped they would or for a small start up performing well and nearly ready to pop off only to have investor s claim that the founders misused the investor s funds investors may even attempt to sue the ceo cfo or other directors and officers personally if the start up followed the first tip above and was set up on a solid foundation the company s bylaws will protect the officers and directors to a certain extent alternately the cost of these types of actions can tank a start up before it ever gets started and directors or officers liability can skyrocket if sec regulators get wind of investor complaints and begin to investigate this is the point at which d o insurance steps in the costs of defending d o claims are substantial the average cost to mount a defense against a shareholder claim can quickly rise into the millions and the millions spend on defense may not even get a company to trial the ultimate liability determination of directors and officers likely is not what sinks the business the defense costs associated can be expensive and the process can take many months and most likely years before any resolution most start ups could not survive such a claim without a d o policy generally d o policies can cost anywhere from 3 000 to 7 000 in premium for every 1m in coverage just like supplemental insurance for your rental car premiums seem miniscule in comparison to the costs associated with claims brought after the fact by angry investors or even worse the sec 5 get good legal counsel while it may seem self serving for an attorney to write an article that suggests one should call an attorney it would be professional negligence to write anything else securities laws much like tax laws are extremely complicated not only is good legal counsel vital but founders should also be intimately involved in the minutiae of legal and accounting documents associated with capital raises when paying professionals to handle then for you it can be easy to forget about the details if you are going to skim a document let it be the document that contains something other than your financial statements disclosure of conflicts of interest or material risk factors your attorney should be vigilant in their efforts to vet these documents however they will likely not be the one on the hook when it turns out that vital information was withheld from investors no deal is perfect but there are precautions that can and should be taken before and after capital raises to avoid common mistakes even the savviest entrepreneurs are at a disadvantage in negotiating with vcs who strike deals for a living the power imbalance is exponentially higher between sec regulators and the start up ceo who is working out of his or her garage there is strong incentive for entrepreneurs to learn as much as they can and get additional help where necessary legal counsel is almost always a necessary element of a successful capital raise in addition to obtaining good legal counsel in the beginning do not wait until you receive a call from an investigator or an sec subpoena in the mail before you pick up the phone and call an attorney if you receive a call from an sec investigator or have any reason to believe you or your company is under investigation call a competent legal professional who specializes in sec compliance and regulatory defense work immediately securities defense work is complicated and takes a level of expertise many lawyers do not have not only is the attorney who helped you set up the company and capital raise likely conflicted out of representing the founder s or the company they likely do not have the expertise required to engage with the sec the sec says their mission includes facilitating capital formation for public companies and small businesses that are active participants in private markets i believe they genuinely want to accomplish their mission the sec s mechanisms for accomplishing their mission are rule making and enforcement when engaging in capital formation founders should engage the rules and avoid the enforcement
