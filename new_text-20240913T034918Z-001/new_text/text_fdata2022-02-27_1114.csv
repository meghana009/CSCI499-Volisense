the russian blitzkrieg invasion of ukraine initiated dramatic surges and reversals across markets the s p plunged to a 9 month low early thursday morning down 15 from january all time highs but then rallied hard into friday s close the dji tumbled and bounced back 1 700 points in this 4 day week to close almost precisely where it closed last week like nothing happened gold had been trending higher up 125 since late january but soared another 75 early thursday only to plunge nearly 100 later the same day gold is leaving bitcoin in the dust wti crude oil rallied 50 from early december to mid february it soared and collapsed 9 on thursday after briefly trading above 100 for the first time in eight years chicago wheat soared to a 12 year high and then tumbled sharply on friday soybeans and corn also surged and fell this week the us dollar index surged to a new 20 month high as the euro plunged to a 20 month low then fell sharply into friday s close the russian ruble tumbled to a new all time low vs the us dollar stock index options volatility soared to nearly the highest levels since the covid panic in 2020 but fell sharply on friday this chart is from thursday why the stunning market reversals this week markets were shocked at the russian attack s speed size and ferociousness everybody knew the russians had massed troops and military hardware to the north south and east of ukraine and the geopolitical stress had exacerbated risk off sentiment last week especially with american and british intelligence services predicting an imminent attack this chart was released mid week but nothing happened in ukraine early in the week and then suddenly wednesday evening the russians charged markets did what you d expect stocks fell the us dollar gold commodities and volatility soared stocks gapped lower when thursday s day session began but big tech began to rally immediately while the broader market went sideways to lower on thursday s gap lower opening msft was down 20 from its november high aapl was down 16 from its january high goog was down 18 in less than a month amzn was down 26 from its november highs tsla was down 40 from its early january highs and nvda was down 38 from its november highs fb was down 40 in less than a month somebody started buying big teck with both hands when the market opened sharply lower thursday morning it was probably hedge funds covering shorts which sparked the monster rally market liquidity was thin a war had just started and option volatility had soared as big tech started to rally options dealers turned buyers to manage gamma risk and as markets continued to rally people who had previously bought puts began selling them adding fuel to the fire when market sentiment becomes extremely risk off like when a war starts correlations between assets go to one with big tech leading the stock markets higher the nasdaq 100 was hugely out performing the dow people started selling the spike rallies in gold crude grains and the us dollar people who had bought those markets thinking they would have massive rallies because of the war were positioned wrong and had to sell accelerating the reversals from the spike highs one of the characteristics of bear markets is that they have face ripping bear market rallies which we saw on thursday and friday one of the great market chestnuts is that everybody loses money in a bear market it is critical to understand that the rally was not caused by people assuming that the war in ukraine was no big deal the war may end this weekend or it may continue for months but it is still a huge deal even if it does end this weekend putin has taken the gloves off and a new cold war has started which will have a huge impact on markets russia is now a severe problem russia is not monolithic and russia is not putin who has been exposed as a cold hearted liar thousands of russian citizens have been arrested for protesting the war the speed of the attack may have made russia appear invincible which may be far from the truth the assumption that putin will have unwavering support from china may also be wrong wouldn t it be interesting if xi turned his back on putin the pariah russia will be isolated and will likely retaliate against the sanctions think cyber attacks against the west commodity exports from russia will be reduced buyers will have to source products from other commodity producing countries western governments may be shocked into abandoning virtue signalling esg driven energy policies and start encouraging the development of reliable energy supplies the usa for instance may promote the development of domestic fossil fuels and canadian oil sands note cnq closed at all time highs friday despite wti closing 9 below thursday s high biden has the state of the union address on march 1 and this will be his opportunity to turn around his and the democratic party s fading popularity my short term trading i got off to a slow start this week after the 3 day president s day weekend i was flat at the end of last week and in no hurry to find a trade just for the sake of doing something i bought the s p tuesday and closed the trade for a small gain i bought the dow futures wednesday and closed the trade for a slight loss i bought the s p early thursday morning as the market rallied back from the overnight lows but was stopped for a small gain i rebought it a few minutes later as the market recovered from a brief setback and covered it on the close for a 110 point gain i thought that the rally was a bear market short squeeze and 110 points was a great move the market rallied another 100 points friday without me the s p rallied almost 300 points from early thursday morning to friday s close to put that stunning move into perspective since the market turned up from the covid panic lows in march 2020 there have only been three entire weeks with a 300 point high low range i was flat going into the weekend and my p l was up 1 2 on the week on my radar the spectacular commodity rally that saw the indices gain 200 since the march 2020 lows may have made an important top this week the same thinking may apply to crude oil i m not saying the big commodity rally is over but a correction is overdue i think the stock market rally off this week s lows is a bear market rally and it will run out of steam and rollover my son drew points out that oil bulls might consider writing december atm puts dec closed friday at 81 an 11 discount to front month april the dec 81 strike puts trade at around 11 net net if you sell the puts and get exercised at the end of november you will effectively be long wti at 70 which is 22 below the current front month price of 92 backwardation creates opportunities this is not investment advice remember wti dropped from 147 in july 2008 to 33 in december if wti and commodities have the correction i expect and then steady i will look at writing forward dated wti puts thoughts on trading this week was a great week for making peace with the fact that i can t catch every move i wanted to sell gold up 80 thursday morning and i wanted to sell wti at 100 but i already had the trade on by being long the s p i noted above that correlation goes to one when sentiment is extreme in that sense in this environment being long s p was the same thing as being short gold or wti if i made the gold or wti trade i would be concentrating my risk exposure and that s great if you re right deadly if you re wrong of course you can never have enough on when the market is soaring in your favour i ve noticed my trading time horizon has shrunk as short term price ranges have increased which is purely intuitive risk management i never used to be a day trader but with today s intra day price

u s cybersecurity officials are urging federal agencies and large organizations to remain vigilant against the threat of russian cyberattacks amid the country s ongoing invasion of ukraine the cybersecurity infrastructure security agency cisa updated its shields up guidance for organizations after russia s incursion into eastern ukraine urging officials to remain laser focused on resilience russia s unprovoked attack on ukraine which has been accompanied by cyber attacks on ukrainian government and critical infrastructure organizations may have consequences for our own nation s critical infrastructure a potential we ve been warning about for months the cisa guidance states while there are no specific or credible cyber threats to the u s homeland at this time we are mindful of the potential for russia s destabilizing actions to impact organizations both within and beyond the region particularly in the wake of sanctions imposed by the united states and our allies every organization large and small must be prepared to respond to disruptive cyber activity it added the specter of broad cyber warfare has increased following russia s invasion this week with experts warning that moscow could respond to retaliatory sanctions over the incursion with additional cyberattacks against the west russian president vladimir putin has also threatened consequences for countries who try to interfere with his military operation though the details about what those consequences are remain unclear we ve moved into an era of hybrid warfare where you can induce fear and debilitate an adversary s capacity to do something using cyberwarfare said john cofrancesco a cyber expert and vice president of government at fortress information security there s no doubt that the frequency and the voracity of what these guys are doing is increasing he added last week white house deputy national security adviser anne neuberger urged the private sector to put in place cybersecurity defenses including encryption and multi factor authentication to counter cyberattacks cyber and department of homeland security dhs officials have also sought to bolster precautions among the federal workforce as agencies seek to shore up their cyber defenses as a reminder dhs cybersecurity and infrastructure agency recommends all organizations adopt a heightened posture when it comes to cybersecurity and protecting their most critical assets read a notice sent to employees with the u s department of agriculture this week the guidance which was viewed by the hill went as far as to suggest that employees stock up on food gas and other supplies as part of a personal and professional preparedness plan have some cash on hand in case atms or credit card readers are unavailable stated the email from usda security and technology heads do not allow your vehicles to get low on fuel employees were told in another bullet point the alert further instructed employees to have basic food and emergency preparedness supplies available and ensure that you have a family emergency plan dhs reiterated to the hill in a statement friday evening that it had not identified any specific credible cyber threats to the u s but urged all organizations to take steps now to improve their cybersecurity and safeguard their critical assets federal officials have long warned about the need to shore up defenses not just against cyberattacks but also against other efforts targeting critical infrastructure cisa earlier this month released additional material to help critical infrastructure owners prepare for and mitigate foreign influence operations we need to be prepared for the potential of foreign influence operations to negatively impact various aspects of our critical infrastructure with the ongoing russia ukraine geopolitical tensions cisa director jen easterly said at the time we encourage leaders at every organization to take proactive steps to assess their risks from information manipulation and mitigate the impact of potential foreign influence operations neuberger said last week that the u s government has been preparing for potential geopolitical contingencies since before thanksgiving though officials are now in a position where their cyber preparations may be readily tested regional cyberattacks have already started amid russia s violent attack on ukraine with several ukrainian government websites down earlier this week following a cyberattack that targeted the parliament as well as the foreign affairs and defense ministries the biden administration suspects that russian government hackers are behind the attacks though russia has denied any involvement president biden said earlier this month that he s prepared to respond if russia launches attacks on u s critical infrastructure and american companies as part of its campaign against ukraine cofrancesco said that the majority of u s businesses are not at the level of cybersecurity needed to efficiently counter attacks adding now is the time to make those investments for instance he said the oil and gas industry is one of the most vulnerable sectors to cyberattacks because unlike the energy sector it is not mandated by law to invest in cybersecurity however the biden administration issued a security directive last year to bolster reporting of cybersecurity incidents weeks after a crippling ransomware attack on colonial pipeline cybersecurity spending is a very difficult thing to do cofrancesco said it s a lot like asking somebody to buy a new roof on their house when they ve been saving to remodel their kitchen ines kogubare contributed
months before the social network was ready to go live the company had agreed to an us875 million listing on the new york stock exchange the deal is on hold as it faces an investigation from financial regulators but that has not stopped fervent supporters bidding up its value shares in the shell company that tmtg is due to merge with suggest the business could be worth us10 billion truth social is only the first step an investor presentation showed tmtg plans to launch a paid for streaming service that would compete with netflix and disney trump s pre politics success with the apprentice and miss universe are presented as proof the company can sign up some 40 million subscribers by 2026 for now though the social network is the priority the app looks like a carbon copy of twitter instead of tweeting users truth the retweet button is replaced by you guessed it retruth likes replies and verification ticks are all there it is almost as if the designers wanted a certain high profile user to be able to truth without having to learn any new buttons they ve kept that similarity either to have a poke at twitter or to make it easy for people to kind of grasp as a platform says matt navarra a social media consultant the trump organisation s accounting firm said a decade of financial statements for the former president can t be relied upon ap trump who has early access to the network posted last week in a manner characteristic of his 11 years on twitter get ready your favourite president will see you soon he wrote truth social s supposed appeal lies in embracing those turned off by big tech what happened to freedom of speech the app s investor presentation laments it has promised to build a non cancellable global community and to be a fountainhead of support for american freedoms it is explicitly a rejection of what is seen as latent censorship by facebook and twitter which have helped the media pendulum swing dangerously far to the left if anyone had forgotten the rancour that trump inspired in his twitter heyday the level of debate on the app s launch day provided a reminder advertisement supporters of the former president celebrated the huge day for alt tech while detractors gloated at its setbacks it s an overwhelming success insists richard grenell a former diplomat under trump who has nearly a million followers on twitter the demand is yuge be patient truth is going to upend social media we will not sit by and watch our voices be silenced prominent liberals instructed users to begin reporting the app for bugs en masse to help get it taken off the apple store is there anything more orwellian than trump calling his new platform truth social tweeted the film maker chip franklin it s like bill cosby starting a podcast called safe women came one reply another said truth social is going to make social media great again the man himself was as usual modestly understated saying he was excited to send out my first truth on truth social very soon and that the app would stand up to the tyranny of big tech truth social s supporters are correct at least that big social networks have become more censorious in recent years trump is gone but vaccine scepticism hate speech and fake news are policed far more enthusiastically than they once were there are concerns that growing regulation including in the uk where forthcoming online harms legislation will create a new category of legal but harmful content will push social networks to take a safety first approach that means huge numbers of posts being removed to prevent fines that creates a yawning gap for new free speech networks to emerge of which truth social is the latest parler gettr mewe rumble and clouthub have all preceded it with limited degrees of success parler funded by trump backer rebekah mercer stormed to the top of app charts after trump s twitter ban but was stopped in its tracks when apple and google removed it from download stores and amazon stopped hosting the site this only deepened the sense of a big tech censorship conspiracy but was brutally effective parler has since re emerged but much diminished jason miller trump s former communications adviser and the chief executive of gettr says he is confident truth social will bring more traffic to his own conservative social media site the truth social growth will come at the expense of facebook and twitter but people have multiple social media so people can be on twitter gettr and truth social at once but navarra says that apps marketing themselves as anti censorship are likely to face an identical struggle while they might attract those who are wrongly silenced by the big social networks they also risk being magnets for extremism and even illegal material truth social does of course have one thing the others do not trump himself the former president has been courted by other platforms since his removal from twitter but opted to wait until his own was ready during his presidency the world hung on trump s tweets as he considers running again in 2024 maybe we should be paying attention to his truths the telegraph london

restrictive measures will also be imposed on russia s central bank the measures were announced jointly as part of a new round of financial sanctions meant to impose a severe cost on russia for the invasion we have taken decisive action tonight with our international partners to shut russia out of the global financial system including the important first step of ejecting russian banks from swift we will keep working together to ensure putin pays the price for his aggression boris johnson borisjohnson february 26 2022 the sanctions were meant to hold russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for russian president vladimir putin the central bank restrictions target the more than 600 billion dollars 4400 billion in reserves that the kremlin has at its disposal meant to limit russia s ability to support the ruble amid tightening western sanctions they also will severely constrain russia s ability to import and export goods cumulatively the steps taken by the west since russia began the invasion amount to some of the toughest sanctions on any country in modern times in coordination with i will now propose new measures to eu leaders to strengthen our response to russia s invasion of ukraine and cripple putin s ability to finance his war machine ursula von der leyen vonderleyen february 26 2022 us officials said saturday s steps were framed to send the ruble into free fall and promote soaring inflation in the russian economy they noted that previously announced sanctions have already had an impact on russia bringing its currency to its lowest level against the dollar in history and giving its stock market the worst week on record the allies criticised ever since for responding too weakly to russia s 2014 aggression shelved the idea russia since then has tried to develop its own financial transfer system with limited success second we will paralyse the assets of russia s central bank this will freeze its transactions and it will make it impossible for the central bank to liquidate its assets pic twitter com 8h9ewkncw9 ursula von der leyen vonderleyen february 26 2022 saturday s move includes cutting key russian banks out of the swift financial messaging system which daily moves countless billions of dollars around more than 11 000 banks and other financial institutions around the world the fine print of the sanctions was still being ironed out over the weekend officials said as they work to limit the impact of the restrictions on other economies and european purchases of russian energy allies on both sides of the atlantic also considered the swift option in 2014 when russia invaded and annexed ukraine s crimea and backed separatist forces in eastern ukraine russia declared then that kicking it out of swift would be equivalent to a declaration of war the allies criticised ever after for responding too weakly to russia s 2014 aggression shelved the idea russia since then has tried to develop its own financial transfer system with limited success the us has succeeded before in persuading the belgium based swift system to kick out a country iran over its nuclear program but kicking russia out of swift could also hurt other economies including those of the us and key ally germany the disconnection from swift announced by the west on saturday is partial leaving europe and the united states room to escalate penalties further later and finally we will work to prohibit russian oligarchs from using their financial assets on our markets putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy ukraine but what he is also doing in fact is destroying the future of his own country pic twitter com bcygxfjeyg ursula von der leyen vonderleyen february 26 2022 announcing the measures in brussels eu commission president ursula von der leyen said they would also push the bloc to paralyse the assets of russia s central bank so that its transactions would be frozen cutting several commercial banks from swift will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally she added cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block russian exports and imports she added putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy ukraine but what he is also doing in fact is destroying the future of his own country getting the eu on board for sanctioning russia through swift had been a tough process since eu trade with russia amounted to 80 billion euros 67 billion about 10 times as much as the united states which had been an early proponent of such measures germany specifically had balked at the measure since it could hit them hard but foreign minister annalena baerbock said in a statement that after russia s shameless attack we are working hard on limiting the collateral damage of decoupling russia from swift so that it hits the right people what we need is a targeted functional restrictions of swift st georges hall in liverpool is lit up in yellow and blue in an expression of solidarity with ukraine following russia s invasion peter byrne pa as another measure the allies announced a commitment to taking measures to limit the sale of citizenship so called golden passports that let wealthy russians connected to the russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems the group also announced the formation this week of a transatlantic task force to ensure that these and other sanctions on russia are implemented effectively through information sharing and asset freezes rachel ziemba an adjunct senior fellow at the centre for a new american security said despite a complete swift ban these measures will still be painful to russia s economy they reinforce the measures already taken earlier this week by making transactions more complicated and difficult ms ziemba says how much pain the sanctions render on the russian economy will depend on which banks have been restricted and which measures are taken to restrict the ability of the central bank to operate regardless these sort of escalating sanctions removing banks from swift restricting the central bank this will all make it more difficult to get commodities from russia and will increase the pressure on the financial market

a ukrainian soldier walks past debris of a burning military truck on a street in kyiv ukraine saturday feb 26 2022 russian troops stormed toward ukraine s capital saturday and street fighting broke out as city officials urged residents to take shelter ap photo efrem lukatsky the united states and european nations agreed saturday to impose the most potentially crippling financial penalties yet on russia over its unrelenting invasion of ukraine going after the central bank reserves that underpin the russian economy and severing some russian banks from a vital global financial network the decision announced as ukrainian forces battled saturday to hold russian forces back from ukraine s capital and residents sheltered in subway tunnels basements and underground garages has potential to spread the pain of western retaliation for president vladimir putin s invasion to ordinary russians far more than previous rounds of penalties putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy ukraine but what he is also doing in fact is destroying the future of his own country eu commission president ursula von der leyen said advertisement the european union united states united kingdom and other allies have steadily stepped up the intensity of their sanctions since russia launched the invasion late last week while u s and european officials made clear they still were working out the mechanics of how to implement the latest measures and intend to spare russia s oil and natural gas exports the sanctions in total potentially could amount to some of the toughest levied on a nation in modern times if fully carried out as planned the measures will severely damage the russian economy and markedly constrain its ability to import and export goods the u s and european allies announced the moves in a joint statement as part of a new round of financial sanctions meant to hold russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for putin the central bank restrictions target access to the more than 600 billion in reserves that the kremlin has at its disposal and are meant to block russia s ability to support the ruble as it plunges in value amid tightening western sanctions the ruble and russia s stock market both declined sharply immediately after russia launched military action in ukraine on thursday the ruble recovered slightly but is still down more than 6 percent from before putin s announcement trading at nearly 84 rubles to the dollar u s officials said saturday s steps were framed to send the ruble into free fall and promote soaring inflation in the russian economy the decline of the ruble would likely send inflation soaring which would hurt everyday russians and not just the russian elites who were the targets of the original sanctions the resulting economic disruption if saturday s measures are as harsh as described could leave putin facing political unrest at home analysts predicted intensifying runs on banks by russians and falling government reserves as russians scrambled to sell their targeted currency for safer assets the u s officials noted that previously announced sanctions have already had an impact on russia bringing its currency to its lowest level against the dollar in history and giving its stock market the worst week on record saturday s move also includes cutting key russian banks out of the swift financial messaging system which daily moves countless billions of dollars around more than 11 000 banks and other financial institutions around the world the fine print of the sanctions was

of swift could also hurt other economies including those of the u s and key ally germany only rarely has the west and its allies fired a full salvo of its available financial weapons on a country iran and north korea two previous targets had far smaller roles in the world economy while russia with its enormous petroleum reserves plays a much bigger role in global trade and parts of europe depend on its natural gas the disconnection from swift announced by the west on saturday is partial leaving europe and the united states room to escalate penalties later officials said they had not fully

damage to the russian economy and its banking system said clay lowery executive vice president of the institute of international finance while details on how the new sanctions affect energy are still emerging we do know that sanctions on its central bank will make it more difficult for russia to export energy and other commodities rachel ziemba an adjunct senior fellow at the center for a new

fx empire afp kjn the incentive structure of the ratings agencies also proved perverse agencies such as moody s and standard poor s are paid by the very people they are supposed to grade as a result they ve had every reason to give companies high ratings in a financial version of what college professors know as grade inflation i want to liken here to what s gone on in the great financial crisis we had rating agencies third party verification sources that were able to perpetuate the fraud because the money got too big their institutions became corrupted with the institutional imperative and they got triple a ratings which we all know in hindsight were not triple a ratings let s move forward to today the fda is the trusted third party verification of pharmaceutical products 50 of their budget comes from pharma due to the institutional imperative that was in place at the time and the speed with which they tried to approve these unproven products with this unproven technology fraud did occur and what s my proof of that t he fda together with pfizer were trying to hide the clinical data and it s come out recently that the all cause mortality for the pfizer product failed that means there were more deaths in the vaccine group than the placebo group normally in such a case you have no drug approval for such drugs it s the gold standard i ve been told by all my people in the biotech industry they were horrified so i ve seen three frauds the corporate fraud of the dot com boom the bank fraud of the great financial recession and i believe the fraud has moved on to central banks and governments because that s the nature of our monetary system you have to constantly create credit to keep this thing going see mark 2 22 the global debt bubble is at its peak we are at the end we are going to see lots of crazy things in the financial markets we are going to see the credit markets become unhinged the equity markets become unhinged the fed got a reprieve under the cover of covid they were able to print 65 more money to keep this thing afloat but we are at the end days here a lot of what you are seeing in the response of global governments is setting up a system under the guise of medical tyranny to prevent the riots that are going to ensue once this thing all unwinds that s my personal belief and the evidence inescapably points to the vaccines as the cause unum insurance is up 36 lincoln national plus 57 prudential plus 41 reinsurance group of america plus 21 hartford plus 32 met life plus 24 and aegon which is a dutch insurer saw in their us arm plus 57 in the 4th quarter in the 3rd quarter they saw a 258 increase in death claims they raised mortality expectations 300 000 for 2022 over 2021 due to covid plus indirect covid which i think we know what that s code for they aegon did a 1 4 billion reinsurance deal with wilton reinsurance what they were reinsuring were high face amount individual policies from 1 million to 10 million so i think there is an asymmetric information situation going on in the insurance industry where some people have figured out something s going on they are off loading their risk they are not going to say what it is as they don t want that information to get out as they unload the risk wrong fraud undoes all these protections 1 a materially false statement or purposeful failure to state or release material facts which non disclosure makes other statements misleading 2 the false statement is made to induce plaintiff to act 3 the plaintiff relied upon the false statement and the injury resulted from this reliance 4 damages include a punitive award as a punishment that serves as a public example to discourage any future similar fraud punitive damages are generally proportional to the defendant s assets fda is the trusted third party just like the rating agencies were and a lot of doctors in this country a lot of local governments are placing their trust in the fda which gets 50 percent of its budget from large cap pharma it wasn t any one person i think they overlooked things an all cause mortality end point should have stopped this thing in its tracks and it didn t when one party enters into a contract and fraud was occurring when they entered into that contract and the other party did not know that the contract is void and null there s no indemnity if this can be proven and i think it will be pfizer got blanket immunity with eua if fraud occurred to my mind and what i m seeing from their refusal to release the data if there is fraud and it comes out and we need whistleblowers and it s looking more apparent that this product is deadly fraud eviscerates all contracts that s case law so you go down the daisy chain and that s liability that s bankruptcy for moderna definitely pfizer dowd remarks that no matter the effort one cannot hide the bodies and the bodies are piling up people are dying and being maimed this is a fraud that goes beyond the pale we have the vaers data we have the dod leak and now we have the insurance company results and the funeral home results we don t need to think too hard about this deaths should have gone down after the vaccines rolled out this is the most egregious fraud in history of the nation and it s global pfizer s involved and they committed fraud dowd explained my job is to be ahead of the news and be a lead steer when i use my stock picking skills outside the realm of stock picking i am called a conspiracy theorist let me make a point here the mainstream media may ignore this wall street is not this is the most interesting hallucination i ve ever seen in the financial markets so we don t need the mainstream media and i want you to know wall street is rallying to this i m getting lots of inquiries from former colleagues nothing will convince a sleeping public more than red stocks or collapsing stocks my goal is to awaken the country by seeing something is going on and wall street is awake there s lots of people who got the jabs that didn t understand what was going on a lot of them are in the investment world a lot of them are smart people they were duped too some of these people that got the jab are doing the work on shorting these stocks because you know you can guess because they are mad as hell and you ve awakened the sleeping giant known as wall street and wall street is on the move the smart money is moving first as always there s lead steers nothing gets going faster than a red momentum down trending stock i don t know what happened to our country it s disgusting there s nothing that s going to be taken from us here today that they re not going to take anyways and people need to stand with enough of us they can t do this if you are long these two stocks you are long mandates you are long government control and you are long the selling of your freedoms wall street investors are dumping their moderna and pfizer stock faster than the world can drop the mandates former blackrock executive and investment adviser edward dowd calls for moderna to go to zero and pfizer to end under ten dollars per share how is this possible given thatwith nothing but profits in sight for the pharmaceutical giant after all in december a forbes headline read the vaccine maker can dominate the covid market for years to come wells fargo predicts in addition to the enormously profitable mrna vaccines pfizer is rolling out potent antivirals like paxlovid which could earn 22 billion in 2022 compared to the 81 billion in 2021 revenue the earnings from the vaccines and the antiviralswhich is music to shareholders ears however some are hearing shrieks and these happen to be wall street s finest twhich often pays spectacular dividends he saw the dot com bubble ready to burst and acted accordingly but unfortunately other not so savvy investors later saw their dot com heavy portfolios collapse as the nasdaq composite index lost 40 of its value in 2000 a graduate of notre dame university and former portfolio manager at blackrock dowd grew his fund from 2 billion to 14 billion and commanded the respect of his investment community peers today after semi retiring to the shores of south maui he remains a voice of stock market wisdom that many hedge funds continue to rely upon linkedin lists him as a consultant to founder partner of symphonic capital llc but the dot com collapse is not the only one dowd successfully navigated while many other portfolio managers placed their client s money in highly rated and lucrative mortgage backed securities dowd hesitated and questioned he considered that those might be grossly over rated and he was correct according to edward dowd a large portion of the blame was shouldered by the rating agencies those trusted organizations whose job it was to judge the risk of these subprime mortgage backed securities agencies like moody s standard poor s and fitch dowd saysso in essence these rating agencies were captured by the institutions backing these risky subprime securities put it this way so what does the man who foresaw the dot com and the subprime mortgage crisis have to say about moderna and pfizer and what trouble could exist in the paradise of covid vaccine profits and unfortunately that is not all dowd feels that although he has successfully predicted three large frauds in his career he clarifies that the ramifications of which may be the loss of pensions and social security income for the skeptics consider that pfizer stock lost 20 billion in market capitalization on february 8 2022 when their record earnings fell short of more optimistic expectations also consider that m from its high of 484 on august 9 2021 wiping out almos t 140 billion in investment dowd predictsand he predictsdowd explains that the smart money has already left moderna and will soon be exiting pfizer dowd foreseescoming as thedowd teamed up with an insurance industry analyst and researched the life insurance claims they found thatmeanwhile the funeral company stocks have outperformed the s p funeral home companies are growth stocks they had a great year in 2021 compared to 2020 and they outperformed the s p 500 the peer group of funeral home stocks was up 40 plus percent while the s p was up 26 percent and they started accelerating price wise in 2021 during the roll out of the vaccines you don t need to be a rocket scientist to connect the dots here see mark 5 55 for example a court in france has already held that a life insurance company cannot be held liable for a death because of the mrna vaccine for an emergency product they were told was liability free aren t the vaccine manufacturers immunized from lawsuits after all the idea is that no company upon government request should have to pay for unforeseen complications resulting from an emergency product that they released to the world out of their goodness of the hearts with the best of intentions if a company or person intentionally deceives another to profit we have fraud under common law the required elements to prove fraud amount to dowd has been researching the covid 19 vaccines and what he considers obvious evidence of knowing concealment of the actual risks of death andhe likens the fda today to the rating agencies during the mortgage crisis dowd assumes fraud based upon thehe notes that theand the deaths are what distinguished thedowd emphasized that he is not short on pfizer or moderna stock he explained that he does not profit from their share prices dropping he also points out that his predictions are not the cause of the steep declines as these occurred before he came out with this analysis see mark 13 45 if money is any indicator edward dowd is correct thatwhile the vaccine market pales in comparison if someone is left holding the bag it will not be the insurance industry but it just might be you and me the average citizen however there is one major caveat if edward dowd succeeds in awakening the citizens then they the oligarchs cannot get away with this those of you who still think nothing s going on you don t want to be what i call the bag holder you don t want to be the guy taking the fourth jab booster and holding these stocks on their way down moderna s going to zero i think pfizer goes sub ten dollars once the lawsuits come out see mark 4 06 dowd s forecast can awaken not only wall street but the ordinary citizen we are those sleeping giants of the world those who can move mountains with the force of our stock sales and non violent protests the great silent majority who can remove dictators from power and elect new and fair leaders there is power in numbers as the canadian truckers recently found courage is contagious as freedom convoys have sprung up everywhere as this freedom trucker fireman said edward dowd cautions those who continue to slumber

cautious too soon most of the bearish arguments we encounter appear more sentiment based e g prices have come too far too fast setting aside this understandably inherent acrophobia induced caution and focusing more squarely on empirical evidence the supply demand picture remains on solid footing thanks to continued record low housing inventory accompanying fresh 30 year lows in single family and multifamily vacancies 6 furthermore roughly 2 million more people will turn 35 years old anually over the next five years as compared to the previous five years since 35 is the peak first time home buying age we believe there will be sustained demand for years to come our long portfolio remains heavily geared to entry level housing related companies as well as those tied to home remodeling one of our preferred ways to express this bullish thematic view is through bluelinx holdings inc bxc we knew investors had been bracing for a profit collapse on the back of a fast 73 decline in lumber prices that occurred from may to september but we had a differentiated view based on the company s earnings mix that is skewed to specialty products with less volatile pricing as opposed to purely commoditized framing lumber the stock continues to be overly discounted based on apathy ambiguity and fear over the housing cycle by our math even in the unlikely event that bxc s structural products segment produces 0 00 in gross profits over the next year compared to 187 7m ltm and their specialty segment revenue declines 5 10 from here the company still has sustainable earnings power in excess of 12 per share at 10x earnings a modest discount to the company s long term p e ratio despite the balance sheet being deleveraged the stock still has 63 upside a more reasonable earnings power estimate is in the 16 50 19 00 range which puts the stock under 4x fully taxed net income unfortunately the board did not pull the trigger on any of their authorized share buyback last quarter before the stock rose 50 after earnings if they sharpen their pencils anytime soon and buy stock back at this depressed valuation the normalized eps number should only move higher 7 the lovesac company

washington ap the united states and european nations agreed saturday to impose the most potentially crippling financial penalties yet on russia over its unrelenting invasion of ukraine going after the central bank reserves that underpin the russian economy and severing some russian banks from a vital global financial network the decision announced as ukrainian forces battled saturday to hold russian forces back from ukraine s capital and residents sheltered in subway tunnels basements and underground garages has potential to spread the pain of western retaliation for president vladimir putin s invasion to ordinary russians far more than previous rounds of penalties putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy ukraine but what he is also doing in fact is destroying the future of his own country eu commission president ursula von der leyen said the european union united states united kingdom and other allies have steadily stepped up the intensity of their sanctions since russia launched the invasion late last week while u s and european officials made clear they still were working out the mechanics of how to implement the latest measures and intend to spare russia s oil and natural gas exports the sanctions in total potentially could amount to some of the toughest levied on a nation in modern times if fully carried out as planned the measures will severely damage the russian economy and markedly constrain its ability to import and export goods the u s and european allies announced the moves in a joint statement as part of a new round of financial sanctions meant to hold russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for putin the central bank restrictions target access to the more than 600 billion in reserves that the kremlin has at its disposal and are meant to block russia s ability to support the ruble as it plunges in value amid tightening western sanctions the ruble and russia s stock market both declined sharply immediately after russia launched military action in ukraine on thursday the ruble recovered slightly but is still down more than 6 percent from before putin s announcement trading at nearly 84 rubles to the dollar u s officials said saturday s steps were framed to send the ruble into free fall and promote soaring inflation in the russian economy the decline of the ruble would likely send inflation soaring which would hurt everyday russians and not just the russian elites who were the targets of the original sanctions the resulting economic disruption if saturday s measures are as harsh as described could leave putin facing political unrest at home analysts predicted intensifying runs on banks by russians and falling government reserves as russians scrambled to sell their targeted currency for safer assets the u s officials noted that previously announced sanctions have already had an impact on russia bringing its currency to its lowest level against the dollar in history and giving its stock market the worst week on record saturday s move also includes cutting key russian banks out of the swift financial messaging system which daily moves countless billions of dollars

germany only rarely has the west and its allies fired a full salvo of its available financial weapons on a country iran and north korea two previous targets had far smaller roles in the world economy while russia with its enormous petroleum reserves plays a much bigger role in global trade and parts of europe depend on its natural gas the disconnection from swift announced by the west on saturday

price has still not recovered from that downward adjustment lseg over a 5 year period has underperformed ice by 33 and ihs markit info by 18 general strategy stock exchanges play a pivotal role in the capital allocation process detailed and segmented market data are essential in this process lseg bets on its price setting capacity and market acumen to sell enhanced market data yet as the recent softbank decision to consider a new york nasdaq ndaq listing for uk high tech chip darling arm over lseg has shown data integration doesn t alleviate prowess to attract disruptive high profile companies to its listing board last year several uk taskforce listing recommendations to attract and retain new high growth capital to lseg were implemented by the financial conduct authority a uk regulator among the rules are relaxation of the use of dual class shares the introduction of spacs special purpose acquisition companies and the reduction of free float to 10 sustainability focus within the context of net zero pledges and decarbonization ambitions stock exchanges become more critical lseg has been at the forefront of several laudable initiatives yet will lseg have the wherewithal to convince venture capital nurtured climate tech companies to seek primary listings on their platform how can lseg attract capital for high growth opportunities when their constituent investor community is stubbornly seeking dividend income and how will environmental social and governance esg astute actors be convinced to invest in such opportunities at lseg if dual class capital structures take more prominence and undermines the pursuit of ethical governance standards there seems to be an implicit paradox between lseg s intent to accelerate decarbonization while also offering appealing esg lit compliance requirements to entrepreneurs to access lseg s primary and secondary market platforms in this context how are decarbonization opportunities spurred at lseg the january 2022 decision by royal dutch shell to ditch its dual dutch british share structure in favor of a single share primary listing at lseg severely thwarted lseg s ambition to become a more sustainability driven listing base david harris recently appointed as global head of sustainable finance strategy at lseg shared his views on lseg s broader sustainability strategy harris outlined the two different tenets of this strategy 1 transforming the global financial eco system whereby lseg s commercial capabilities influence and market relationships are deployed to ensure that capital markets are orientated for long term sustainable development 2 reshaping its operations and culture such that lseg s direct sustainability efforts towards community environmental responsibility and philanthropy become more impactful in october 2021 just prior to cop26 in glasgow lseg became the first stock exchange to publish climate reporting guidance based on the taskforce for climate related financial disclosures tcfd recommendations achieving comparable sustainability disclosures across regions was deemed critical to drive sustainable investments and the transition towards net zero goals david harris believes it s about how we lseg can accelerate market based decarbonization he underscores that common language for sustainable investment is vital in holding companies to account for their climate commitments he argues that financial markets must be part of the solution to the climate emergency but that the window to decarbonize to drive down global emissions is narrow financing is only the first stage in a sequence of activities that eventually lowers levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere lseg key initiatives the recent cop26 gathering in glasgow turned a deaf ear to this narrow window and to climate emergency bolder commitments may have emerged on deforestation on scaling down coal use and on the reduction of methane emissions new standards for carbon markets were probably the most significant milestone reached finally deeper engagement of the finance industry through the creation of gfanz the global financial alliance for net zero whereby the financial institutions with over 130 tr of assets under management committed to align their financing to a neutral carbon footprint unfortunately the overall gap between intent and tangible support to decarbonize global economies remained colossal as a key financial market infrastructure lseg tried to distinguish itself by announcing several important climate related initiatives at cop26 designed to accelerate the transition to net zero lseg s ceo david schwimmer was assigned to steer the real economy transition plans within the gfanz initiative gfanz members incite their target companies to execute transition plans in alignment with the overall net zero ambition lseg is continuing to see investors act by reallocating portfolios based on climate goals uk pension fund brunel pension partnership allocated 3 billion to a fund tracking a ftse russell index that is aligned to the goals of the paris agreement the index provider has seen capital tied to its sustainable investment indices rise to 167 bn but such achievements are still way off mark carney s gfanz ambition to garner 130 trillion to decarbonize the global economy in a further initiative the transition pathway institute tpi and london school of economics developed a robust methodology whereby the world s largest corporate carbon emitters are ranked lseg contributed for free publicly available independent assessments of how the world s biggest carbon emitters are decarbonizing their businesses lseg is also aiming to support the growth of the green economy and one way of achieving this is providing the tools for identifying and allocating capital to green industries to this end lseg has a green revenues classification system that identified 133 micro sectors when screening green revenues classified in accordance with the eu taxonomy and this is also the basis for their green economy mark for green industry companies listing in london additionally lseg is committed to advancing solutions for the voluntary carbon markets these developments would enable funds to be listed that will provide capital for projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and remove carbon from our atmosphere but why is a capital allocation vehicle like lseg intent on zero carbon ambitions not more ambitious in its product innovation why is there no full derivatives product suite built around the more robust compliance carbon credit market like the european emissions trading system swaps futures and options anchored around the instruments auctioned to significant polluters in the european union could foster price discovery ensure deeper liquidity and offer more adequate climate risk management tools to investors and issuers alike the reason can t be that momentum is missing carbon credits rose about 131 this year and are close to reaching 100 euros 112 a metric ton furthermore as a facilitating market infrastructure lseg still has a treacherous road ahead to attract less heavy scope 1 emitters as listed entities based on the ranking of its top 100 listed issuers by market capitalization lseg finds itself ranked 15th among the top 22 stock exchanges within g20 and this was before dutch shell decided to list their single share listing at lseg a further challenge for lseg and for that matter other exchanges is that current equity capital allocation on stock exchanges is short term driven guided by quarterly earnings reports is carbon footprint agnostic in the use of its decision variables and is executed in nanoseconds through ai driven applications how can these characteristics serve longer term esg oriented investors conclusion lseg is at crucial crossroads this market infrastructure data and analytics firm sees the climate agenda as central to its future strategy but lseg is facing five distinct challenges will it be capable of integrating refinitiv within the redefined budget and timeframe will it be able to sell esg enhanced data analytics at a premium as well as bring innovative esg driven products to market will it have the appeal to attract and maintain high climate tech companies can it transform a carbon agnostic high frequency trading environment into a more esg attuned capital allocation platform and finally will ceo david schwimmer be decisive enough in contributing to mark carney s 130 tr gfanz ambition at a current p e of 64 the market is convinced ceo david schwimmer can but then the core shareholder base blackstone and qatar investment authority is watching every move

billionaire buffett still wants deals but can t find any attractive ones warren buffett speaks onstage during fortune s most powerful women summit day 2 at the mandarin oriental hotel on oct 13 2015 in washington d c photo by paul morigi getty images for fortune time inc via cnn omaha neb ap billionaire warren buffett says his company has benefited from some extraordinary luck in finding acquisitions like bnsf railroad over the decades but he hasn t had much of that in recent years as berkshire hathaway s cash pile has grown to nearly 147 billion buffett sought to reassure shareholders with his annual letter saturday that he retains a strong appetite for acquisitions and stock investments but he hasn t found many of either that interest him at today s inflated prices in fact berkshire was a net seller of stocks again last year unloading 7 4 billion more shares than it bought he blamed the continued low interest rates for helping drive up the price of stocks and whole companies alike and in the past he has said that increasing competition from private equity buyers has also made it hard to find good deals from time to time such possibilities are both numerous and blatantly attractive today though we find little that excites us buffett wrote about the prospects for finding good stock investments so berkshire has focused on growing the 90 odd businesses the omaha nebraska based conglomerate already owns and repurchasing its own shares something buffett has invested 51 7 billion in over the last two years including 27 billion last year but the pace of buybacks may have slowed a bit because berkshire has only bought 1 2 billion of its own shares so far this year with berkshire s companies generating about 7 billion in cash every quarter the repurchases haven t been enough to meaningfully shrink the cash pile and buffett said he will always keep at least 30 billion on hand to make sure berkshire can cover any catastrophic claims on the insurance policies its companies write buffett s letter is always well read in the business world because of his remarkably successful track record but he kept his message focused on berkshire s businesses and didn t mention politics or say much about the broader economy he also didn t offer any new details about berkshire s succession planning in his first letter since saying last spring that berkshire vice chairman greg abel will one day replace him as ceo although the 91 year old buffett has no plans to retire buffett only confirmed that plan after his business partner charlie munger slipped up and hinted at it during last year s annual meeting i felt like there was an opportunity here for buffett to do something more formal and make comments about abel s qualifications or why shareholders and investors should trust he was the right candidate there could have been more commentary around that edward jones analyst jim shanahan said investor bill smead said buffett also didn t devote much space in his letter to warning people about foolish behavior as he has often done in the past it just seems like the last two or three years of letters and annual meetings there has just been way more that he didn t say than what he did smead said but buffett did warn investors to be careful when reading other companies financial reports to make sure they are accounting for all their costs when they report their earnings deceptive adjustments to earnings to use a polite description have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks have risen speaking less politely i would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull buffett wrote despite the dearth of acquisitions and new investments berkshire has continued to profit as the economy rebounded from the depths of the pandemic the company reported making 39 6 billion or 26 690 per class a share during the fourth quarter that s up from 35 8 billion or 25 015 per class a share a year ago in 2021 the majority of the operating companies benefited from the tailwind of an economic recovery cfra research analyst cathy seifert said but those bottom line figures were inflated by paper gains on berkshire s investments which is why buffett maintains that operating earnings are a better measure of the company s performance because they exclude investments and derivatives by that measure berkshire s operating earnings jumped from 5 02 billion or 3 224 74 per class a share to 7 3 billion or 4 904 23 per class a share during the fourth quarter the four analysts surveyed by factset expected berkshire to report operating earnings per class a share of 4 197 84 in the quarter buffett said the four biggest pillars of berkshire s business its insurance companies its 161 billion investment in apple stock bnsf railroad and its collection of utilities all helped it succeed last year the railroad alone contributed a record 6 billion in profit last year while the utilities set a record of their own with a 3 5 billion profit and buffett praised apple s ceo tim cook as a brilliant executive buffett said that this year berkshire will bring back the full slate of events surrounding the company s annual meeting that used to routinely attract more than 40 000 people before the pandemic forced it to go virtual for the past two years but anyone who wants to attend the april 30 meeting in omaha to hear buffett spend hours answering questions will have to prove they have been vaccinated for covid 19 berkshire owns an eclectic variety of companies including bnsf a number of large electric utilities geico insurance and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies the conglomerate also holds large stock investments in apple coca cola bank of america and other companies

washington the united states and european nations agreed saturday to impose the most potentially crippling financial penalties yet on russia over its unrelenting invasion of ukraine going after the central bank reserves that underpin the russian economy and severing some russian banks from a vital global financial network the decision announced as ukrainian forces battled saturday to hold russian forces back from ukraine s capital and residents sheltered in subway tunnels basements and underground garages has potential to spread the pain of western retaliation for president vladimir putin s invasion to ordinary russians far more than previous rounds of penalties putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy ukraine but what he is also doing in fact is destroying the future of his own country eu commission president ursula von der leyen said the european union united states united kingdom and other allies have steadily stepped up the intensity of their sanctions since russia launched the invasion late last week while u s and european officials made clear they still were working out the mechanics of how to implement the latest measures and intend to spare russia s oil and natural gas exports the sanctions in total potentially could amount to some of the toughest levied on a nation in modern times if fully carried out as planned the measures will severely damage the russian economy and markedly constrain its ability to import and export goods the u s and european allies announced the moves in a joint statement as part of a new round of financial sanctions meant to hold russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for putin the central bank restrictions target access to the more than us 600 billion in reserves that the kremlin has at its disposal and are meant to block russia s ability to support the ruble as it plunges in value amid tightening western sanctions the ruble and russia s stock market both declined sharply immediately after russia launched military action in ukraine on thursday the ruble recovered slightly but is still down more than six per cent from before putin s announcement trading at nearly 84 rubles to the dollar u s officials said saturday s steps were framed to send the ruble into free fall and promote soaring inflation in the russian economy the decline of the ruble would likely send inflation soaring which would hurt everyday russians and not just the russian elites who were the targets of the original sanctions the resulting economic disruption if saturday s measures are as harsh as described could leave putin facing political unrest at home analysts predicted intensifying runs on banks by russians and falling government reserves as russians scrambled to sell their targeted currency for safer assets the u s officials noted that previously announced sanctions have already had an impact on russia bringing its currency to its lowest level against the dollar in history and giving its stock market the worst week on record saturday s move also includes cutting key russian banks out of the swift financial messaging system which daily moves countless billions

economy while russia with its enormous petroleum reserves plays a much bigger role in global trade and parts of europe depend on its natural gas the disconnection from swift announced by the west on

kamloops news war via tiktok russia s new tool for propaganda machine file russia s president vladimir putin appears on a television screen at the stock market in frankfurt germany feb 25 2022 russia is revving up its sophisticated propaganda machine as its military advances in neighboring ukraine analysts who monitor propaganda and disinformation say they ve seen a sharp increase in online activity linked to the russian state in recent weeks image credit ap photo michael probst file the russian tiktok video has it all a cat puppies and a pulsing background beat it s cute watchable and hardly seems the stuff of state propaganda in 2014 russia flooded the internet with fake accounts pushing disinformation about its takeover of crimea eight years later experts say russia is mounting a far more sophisticated effort as it invades ukraine armies of trolls and bots stir up anti ukrainian sentiment state controlled media outlets look to divide western audiences clever tiktok videos serve up russian nationalism with a side of humor the effort amounts to an emerging part of russia s war arsenal with the shaping of opinion through orchestrated disinformation fighting alongside actual troops and weapons in the cat video a husky puppy identified by a digitally inserted u s flag swipes at the tail of a tabby identified by a russian flag the cat responds with a ferocious jab that sends the hapless dog scurrying the clip which has been viewed 775 000 times in two weeks is the work of an account named funrussianprezident that boasts 310 000 followers almost all of its videos feature pro russian content it could just be a patriotic russian fighting the good fight as they see it or it could easily be something directly affiliated with the state said nina jankowicz a disinformation researcher and expert on eastern europe at the wilson center in washington russia has been perfecting these tactics now they are putting them in play analysts at several different research organizations contacted by the associated press said they are seeing a sharp increase in online activity by groups affiliated with the russian state that s in keeping with russia s strategy of using social media and state run outlets to galvanize domestic support while seeking to destabilize the western alliance across the internet there s been a rapid uptick in suspicious accounts spreading anti ukrainian content according to a report from cyabra an israeli tech company that works to detect disinformation cyabra s analysts tracked thousands of facebook and twitter accounts that had recently posted about ukraine they saw a sudden and dramatic increase in anti ukrainian content in the days immediately before the invasion on valentine s day for instance the number of anti ukrainian posts created by the sample of twitter accounts jumped by 11 000 when compared with just days earlier analysts believe a significant portion of the accounts are inauthentic and controlled by groups linked to the russian government when you see an 11 000 increase you know something is going on said cyabra ceo dan brahmy no one can know who is doing this behind the scenes we can only guess the work has been underway for some time researchers at the atlantic council s digital forensic research lab analyzed 3 000 articles by 10 state owned russian news outlets and noticed a big increase in unfounded claims that ukraine was poised to strike separatist groups overall russian media claims of ukrainian aggression surged by 50 in january according to the research this is the way they go to war it s a central part of russian doctrine said jim ludes a former u s defense analyst who now directs the pell center for international relations and public policy at salve regina university ludes said russian disinformation campaigns are intended to galvanize russian support while confusing and dividing the country s opponents russia tailors its propaganda message for specific audiences for russians and pro russian separatists in ukraine the message is that russia is trying to defend its own people against western fueled aggression and persecution in ukraine similar tactics have been used including by nazi germany when it invaded czechoslovakia under the guise of protecting ethnic germans living there ludes noted it s not good guys who use this tactic ludes said it s the language of conquest not the language of democracy russia is also using disinformation to confound and demoralize its opponents for instance the kremlin said it resumed fighting saturday after pausing for possible talks with ukraine but ap journalists in various areas of ukraine witnessed that the russian offensive never stopped on friday ukrainian officials reported that all troops stationed on the strategic snake island had been killed after defiantly refusing russian demands to surrender russian state tv later showed what it said was footage of the soldiers alive in custody the ap was unable to immediately verify either claim however reflecting the chaotic information environment surrounding the invasion the chaotic information environment surrounding the invasion led to confusing and sometimes contradictory accounts on friday ukrainian officials reported that all troops stationed on the strategic snake island had been killed after defiantly refusing russian demands to surrender russian state tv later showed what it claimed was footage of the soldiers alive in custody the ap was unable to immediately verify either claim meanwhile the u s has information indicating russia is publicizing false reports about widespread surrenders of ukrainian troops and claims that moscow plans to threaten killing family members of ukrainian soldiers if they do not surrender according to state department spokesman ned price russia has also employed cyberattacks in its invasion of ukraine and while they pose a serious threat online propaganda can leave even more lasting damage if it succeeds according to retired army lt gen michael nagata a former director of strategic operational planning at the u s national counterterrorism center what is far more dangerous is russia s ability to influence what populations everywhere believe nagata said to get them to believe things that are useful for russian strategic interests if you re able to change what an entire population believes you may not have to attack anything in the west russia seeks to sow division and reduce the chances of a unified international response it does this in part through a stable of state controlled media outlets such as sputnik and rt which publish in english spanish and several other languages the invasion is off read one headline in rt last week just days before russian troops moved into eastern ukraine tucker carlson slams biden for focusing on putin ukraine instead of us domestic problems reads another in sputnik news reflecting a common russian practice cite government critics in the u s like fox news host carlson to suggest america s leaders are out of touch the european union signaled its concerns about rt on wednesday when it included rt s editor in chief on a list of sanctions imposed on russian officials the eu called rt s leader margarita simonyan a central figure of the government propaganda on friday facebook announced that it would prohibit rt from running ads on its site and said it would expand its use of labels to identify state run media ludes said he s been pleased to see the u s and its allies forcefully push back on russian disinformation and even seek to preempt it by publicly disclosing russia s plans the biden administration has demonstrated some creativity in using intelligence to respond he said we haven t seen that from the west since the cold

holocaust survivor maurice blik makes sculptures that fetch 300 000 he tells me my money i lost 50k in a gold mine now i put my cash into art the best money decision that artist maurice blik ever made was to take advantage of margaret thatcher s right to buy policy in the early 1980s and buy a home at a big discount blik 82 a sculptor and a holocaust survivor whose huge bronze sculptures now sell for substantial six figure sums snapped up his two bedroom flat in the centre of london for just 45 000 in 1981 he spoke to donna ferguson his book the art of survival is out now what did your parents teach you about money that there are more important things in life i am jewish and was born in amsterdam in 1939 at the age of four i was carted off to camp westerbork and then to belsen concentration camp with my mother and my older sister we were lucky to survive my father a salesman who travelled around holland selling car parts to garages was taken from us and we never saw him again we can only assume he died somewhere possibly auschwitz so did my uncles my aunt my cousins i lost half my family in the holocaust so it wasn t so much that my parents taught me about money more about life it wasn t means tested whether you went into the camps or not as a result i think i probably have a view of life which has certain priorities being alive is one of them so is having your health having love and people around you that matter was money tight when you were growing up it was i didn t find it stressful money was less important to me than freedom i was six when a train i had been put on to take me off somewhere was liberated by cossacks my mother who was british and had come to holland with her parents as a girl of 11 spoke perfect english she didn t have any papers but somehow she persuaded people after the war that she was british she came here with me and my sister and i grew up in north harrow middlesex my mother worked at the local kodak factory eventually she married my stepfather who was a diamond polisher we weren t poor we had enough to eat we had a roof over our heads and clothes on our backs but we weren t wealthy either we were a working class family and it was fine have you ever struggled to make ends meet yes when i was 16 we moved to the united states for complicated reasons i didn t want to stay there so a year later i came back to england and started art school i rented a bedsit in a house and got a job in a pub in the evenings to feed and clothe myself i also did odd jobs fixing cars and working in coffee shops i had to manage on my own it was a struggle at times i didn t have any family to turn to when i needed a good feed but i do remember the pub landlady giving me free sandwiches have you ever been paid silly money no quite the contrary i ve spent endless hours making a sculpture and then selling it for the equivalent of ten pence an hour it s unpredictable how long it can take to make something and sometimes you don t get paid at all i ve spent weeks on pieces that don t work out and get thrown back in the claybin what was the best financial year of your life it was 2018 that year as well as selling several pieces i got commissioned to make a huge bronze sculpture for love of cyprus for the outside of an office block in cyprus it is 6 5 metres high in total my fee and the casting and the transport costs probably came to around 500 000 that was brilliant and i felt well rewarded what s the most expensive thing you bought just for fun i recently bought a three year old range rover autobiography for 60 000 it was a stupid money decision really but you can t always be sensible and logical what is your biggest money mistake i foolishly invested 50 000 in a gold mine in costa rica about ten years ago it went bankrupt i think there was a political coup and my money disappeared that taught me not to speculate so i don t invest in stocks and shares whenever i get spare cash i invest in myself by casting a couple more limited edition bronzes i make all my sculptures from clay and then cast them in bronze in a small edition six or nine they can sell for anything up to 300 000 it doesn t provide me with much security though because i can t tell in advance if a sculpture is a saleable piece or not obviously if it s one of an edition that s sold in the past then there s a good chance the next one will sell but until something sells from an edition you have no idea vast maurice blik s for love of cyprus right and on the office wall left the best money decision you have made to take advantage of maggie thatcher s right to buy policy in 1981 i d been renting my two bedroom flat in the barbican london for five years at that point so i qualified for a discount when i bought it it cost me about 45 000 it was a stretch for me to buy it at the time and i had to rent a bedroom to lodgers but it was a good financial decision i sold it ten years ago for about 600 000 and bought my current home a converted stables in essex with five bedrooms for 700 000 i imagine that my home has also gone up in value since i bought it but i haven t checked do you save into a pension no i get the state pension and a small works pension because i used to teach at middlesex university theoretically i could live on bread and cheese on the pension i receive but i don t want to just exist i want to live i m 82 and i have no ambition to retire i will work until the day i m not going to be here do you work because you rely on your income from sculptures no if i didn t make sculpture emotionally i don t know what i d do i ve got to do something with my time after all i don t have a dog to take for a walk and if i did i d find that infinitely boring i have never made sculptures to make a living i do it because it gives meaning to my life i honestly believe i m making a contribution to life my book the art of survival goes into my reasons for making sculpture and it s related to my background my not very happy early years it s a way of taking a positive view of life it s not about money it s my way of saying something about what life s about that s my motive for working what is the one little luxury you treat yourself to it s a glass of single malt whisky i like laphroaig it costs about 35 a bottle if you were chancellor what is the first thing you d do i would get rid of inheritance tax it s an invidious tax i inherited nothing everything was taken from my family their house and everything of value was stolen from them i think it d be lovely to come from that sort of background and be able to leave as much as possible that i ve managed to accumulate in my lifetime to my two kids and my wife free of tax what is your number one financial priority to stay solvent and make sure that my family my kids and my wife are comfortable when i m gone

so what happens next more sanctions on russia yes but what about the impact of the conflict on the global recovery and what does this mean for us here in washington where the economic response to russia s invasion of ukraine is being coordinated you are aware of a harsh reality sanctions will do serious damage to the russian economy but they will also damage europe particularly germany and to a smaller extent the uk but they won t cost much to america it is not at all dependent on russia for its energy supplies and it is a net exporter of petroleum products damaging vladimir putin s invasion of ukraine is seen by the markets as a humanitarian catastrophe with powerful political consequences rather than an economic one it is also as argued here last week the best safe haven for global capital you can see this in the foreign exchanges the pound started the week above 1 36 on thursday it dipped below 1 33 before managing a modest recovery the hit to the euro was even greater though it too recovered on friday however the experience of past shocks including the hit from the pandemic in spring 2020 is that markets will settle down even before it is clear how damaging the blow will be this may seem callous and it is but global finance looks at the total picture of the world economy and is taking the view that the likely outcome in ukraine is not big enough to destroy the general recovery they see this as a humanitarian catastrophe with powerful political consequences rather than an economic one the plain fact is that there is a practical limit to sanctions the simple reason is europe s energy supplies germany gets half its gas and one third of its oil from russia the strongest impact on russia would be for it to be excluded from the swift international payments system this links banks around the world enabling them to send money across borders everyone who has an account with a major british bank will have a swift number boris johnson has called for russia to be excluded from this system that would be a huge blow in that it would cripple russia s trade but how then would germany and indeed the rest of europe pay for its gas and oil in theory energy payments could be excluded but this would be an invitation for russia to do exactly what europe most fears having its energy supplies cut off the markets have been trying to calculate what this might do to the oil price and the numbers are nasty the current oil price is around 100 a barrel and projections are that it could rise to 120 or even 140 if russian supplies are temporarily halted gas prices are harder to predict but the european wholesale gas price quadrupled last year so any restriction would hit a market that is already desperately short of supply money spent on more expensive energy is money not available to be spent on other things and if demand for the broad output of any economy falls sharply there is one clear outcome my judgment is that if russia does cut off oil and gas exports to europe that makes a recession in europe this summer inevitable america can cope though there is profound concern here about the impact of higher energy prices on inflation generally but europe can t cope without huge economic cost so if russia is cut out of swift it will be because the us forces the eu to follow america s line what should we look for now the broad expectation of the markets is that there will be some weeks of conflict and then a ceasefire until there is a ceasefire it is difficult to assess the full economic consequences but there will be three areas to look at the first will be the impact on energy markets europe will make a huge effort to ensure security of supply that will include longer term areas such as investment in renewables as well as more immediate issues such as building more gas storage facilities and boosting the ability to import liquefied natural gas next there is the impact on inflation in very round numbers what has happened is likely to add about one percentage point on inflation this spring in the uk in other words if our consumer prices index was going to peak at 7 per cent it will now peak at 8 per cent third financial markets will soon start to look through the chaos and go back to assessing the fundamentals after all while russia is a huge energy producer it accounts for less than 2 per cent of global gdp what is happening is unbearably horrible in human terms but in economic terms it is a middle weight blow

portuguese prime minister antonio costa on friday said at a televised news conference that his country would send soldiers to assist ukraine in its defense against russia cnn reported according to costa russia s war on ukraine is a war against the freedom of self determination of a democratic country and therefore it is also a war against the freedom of self determination and against democracy he added that there is an unanimity of all states in view of the need to strengthen the nato presence on the borders of ukraine and in all the alliance countries that are close to the ukraine
we were repeatedly told that putin was on the rampage but even so when the news broke on thursday that russia had invaded ukraine financial markets went into panic mode stocks tumbled oil prices soared and big investment institutions took refuge in traditional safe havens such as gilts the dollar and gold shares rebounded on friday but the landscape is still a frightening one for individual investors and tempestuous times almost certainly lie ahead surefire defence supermarkets and healthcare are all sectors that will continue to see demand in the crisis fortunately even in this climate certain companies are more likely to weather the storm than others they include those involved in essential services with strong management at the top and a decent track record of growth bae systems with an almost uncanny sense of timing the defence giant unveiled its 2021 results just as russian tanks were rolling into ukraine the figures were good sales rose to more than 21billion profits were 24 per cent higher than last time at 2 4billion and the dividend rose 6 per cent to 25 1p critically analysts expect this growth to continue bae systems is not just the uk s largest defence company it is the biggest in western europe and ranks seventh on the world stage with a massive business in america admittedly there have been times when it has been hit with allegations of bribery corruption and basic inefficiency but that seems to have changed under chairman sir roger carr a veteran of the business world and his chief executive charles woodburn today bae is well regarded not just for making world class tanks submarines planes and ships but also for making the sophisticated stuff of modern warfare including complex electronic equipment and technology to enhance intelligence and repel cyber attacks the group has longstanding relationships across the ministry of defence over here and its counterpart in the us contracts tend to be long term and once business deals are signed there is plenty of adjacent repair and maintenance work as well midas verdict some investors shy away from defence stocks but as the current situation proves they provide an essential service in an unstable world defence budgets may also expand if russian aggression persists at 6 53 bae systems should deliver long term growth and the dividend yield of around 4 per cent is attractive too traded

shortly after the united states and european nations agreed saturday to impose the most potentially crippling financial penalties yet on russia over its unrelenting invasion of ukraine the ukrainian president s office said russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in kharkiv the country s second largest city the swift sanctions go after the central bank reserves that underpin the russian economy and sever some russian banks from a vital global financial network the decision announced as ukrainian forces battled saturday to hold russian forces back from ukraine s capital and residents sheltered in subway tunnels basements and underground garages has potential to spread the pain of western retaliation for president vladimir putin s invasion to ordinary russians far more than previous rounds of penalties putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy ukraine but what he is also doing in fact is destroying the future of his own country eu commission president ursula von der leyen said the european union united states united kingdom and other allies have steadily stepped up the intensity of their sanctions since russia launched the invasion late last week the state service of special communication and information protection warned saturday that the kharkiv explosion which it said looked like a mushroom cloud could cause an environmental catastrophe and advised residents to cover their windows with damp cloth or gauze and to drink plenty of fluids ukraine s top prosecutor iryna venediktova said the russian forces have been unable to take kharkiv where a fierce battle is underway the city of 1 5 million is located 40 kilometers 25 miles from the russian border related who is the ghost of kyiv tale of ukrainian fighter pilot trends on social media meanwhile while u s and european officials made clear they still were working out the mechanics of how to implement the latest measures and intend to spare russia s oil and natural gas exports the sanctions in total potentially could amount to some of the toughest levied on a nation in modern times if fully carried out as planned the measures will severely damage the russian economy and markedly constrain its

kremlin has at its disposal and are meant to block russia s ability to support the ruble as it plunges in value amid tightening western sanctions u s officials said saturday s steps were framed to send the ruble into free fall and promote soaring inflation in the russian economy the decline of the ruble would likely send inflation soaring which would hurt everyday russians and not just the russian elites who were the targets of the original sanctions the resulting economic disruption if saturday s measures are as harsh as described could leave putin facing political unrest at home analysts predicted intensifying runs on banks by russians and falling government reserves as russians scrambled to sell their targeted currency for safer assets the u s officials noted that previously announced sanctions have already had an impact on russia bringing its currency to its lowest level against the dollar in history and giving its stock market the worst week on record saturday s move

menafn afp the united states and western allies sought to cripple russia s banking sector and currency saturday with an extraordinary set of sanctions punishing moscow s invasion of ukraine taking measures unprecedented against a country of russia s size and international stature the allies cut selected banks from the swift system rendering them isolated from the rest of the world they hobbled the russian central bank s ability to use reserves to support the already sinking ruble which a senior us official said will now go into freefall and they warned that a task force will hunt down the yachts jets fancy cars and luxury homes owned around the world by oligarchs in president vladimir putin s ultra wealthy inner circle the us official said the measures were backed by the united states canada the european commission britain france germany and italy in a symbolic gesture likely to resonate in moscow which has been counting on european divisions to dilute western fury over its ukraine invasion the stunning news was first delivered from europe far exceeding others imposed against russia during putin s two decades long grip on power the sanctions came as the russian military stepped up its bloody multi pronged assault against kyiv and other ukrainian cities putin says the invasion is meant to restore control over a country that was long dominated by russia but now wants to join western institutions the group of world powers said in a statement it was resolved to continue imposing costs on russia that will further isolate russia from the international financial system and our economies we stand with the ukrainian people in this dark hour even beyond the measures we are announcing today we are prepared to take further measures to hold russia to account for its attack on ukraine the statement said paralyze russian central bank earlier this week western nations imposed an initial raft of sanctions including personally against putin and his foreign minister sergei lavrov they also targeted the biggest russian banks and effectively stopped energy rich russia s prized new export pipeline for natural gas known as nord stream 2 saturday s measures now mean that russia has become a global economic and financial pariah said the senior us official who asked not to be named he noted that moscow s stock market had suffered its worst week on record and that the ruble was at a historic low against the dollar putin s government is getting kicked off the international financial system cut from swift the chosen russian banks will not be able to conduct transactions without going back in time and using a fax machine or a telephone in every single instance effectively bringing their commerce beyond russia to a halt for now the swift measure covers only part of the russian banking network but could be expanded the german government s spokesman said in a statement this is intended to cut off these institutions from international financial flows which will massively restrict their global operations the spokesman said restrictions on the russian central bank aim to prevent the government from using its massive foreign currency reserves to prop up the falling ruble russia has to be able to sell those reserves and buy rubles to support its currency but without being able to buy the ruble from western financial institutions the ruble will fall even further the us official said that means the russian central bank can t support the ruble full stop european commission chief ursula von der leyen said this will paralyze the russian central bank only putin can decide the phenomenon of wealthy russians safeguarding their fortunes in luxury assets across the west often in chic areas of europe will also come under attack the so called golden passport system to obtain european citizenship will be scrapped while a us eu task force will seek to identify and freeze hidden riches putin allies will find themselves barred from foreign luxuries including their ability to send their kids to fancy colleges in the west the us official said the western allies said in their statement that they also intend to coordinate against disinformation and other forms of hybrid warfare that putin has used in his increasingly dangerous confrontation with the west the us official said more sanctions were being considered and that all depended on russia s next moves in ukraine this is putin s war of choice the official said only putin can decide how much more cost he is willing to bear burs sms bfm

washington ap the united states and european nations agreed saturday to impose the most potentially crippling financial penalties yet on russia over its unrelenting invasion of ukraine going after the central bank reserves that underpin the russian economy and severing some russian banks from a vital global financial network the decision announced as ukrainian forces battled saturday to hold russian forces back from ukraine s capital and residents sheltered in subway tunnels basements and underground garages has potential to spread the pain of western retaliation for president vladimir putin s invasion to ordinary russians far more than previous rounds of penalties putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy ukraine but what he is also doing in fact is destroying the future of his own country eu commission president ursula von der leyen said the european union united states united kingdom and other allies have steadily stepped up the intensity of their sanctions since russia launched the invasion late last week while u s and european officials made clear they still were working out the mechanics of how to implement the latest measures and intend to spare russia s oil and natural gas exports the sanctions in total potentially could amount to some of the toughest levied on a nation in modern times if fully carried out as planned the measures will severely damage the russian economy and markedly constrain its ability to import and export goods the u s and european allies announced the moves in a joint statement as part of a new round of financial sanctions meant to hold russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for putin the central bank restrictions target access to the more than 600 billion in reserves that the kremlin has at its disposal and are meant to block russia s ability to support the ruble as it plunges in value amid tightening western sanctions the ruble and russia s stock market both declined sharply immediately after russia launched military action in ukraine on thursday the ruble recovered slightly but is still down more than 6 percent from before putin s announcement trading at nearly 84 rubles to the dollar u s officials said saturday s steps were framed to send the ruble into free fall and promote soaring inflation in the russian economy the decline of the ruble would likely send inflation soaring which would hurt everyday russians and not just the russian elites who were the targets of the original sanctions the resulting economic disruption if saturday s measures are as harsh as described could leave putin facing political unrest at home analysts predicted intensifying runs on banks by russians and falling government reserves as russians scrambled to sell their targeted currency for safer assets the u s officials noted that previously announced sanctions have already had an impact on russia bringing its currency to its lowest level against the dollar in history and giving its stock market the worst week on record saturday s move also includes cutting key russian banks out of the swift financial messaging system which daily moves countless billions of dollars

germany only rarely has the west and its allies fired a full salvo of its available financial weapons on a country iran and north korea two previous targets had far smaller roles in the world economy

removing several russian banks from swift and sanctioning russia s central bank are likely to cause serious damage to the russian economy and its banking system said clay lowery executive vice president of the institute of international finance while details on how the new sanctions affect energy are still emerging we do know that sanctions on its central bank will make it more difficult

topics highlighted in the outlook included climate change enabling strong cultural values and attracting young talent now is an excellent time for people in the insurance industry to start studying what trends may become prominent during 2022 isabelle santenac ey s global insurance leader recently published her 2022 global insurance outlook it highlights several key trends here s a closer look at them the era of ecosystems and the rise of open insurance in today s highly connected society people no longer have to visit insurance agents offices to find out about offerings and sign up for their desired plans instead consumers can perform self driven research and even sign up for offerings with their smartphones many of the emerging companies that blend technology and insurance offer highly personalized user friendly experiences santenac believes that due to the state of the industry regulators will need to maintain an environment that lets people share their financial information with any firm in a secure and frictionless way such options will give customers better overall financial visibility however santenac does not suggest insurers should wait for regulators to develop and publish new rules she recommends insurers push ahead and look for strategic opportunities in the market by connecting with partners she says insurers can monetize data streams catch the interest of new customers and deploy new underwriting strategies by creating well designed and executed ecosystems the report clarified based upon current trends we expect ecosystems will become a major business model in the relatively near future as is often the case what feels innovative today will soon become a baseline one recent example of pursuing new technologies through partnerships concerned sapiens international corp an insurance software company it collaborated with charlee an artificial intelligence provider that uses algorithms to show litigation propensity and high cost patterns in customer claims jamie yoder north america president and general manager at sapiens said charlee joins sapiens expansive partner ecosystem through which we have a strategic imperative to constantly search for the latest innovations and empower our customers with the most innovative capabilities moving forward with care the ey report also contained some cautionary content for insurers that think moving to an ecosystem model will be a quick transition to succeed ecosystem business models need strong leadership from the top and a clear and executable ecosystem strategy based on their current market position brand value business models talent pool and level of technology sophistication the report said however it noted despite the clear upside of ecosystems most insurers are still working to develop the necessary tech and data capabilities navigate distribution constraints and address organizational and cultural impacts santenac was not alone in her expectation that ecosystems would become more popular in the insurance sector a pwc report echoed that sentiment and said the covid 19 pandemic had accelerated the push to create them it also mentioned that ecosystems give insurers ways to move beyond the traditional insurance model and strengthen customer relationships insurers increasingly looking for creative ways to mitigate climate related risks people in the insurance and risk management industries are no strangers to helping clients get equipped for facing the worst what if scenarios certain industries have more inherent risks than others however specific threats will continue to mount regardless of a company s line of business climate change will likely accelerate or trigger many of them as santenac mentions in this report climate change has caused insurers to investigate innovative ways to mitigate the associated risks they face now or might soon some have considered parametric policies and carbon offsets to reduce physical climate change risks actions with greater meaning showing a united front could also help make progress in the battle against climate change in 2021 eight of the world s top insurers created a net zero emissions alliance the ey report recommended that insurers engage in meaningful near term decisions to show they understand their roles in creating a more sustainable economy it suggested linking action plans to specific targets and creating quantifiable metrics that indicate whether a company s performance has become more sustainable besides showing the progression toward green targets the report advised that chosen metrics relate to risk exposures and how the business creates value another suggestion from the report was to make a company roadmap that shows how insurers environmental and social governance esg strategies impact various parts of the business it should clarify how they will carry out esg plans the coverage of this trend noted that reporting and disclosures would become standard practices the report said companies that prioritize transparency will experience more customer loyalty improved stock market performance and easier capital access attracting younger workers while showing strong social stances the ey report also mentioned the great resignation which saw workers from numerous fields leaving the workforce during the covid 19 pandemic analysts warn that global skilled worker shortages pose risks to the insurance industry however santenac believes a vital strategy to retain younger people in the sector and attract new candidates is to disprove the beliefs that the insurance industry is boring and slow moving the need for connection within the workplace and society another way to retain talent particularly on remote teams is to use technology to foster stronger connections between managers and employees the modern workforce will be more likely to thrive when there are stronger links to colleagues and teams even if not working together in the same room however the need for connection runs even deeper the ey trend overview highlighted the necessity for insurers to take stronger stances on social issues that matter most to younger workers such as diversity and inclusion these candidates also want assurance they re doing purposeful work that connects to the greater good they need to feel they re making a positive difference in society rather than just earning a paycheck one study found that 64 of millennials would not accept positions at companies that lacked strong corporate social responsibility values insurance leaders should consider mentioning social values in job ads provided the business already has a history of association with those aims if younger recruits perceive that the company has only brought up specific values to attract candidates all efforts will likely backfire insurers must demonstrate relevance another strategy is for hiring managers in the sector to stay up to date with methods of connecting to potential candidates for example many millennials would perceive a firm as outdated if they received a physical postcard or flyer about a job fair or open house however using social media channels is a practical strategy that enables hiring professionals to target specific groups or areas finally people trying to fill open positions should look at the basic components that typically make work more fulfilling the ey report mentioned flexibility performance recognition and updated benefits packages as some of the options to pursue trends of note for the insurance sector these three trends are not the only areas of focus worth following this year however the helpful insights here show people in the industry what to prepare for in 2022 and beyond

menafn afp the united states and western allies sought to cripple russia s banking sector and currency saturday with an extraordinary set of sanctions punishing moscow s invasion of ukraine taking measures unprecedented against a country of russia s size and international stature the allies cut selected banks from the swift system rendering them isolated from the rest of the world they hobbled the russian central bank s ability to use reserves to support the already sinking ruble which a senior us official said will now go into freefall and they warned that a task force will hunt down the yachts jets fancy cars and luxury homes owned around the world by oligarchs in president vladimir putin s ultra wealthy inner circle the us official said the measures were backed by the united states canada the european commission britain france germany and italy in a symbolic gesture likely to resonate in moscow which has been counting on european divisions to dilute western fury over its ukraine invasion the stunning news was first delivered from europe far exceeding others imposed against russia during putin s two decades long grip on power the sanctions came as the russian military stepped up its bloody multi pronged assault against kyiv and other ukrainian cities putin says the invasion is meant to restore control over a country that was long dominated by russia but now wants to join western institutions the group of world powers said in a statement it was resolved to continue imposing costs on russia that will further isolate russia from the international financial system and our economies we stand with the ukrainian people in this dark hour even beyond the measures we are announcing today we are prepared to take further measures to hold russia to account for its attack on ukraine the statement said paralyze russian central bank earlier this week western nations imposed an initial raft of sanctions including personally against putin and his foreign minister sergei lavrov they also targeted the biggest russian banks and effectively stopped energy rich russia s prized new export pipeline for natural gas known as nord stream 2 saturday s measures now mean that russia has become a global economic and financial pariah said the senior us official who asked not to be named he noted that moscow s stock market had suffered its worst week on record and that the ruble was at a historic low against the dollar putin s government is getting kicked off the international financial system cut from swift the chosen russian banks will not be able to conduct transactions without going back in time and using a fax machine or a telephone in every single instance effectively bringing their commerce beyond russia to a halt for now the swift measure covers only part of the russian banking network but could be expanded the german government s spokesman said in a statement this is intended to cut off these institutions from international financial flows which will massively restrict their global operations the spokesman said restrictions on the russian central bank aim to prevent the government from using its massive foreign currency reserves to prop up the falling ruble russia has to be able to sell those reserves and buy rubles to support its currency but without being able to buy the ruble from western financial institutions the ruble will fall even further the us official said that means the russian central bank can t support the ruble full stop european commission chief ursula von der leyen said this will paralyze the russian central bank only putin can decide the phenomenon of wealthy russians safeguarding their fortunes in luxury assets across the west often in chic areas of europe will also come under attack the so called golden passport system to obtain european citizenship will be scrapped while a us eu task force will seek to identify and freeze hidden riches putin allies will find themselves barred from foreign luxuries including their ability to send their kids to fancy colleges in the west the us official said the western allies said in their statement that they also intend to coordinate against disinformation and other forms of hybrid warfare that putin has used in his increasingly dangerous confrontation with the west the us official said more sanctions were being considered and that all depended on russia s next moves in ukraine this is putin s war of choice the official said only putin can decide how much more cost he is willing to bear burs sms bfm
