sales growth trends might slow in the european market what happened ralph lauren rl 0 08 stock fell harder than the market on monday dropping 12 by 3 30 p m et compared to a 2 7 slump in the s p 500 that move put the stock below the broader market s 11 loss so far in 2022 investors sold off shares in response to increasing pessimism about the retailer s short term prospects due to its exposure to the european market so what an analyst at wedbush downgraded ralph lauren s stock and lowered the firm s price target to 127 per share from 150 per share the downgrade was due to the company s reliance on sales growth in europe which may weaken because of geopolitical strife to be sure ralph lauren credited its gains in europe for helping it deliver much of its overall growth in recent months sales there have expanded by over 500 million in the past three quarters and operating income has nearly tripled to 350 million the company revealed in early february growth in europe was 50 in the holiday quarter now what it is reasonable to assume that ralph lauren will be impacted by economic disruptions in europe geopolitical turbulence there might threaten the fiscal 2022 outlook that management issued in early february calling for sales to jump about 40 while operating margin improves to 13 of sales yet that s no reason to abandon the retailer s stock ralph lauren s operating momentum was impressive through late december and while the short term outlook is cloudier today the retailer should continue winning market share in premium apparel niches across its three key markets of europe asia and north america

a tweet about nuclear energy from the tesla ceo pulled investors focus toward uranium stocks what happened uranium stocks rocketed on monday with most stocks in the industry surging by double digit percentages in early morning trading these were the top performing uranium stocks as of market close monday energy fuels uuuu 3 39 uranium energy uec 1 24 denison mines dnn 2 37 these stocks have been rallying ever since russia began its invasion of ukraine in late february but many thought the bull run would come to halt after the u s nuclear power industry s lobbying to not sanction uranium exports from russia gathered steam last week that doesn t seem to be the case just yet moreover tesla ceo elon musk may deserve a bit of credit for the continued momentum pressing uranium stocks upward the other driving factor was european natural gas prices hitting levels no one saw coming so what nuclear energy is a key source of power in many nations and accounts for 20 of the electricity generated in the u s the u s though relies extensively on russia and its allies for the supply of uranium fuel to power its nuclear reactors largely because russian uranium is cheap but with its invasion of ukraine earning it steep economic sanctions power companies in the u s are now pushing the white house to continue to exempt russian uranium exports from sanctions even as the market is trying to figure out how such sanctions if imposed might affect uranium miners the world is looking with renewed interest at nuclear as a reliable source of power and musk has emerged as a strong advocate on sunday musk tweeted that nuclear is vastly better for global warming than burning hydrocarbons for energy and called for europe to restart its nuclear power stations hopefully it is now extremely obvious that europe should restart dormant nuclear power stations and increase power output of existing ones this is critical to national and international security elon musk elonmusk march 6 2022 there s some merit to that view european natural gas prices after all are hitting record highs even as i write this indeed that s a bit of an understatement european natural gas prices were range bound in the neighborhood of 15 euros to 25 euros per megawatt hour mwh for almost a decade prices touched a high of euro 345 per mwh monday morning or almost 600 per barrel of oil equivalent that s unheard of and illustrates why it s becoming imperative for europe to look toward alternative sources of energy barely three weeks ago french president emmanuel macron announced plans to build 14 new nuclear reactors with construction starting 2028 and last week germany said it s mulling moves to extend the lifespans of its existing nuclear reactors this could just be the beginning and some investors don t want to miss any opportunity they are therefore bidding up shares of any and all uranium companies regardless of whether they re currently producing any uranium or not interest in the world s largest physical uranium exchange traded fund the sprott physical uranium trust fund sruu f 2 12 is equally high sprott s inventory of physical uranium hit 50 million pounds last week as the fund purchased huge amounts of the mineral to meet demand for its units now what as russia is a major supplier of uranium to the world the ongoing conflict has unsurprisingly made the nuclear power industry nervous uranium companies on the other hand see it as a blessing in disguise given the potential rise in demand for uranium that s already reflected in the price of uranium it has jumped nearly 20 in just the past two weeks and is hovering around its 10 year highs according to tradingeconomics com while it s anyone s guess how long this rally will last investors in uranium stocks are making hay while the sun shines

alberta premier jason kenney says the united states should be seeking his province s oil instead of getting it from saudi arabia and venezuela responding to a report by axion that u s president joe biden may travel to saudi arabia in the coming months to request more oil amid the russia ukraine crisis kenney said he would be delighted to welcome the president should he decide to visit alberta we could discuss how to ship nearly 1 million barrels of day of responsibly produced energy every day from the usa s closest friend and ally he said in a tweet on march 6 the united states is the world s largest oil producer ahead of saudi arabia and russia but it s also the biggest oil consumer and it can t meet that staggering demand with domestic crude alone the united states imported 245 million barrels of oil from russia last year about 8 percent of all u s oil imports up from 198 million barrels in 2020 that s less than it gets from canada or mexico but more than it imported last year from saudi arabia russia s invasion of ukraine has sparked a price hike in gasoline in the united states on march 6 the price of gas surpassed 4 c 5 12 per gallon for the first time in nearly 14 years oil prices soared early march 7 before retreating in midday trading benchmark u s crude was up 2 percent to about 118 c 151 12 per barrel and the international price gained 4 percent to around 123 c 157 52 per barrel major u s stock indexes were down about 2 percent with calls to ban the import of russian oil and concerns that such a move would exacerbate the prices of gasoline and oil biden has been hesitant to make a decision kenney proposed a solution all it would take is approval for keystone xl easy the premier said in his tweet u s president joe biden speaks at the white house campus on march 4 2022 patrick semansky ap photo the keystone xl cross border pipeline project was held up for more than a decade by environmental opposition and regulatory hurdles in 2021 biden scrapped the project by revoking a presidential permit that had been approved by president donald trump in 2017 if keystone xl had been allowed to proceed it would have carried 830 000 barrels per day of oil from alberta to the u s midwest attempts to revive the project were made by u s house republicans who introduced the american independence from russian energy act on feb 28 a measure meant to authorize the keystone xl pipeline and boost domestic oil and gas production but the bill was defeated in a 221 202 vote on march 1 almost entirely along partisan lines responding to a report by the wall street journal that u s officials have met with venezuela officials face to face over the weekend to discuss possible oil exports to replace russia s kenney questioned the thinking behind biden s administration what is going on with us energy policy without the biden veto kxl would have added 840 000 bpd of supply to the us later this year he said in another tweet on march 6 now the us is importing 600 000 bpd from putin may replace that by lifting sanctions on oil from the iranian venezuelan dictatorships if the discussion between the united states and venezuela comes to fruition the oil sanctions imposed on caracas by the trump administration in 2019 will be eased meaning venezuelan crude oil will be back on the international market in a statement to the u s senate subcommittee on foreign relations in 2019 carrie filipetti former deputy assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs said the purpose of the oil sanctions was to eliminate funding that enabled a patronage network used to retain the regime of venezuela leader nicolás maduro the maduro regime has been described by amnesty international as a repressive government that created an unprecedented human rights crisis in venezuela the regime is determined to retain power and it needs money to do so filipetti told the senators this is a large reason why we have implemented sanctions to cut off those sources of financial income and prevent the oil industry from being exploited for patronage the associated press and reuters contributed to this report
less than two weeks into russia s war in ukraine the conflict s geopolitical ripples are heading in some unexpected directions some are even being felt by active and retired teachers through their retirement funds many public employee pensions including those covering teachers are significantly exposed to a russian financial market that has taken a drubbing in response to western sanctions this month within days of the russian invasion colorado s state pension fund removed over 7 million held in sberbank a substantially state owned russian bank legislators in massachusetts illinois and new jersey have proposed bills that would push state treasurers to liquidate russian holdings while governors and other officials in virginia ohio maryland washington state california pennsylvania and connecticut have advocated either for full scale divestment or reviews of their portfolios pension funds in canada and sweden are following suit introducing 16 under 16 in stem we are looking for 16 of the most impressive students who are 16 years of age or younger who have shown extraordinary achievement in science technology engineering and math nominate a student here in a letter to his state s three largest retirement systems california gov gavin newsom asserted that their fiduciary duties to beneficiaries demand that you act to address russia s aggressions and immediately restrict russian access to california s capital and investments advertisement advertisement the sudden push has been framed as a blow against military aggression but disentangling public funds from foreign entities in countries like russia may also pose further challenges to their short run health of already stressed retirement systems given the ruble s precipitous decline in value states must decide whether to sell off their control over assets at stupefying losses with the restrictions placed on stock trading of russian entities some investors are simply unable to act at the moment and that s without considering the logistical challenges of identifying and severing ties to foreign investments in the first place chad aldeman the policy director at georgetown university s edunomics lab said that teachers might be surprised to learn that their retirement contributions were mingled with assets overseas related aldeman teacher pensions took a beating in the great recession and passed the costs on to new employees it s probably going to happen again i would say that through their pension funds teachers are invested in far more exotic assets and investments than the typical 401 k investor aldeman said there are all kinds of different financial strategies they re pursuing and they re more aggressive about finding different types of investments like lumber or coffee or international avenues like russia advertisement advertisement the dilemma showcases some important recent development in american finance increasingly major american investors including pensions but also 401 k plans and endowments have tended to favor positions in passive funds that track stock indexes rather than paying managers to pick winners for them the switch comes in response to the high fees and disappointing performance resulting from active investments in the past such as the alabama retirement system s misbegotten outlay of 221 million in a now defunct chain of movie theaters by contrast nevada s public employee pension went fully passive a few years ago shrinking its investment office to just one man whose professed strategy was to do as little as possible a member of the ukrainian territorial defence forces looks at destruction following a shelling in kharkiv on march 7 getty images but aldeman observed that many public pensions still have considerable sums tied into such investments including those in foreign markets they re stretching to hit an investment target and to do that they re trying to find the absolute best investments out there he said advertisement advertisement moving away from that posture even in response to global condemnation of russia s actions may come at a price as a case in point the kentucky teachers retirement fund sold its own shares in sberbank in late february for 12 4 million that was over 3 million less than it cost to buy them in 2017 that figure recedes a bit in the context of a 26 billion portfolio but the system is already dramatically underfunded and such losses may contribute to the perception of mismanagement ted siedle is a pensions expert and writer who has authored investigations into retirement systems in several states including a widely circulated report in rhode island commissioned by the state teachers union in an interview he cited the example of ohio s pension fund which lost over half a billion dollars over the last decade in a deal with a texas private equity firm related ukrainian born students in the u s and those with strong ties to country struggle to balance studies with news of war that s not a whole lot for a 100 billion pension fund to lose but the people whose money it is didn t look at it that way siedle said the teachers were pissed that s money that could have gone to their cost of living adjustments and for some pensions the russian holdings could be a significant amount advertisement advertisement a key problem siedle argued is that the boards of pension plans are typically filled with laymen with insignificant financial expertise like municipal leaders and retired public employees they are also not governed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the main federal body of regulations over private pensions as a consequence the systems are viewed by wall street intermediaries like hedge funds as the dumbest investors out there he said even amid a wave of divestment from russian industry it may be difficult for teachers pension funds to distance themselves for one thing aldeman noted they could face lock up fees from their managers for canceling their investments early those might come on top of financial losses from selling assets whose market value is plummeting beyond that siedle has argued lower transparency requirements outside erisa will mean that pension funds may find it difficult to even identify where their money is invested in other words not only are teachers unaware of the scope of their exposure to the russian economy but so are the pension systems themselves there s no accountability who s even going to tell them the money manager would have to honestly tell the pension fund and then the pension fund would have to honestly tell the public the chances of that happening are slim to none related sign up for the 74 s newsletter

new york wall street had its biggest drop in more than a year monday as another leap for oil prices threatened to squeeze inflation s grip on the global economy the s p 500 fell 3 its biggest decline in 16 months after a barrel of u s oil surged to 130 overnight on the possibility the u s could bar imports from russia stocks around the world also fell earlier in the day taking their cue from oil s movements the benchmark s p 500 fell 122 78 points to 4 201 09 the dow jones industrial average fell 797 42 points or 2 4 to 32 817 38 the nasdaq composite slid 482 48 points or 3 6 to 12 830 96 the tech heavy index is now 20 1 below its record set in november such a decline means the index is now in what wall street calls a bear market the s p 500 is down a more modest 12 4 from the peak it set in early january gold and a measure of nervousness on wall street also rose though not by quite as much as when oil prices hit their peak the price of gold briefly rose above 2 000 an ounce before settling at 1 995 90 up 1 5 this could be something that drags on for a while as the tensions in ukraine persist as oil prices remain elevated said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra the higher and longer oil prices stay elevated the greater the eroding impact that they will have on economic growth oil prices have soared recently on worries that russia s invasion of ukraine will upend already tight supplies russia is one of the world s largest energy producers and oil prices were already high before the attack because the global economy is demanding more fuel following its coronavirus caused shutdown u s house speaker nancy pelosi said in a letter to her colleagues on sunday that the house is currently exploring strong legislation to further isolate russia because of its attack on ukraine that could include a ban on imports of russian oil and energy products she said it s a major step that the u s government has not yet taken despite a long list of moves to punish russia as the white house has said it hopes to limit disruptions to oil markets it wants to limit price jumps at the gasoline pump reports also said u s officials may be considering easing sanctions against venezuela that potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from russia a gallon of regular already costs an average of 4 065 across the country after breaching the 4 barrier on sunday for the first time since 2008 a month ago a gallon averaged 3 441 according to aaa a barrel of u s crude oil settled at 119 40 per barrel up 3 2 after earlier touching 130 50 brent crude the international standard settled at 123 21 per barrel up 4 3 after earlier topping 139 meanwhile smaller company stocks also fell sharply the russell 2000 index fell 49 57 points or 2 5 to 1 951 33 markets worldwide have swung wildly recently on worries about how high prices for oil wheat and other commodities produced in the region will go because of russia s invasion inflaming the world s already high inflation in the united states prices for consumers jumped last month from their year ago level at the fastest rate in four decades the conflict in ukraine also threatens the food supply in some regions including europe africa and asia which rely on the vast fertile farmlands of the black sea region known as the breadbasket of the world the war puts extra pressure on central banks around the world with the federal reserve on course to raise interest rates later this month for the first time since 2018 higher rates slow the economy which hopefully will help rein in high inflation but if the fed raises rates too high it risks forcing the economy into a recession their reaction to geopolitics can t really be measured so there s uncertainty around that said sameer samana senior global market strategist at wells fargo investment institute some investors have seen the war in ukraine as potentially pushing the fed to go easier on rate increases investors love low rates because they tend to boost prices for stocks and all kinds of markets but that may not necessarily be the case this time goldman sachs economists wrote in a report with prices for oil wheat and other commodities potentially rising even more the threat is higher for a sustained high inflation to settle on the economy that could flip the fed s traditional playbook after several decades in which economic financial or political shocks invariably caused interest rates to fall markets may have to re learn that the opposite can also be true goldman sachs economist jan hatzius wrote beyond sanctions brought on russia by governments because of its invasion of ukraine companies are also levying their own punishments the list of companies exiting russia has grown to include mastercard visa and american express as well as netflix the value of the russian ruble continued to slide amid all the financial pressure falling 12 to 0 7 cents treasury yields climbed the 10 year yield rose to 1 78 from 1 72 ap business writers damian j troise and yuri kageyama contributed veiga reported from los angeles

vienna fears mounted monday that the iran nuclear deal may become collateral damage in the ukraine war as russia pressed its demand to be exempted from u s sanctions in any future business dealings with iran negotiators had hoped to finalize an agreement to revive the 2015 nuclear deal imminently and have already allowed several presumed deadlines to slip after 11 months of talks on ways to bring the deal back to life the talks have been focused on how to bring both the united states and iran back into compliance with the joint comprehensive plan of action or jcpoa as the deal is known by rolling back sanctions imposed by the united states after it pulled out of the agreement in 2018 and the advances later made by iran in its nuclear program in response to the u s sanctions the eruption of war in ukraine has thrown up additional complications by overturning russia s relations with the western nations involved in the negotiations including the united states britain france and germany along with iran and china because the united states withdrew from the agreement the talks at the palais coburg hotel in vienna have been taking place among the remaining parties with negotiators shuttling between the talks and the u s delegation at a different hotel advertisement in a phone call with iranian foreign minister hossein amirabdollahian on monday russian foreign minister sergei lavrov reiterated that russia wants the revival of the nuclear deal to be accompanied by u s guarantees that sanctions imposed by the west in response to russia s invasion of ukraine won t apply to russian trade or investment with iran lavrov told amirabdollahian that the deal s resuscitation should ensure that all its participants have equal rights regarding the unhindered development of cooperation in all areas the russian embassy in iran said on twitter the demand first raised by lavrov at a news conference in moscow on saturday has rocked the negotiations underway in vienna this was the first time russia had given any indication that its position might have shifted and diplomats are now scrambling to assess what the new demands mean and how they might affect the chances of getting a revived deal iran seemed as stunned as any of the other countries with iranian officials complaining to iranian media that they only learned of the russian demand from news reports advertisement u s secretary of state antony blinken indicated in an interview sunday that the united states would not be prepared to bargain over the sanctions imposed on russia for the sake of the nuclear deal saying the issues are unrelated share this article share the sanctions that are being put in place and that have been put in place on russia have nothing to do with the iran nuclear deal and the prospects of getting back into that agreement he told cbs s face the nation these things are totally different and are just are not in any way linked together iran is still pushing for further concessions from the united states on issues related to economic guarantees and removing iranian entities from the u s list of designated terrorists before agreeing to resume adherence to the deal diplomats say it is still possible the negotiations could collapse regardless of any shift in russia s position a western negotiator said advertisement but diplomats now have to contend with the possibility that russia may try to upend the deal altogether or to use the talks as a bargaining chip to exact concessions from the west on sanctions related to ukraine there s a real tension between russia s long standing interest in containing the iran nuclear program and this new russia that seems willing to bring its relations with the west crashing down said henry rome an analyst with the eurasia group russia may also now have no interest in remaining in a revived deal that would benefit the united states and its western allies but would potentially damage russian interests by bringing oil prices down said karim sadjadpour a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace iran would be able to sell its oil on the open market again which could ease tight global supplies and bring prices down by as much as 10 percent advertisement considering the magnitude of the global pressure against russia it s understandable why they might try and hold the iran nuclear deal hostage to secure their own interests he said russia wants the world to feel the economic pain of an embargo against russian oil helping to get iranian oil back on the market would soften the global financial blow russia s participation in the agreement isn t essential but the original jcpoa assigns russia an important role in shipping out and storing iran s excess stocks of enriched uranium the original deal is also backed by a u n security council resolution which russia could veto if it chooses to oppose the revived deal

a tweet about nuclear energy from the tesla ceo pulled investors focus toward uranium stocks what happened uranium stocks rocketed on monday with most stocks in the industry surging by double digit percentages in early morning trading these were the top performing uranium stocks as of market close monday energy fuels uuuu 3 39 uranium energy uec 1 24 denison mines dnn 2 37 these stocks have been rallying ever since russia began its invasion of ukraine in late february but many thought the bull run would come to halt after the u s nuclear power industry s lobbying to not sanction uranium exports from russia gathered steam last week that doesn t seem to be the case just yet moreover tesla ceo elon musk may deserve a bit of credit for the continued momentum pressing uranium stocks upward the other driving factor was european natural gas prices hitting levels no one saw coming so what nuclear energy is a key source of power in many nations and accounts for 20 of the electricity generated in the u s the u s though relies extensively on russia and its allies for the supply of uranium fuel to power its nuclear reactors largely because russian uranium is cheap but with its invasion of ukraine earning it steep economic sanctions power companies in the u s are now pushing the white house to continue to exempt russian uranium exports from sanctions even as the market is trying to figure out how such sanctions if imposed might affect uranium miners the world is looking with renewed interest at nuclear as a reliable source of power and musk has emerged as a strong advocate on sunday musk tweeted that nuclear is vastly better for global warming than burning hydrocarbons for energy and called for europe to restart its nuclear power stations hopefully it is now extremely obvious that europe should restart dormant nuclear power stations and increase power output of existing ones this is critical to national and international security elon musk elonmusk march 6 2022 there s some merit to that view european natural gas prices after all are hitting record highs even as i write this indeed that s a bit of an understatement european natural gas prices were range bound in the neighborhood of 15 euros to 25 euros per megawatt hour mwh for almost a decade prices touched a high of euro 345 per mwh monday morning or almost 600 per barrel of oil equivalent that s unheard of and illustrates why it s becoming imperative for europe to look toward alternative sources of energy barely three weeks ago french president emmanuel macron announced plans to build 14 new nuclear reactors with construction starting 2028 and last week germany said it s mulling moves to extend the lifespans of its existing nuclear reactors this could just be the beginning and some investors don t want to miss any opportunity they are therefore bidding up shares of any and all uranium companies regardless of whether they re currently producing any uranium or not interest in the world s largest physical uranium exchange traded fund the sprott physical uranium trust fund sruu f 2 12 is equally high sprott s inventory of physical uranium hit 50 million pounds last week as the fund purchased huge amounts of the mineral to meet demand for its units now what as russia is a major supplier of uranium to the world the ongoing conflict has unsurprisingly made the nuclear power industry nervous uranium companies on the other hand see it as a blessing in disguise given the potential rise in demand for uranium that s already reflected in the price of uranium it has jumped nearly 20 in just the past two weeks and is hovering around its 10 year highs according to tradingeconomics com while it s anyone s guess how long this rally will last investors in uranium stocks are making hay while the sun shines

modest 12 4 percent from the peak it set in early january gold and a measure of nervousness on wall street also rose though not by quite as much as when oil prices hit their peak the price of gold briefly rose above 2 000 an ounce before settling at 1 995 90 up 1 5 percent this could be something that drags on for a while as the tensions in ukraine persist as oil prices remain elevated said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra the higher and longer oil prices stay elevated the greater the eroding impact that they will have on economic growth advertisement oil prices have soared recently on worries that russia s invasion of ukraine will upend already tight supplies russia is one of the world s largest energy producers and oil prices were already high before the attack because the global economy is demanding more fuel following its coronavirus caused shutdown u s house speaker nancy pelosi said in a letter to her colleagues on sunday that the house is currently exploring strong legislation to further isolate russia because of its attack on ukraine that could include a ban on imports of russian oil and energy products she said it s a major step that the u s government has not yet taken despite a long list of moves to punish russia as the white house has said it hopes to limit disruptions to oil markets it wants to limit price jumps at the gasoline pump reports also said u s officials may be considering easing sanctions against venezuela that potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from russia a gallon of regular gas

meanwhile smaller company stocks also fell sharply the russell 2000 index fell 49 57 points or 2 5 percent to 1 951 33 markets worldwide have swung wildly recently on worries about how high prices for oil wheat and other commodities produced in the region will go because of russia s invasion inflaming the world s already high inflation in the united states prices for consumers jumped last month from their year ago level at the fastest rate in four decades the conflict in ukraine also threatens the food supply in some regions including europe africa and asia which rely on the vast fertile farmlands of the black sea region known as the breadbasket of the world the war puts extra pressure on central banks around the world with the federal reserve on course to raise interest rates this month for the first time since 2018 higher rates slow the economy which hopefully will help rein in high inflation but if the fed raises rates too high it risks forcing the economy into a recession their reaction to geopolitics can t really be measured so there s uncertainty around that said sameer samana senior global market strategist at wells fargo investment institute some investors have seen the war in ukraine as potentially pushing the fed to go easier on rate increases investors love low rates because they tend to boost prices for stocks and all kinds of markets advertisement but that may not necessarily be the case this time goldman sachs economists wrote in a report with prices for oil wheat and other commodities potentially rising even more the threat is higher for a sustained high inflation to settle on the economy that could flip the fed s traditional playbook after several decades in which economic financial or political shocks invariably caused interest rates to fall markets may have to re learn that the opposite can also be true goldman sachs economist jan hatzius wrote beyond sanctions brought on russia by governments because of its invasion of ukraine

in 2020 the price of oil crashed even falling to less than zero one day traders actually had to pay buyers to get them to take oil contracts off their hands oil companies would prefer not to sell oil unless they can make money off it oil companies are just funny that way so u s producers curtailed production a lot u s oil production is still about 12 less than it was pre pandemic and isn t projected to get back to pre pandemic levels until next year demand for petroleum products by contrast has rebounded to pre pandemic levels investor pressure did much to stall a rebound in production and continues to do so investors prefer that the oil companies spend their money on dividends and stock buybacks instead of new field development in the meantime opec is in no rush to bail out the world russia is the world s third largest oil producer behind the u s and saudi arabia joe biden hasn t sanctioned russian oil because people are paying enough for gas already but russian oil is effectively off the market anyway because traders don t want to touch it global financial institutions are doing the heavy lifting and blanket banning anything with russia written on the documentation according to an energy analyst with the futures trading firm oanda oil production and sales evidently aren t as accurately reported as in the u s but a british firm that watches the industry estimates that nearly 70 of russian crude has no buyers combine russia s role as a key oil producer with the anxiety over its invasion of ukraine and you get traders worrying that oil supply will be further limited which in turn increases demand and the price bullish traders keep buying betting the price will go higher still which makes the price go higher now and all of that s on top of prices that had already been rising prior to putin s war for reasons noted above when republicans aren t blaming biden instead of vladimir putin for putin s war of aggression they re blaming biden for not reopening america s energy sector as nevada gop senate candidate adam laxalt put it the other day laxalt seems to spend most of his time coming up with new and painfully overwrought ways to warn of the existential threat posed by any and all non trumpism so it s hard to know how much bandwidth he has left to review energy market conditions but the republican claim that biden has crippled another laxaltism u s energy production is routinely premised on two biden administration actions canceling the keystone xl pipeline and pausing new oil and gas leasing on public lands as i ve noted before even if biden hadn t canceled the keystone xl and it had proceeded as planned it would not be delivering any oil to the u s until 2023 at the earliest there are a lot of reasons for high gas prices biden s decision on that pipeline isn t one of them and has exactly nothing to do with the price of gas today the pause on leasing only applies to new leasing and does nothing to prohibit or even limit drilling on millions of acres of public land that according to the bureau of land management is currently available for development biden isn t responsible for oil company resistance to drill investors are the main congressional republican initiative right now to alleviate pain at the pump is to push for expanded domestic energy production by reversing those two actions but neither action is hindering domestic energy production now and by the way oil flowing through the keystone xl would not be domestic but canadian if anything expands domestic energy production anytime soon it will be oil selling at checks sunday morning price 115 70 per barrel not vapid boilerplate republican talking points many and maybe most voters perhaps only slightly better informed than laxalt don t care about any of the things discussed above as far as joe jill voter are concerned gas prices are high so it must be the party in power s fault and that s that republicans know and love this just as they have no credible policy fixes for today s high prices at the pump neither do they have any policy for fighting inflation in general the only solid position the gop has on rising prices is to hope they stay high enough long enough to assure democrats lose in november the u s is the world s largest oil producer accounting for 20 of global oil production and the u s consumes about 20 of global oil production also more than any other nation the u s has about 4 of the world s population the u s doesn t have an oil production problem it has an oil consumption problem i blame michele fiore s f 150 this column was originally published in the nevada current a states newsroom sibling of the georgia recorder

washington ap president joe biden is expected to sign an executive order on cryptocurrency this week that will mark the first step toward regulating how digital currency is traded the move comes as administration officials have raised concerns in recent weeks about russia s use of cryptocurrency to evade the impact of crushing sanctions in response to its invasion of ukraine the sanctions have sent the ruble to historic lows and have closed the country s stock market two people familiar with the process said the executive order on cryptocurrency was expected to be issued this week and it had been in the works long before the war both people spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the order the order is expected to describe what government agencies including the treasury department need to do to develop policies and regulations on digital currencies it is expected to include a request for the state department to ensure that american cryptocurrency laws are aligned with those of u s allies and will ask the financial stability oversight council which monitors the stability of the u s financial system to study illicit finance concerns additionally the order will explore the possibility of a new central bank digital currency the federal reserve issued a paper on the topic in january that explores the risks and benefits of u s backed digital currency implicit in the order will be that cryptocurrency will remain a part of the u s economy for years to come the white house s plans to move forward with the executive order were first reported by bloomberg news while u s officials have played down the significance of cryptocurrency to russia s ability to evade sanctions it remains a concern we will continue to look at how the sanctions work and evaluate whether or not there are liquid leakages and we have the possibility to address them i often hear cryptocurrency mentioned and that is a channel to be watched treasury secretary janet yellen said last week a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the president s national security team has already been on the lookout for the use and creation of front companies and alternative financial institutions that moscow might try to employ to get around sanctions crypto is one of several spaces that the biden administration is looking to shore up as it tries to make certain that sanctions on russia have maximum impact the official said past experiences in iran and venezuela with sanctions evasion are informing the administration s efforts additional export controls and new sanction targets are also expected to be unveiled in the days and weeks ahead to counter russian sanction evasion efforts the official said on monday treasury s financial crimes enforcement network issued an alert advising financial institutions to be vigilant against any efforts to evade sanctions in connection with russia s war in ukraine although we have not seen widespread evasion of our sanctions using methods such as cryptocurrency prompt reporting of suspicious activity contributes to our national security and our efforts to support ukraine and its people acting director him das said in a statement

editors note data for the report was gathered prior to the russian invasion of ukraine although the global economy remains firmly on track to expand in 2022 a number of challenges are poised to serve as obstacles for the construction equipment industry according to the association of equipment manufacturers aem according to the latest business intelligence data from aem the global economy expanded by 5 1 percent in 2021 although growth for 2022 is projected to be about 3 9 percent slower growth seems like a foregone conclusion short term factors such as the lingering covid pandemic ongoing supply chain issues and persistent labor shortages as well as long term factors such as deglobalization and inflation have emerged to dampen enthusiasm a bit the last recession we experienced ended the longest period of economic expansion in the united states and that recession lasted from february 2020 to april 2020 said benjamin duyck director of market intelligence two months in traditional economic terms can t even be accurately described as a recession however this economic disruption has impacted us all greatly and we are still dealing with the aftereffects today labor shortages supply chain problems and higher interest rates recent volatility in the stock market has done little to quell concerns according to aem although the stock market is up 20 percent when compared to a year ago and 30 percent from two years ago just prior to the onset of the pandemic aem has surveyed its members quarterly for nearly two years regarding how quickly they expect to recover to pre covid levels for some time the responses had been generally quite positive according to duyck but the data for this last quarter is moving again in the other direction largely due to the headwinds we re facing with inflation workforce issues and supply chain disruptions he said inflation on construction equipment has been rising gradually with a 9 7 percent increase in the last quarter labor is also a significant factor for future growth according to aem in its most recent quarterly member survey 84 percent of respondents have experienced issues in this particular area supply chain issue are also continuing challenges more than 95 percent of aem members that responded said they are experiencing supply chain issues however it appears either demand is beginning to normalize or supply chain signaling is improving because 44 percent of respondents noted the issues are beginning to turn around for the vast majority of these people issues are both domestic and global said duyck the issues are also widespread but consensus opinion among members is that the issues lie particularly with prices shipping and quantities of raw materials and subsequently inputs and components in addition the issues do not necessarily lie at the endpoint or receiving shipping but rather at the supplier source and especially international shipping ultimately the imbalance between supply and demand and covid 19 restrictions eliminated all the inventory and the grease that allows the global supply clock to operate he said another metaphor that maybe hits closer to our industries is this we re running a machine that s low on oil and almost out of it the machine will continue to run and maybe even run for a while until it doesn t construction equipment market outlook construction industry value is expected to grow 4 5 percent this year largely driven by residential aem member perceptions show strong demand 83 percent see year over year growth ahead and it s reasonable to expect growth of 6 percent to 10 percent over the next 12 months on the heels of 6 percent to 10 percent stronger growth than was expected in 2021 infrastructure spending is set to gain significant momentum in the coming years uncertainty related to the covid 19 pandemic high material costs and monetary policy all remain concerns source aem

consultations will continue on ways to negotiate an end to hostilities previous efforts to set up safe passage for civilians over the weekend fell apart amid continued shelling but the russian defense ministry announced a new push monday saying civilians would be allowed to leave the capital of kyiv mariupol and the cities of kharkiv and sumy hours after the talks russia announced a limited ceasefire that would happen on tuesday morning and the opening of safe corridors for civilians to evacuate the war torn country a significant move that s likely to be met with skepticism after similar efforts failed ukraine has yet to agree to the proposal the proposal made monday by russia s u n ambassador vassily nebenzia during the u n security council meeting on the humanitarian crisis in ukraine included that fleeing ukrainians would not have to flee to russia or or its ally belarus a key issue ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy called just cynicism and a propaganda effort in the country s favor this proposal doesn t have any demands about the citizens being sent necessarily to russia into russian territory nebenzia said there s also evacuation offered towards ukrainian cities to the west of kyiv and ultimately it will be the choice of the people themselves where they want to be evacuated to the announcement came hours after a third round of talks between the two countries

identified him as 45 year old maj gen vitaly gerasimov and said he had fought with russian forces in syria and chechnya and had taken part in the seizure of crimea in 2014 according to the intelligence agency he was killed around kharkiv ukraine s second largest city it was not possible to confirm the death independently russia has not commented it s a rare occurrence for such a senior

u n s nuclear watchdog another facility damaged by shelling the u n nuclear watchdog said ukraine has informed it that a new research facility producing radioisotopes for medical and industrial uses has been damaged by shelling in kharkiv the international atomic energy agency said the ukrainian regulator told it that sunday s incident didn t cause any increase in radiation levels at the site it said the nuclear material at the facility is always subcritical and there is a very low stock of it so the iaea s assessment is that the reported damage would have no radiological consequence however it adds to a string of concerns the vienna based iaea has over nuclear facilities and material in ukraine last week russian shelling started a fire at europe s largest nuclear plant in ukraine causing worldwide fears of another emergency like the 1986 chernobyl accident the world s worst nuclear disaster since russian forces took the plant the iaea said the ukrainian regulator has informed it that

express news 13th check from legislature means smaller monthly payments last year gov greg abbott signed into law a bill that distributed a 13th benefit check for trs recipients many of whom are teachers but who can also be administrators janitors or anyone who worked in texas schools it cost the state about 700 million advertisement article continues below this ad the 13th check confused many retirees when it was distributed in mid january as their regular check came in that same month less than they expected the extra check had pushed their january income into a different tax bracket resulting in a lower payout although trs sent out several letters and published an online faq attempting to explain the decrease many were still confused and alarmed thinking the lesser monthly payout would stay that way going forward the tax difference made the january check 100 to 200 less than usual several retirees said then when their february checks came they remained marginally lower than in 2021 because of adjustments to federal tax tables made by the irs a spokesman for trs declined to provide an average amount or example of how monthly payments were affected by 2022 irs updates saying it s hard to generalize as each person s tax situation is unique norma maldonado center chats with a friend during the san antonio area retired teachers association member meeting held at san antonio garden center in san antonio texas wednesday feb 16 2022 sam owens staff photographer san antonio express news that is all part of the ongoing degradation of retirement benefits over time said tim lee president of the texas retired teachers association if we were just in a vacuum where we didn t have rising costs of living and it was just a question of income tax raises or federal tax changes most retirees would be relatively neutral with a decreasing amount over time because the feds want a little more advertisement article continues below this ad the legislature in 2021 and 2019 considered a permanent cost of living adjustment which retired teachers have called for but both times instead opted for one time payouts during a house committee hearing last year on a bill for the 13th check rep greg bonnen chair of the appropriations committee said it would be better for the legislature to consider a permanent adjustment in benefits in 2023 when the teachers pension fund has more time to grow and demonstrate its financial stability to the legislature the fund has about 204 billion and its current assets cover about 77 percent of the benefits it has promised to pay over time the national average for the funded ratio of pension funds is 80 percent if for some reason trs funds were to fall short of what is owed state taxpayers would ultimately be on the hook for the money lee said he expects a cost of living adjustment to be taken up next year it will be more than just a serious conversation i think it s going to be a desperate conversation that our members are going to have with elected officials the next time we roll into session the trs fund sets a benchmark of a 7 25 percent return year over year while for the last 10 it has averaged 9 12 percent in 2021 the fund saw a massive rate of return because of a surging economy and stock market although markets have struggled so far this year our belief is the markets are hard to predict and you don t know what the future holds and we are concerned about that lee said the worry that we have as an association between now and the time the next legislative session rolls around is what if the markets have a serious correction what if we see another situation where a major recession occurs and will that have a demonstrative impact on the legislature s willingness to have that conversation and it s possible

nerdwallet data writer liz renter who is here to join us for the conversation welcome back to the podcast liz advertisement article continues below this ad liz renter hey thanks for having me again sean and liz sean it s great to talk with you and i will admit when i first saw this article i was kind of skeptical as a homeowner why would i want to sell my house so given how nuts the market is right now why would someone want to wade into the market again liz renter you re absolutely right and i think everyone knows how crazy it is to buy a home right now but the very things that make it such a tough time to buy make it a really incredible time to sell i m going to go out on a limb and say probably many people would find that if they really weighed the pros and cons of selling their current home and buying another they would probably find that the benefits of selling right now could outweigh the risks of buying or the stress of buying and particularly if they prepare well enough in advance for the potential obstacles in buying selling now is really going to make it worthwhile sean sell me on why that might be i need some reasons here advertisement article continues below this ad liz renter yeah sure i mean there s a shortage of homes on the market right and demand is huge people still want to buy houses that lack of supply high demand is driving prices up sale prices are the highest they ve been in quite some time and we also know that seller satisfaction is up we know that people walking away from selling their homes are more satisfied with how the whole process is panning out because they re having to give up less throughout the transaction liz weston that really stood out to me too that because it s a seller s market you re not going to have buyers throwing up all kinds of obstacles and making all sorts of demands you can just sell it get your money and go liz renter the ball is in the seller s court right now so they have a ton of power sean yeah i guess my hangup is once you get your money and go where are you going to go advertisement article continues below this ad liz weston there yes sean because then you re a buyer again and you have to compete with so many other people so that s what my hangup is in particular liz renter yeah you re not alone sean we found in our annual home buyer report that 89 of people who want to list their home right now say there s something standing in their way and most of those people cite obstacles related to reentering the market as a buyer so a lot of people that are holding off on selling right now are absolutely scared of buying again sean i talk with my partner all the time about what would we do potentially if we each sold our houses and bought a new one and we realize that we probably wouldn t be able to get that much more than each of us currently has house wise because houses have gotten so much more expensive in the pacific northwest advertisement article continues below this ad liz renter that s a really important callout i mean in order to really make the most of this market as a seller it s going to depend on what your next steps are where are you going next look if you want to sell your house and not be a homeowner you re in a great position sean right liz weston like if you want to go back to renting liz renter yeah you re going to move in with someone you re going to go live with your parents you re going to go live with your partner whatever the case may be if you re going from homeowner to renter or another situation i mean you only stand to benefit right now but yeah if you re selling in order to buy again there are going to be challenges advertisement article continues below this ad sean i think a lot of people can see selling your house and then going back to being a renter as a step backwards but i think it can really also be a reflection of shifting priorities there s nothing wrong with being a renter gives you a lot of freedom liz renter yeah absolutely and we find year after year when we run these surveys is that a certain portion of people who purchase a home regret it for one reason or another a lot of times they underestimate the amount of work and the costs involved in home ownership and so for some people it s not the right solution and renting is better for their life circumstances and there certainly shouldn t be any shame in that sean mm hmm affirmative liz weston but there are also situations like yours where you went to an area that wasn t as competitive and having more money right now from selling a house could be hugely helpful if you do something like that advertisement article continues below this ad liz renter i said earlier depending on how prepared you are when you go into this market as a seller is going to sort of allow you to lay the groundwork to make the buying experience easier you re right liz i went from living in the raleigh north carolina metro area to rural kansas i went from a very competitive market to not so much liz weston they were glad to see you coming liz renter yeah exactly selling for me was kind of a no brainer when i was coming here because buying here is not going to be a challenge but not everybody has to go to that extreme you can move from a very hot neighborhood to one that s a little less competitive and really reap the benefits of the sale in that scenario you don t have to move halfway across the country to farmland if you don t want to sean yeah advertisement article continues below this ad liz weston well and i was thinking of another scenario that affects people who are older which is a lot of people are thinking about downsizing someday moving to a retirement community someday and maybe it s time to consider doing it now because if you have that big family home that everybody wants and you want a smaller home to take care of even if you re in the same market you ll probably have less competition when you buy but you ll get plenty of offers when you sell liz renter you know liz that point so some generational effects that we ve been seeing on the number of homes on the market even before the pandemic baby boomers are more comfortable aging in place than older generations before them so they re less likely to come up off of the house that they re in as early as other generations would have that paired with millennials being at prime home buying age means that there s just fewer homes available and that s something that we were seeing before the pandemic and then you add covid to that and the apprehensions of selling during a pandemic what was a slight housing shortage beforehand has really gone far to sink inventory incredibly sean yeah liz weston that s really interesting advertisement article continues below this ad sean the housing inventory is pretty nuts right now one thing that stood out to me in your article is that nearly 26 million americans said that they plan to buy a house this year according to nerdwallet s 2022 home buyer report but only 5 to 6 million houses are sold in a year typically so the math doesn t really work out for a lot of would be buyers liz renter we run this survey every year i ve been writing it for the past four years and every single time there is just this unrealistic number of people who say they re going to purchase a home in the next year and that was before covid and now and i don t want to tell people that their dreams are going to be dashed but you re right the math doesn t work out 26 million americans are not going to buy homes this year it s just simply not in the cards i think part of that optimism has to do with when we ask the questions so we field this survey at the end of december to talk about the coming year and think of your mindset at the end of december you re thinking about oh my gosh this next year is going to be my year i m going to accomplish this list of goals 1 through 10 and everything s going to go my way so i think that has something to do with the optimism but then too within that 26 million americans who say they re going to purchase this year are people that put off their home buying plans maybe last year or the year before because of the pandemic maybe their income was volatile over the past few years and so some of them will be successful this year millions of people will buy homes this year so i think it s those that are braced for the challenge that will be successful advertisement article continues below this ad sean liz one of the biggest appeals to selling your house right now as you ve mentioned is profit how much money are we talking about liz renter so there s a lot that goes into how much money you can make off your house the type of house that you re in the location that you re in for sure but what we can say is that sale prices are up close to 30 compared to a couple years ago so you re going to be able to sell it for more normally we would say the profit that you make is essentially your sale price minus the balance on your current mortgage and any cost associated with selling your house but what we know is that the costs associated with selling your house are extremely low right now so last year fewer than 1 in 10 sellers contributed to closing costs you re also less likely to have to do repairs on your home in order to put it on the market so really then what it boils down to for a lot of people is just the sales price minus the balance on your current mortgage and because we know sale prices are up 30 on average your potential profit is up 30 on average sean right advertisement article continues below this ad liz weston anecdotally i ve heard from several people whose real estate agents basically said vacuum the carpet that s all you have to do you don t have to do all the repairs the house is going to sell no matter what liz renter right sean oh man interesting so houses are also moving really quickly right now liz renter it s all happening very fast in 2021 homes were typically on the market for less than a week advertisement article continues below this ad sean wow liz renter that s compared to i know right that s compared to three weeks just a couple years ago and as many as 11 weeks 10 years ago so one of the things that i would caution to people that are thinking about selling is to get all of your ducks in a row have a plan of action and maybe start implementing that plan before you list your house because this isn t a market where you can list your house and then dilly dally while you wait on the offers to roll in more than likely you re going to be under contract in a matter of a week or two sean folks can put in a term in that contract saying you can get this house when i have a new house which might take a little bit of time i imagine liz renter that s a very good point if you re not certain about whether you want to take the risk of selling right now an agent can help you build things into the contract that are going to sort of buffer those risks like you said you can make the sale of your current home contingent on finding a new house and getting under contract also because you have the power in this market you have some flexibility on choosing the closing date less common but also an option is renting back the home after the sale closes and so the way that works is you make an agreement with the buyer of your home that you re going to stay in it for two weeks or four weeks after closing and essentially rent it from the new owner for those few weeks to allow you some additional time advertisement article continues below this ad sean so if someone is on the fence about selling their house how can they decide whether it s right for them liz renter i think the biggest question you have to ask yourself when deciding if it s right for you is what is your plan afterwards if it s not to buy like we said earlier well then great yes you should probably sell right now but if you are going to buy figure out where you want to be and how competitive it is there will you get out ahead when you sell what are homes selling for in your area so a lot of these questions a lot of this planning is going to be made a lot easier with having an agent on your side to help you with both the selling process and the buying process because while those are two transactions they can help you connect the dots and time everything well and not to mention even when you re in the decision making process they re going to know how competitive the market is where you live versus where you re going which really is going to be the crux of the decision that you make sean liz well thank you so much for talking with us advertisement article continues below this ad liz renter absolutely it s always a fun time to be here and chat with you guys sean yeah all right and now let s pivot to our no spend month check in this is the final check in of the no spend month where for the past month or so liz and i have been trying to not spend money on things that we do not need with the goal of shifting up our spending habits and hopefully saving some money and liz how s it going liz well honestly it was the least successful no spend month i ve ever done just because there were so many unanticipated things that happened so i did not save a ton of money compared to a normal month however i did wind up fixing some stuff that i might have just replaced otherwise we had two space heaters for example that weren t working and normally in the course of things i would take them to hazardous waste and pick up new ones and not think twice about it but i did take a little time looked on google figured out how to fix them they just needed to be cleaned literally they just needed to have a vacuum go over them and they worked fine sean that s kind of incredible advertisement article continues below this ad liz it is and it kind of made me feel bad that i ve thrown these things away before so sean yeah well it speaks to how we are used to consuming and discarding things as americans in particular oh it s not working right today probably broken chuck it get a new one but you can just dust it off and it s working fine liz well you also can find out what products have a reputation for lasting longer so that s another goal of mine is to make sure that the things i m buying have a little longevity in them so that i m not constantly replacing and throwing things into the landfill and the other thing i did was i took care of a bunch of returns that s another thing i tend to let things sit until it s too late and this time i just did it basically in one long errand running day i got everything back where it should be so advertisement article continues below this ad sean nice just knock it all out liz that part i feel really good about how did it go for you sean sean i think it went pretty well wrapping up this month i m proud of the way that i didn t spend money on things that i typically would and the way that i ve been reevaluating my spending habits in general i did have a couple unexpected expenses and allowances that i gave myself and i ll start with those before i go into my saving so with the expenses it was one of my best friend s birthdays last week and another friend of mine banded together and booked the birthday girl a dolly parton singing telegram which was some money but 100 worth it it was so fun and the video of it was incredible i also bought myself this nice backpack that i ve had my eye on as a little treat for my recent promotion so i was treating myself there advertisement article continues below this ad liz congratulations sean thank you liz yes sean thank you been working hard for that that was something where i typically wouldn t be spending money on this but i wanted to seize the moment and really appreciate all the work that i ve been putting into this podcast and everything else in nerdwallet and reward myself so even though it s the no spend month i still purchased that which i feel ok about i ve also continued to say no to my ebay purchases i got a bunch of emails from sellers offering me discounts on things that were in my watch list and i said no to all of them advertisement article continues below this ad liz oh very good sean and that saved me a couple hundred dollars if i was to have purchased those things in total over the no spend month i saved around 500 liz nice sean which is a lot more than i was expecting and it makes me kind of scared about the fact that i maybe would have spent that money otherwise it s a good chunk of change i was worried that i would be itching to buy stuff as the no spend month wrapped up and i really haven t so i think that that shows the effect of shifting up the spending habits i m no longer just turning to my phone to scroll through ebay if i m bored i am planning on keeping the shopping apps off my phone for the time being and continuing this dialogue with myself about what i truly want to spend my money on and why advertisement article continues below this ad liz oh that s wonderful see to me those are huge successes when you ve really figure out how are you using money when you re spending when you don t need to that s the benefit of doing one of these no spend months sean and i m taking all the money that i didn t spend putting that into my fun money savings account and using that on my upcoming travel so that way i have money to spend on totally discretionary things and i won t feel guilty about it liz good for you i love that sean thank you well one more note before we get into this episode s money question segment we are diving into student loan debt for a new podcast series and we want to hear from you our listeners we want to know if you

it did for you and your finances you can leave us a voicemail on the nerd hotline at 901 730 6373 or email a recorded voice memo to podcast nerdwallet com now we can get into this episode s money question segment advertisement article continues below this ad liz all right sean this episode s money question comes from a listener s voicemail here it is listener hi this is danny in fort worth texas i was curious about fees paid on investments like mutual funds and etfs things like expense ratio commissions et cetera how do they work and how closely should an average investor be watching the fees on their 401 k s taxable brokerage accounts or other investment vehicles thanks so much liz to help us answer danny s question on this episode of the podcast we re joined by investing nerd alana benson welcome back to the podcast alana advertisement article continues below this ad alana hey guys sean hey before i throw a bunch of questions at you alana we have to get one thing out of the way a brief disclaimer and that is that we are not investment advisors and will not tell you what to do with your money all that we are about to discuss is for educational purposes so ok with that done alana our listener danny is primarily concerned with something called brokerage fees both trade commissions and expense ratios are forms of brokerage fees but there are others too can you start off by explaining what brokerage fees are at a high level alana so brokerage fees can be a lot of things they re essentially fees that are charged by your brokerage and other investment companies for everything from making a stock trade to closing your account and there are even fees for premium research tools or investing data but the important thing is that some of these fees you can avoid and some you just can t liz let s break down the different fees paid on an investment accounts advertisement article continues below this ad alana ok so trade commissions this is about how much it costs every time that you make a trade if you bought a stock they might charge you a little bit for that trade many brokerages have actually dropped these to zero but you should always check with your individual broker to see how much a trade will actually cost you because they can really vary sean and the trend of brokerages dropping fees to zero isn t that a result of the rise of sort of gamification of trading through apps like robinhood alana that was definitely a factor but this happened a couple of years ago now so if you re finding a brokerage that is going to charge you for every single trade that you make it s definitely worth shopping around because there are a lot more now that charge zero dollars per trade sean and what about expense ratios advertisement article continues below this ad alana expense ratios these are what are charged on funds like mutual funds or exchange traded funds and this is the cost of what it actually takes to manage the fund think of index funds these are passively managed and they just track an index like the s p 500 so it doesn t actually cost that much to manage them and it can vary but around 0 1 to 0 2 is a pretty good deal so that would be about 10 or 20 for every 10 000 that you invest but if you have a mutual fund that s actively managed and that means someone is picking and choosing the investments within the fund so it s a much more expensive fund to manage than a passively managed fund and these can run closer to 0 5 or even over 1 and that means instead of paying 10 or 20 for each 10 000 that you have invested you re paying like 100 or more liz ooh that s a big difference now our listener is also wondering about 401 k fees how should they think about those alana the investments that are available to you in your 401 k may be more restricted than just buying different investments from a brokerage but just because you may not be able to do as much about your 401 k fees doesn t mean that you should not invest in one particularly if your employer offers a match liz if you work for a company a larger company you may have access to institutional funds through your 401 k and those are the cheapest ones you can get so the idea that all 401 k s are expensive really isn t the case the fees have come down and in some cases you can do better in a 401 k than you could in your own ira when it comes to expenses advertisement article continues below this ad sean i have a quick follow up question around index funds and mutual funds is there a max fee that you think people should look for and say ok this fee is too high for this account and i m not going to go for that alana i think that really just depends on each individual investor and what s important to you and what you want to get out of the fund personally when i look for funds and again i am not a financial advisor but i try to find the cheapest management fees that i possibly can so i ll look for an index fund that will have a really really low fee but if you want something that s managed by professionals or you re looking for a particular type of fund there s different reasons why people might pay a higher fee if you re looking at a mutual fund and it wants you to pay 1 that s a pretty significant fee sean i could see some people thinking ok the fee is higher that must mean i m going to get a greater return or the results will be better for me and that may not be the case right alana and in fact a lot of times actively managed investments like those actively managed mutual funds don t perform as well as passively managed funds because it requires people to sort of predict the market which people no matter how much experience they have into the industry or whatever their background is people are just notoriously bad at predicting the market and so the likelihood that your actively managed fund will outperform the market is actually really low so you re kind of paying more to underperform in a lot of cases advertisement article continues below this ad sean doesn t sound like a good deal alana to each their own but i m inclined to agree with you sean sean ok liz well maybe we should give people an example of how much fees can cut into earnings there s so much that you can t control with investing you can t control the market but the thing you can control is how much you invest and what you pay in terms of expenses so can you talk about how fees cut into earnings advertisement article continues below this ad alana absolutely say you invested that 10 000 into a fund with a 0 1 fee and you matched the average market returns you d have nearly 210 000 after 40 years but if you had a 1 fee you d have just 150 000 so that s a pretty significant difference just from a fee that you don t actually have to be paying sean that leads me to my next question which is how much should folks be worrying about their fees and it seems like the answer is maybe a lot a decent amount at least alana yeah and like liz said this is something that people actually have some control over when it comes to investing and there s not a lot of things that you do have control over so you should definitely look into your fees but i don t think this is something that you should be super stressed about once you know what fees your brokerage charges you can kind of adjust your plan so if your brokerage charges a trading commission maybe keep that in mind if you re regularly trading stocks and you can also check out the expense ratios of funds that you re invested in and see how much you re paying and maybe explore cheaper options if the fees are pretty significant sean is there any room for negotiation say you ve been with a brokerage for a while you find another one that has lower fees and you call up the brokerage that you ve been with and say hey there s someone else over here that has lower fees if you lower yours i won t jump is that possible advertisement article continues below this ad liz a lot of it is baked in terms of what they re going to charge you for trading commissions if they re charging those and what the expense ratios are of the underlying investments but if you are paying someone to manage your money for you if you re paying a financial advisor a 1 of assets fee for example or you re paying some kind of brokerage wrap fee there may be some room so you can let them know that you re looking around and you think it s a little expensive what they re charging and maybe you can get a break one thing we should talk about is robo advisors because that s another way to get access to some pretty cheap investment accounts alana i love the idea of a robo advisor particularly for the folks who otherwise just would be too stressed out or not have enough time or get a little intimidated by the research that they should do to start investing on their own and a robo advisor is great because like you said the fees are pretty minimal for the service that you get and you just don t even have to think about it you don t have to know any of the lingo all you have to do is set up an auto deposit and kind of forget about it sean well speaking of lingo we should probably define what a robo advisor is for those who don t know these are services that use computer algorithms to build and manage a portfolio for you alana and when you invest through a robo advisor you re paying for them to manage those investments for you so those fees will typically float around 0 25 of your assets so if you have 10 000 managed you ll pay 25 but remember they re doing all of that work for you so that s not just an expense ratio that you re paying you re actually paying for a service advertisement article continues below this ad sean some brokerages will charge you for things like inactivity fees and robo advisors don t tend to do that is that correct alana that s correct because essentially a robo advisor will be doing the managing for you so it s kind of tough to have an inactive account with a robo advisor particularly if you have auto deposits there could be robos out there that do charge for that so these fees will vary by broker or robo advisor so it s always really important to look into what fees you d be charged before committing to one sean and one thing i m betting our listener and a lot of other listeners out there are wondering is how they can reduce the fees that they re paying on investment accounts alana the first and most important thing is to just know what you re going to be charged expense ratios may not actually show up on your monthly statement they ll likely just be deducted so it s good to know what kind of expense ratios whether you re working with a robo advisor or you re buying investments on your own what those fees are going to look like for expense ratios advertisement article continues below this ad but the other thing is is that you can always look at a brokerage or robo advisor s fee sheet this ll give you a whole list of every possible fee that they could charge you so things like those closing or inactivity fees that s where they ll be listed so definitely do your research ahead of time and just make sure you know what you ll be charged the second thing to do is look at your investment fees that you re already being charged so if you re in an actively managed mutual fund you can kind of consider some of those lower cost investments like index funds look at the price point difference and see what you re comfortable paying sean this is also a good reminder for folks to shop around when they re looking for various investment accounts when people are considering one account or another how do you think fees should factor in alana fees are pretty important because they do eat into your bottom line but they are just one factor alongside performance and sector if you wanted to invest in a particular fund like emergent technologies that kind of fund because it s so particular might be a little more expensive you can look at the existing diversification in your portfolio you can also look at what kind of tools and research that brokerage has because some are better than others and if you really want to get into the nitty gritty of your investments that might be something you re willing to pay a little bit more for so just remember that fees are important but it can be balanced with other things advertisement article continues below this ad sean all right alana i think that covers this pretty thoroughly do you have any final thoughts for our listener alana i think it s just really important for investors to remember that they are in control they have the choice to make about what kind of investments matter to them and some will charge more than others but at the end of the day it s their choice so they should remember that they have the power if they re getting charged a really high fee they don t just have to pay that they can look around and find other options sean great well thank you so much for talking with us alana yeah thanks for having me advertisement article continues below this ad sean and with that let s get on to our takeaway tips liz do you want to kick us off liz it would be my pleasure first know what the fees are they go by many names but make sure you understand their underlying structure sean next up understand what fees you are being charged different accounts have different fees and charges liz examine your investments and look for cheaper options if the fees you re being charged are higher than you d like advertisement article

the treasurer of a pro trump political action committee that ran afoul of campaign finance laws almost immediately after it was formed has been charged with running an international ponzi scheme in which he allegedly duped investors out of nearly 7 million that he used to fund his own opulent lifestyle including vacations luxury vehicles and a down payment on a million dollar home david w schamens a 64 year old north carolina resident who in 1996 was barred from the securities industry by the sec over allegations of fraud is now accused of securities fraud along with wire fraud and money laundering according to a criminal complaint unsealed monday in new jersey federal court schamens the feds claim carried out a years long scam with victims in at least three u s states and as far away as australia but schamens who heads a new jersey based firm that develops and sells stock trading software bizarrely claims the charges are a product of a political vendetta being carried out for his support of trump whom he now derides for breaking his campaign promise to build a wall along the u s border with mexico this is thermonuclear war now schamens told the daily beast of the government s decision to bring charges against him it s made up i believe 5 000 subpoenas have been sent out in the last year have they not i believe there s a statement by merrick garland that said they re going after anybody who supported january 6th whether they were there or not i wasn t there but that s the point it doesn t matter if you were there the jan 6 committee and others have in fact issued some 5 000 subpoenas and search warrants related to the capitol riot garland in a jan 5 speech said he would hold all jan 6 perpetrators at any level accountable under law whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy in response to calls for donald trump to face accountability for his alleged role in inciting the siege but not for those who simply agreed with the rioters schamens pac called america comes first was formed in 2016 and supported then presidential candidate donald trump s hardline policies in one tv ad the organization parroted trump s false claims about hillary clinton s emails insisting that the former secretary of state considered national security a joke trump takes it seriously the ad said some six years before the national archives discovered classified material had been taken from the white house to trump s mar a lago resort in florida the scam allegedly perpetrated by schamens began back in 2014 and lasted until june 2021 prosecutors allege in their complaint saying investors were promised returns ranging from 12 percent to 30 percent annually in reality however schamens was running a ponzi scheme and stealing the victim investors funds the filing states at least 25 people lost vast sums to schamens alleged fraud which used fabricated monthly account statements that falsely represented gains associated with their investments and bogus explanations for delayed and or incomplete dividend payments and or redemptions according to the feds schamens sold his investment opportunity as a sure bet prosecutors say his companies would loan money to day traders in need of capital executing transactions on tradestream a platform run by schamens the profits would come from fees tradestream imposed on the day traders regardless of whether their trades made money or not the investors some of whom sank portions of their retirement accounts into the venture were told in 2018 a number of schamens clients began to demand their money back the complaint states schamens returned some funds in part by using incoming funds from other investors in the manner of a ponzi scheme it explains yet not everyone was so lucky as schamens has strung along the victim investors through misrepresentations and false promises to date investigators say they have identified at least four investors who lost a combined total of 3 35 million in the tradestream offering the following year prosecutors say schamens began to solicit investment in what he called the algo fund describing it in presentations as a proprietary algorithmic trading fund managed by tradestream investors were told that the fund would use state of the art servers located in the same data center as the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq according to the complaint but as with tradestream schamens provided his algo fund clients with fake records regarding the health of investments the complaint states investigators say they have so far identified at least 25 victims who lost a collective 3 45 million by investing in the algo fund the feds say they followed the money tracking investor funds that flowed into schamens corporate bank accounts quickly passing through accounts in the names of law firms that were not involved with the investments then getting steered into accounts in the names of companies controlled by schamens and ultimately into schamens personal bank accounts the funds were used largely for personal expenses the complaint says when one alleged victim became skeptical of schamens he tried to liquidate his 2 9 million investment schamens returned 300 000 to the unnamed investor all of which had been sourced from other victim investors according to the complaint realizing the rest of his money was not forthcoming victim 1 demanded explanations for the delays in receiving redemption payments the complaint continues schamens consistently made excuses for the delays and continued to falsely assure victim 1 that wire transfers had been sent or were pending the balance of the account 2 6 million worth never appeared the feds say schamens used an identical script on the others insisting that everything was above board in messages calculated to lull into a false sense of security according to the complaint in 2020 schamens began hawking a new investment opportunity claiming to be tired of dealing with the traders propping up one of his other funds schamens told prospective customers that he wanted to transition into the health savings plan market companies that offered their employees health savings accounts would invest that money in the algo fund which schamens said would increase the value of those health savings accounts as well as generate returns for the algo fund s investors but once again investors lost faith and began to ask for their money back the feds say schamens often cited issues such as inclement weather travel and illness as reasons for the frequent delays in releasing their funds states the complaint on may 29 2021 victim 4 sent an email to schamens with the subject line wits end it explains david we just don t know what to do to get our funds from you the message began according to the complaint this journey began last october i have as you know a long string of emails from you promising the end of the week or by next week r even the wiring center is in dallas and is shut down because of the freeze could you please tell me when you are actually going to distribute the funds eventually schamens used money invested by other clients to return 150 000 to the unhappy customer the other 360 000 they invested was allegedly never seen again in all investigators say schamens made off with at least 6 8 million in illicit funds schamens is no stranger to being under the microscope of federal investigators in 2016 america comes first found itself in hot water after neglecting to disclose the names of its donors before election day and exceeded campaign contribution limits according to a propublica investigation basically they re not obeying any campaign finance law whatsoever one lawyer told the news outlet two days after the election america comes first posted a now deleted photo on facebook that showed schamens meeting with president elect trump in a rambling phone interview with the daily beast on monday schamens claimed to have testified against hillary clinton in a secret grand jury in 1997 purporting to have evidence of millions of dollars in illegal campaign contributions out of china so you can draw your conclusions from that that s where this all started said schamens with that bitch hillary clinton i had my computer seized i had all my information seized my daughter and my wife had automatic weapons pointed at them when they took it at 6 o clock in the morning on august 31st insisting that the allegations in the affidavit used to obtain the search warrant for his home were 100 percent false schamens promised to provide evidence later i won t get into it now i don t have time he said but i ll tell you something i m not happy i m tired of living in this country and being attacked if you re on the wrong side of the political spectrum if you re not with the right group they will come after you in this country politics has now been criminalized that s what s going on here schamens further said he shared an unspecified piece of evidence with trump about clinton claiming that trump promised don t worry dave we ll get her however he said the bloom is now off the rose for him with regards to trump he promised to build a wall said schamens never happened schamens who is facing a maximum of 20 years in prison on the wire fraud charge 25 years on the securities fraud charge and 20 years on the money laundering charge will appear in newark federal court on tuesday they re trying to ruin our company is what they re trying to do he said they stole our code i am almost certain they ve denied it but our servers were stolen in 2021 from a military style security data center when this investigation started they were all stolen still he concluded all i need is an honest judge and a good jury not one that hates everyone on wall street but i m pretty damn angry about being villainized and tainted and i m not happy about it i m a very strong christian i believe this pandemic has brought out the good people and has brought out the evil people almost like in the old testament passover everyone had a mark on their door that s what the pandemic s done you know where people stand the sec on monday filed a parallel complaint against schamens charging him with lying to retail investors this is not the first time that david schamens has been charged by the sec for misconduct and serves as a good reminder for investors to research potential advisers richard r best director of the sec s new york regional office said in a statement before entrusting someone with managing your money investors should visit investor gov where they can vet potential advisers

pretend you are sitting behind the resolute desk in the oval office of the white house for a moment you see gas prices rise at the same rate as americans angst and you recall those famous words from political advisor james carville it s the economy stupid what would you do this question is especially important to a big state like florida for decades leaders have treated the idea of mass transit with the same disdain for which gov ron desantis treats facemasks floridians love their cars and if they can t afford to drive them that s bad the state s average price for a gallon of gas just topped 4 which is really bad anyway as russia continues its war crime against ukraine lawmakers have seized the moment to make their point the u s imports about 1 4 of its crude oil from russia and some are making the case that percentage should be zero by the way the u s domestically produces 128 barrels for every one russian barrel it imports that doesn t sound like a lot does it however any disruption now will send prices higher sen rick scott and house speaker nancy pelosi appear to agree on something when is the last time that happened scott tweeted i ll say it again no american company should be doing business in or with russia it s disgusting that wall street investors are putting profits over the free and innocent people of ukraine and i urge them to immediately stop propping up any russian business presumably he includes u s companies that import oil from russia in his blanket statement pelosi added i m all for that ban it ban the oil coming from russia the u s house is working on a bill to require that and it probably will pass meanwhile back behind the resolute desk it s your job to come up with a solution that brings gas prices down and your approval ratings up and if you stop even that small amount of imported oil prices will climb and your approval numbers will make donald trump s look good by comparison venezuela is a big oil producer but we stopped doing business with them in 2019 when trump imposed sanctions because of oh the irony election fraud by strongman nicolás maduro a u s delegation just went to venezuela to talk about allowing oil imports again from there scott and sen marco rubio are two of maduro s most vocal critics but venezuela has the oil and america needs it iran has lots of oil too but it s complicated after trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement president barack obama negotiated with iran oil imports from there plummeted there is talk about working a deal with iran but estimates it could take well into the summer before we d notice any relief all right mr president would you do business with iran and venezuela scott rubio and the whole republican party would go berserk not to mention desantis they would accuse biden of cozying up to dictators but the moral high ground gets slippery at times oh just reauthorize the keystone pipeline right biden shut down the pipeline s construction before it was completed but couldn t he start it up again well it s too late for that after biden canceled the permit for calgary based tc energy to transport oil in the pipeline the company said it would dismantle its equipment meanwhile gas keeps costing more which means consumers have less money to spend on other things biden could deal with several devils inviting invectives from critics or try to ride it out and gamble that the situation will ease two bad options one unholy mess and the stock market fell by more than 800 points monday after oil hit 130 a barrel well he wanted the job

correspondents from across the globe new episodes are recorded weekly and available on apple podcasts spotify and all other major platforms and on our youtube channel this week we look at china and india the major powers that still haven t condemned russia s invasion of ukraine and chose to abstain from reprimanding moscow at the united nations what factors are compelling beijing and new delhi to stand by russia we report the latest on russia s china connection while dhruva jaishankar of the observer research foundation america tells us about india s delicate balancing act asia stream is hosted by wajahat s khan our digital editor and executive producer and produced by both him and jack stone truitt related to this episode quad urges india to condemn russia over ukraine mar 4 2022 analysis china s cips cannot rescue russian banks from swift ban mar 3 2022 transcript theme music in wajahat s khan host hello and welcome to asia stream where we track report and analyze the issues and interests of the world s largest region i am waj khan nikkei asia s digital editor here in new york city today s episode the china russia india love triangle the sino indo russo love triangle as russia s invasion of ukraine turns into a brutal all out war beyond the casualties which continue to pile and the refugees who continue to flee and the sanctions which continue to hurt the russian economy and the misinformation which continues to be manufactured from all sides the world is taking stock of who is standing by the side of vladimir putin this list is short it features the usual bad boys of the international order north korea iran syria and a smattering of less relevant actors but two major powers really stand out for not condemning russia s actions china and india the evidence lies right here in new york since the beginning of this year the united nations security council has met half a dozen times and the general assembly has met twice to discuss ukraine and reprimand russia in the many votes and resolutions both china and india continue to abstain besides their official lack of condemnation many see this as a sign of support for moscow but why are beijing and new delhi putting themselves in this position on the surface china and india seem like an unlikely pairing china is the world s largest and most powerful authoritarian regime the people s republic has exercised a very different strand of communism compared to the soviet union and the communist party of china isn t by any means headed down the path the ussr took three decades ago as for india well the world s largest democracy has turned into one of the world s most dynamic economies with a robust constitutional clarity for fundamental rights and a century long tradition of voting thus it s no surprise that china and india are rivals as the largest nations in asia indeed the world this is expected they ve been on a war footing since 2020 they claim each other s territory india just diplomatically boycotted the beijing olympics but only after the chinese gave the honor of torchbearer to a soldier who had fought indian forces of course india s western leanings have irritated china delhi has joined the us led quad that is meant to keep china in check in the indo pacific meanwhile beijing has armed and supported india s archenemy pakistan for decades and continues to support and invest in other countries in india s neighborhood so why are both these rivals supporting russia what does moscow offer that both beijing and delhi are going out on a limb for it the answer for china is clearer both xi jinping and vladimir putin enjoy a warm relationship russia has been moving increasingly closer to china in its economic ties with the people s republic and depends on the great chinese hunger for energy for much of its oil and gas exports of course russia s is a much smaller economy but in their rhetoric and actions both moscow and beijing are equal partners in being declared anti western regimes which continuously question and critique the u s led order but what about india russia and india s dynamics are quite different they barely trade unlike china and russia they don t have a common border yet the ties between moscow and delhi go back decades and are primarily based in security india lives in a tough neighborhood since independence it has fought one war with china three with pakistan and countless skirmishes with both to secure itself it started tilting towards moscow in the 1950s as it became the first non communist country to receive soviet weaponry over the decades the russia india defense relationship has developed into the most robust one in the world today russia is the world s second biggest arms exporter and india is its largest and most loyal customer over 60 percent of india s armory is russian made or licensed still india is a democracy and has shocked many observers by not criticizing russia s actions is it that dependency on russian weapons which is causing india to risk it s democratic credentials with the west or does delhi have a larger scheme to consider like ensuring that it s old cold war ally and weapons dealer russia doesn t go all out into the arms of its nemesis china thus the china russia india love triangle it s going to be a heck of a show tune in to understand the war behind the war you re listening to the sound of asia streaming in your ear from nikkei asia this is asia stream theme music out khan now the elephant or perhaps in this case dragon in the russia ukraine war room is china from xi jinping and vladimir putin meeting on opening day of the olympics to however this conflict shall end china s effect on putin s decision making and vice versa have played a massive role in the development of this invasion joining me in the studio to discuss it further is asia stream correspondent jack stone truitt jack thank you for being here jack stone truitt thank you for having me khan so jack there seems to be a flurry of information out there about what china knew about russia s invasion and when china knew it what s going on here truitt that is the central question right now as it relates to china s role in all of this the new york times has just reported that senior chinese officials told their russian counterparts in early february not to invade ukraine while the olympics were still ongoing which of course would indicate that china had some knowledge of russia s plans this comes after earlier reporting that the u s actually shared classified intel with china months ago in the hopes they could do something to prevent it so it seems extremely unlikely that xi was not aware of putin s plans to invade we may never know but it s possible xi simply did not take the threat of a russian invasion seriously or that he simply miscalculated with the information he had khan ok but let s step back a bit why is china a part of the conversation regarding a conflict centered around nato taking place halfway across the world from beijing truitt so let s go back to that meeting between putin and xi in early february at the start of the olympics putin is amassing troops on the border the u s is warning of a possible invasion and threatening sanctions and none of it seems to be dissuading the russian president and maybe that s in part because he feels that china has and will have his back khan other than rhetorically or sending in military support how can china support putin while the rest of the world cuts him off truitt since the invasion the global response has been pretty unified and severe russia is cut off from european and american airspace many oligarchs have had their assets frozen or seized and most notably the global payments system known as swift has banned several russian banks from using it all in all russia has been extremely economically isolated and this is where china comes in as the world s second biggest economy access to chinese capital could help mitigate these sanctions and china s own cross border interbank payment system cips could come into play instead of swift though neither can fully make up for the kind of economic isolation russia is experiencing khan so have they actually done any of this yet truitt not quite so far china s response has been relatively nuanced and muted they ve yet to call russia s actions an invasion and continue to harp on nato expansion as playing a role in this conflict but china s un ambassador zhang has said that the situation has evolved to a point which china does not want to see the invasion also violates all concepts of national sovereignty something beijing takes very seriously khan and they ve begun to use that s word sovereignty quite often at the un too so difficult one to answer but what does this all mean right now for mr xi truitt it s far too early to make any major declarations but recall that on the eve of russia s invasion one major talking point was whether or not it would serve as a blueprint for china to possibly invade taiwan so far the obstacles russia has faced both in the invasion itself and from the global response to it may serve as a warning sign to the difficulty china could have in a military campaign of their own it also could bolster america s resolve in defending the island just this week a delegation arrived in taipei including former sec of state mike pompeo to affirm u s support khan of course it could also be a lesson in how to navigate the choppy waters of an international sanctions regime as well a bit of wargaming to see what happens when you invade a little piece of real estate that may or may not be yours by international law so how about going forward truitt remember that it s a critical year for xi who is seeking to secure an unprecedented third term during the party congress in the fall and given the broad global consensus condemning russia s invasion it s unlikely he will make any major moves and risk a political backlash at home khan right any major moves like risking wwiii jack stone truitt thank you for joining us truitt thank you khan now just before he got to china to meet xi jinping at the olympics guess where vladimir putin was india just as russian troops were amassing on the ukrainian border in december putin was in delhi for what was his second international trip during the pandemic putin s tour was meant to coincide with yet another important weapons deal with india one of many the two countries have inked since the 1950s this time russia was delivering the sophisticated s400 air defense system to the indians worth around 5 4 billion dollars the s400 is considered as one of the most advanced weapons platforms in the world but more than what it can do which is shoot down enemy aircraft from the ground it is the politics behind the system that are more intriguing by buying the s400 from the russians the indians have risked sanctions from their new partners the us the turks who are nato allies of the us purchased the same system from the russians and triggered the wrath of those sanctions from washington which essentially cut off turkey from most future weapons deals with the us by buying the system the indians who are not us allies but are increasingly active in groups like the quad a security partnership between the us india japan and australia have exposed themselves to the same the thinking is simple with its rival china nuclear armed and nemesis pakistan also nuclear armed on its borders and a decades old defense relationship with russia still intact why should india bet all on american weapons some think this explains why delhi didn t condemn moscow when its invasion began although prime minister modi appealed to putin for an immediate cessation of violence in a phone call on the first day of the war indian officials have steered clear of blaming the russian president instead new delhi continues to stay in touch with both moscow and kyiv as it has prioritized evacuation operations for thousands citizens on ukraine s borders but balancing acts are tricky and risk upsetting the same parties one is trying to please is india risking it s democratic credentials to discuss this complicated place that india finds itself in an indispensable partner of the west on the one hand but an old customer of russia s on the other i spoke to dhruva jaishankar the executive director of the observer research foundation america he is also a non resident fellow with the lowy institute in australia and former fellow at the brookings institution and the german marshall fund here is our conversation record both to discuss this complicated place that india finds itself in an indispensable partner of the west on the one hand but an old customer of russia s on the other i am joined by dhruva jaishankar the executive director of the observer research foundation america he is also a non resident fellow with the lowy institute in australia and former fellow at the brookings institution and the german marshall fund dhruva thank you for joining asia stream khan dhruva welcome to asia stream dhruva jaishankar observer research foundation thanks for having me khan all right now drew let s get straight to business india needs both the us and russia to contain china we ve heard this story but explain the dilemma to us how is it on the ground what are the actual compulsionsthat are keeping india in this weird tricky balancing high wire act jaishankar and so first of all i wouldn t say that the object has to contain china i think that s not necessarily the indian objective or that of any other country but there is a serious concern about a disputed boundary between india and china in 2020 it was it s a major it is a major security challenge but beyond that i think india sees like other countries concerns about chinese assertiveness in the indian ocean region concerns about the belt and road initiative about its market principles and trade practices and on counters with global norms freedom of navigation and overflight being just one of them so there s a whole variety of concerns about china s growing strategic challenge for india and in this context india has sought partners in many places most importantly the us which shares many of those concerns but also japan australia those four countries of course constitute the quad which has now been formalized and now meets on a regular basis but an old partner has also been russia and india has had this relationship a defense relationship with russia from the late 1950s it has had an aid relationship from the mid 1950s before that india was actually among the first recipients of outside non communist recipients of soviet aid in 1971 of course india and then the soviet union signed a treaty and since period last 20 years of the cold war in the very firmly tilted in towards the soviet union in the 1990s and 2000s a lot of that relationship continued but it was really became mostly a one dimensional defense relationship and even to this day about 60 of india s defense imports if you take it over a five or 10 year span come from russia that share has been declining the us us exports to india have grown french exports have grown israeli exports have grown but russia remains the biggest external supplier of indian military hardware including for some very critical components for critical platforms sukhoi 30 fighters which also frontline fire along with rafale fighter jets are so the frontline fighters that india has a nuclear attack submarine nuclear powered attack submarines which russia leases and a whole range of ballistic missile defense india has entered into an agreement of somewhat controversial agreement about importing s 400 ballistic missiles defense system khan so dhruv that clearly creates a more complicated narrative than the one which one usually reads that oh india has been dealing with the russians for all so so many years and india is not in a comfortable spot with china and thus it needs russia to balance it off because there s more actors here right india s relationship with china may be tense yes the two countries have been at war footing essentially for the last couple of years but they trade so much more than indian russia for example meanwhile the indian relationship with the us hasn t been static as you pointed out they ve been increasingly proximate they trade from a zero literally nail from 2007 or eight the defense ties have now ballooned to up to i think maybe 20 billion or so of course the american indian trade relationship and strategic relationship is getting closer literally by the moment but this is not a balancing act this is a triple or quadruple act if you throw in the neighbors as well the pakistan s of the world which are moving closer to moscow the myanmar s of the world which are moving closer to beijing so can you explain to me how complicated it is what is the way forward for them as far as what can they do and what can t they do look i think it s quite clear india has two major major security concerns china and pakistan the china concern has grown in recent years the pakistan concern as comes and goals and they ve been crises in the recent past but it s seen as a more manageable problem but definitely the overarching concern and there is it s not just in the south asian context not just with between india and china this is now you know having a global implication so this question of india russia relations in some ways the central dilemma and all of that and i think there is some genuine concern and there s no reason to unnecessarily antagonize the russian relationship to push them away to push them as they see it into the arms of china that is starting to happen anyway there is a growing russia china relationship it s gotten much much deeper and much faster than many had anticipated and sometimes not completely in russia s favor since 2014 russia has become much more dependent on china including for energy exports but it s translated into a number of other areas so for example we re seeing russia china cooperation in what will ones consider very sensitive domains such as ballistic missile defense which was completely off the table since the 1960s but now is back we seeing as you mentioned new russia pakistan prime minister imran khan was was in moscow just last week so we re seeing starting to see some exploratory ties there are both commercial and security related you re starting to the russian position on afghanistan and until the 1990s india and russia were cooperating quite closely in supporting the northern alliance against the taliban but essentially from india s point of view russia has switched sides now in today s become much more accommodating of the taliban largely due to what they perceive as internal security reasons but it also has led to a greater coordination with china and pakistan so i think these are the sort of ground realities that are changing in the india russia relationship but that being said i think there it remains one of india s you know intermediate diminishing points where remains one of india s critical partners defense being again the key pillar but civil nuclear and nuclear commerce is quite significant for example space cooperation energy cooperation including both coal investments that india has in the far east and the oil and natural gas again it remains an important partner and from india s point of view there s no unnecessary reason to push it further away given the continuing importance for indian national security khan fair now moving forward we re going to project things it s there s already signs that by striking this tricky high wire balancing act through india risks in the end nobody being happy with it it risks losing russia it risks the white house where the american president last week had a quite a terse remark about the indians and of course on the ground one has seen problems arise between the two missions of the united nations as well the us and the indian mission if you were a war gamer or a betting man play this out for us how will india manage to really hurt either one of its relationships jaishankar look i think the current crisis particularly it s been a week less than a week since the full invasion by russia of ukraine and emotions are running high in washington still and not just washington european capitals and elsewhere i think what a crisis like this has done is it has brought out all of the skeptics of the us western relationship in india in full force and it s brought out all the skeptics of the india relationship in the us and full force and i think that s going to happen people who it reinforces their viewpoints that this is a relationship that s not going to materialize but i think it s important to keep a few things in mind which is one i think over the long term the big geopolitical competition is not going to be between the us and russia it s going to be between the us and china and in that sense the analogy doesn t fully hold of those cold war era analogies where india was trying to make choices between the us and the soviet union i think a second thing is that again look at the broader trajectory of india russia relations on the one hand and in the us relations and they tell two rather different stories and i think what again most people who follow that know that and know that s the case i think the third thing to keep in mind is i think there has been a great deal of understanding particular on the part of the us pre us officials of india s predicament and we saw the state department basically say that now obviously they would like onside and there has been given india s position at the un security council there has been extra scrutiny of india s position that otherwise might not have been there so i think we re in for a period of jostling right now but again the longer term structural factors i think will define the relationship over the long run in the us relations have gone through far worse in the recent past as i see it khan and last couple of questions yes it s early days in the war but even in the build up and since the debates began at the united nations one has seen a very slow change in india s positioning and language one has seen a similar change coming from beijing as well the other partner of moscow but this is quite different from 2014 when of course the crimea was taken by the russians and india a abstained and b did not support those sanctions it seems like the language is beginning to change just moments ago before this interview there was a vote on the floor of the un general assembly where india again abstained from voting can you perhaps reflect on how different things are from 2014 to now and now in the last couple of weeks how have the indians been changing their position especially since prime minister modi has started to engage with leaders on the ground jaishankar i think it s complicated the number one priority right now and maybe for a couple more days at least perhaps another week will be the safety and well being of about 20 000 indian citizens who are in ukraine and we ve had at least two deaths as of now of those indian citizens what one was a medical emergency but their their well being is the number one priority and that requires maintaining good relations insofar as possible with the ukrainian authorities as well as european neighbors poland slovakia moldova romania hungary but also with russia as well and in fact today the shelling of kharkiv in particular the some something like 4000 indian students whose evacuation is still up in the air requires in some ways the russian authorities so i think that s actually the number one priority but that being said there have been a few developments since india s first initial position was articulated at the un security council on this issue in late february one is you have seen india now as you mentioned china but repeatedly mentioned respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity finding diplomatic solutions non military solutions and end to conflict and i think that s about as pointed as they will get when it comes to russia despite abstaining on the vote the second thing is i think prime minister modi after speaking to prsident putin on the first day of full hostilities on feb 24th 25th did eventually also speak to president zelinsky and i think that sort of helped to some show in some ways where india was positioning itself and then also india has provided some humanitarian assistance planeload that just arrived in the last day or two to ukrainian border via poland and romania so i think that these have transpired since india staked out its original position it hasn t led to a change in votes and in any way and i said because of india s continuing relationship with russia i d be very surprised if it would dramatically change its position on that front but these things have been some indicators what has gone into that i think the big difference in 2014 is the scale of the conflict if nothing else so one was a very limited action in crimea and the donbas but this is obviously on a scale that is completely different and i think that this has to be taken into account the sanctions that the west is imposing on russia likely to be much are already much more severe on an order of magnitude but also likely to be much more long lasting from this and that will have secondary implications for india amongst other countries i think that s the main thing that differentiates today from the 2014 context khan dhruv finally please expand on why the indian vote and positioning in this entire gambit matters frankly pakistan s abstained as well but it s not as important perhaps the uae has abstained but again not as important so many middle eastern countries southeast asian countries are sitting this one out nobody really cares but india keeps on whether it s in the press or in the great conversation about this conflict india keeps on popping up as an important significant fence sitter why does india matter more than other countries when it comes to its weighing in this conflict weigh in on that for us jaishankar so i think broadly three reasons or some combination thereof i think one is the fact that india is on the un security council which puts it in greater gives it greater scrutiny than if it had not been on the on the security council at this point of time so i say compared to is at least initially israel or indonesia s position which was similar india and the uae really are the ones that have abstained and i think there has been a desire on the part of the us to if they can swing india that the uae sort might follow suit at least that s what s believed and that would essentially isolate china and russia on the security council so in that sense i think india is really seen as the key swing vote at the unsc at the general assembly much broader many more countries abstained on it but i think if you look at it india is perhaps the largest democracy on that and i think that i think is what would have stood out to a lot of people examining examining that so i think that s in some ways why at the unga perhaps that matters i think the third reason is on more on the economic front which is if the idea is to impose a crushing sanctions on russia and the more sub large economies you can peel off and from the us point of view or friend from the european point of view the more cooperation you can get from the larger economies the more it will isolate russia economically and i think china may be a bridge too far i think nobody believes that china will fully follow the sanctions although they may be secondary sanctions that will affect chinese companies but the other big one would be india you know what we ve seen even singapore japan south korea cooperate australia cooperating a lot of the sanctions getting i think india and to some degree some of the middle eastern economies on board some of the southeast asian economies on board would be from their point of view high priorities in terms of isolating russia economically so i think for these reasons you ve seen the attention which you haven t seen in past crises affected or focused on india khan and forgive my persistence if the americans were to hold a gun to delhi s head today what would that gun be and second part is what would india do about taking a position on this predicament jaishankar i doubt we get to that point because again as i said i think there s a degree of understanding and a degree of cooperation and connect to in this ub day to day job coperation going on between india and the us and a whole bunch of issues including defense that s ongoing right now and giving an ultimatum like that won t help at this point with with the partnership is just developing it in many ways but that being said i think if india was forced to choose on the defense side today it might choose russia if it was just if we re just looking at the defense relationship khan wow that s quite a claim jaishankar yeah yeah again more than 50 of your defense imports when your defense industry is still very integrated with russia that s that s the case but i think if you were to the look at the overall relationship and that includes the economic relationship and clearly i think india s interests live much more with the west and look at indian businesses are much more integrated into the west dependent on financial systems in europe and the us so i think if you look at the overall sort of relationship it s quite clearly if i were to look at so do our cost benefit analysis i think it quite clearly which way it lines up but if if we re just looking narrowly at the defense relationship today i think russia still would be still remains the biggest most important partner for india that was dhurva jaishankar of orf america from washington dc that s it for asia stream this week theme music in khan as always i encourage you to

lviv ukraine ap the humanitarian crisis in ukraine deepened monday as russian forces intensified their shelling and food water heat and medicine grew increasingly scarce in what the country condemned as a medieval style siege by moscow to batter it into submission thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors a third round of talks between the two sides ended with a top ukrainian official saying there had been minor unspecified progress toward establishing safe corridors that would allow civilians to escape the fighting russia s chief negotiator said he expects those corridors to start operating tuesday but that remained to be seen given the failure of previous attempts to lead civilians to safety amid the biggest ground war in europe since world war ii well into the second week of the invasion with russian troops making significant advances in southern ukraine but stalled in some other regions a top u s official said multiple countries were discussing whether to provide the warplanes that ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy has been pleading for russian president vladimir putin s forces continued to pummel cities with rockets and fierce fighting raged in places in one of the most desperate cities the encircled southern port of mariupol an estimated 200 000 people nearly half the population of 430 000 were hoping to flee and red cross officials waited to hear when a corridor would be established the city is short on water food and power and cellphone networks are down stores have been looted as residents search for essential goods police moved through the city advising people to remain in shelters until they heard official messages broadcast over loudspeakers to evacuate hospitals in mariupol are facing severe shortages of antibiotics and painkillers and doctors performed some emergency procedures without them the lack of phone service left anxious citizens approaching strangers to ask if they knew relatives living in other parts of the city and whether they were safe in the capital kyiv soldiers and volunteers have built hundreds of checkpoints to protect the city of nearly 4 million often using sandbags stacked tires and spiked cables some barricades looked significant with heavy concrete slabs and sandbags piled more than two stories high while others appeared more haphazard with hundreds of books used to weigh down stacks of tires every house every street every checkpoint we will fight to the death if necessary said mayor vitali klitschko in kharkiv ukraine s second largest city with 1 4 million people heavy shelling slammed into apartment buildings i think it struck the fourth floor under us dmitry sedorenko said from his kharkiv hospital bed immediately everything started burning and falling apart when the floor collapsed beneath him he crawled out through the third story past the bodies of some of his neighbors klitschko reported that fierce battles continued in the kyiv region notably around bucha hostomel vorzel and irpin in the irpin area which has been cut off from electricity water and heat for three days witnesses saw at least three tanks and said russian soldiers were seizing houses and cars a few miles away in the small town of horenka where shelling reduced one area to ashes and shards of glass rescuers and residents picked through the ruins as chickens pecked around them what are they doing rescue worker vasyl oksak asked of the russian attackers there were two little kids and two elderly people living here come in and see what they have done in the south russian forces also continued their offensive in mykolaiv opening fire on the black sea shipbuilding center of a half million people according to ukraine s military rescuers said they were putting out fires caused by rocket attacks in residential areas at the hague netherlands ukraine pleaded with the international court of justice to order a halt to russia s invasion saying moscow is committing widespread war crimes russia is resorting to tactics reminiscent of medieval siege warfare encircling cities cutting off escape routes and pounding the civilian population with heavy ordnance said jonathan gimblett a member of ukraine s legal team russia snubbed the court proceedings leaving its seats in the great hall of justice empty efforts to set up safe passage for civilians over the weekend fell apart amid continued russian shelling before monday s talks began russia announced a new plan saying civilians would be allowed to leave kyiv mariupol kharkiv and sumy later russia s u n ambassador vassily nebenzia told the u n security council that russia would carry out a cease fire tuesday morning and open humanitarian corridors leading away from kyiv mariupol sumy and chernigov zelenskyy expressed skepticism about the sincerity of the gestures asserting in his daily video address that instead of an agreement on humanitarian corridors what ukraine got on monday was russian tanks russian grad rockets russian mines many of the evacuation routes headed toward russia or its ally belarus which has served as a launch pad for the invasion ukraine instead proposed eight routes allowing civilians to travel to western regions of the country where there is no shelling the u n humanitarian chief undersecretary general martin griffiths addressed the security council and urged safe passage for people to go in the direction they choose the battle for mariupol is crucial because its capture could allow moscow to establish a land corridor to crimea which russia seized from ukraine in 2014 the fighting has sent energy prices surging worldwide and stocks plummeting and threatens t he food supply and livelihoods of people around the globe who rely on crops farmed in the fertile black sea region the u n human rights office reported 406 confirmed civilian deaths but said the real number is much higher the invasion has also sent 1 7 million people fleeing ukraine on monday moscow again announced a series of demands to stop the invasion including that ukraine recognize crimea as part of russia and recognize the eastern regions controlled by moscow supported separatist fighters as independent it also insisted that ukraine change its constitution to guarantee it won t join international bodies like nato and the eu ukraine has already rejected those demands he has called for more punitive measures against russia including a global boycott of its oil exports which are key to its economy if russia doesn t want to abide by civilized rules then they shouldn t receive goods and services from civilization he said in a video address he has also asked for more warplanes deputy u s secretary of state wendy sherman said officials are trying to see whether this is possible and doable while the west has been rushing weapons to ukraine such as anti tank and anti aircraft missiles some officials fear that sending warplanes could be seen by moscow as direct involvement in the war one possible scenario under discussion former soviet bloc nations that are now nato members could send ukraine their own soviet era migs which ukrainian pilots are trained to fly and the u s would then replace those countries aircraft with american made f 16s russia s invasion has nearby countries terrified the war could spread to them u s secretary of state antony blinken began a lightning visit to the baltic states of latvia lithuania and estonia former soviet republics that are nato members blinken hoped to reassure them of the alliance s protection nato has shown no interest in sending troops into the country and has rejected zelenskyy s pleas to establish a no fly zone for fear of triggering a wider war thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors

administrators janitors or anyone who worked in texas schools it cost the state about 700 million advertisement article continues below this ad the 13th check confused many retirees when it was distributed in mid january as their regular check came in that same month less than they expected the extra check had pushed their january income into a different tax bracket resulting in a lower payout many although trs sent out several letters and published an online faq attempting to explain the decrease many were still confused and alarmed thinking the lesser monthly payout would stay that way going forward the tax difference made the january check between 100 and 200 less than usual several retirees said then when their february checks came they remained marginally lower than in 2021

2019 considered a permanent cost of living adjustment which retired teachers have called for but both times instead opted for one time payouts during the state house committee hearing of the 13th check bill last year rep greg bonnen chair of the appropriations committee said it would be better for the legislature to consider a permanent adjustment in benefits in 2023 when the teachers pension fund has more time to grow and demonstrate its financial stability to the legislature the fund has about 204 billion and its current assets cover about 77 percent of the benefits it has promised to pay over time the national average for the funded ratio of pension funds is 80 percent if for some reason trs funds were to fall short of what is owed state taxpayers would ultimately be on the hook for the money lee said he expects a cost of living adjustment to be taken up next year it will be more than just a serious conversation i think it s going to be a desperate conversation that our members are going to have with elected officials the next time we roll into session the trs fund sets a benchmark of 7 25 percent return year over year while for the last 10 it has averaged 9 12 percent in 2021 the fund saw a massive rate of return due to a surging economy and stock market although markets have struggled so far this year our belief is the markets are hard to predict and you don t know what the future holds and we are concerned about that lee said the worry that we have as an association between now and the time the next legislative session rolls around is what if the markets have a serious correction what if we see another situation where a major recession occurs and will that have a demonstrative impact on the legislature s willingness to have that conversation and it s possible

tensions continue to simmer between moscow and washington in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine but the united states and russia are continuing to work together on at least one issue salmon there s a map scattered with orange green blue and red dots spanning most of the north pacific above 46 degrees latitude on the map are three flags of arctic nations the u s canada and the russian federation this interaction between the countries in this is really something that has never happened to this scale before said mark saunders the executive director of the five country north pacific anadromous fish commission he s talking about the 2022 pan pacific winter high seas expedition vessels from both sides of the pacific are braving gale force winds and 13 foot seas as they crisscross the ocean from the edge of the aleutian chain to the strait of juan de fuca all in the name of research on challenges to wild salmon runs that are important to people on all sides of the north pacific rim last year the chum salmon run on the yukon river collapsed this past summer the yukon river did not fish for food zero said mike williams sr he s the chair of the kuskokwim inter tribal fish commission an organization that manages and researches fisheries using a combination of traditional knowledge and western scientific methods never before had so few fish swum up the nearly 2 000 mile river regulators closed all fishing on the yukon to preserve what little of the run remained williams says in recent years he s watched runs on the kuskokwim dwindle too in the past he says fishing was relatively unrestricted residents would return to their fish camps shortly after the ice on the river broke up in the spring but in recent years he says residents have had to wait until june long after breakup to start stockpiling the essential staple we depend on the salmon to sustain us through the winter and we re very concerned about the returns of our salmon in all of the rivers in western alaska williams said in a phone interview wednesday it s not clear what was behind the collapse the inter tribal commission and the alaska department of fish and game for that matter spend most of their effort studying what happens in freshwater but that s just a small part of a salmon s life the salmon spawn in our headwaters they go down to the ocean and something happens in the ocean williams said and it s not just western alaska that s struggled with salmon runs in recent years in southeast chinook runs from haines to ketchikan are listed as stocks of concern salmon fishing on the unuk river has been banned outright for years some including williams say too many salmon in the bering sea and the north pacific are pulled out of the ocean as bycatch from trawlers that scrape the seabed for sole and flounder others say fish from hatcheries all over the north pacific rim are outcompeting native fish some say climate change is affecting the food web or a combination of all these factors but one thing is clear something is happening to chum and chinook salmon in the open ocean we know that a lot of the poor survival for chum and other salmon is related to the marine environment saunders of the north pacific anadromous fish commission said tuesday from his home office on vancouver island there s quite a bit known about how the ocean is changing but you need to know where the fish are and have actually had your hands on them and understand how they re interacting with the environment saunders said i think a lot of that is a large black box in particular this winter period we know very little about he added he says the goal of the survey the largest ever conducted is to shine some light in that black box scientists are hoping to map out the distribution of salmon across the north pacific using new dna techniques developed over the past decade or so to understand where salmon interact with predators prey and each other not to mention a generally warmer more acidic ocean and the big question is how is the changing north pacific ocean affecting our salmon and improving our ability to understand how that change is going to impact people and fish and fisheries into the future he said that brings us back to the map earlier this winter ships from the u s canada and russia set sail for the north pacific each is assigned its own area to sample the u s and canada are tackling areas in the gulf of alaska and west of british columbia and a vessel from russia is surveying an immense swath of ocean spanning areas south of the alaska peninsula all the way out the aleutian chain southwest of adak the russian vessel s survey work started late last month it actually tied up in dutch harbor a day after russian troops started their assault on ukraine s capital kyiv unalaska s port director told krbd the visit was tightly scrutinized by u s border agents alaska s chief salmon scientist bill templin says a few thoughts crossed his mind as he watched the invasion unfold my first concerns were for the people of ukraine templin said by phone wednesday but then when i walked into my office and i sat down i was thinking oh ok so what does this mean he says it s not the first time international tensions have come up in his work with the five country commission he recalls russian scientists including islands disputed with japan on maps of salmon stocks all in good fun as he recalls it the first two years they got it past me and the japanese had to come over and correct me very politely he said but this is more tension than usual saunders the head of the anadromous fish commission says an american scientist was scheduled to board the russian vessel to allow it to survey within the 230 mile u s exclusive economic zone that didn t happen and that means the russian research vessel can t work close to the aleutian chain where some salmon are thought to spend the winter templin says that means salmon activity within that zone will remain a blank spot for now it doesn t ruin the results it s not a failure but it is going to limit what we get he said and it s taken years to get this winter coordinated so it s a little disappointing but templin says scientists from japan canada south korea russia and the united states have always put their work first and their political leaders policies second and he says that ll continue the salmon all go to the same place so they re all grazing in the same field so to speak for all of us to work together to understand what s happening out there and the way it affects our nations is i think it s a pretty huge deal he said and i d hate to see it go away so far geopolitical tensions haven t overshadowed the need for cooperation at least not when it comes to preserving wild salmon

intended to define the treatment of rare also termed orphan diseases affecting fewer than 200 000 people in the us more recently specialty drugs have emerged as the cornerstone of treatment for chronic and complex diseases such as cancer autoimmune conditions diabetes hepatitis c and hiv aids we believe improved treatment of ntm lung disease will require an efficacious safe and well

because they were attacked and lines of people waiting for help in the freezing cold with no heavy coats it s just horrible the suffering that is being caused because of this brutality by russian

vladimir putin has a plan to brutalize ukraine and the last two weeks have shown that the ukrainian people are not going to give up thomas greenfield said the united states will continue to stand with

determine that property was bought with illicit revenues from organized crime like drug trafficking or extortion it is seized and eventually made available for use by charities or other non profit
