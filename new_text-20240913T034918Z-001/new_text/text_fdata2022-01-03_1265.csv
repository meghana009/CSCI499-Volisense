robert j birnbaum who headed both the american stock exchange and the new york stock exchange during a 27 year career in market regulation and administration has died he was 94 he died on dec 23 at his home in boca raton fla after a long illness his wife gloria said in an interview other than their new york locations the nyse and the amex shared little besides birnbaum s leadership the much smaller american exchange was founded by traders unable to afford membership in the new york exchange while at the american stock exchange in 1984 birnbaum played a role in a high profile case of insider trading birnbaum said he learned through staff about a good number of situations where a stock moved dramatically shortly before being mentioned in r foster winans s heard on the street columns in the wall street journal birnbaum passed the information to the sec winans was charged with fraud and convicted and spent about nine months in prison birnbaum s 1985 move from the amex led by arthur levitt to the nyse succeeding john phelan who became chairman stoked speculation that the two exchanges would finally merge instead they remained independent until 2008 when the nyse s parent nyse euronext took over the amex phelan died in 2012 new york stock exchange people had always looked down their noses at the amex that s not our quality guys on the floor over there you know birnbaum said in a 2007 interview with the securities and exchange commission historical society but regarding a merger they re probably right what s in it for new york if you re a member on the floor what the heck is in it for you so there wasn t much push for it birnbaum s move was the new york times reported at the time apparently the first time a senior official of one exchange has moved to a senior post at the other birnbaum felt it necessary to tell the times that he carried no secret merger plan with phelan birnbaum he helped maintain order and calm nerves at the nyse on black monday oct 19 1987 when the dow jones industrial average lost 508 points or 22 6 percent we sort of divided things birnbaum said phelan was talking to the fed and to the white house and i was talking to all of the exchanges to keep them apprised as much as i could of what was going on but nobody really knew he said the exchange made a wise call in directing trading firms to halt their program trading large automated buy and sell orders to take advantage of small discrepancies in price robert jack birnbaum was born on sept 3 1927 in new york the son of joseph m birnbaum and the former beatrice herman according to marquis who s who he received a bachelor s degree in business administration from new york university in 1957 and a bachelor of laws degree from georgetown university in 1962 his professional career began at the u s general accounting office known today as the government accountability office he moved to the sec in 1961 to help conduct the special study of securities markets which congress had ordered he worked on sections of the study related to the over the counter market and once the report was completed he became a branch chief for otc regulation an sec colleague ralph s saul became president of the american stock exchange in 1966 and birnbaum followed him there he worked his way up to president and chief operating officer a position he held from 1977 to 1985 saul died in 2016 in 1975 the amex began trading in options joining the chicago board options exchange you have to remember in the early 70s the equity business was dying birnbaum said in the sec interview in the aftermath of black monday phelan helped implement so called circuit breakers to interrupt a crashing market but he opposed more dramatic changes and described what happened as an inevitable correction to overly high stock prices birnbaum disagreed he called publicly for banning index arbitrage and considering limits on the size of big firms portfolios radical recommendations that would have put the exchange on a collision course with the big trading houses and with at least some of its specialists tim metz wrote in black monday in 1988 birnbaum left the nyse when his contract expired in june 1988 i ve had about enough of stock exchange work he said at the time according to metz i want to leave while there s still enough time to do something else from 1988 to 1994 he was special counsel at law firm dechert price rhoads now called dechert in new york the chicago board options exchange named him a director in 1997 with his first wife joy who died in 1990 he had two children gregg and julie he was stepfather to three children jeremy simon and jenny through his second marriage in 1993 he is also survived by seven grandchildren
the first major snowfall of the year is expected monday parts of baltimore could get 3 to 5 inches of snow and annapolis could get up to 7 inches overnight into monday afternoon forecasters said sunday night southern maryland the eastern shore and the washington d c area also are expected to see heavy snowfall less snow around 1 to 3 inches was expected in north central northeast and northern maryland which includes baltimore carroll cecil frederick and harford counties and portions of baltimore city according to forecasters at the national weather service as of late sunday afternoon a winter weather advisory was in effect for baltimore city and southern baltimore county while a winter storm warning was in effect for anne arundel calvert charles prince george s and st mary s counties plus washington and much of the eastern shore and portions of howard and montgomery counties several school systems including anne arundel baltimore cecil harford howard montgomery prince george s and st mary s counties will close monday in response to the forecasts carroll county public schools will start the day two hours late and will reevaluate monday morning baltimore city schools will stay closed monday and tuesday to allow students and staff more time to get tested before returning from winter break maryland gov larry hogan said the state on sunday activated a governmentwide response that included the emergency management transportation and state police divisions to prepare for the incoming storm that could have a significant impact on roads and transportation systems he urged marylanders to use common sense and listen to forecasters the snowstorm will come after an unseasonably mild sunday with a high temperature of 65 degrees for baltimore but a cold front moving into the area overnight will drop temperatures below freezing the low temperature for sunday night is 30 degrees precipitation could begin in the early morning national weather service forecaster kyle pallozzi said it may start as rain in the baltimore area but will likely switch to snow that becomes steady as the night goes on of course the ground will probably stay a little warm so snow might have a little trouble sticking until it comes down very heavily pallozzi said but if it snows heavy enough that can kind of overwhelm the warm ground and start to accumulate the snow is likely to impact the morning commute and could continue until midafternoon on monday the forecast worst case scenario for baltimore is 6 to 8 inches pallozzi said but as of sunday afternoon forecasters were expecting 4 to 6 inches for baltimore 3 to 4 inches north of the city and higher totals south of the city annapolis could get 6 to 8 inches and la plata and lexington park could get 6 to 12 snowfall could last until around 1 p m in the baltimore area according to weather service reports and about 4 p m in the washington area if that storm continues to track north we could get upward of a half a foot in baltimore so there is some uncertainty at the moment pallozzi said but right now it kind of looks like the further south you go the better chance you have given heavier snow it s likely to be the season s first significant snowfall for the region no more than trace amounts of snow have been measured at bwi thurgood marshall airport since the winter began according to nws reports maryland emergency management officials cautioned residents to avoid travel during the precipitation event they also asked marylanders to keep devices charged in cases of power outages stock emergency travel kits with masks hand sanitizers and other covid related supplies and heed local forecasts and state alerts when venturing outdoors nws forecasters said people should expect wet and slippery conditions watch for ice on steps sidewalks and driveways forecasters said those who need to commute are encouraged to keep food water and flashlights in the car in case of an emergency the public also can call 511 or visit md511 org for travel updates and subscribe to text message alerts by messaging mdready to 898211 the baltimore city department of public works announced that the following operations are being suspended monday so that dpw crews can assist with emergency snow operations bulk collections street sweeping and alley cleaning cleaning and boarding siu fire debris and graffiti removal cold temperatures will continue into the week with a high temperature of 37 degrees monday 40 degrees tuesday 47 degrees wednesday and 44 degrees thursday more snow is possible thursday night forecasters said
update this article is outdated for the latest winter storm forecast information please refer to my newest weather blog post what s new since my comprehensive sunday morning weather blog post we have two more model runs and a lot more analysis under our meteorological belts the bottom line of this winter storm forecast remains the same significant snow for south jersey hardly anything for north jersey our initial big cooldown is on schedule as temperatures have already started to cool rapidly in the northwest corner of the state thermometers will tumble about 25 degrees within a few hours sunday night accompanied by a brisk northwest wind for my latest snowfall forecast map i decided to compress the totals a bit dry north jersey goes down snowy south jersey goes up the contours the lines and colors pretty much stayed the same on this map i just tweaked the numbers a bit latest snow accumulation forecast for monday as of sunday evening dan zarrow townsquare media going by raw model output maximum snowfall for inland south jersey would be on the order of 20 inches yikes but don t pay attention to that drama and hype there are so many limiting factors at play dry air warm ground rain mix at onset i think we ll end up far from those huge totals but still firmly within plowable snow range for all or part of 8 counties in the southern half of nj one of the biggest challenges in this forecast is nailing down the duration of initial mixing we should be all snow by 9 a m at the latest the other big issue is figuring out the most likely location of heavier mesoscale snow bands that will develop monday morning the rest of this article takes a question and answer format to run down when and how this winter storm may affect you why does this storm seem like such a surprise if you scroll back through my blogroll you ll see we have been peripherally watching this chance of wintry weather since last monday but i largely wrote it off figuring post frontal dry air would win out and the storm will stay off the coast then models took a dramatic shift late on saturday leading forecasters including myself to take the snow threat much more seriously in addition coming off winter break many new jerseyans are headed back to school and back to work on monday for the first time in 2022 i m sure many of them haven t paid close attention to the weather forecast while on vacation of course it is january now on average our second snowiest month of the year behind february what is the overall timeline for the snow first snowflakes and raindrops will enter southern new jersey just after midnight sunday night spreading northward through early monday morning we ll enter the brunt of the storm the period of heaviest and most widespread precipitation bands starting about 5 a m that s when the snow will begin to accumulate first on cold and grassy surfaces and then eventually on paved roadways sidewalks etc note yes it will likely take several hours for falling snow to stick and start to accumulate snow should start to taper by mid monday afternoon with much improved conditions by the evening commute final flakes should fall in new jersey by 6 p m monday at the latest when will be the worst time to travel generally monday morning let s say 8 a m to noon there s reason to hope the heaviest snow bands will hold off until mid to late morning after the am rush hours road crews wil hopefully be able to get ahead of the snowy icy conditions through the afternoon will it be all snow winter storms are always complicated a difference of a single degree on the thermometer can lead to a completely different scenario in this case i do think temperatures at the surface in southeastern new jersey will be just above freezing at the onset of precipitation that means through the morning commute much of south jersey will probably experience rain and or icy mix for several hours no accumulation yet eventually temperatures will fall below freezing statewide for the duration as i mentioned above after 9 a m at the latest everything that falls from the sky will be snow through the rest of the storm how much snow will fall how much snow will stick as i referenced above it may take a while for snow to start to whiten up the ground so the answers to those two questions are very different and it s really the second once that matters accumulations i ve bumped up my snow totals in se nj to 5 to 10 inches that qualifies as a major winter storm leading to widespread travel disruptions snow plows are revving their engines and shovels are ready for the first use of the season if i had to guess the overall snow bullseye will probably be inland atlantic county farther north up to a line between about salem and brick moderate snowfall of 3 to 6 inches is forecast certainly enough to slicken up roads snarl traffic and force schools business to close it s important to note that the bottom and top of these snowfall ranges represent the lowest and highest case scenario respectively this is very much a boom or bust situation and i do not expect snow totals in the middle of those ranges here the nam model forecast as of 10 a m this is the least snowy solution keeping accumulating snow over a stretch of southern and coastal nj only college of dupage meteorology the gfs model forecast as of 10 a m monday this is the most widespread snow scenario with accumulations reaching through central nj the southern coast still sees the heaviest snowfall and biggest totals in this solution college of dupage meteorology how far north will accumulating snow reach south of a trenton perth amboy line it does look like a snowy morning although that s not a slam dunk forecast i ve cautiously painted 1 to 3 inches for the i 195 and i 295 corridors and the farther north you go the harder it will be to see any snow accumulation that s because north jersey will be pretty far from the center of the storm system and it s also because dry air will prevent precipitation from fully reaching the ground on my latest snow map above i have noted the possibility of a coating or an inch of snow along and south of the nj turnpike corridor note zero is also a distinct possibility here far nw nj this isn t your storm flurries are possible but little to no accumulation any other issues to know about northerly wind gusts will probably hover near 30 mph for most of the day the high res nam model shows 30 mph wind gusts through the afternoon that will contribute to blowing snow and further reductions in visibility that could also lead to power outages due to downed trees and power lines finally the wind chill the feels like temperature will be stuck in the teens all day long bundle up what warnings advisories have been issued a winter storm warning pink and winter weather advisory purple blankets the southern half of nj from 4 a m to 4 p m monday townsquare media aerisweather a winter storm warning has been posted for ocean southeastern burlington atlantic cape may and cumberland counties from 4 a m to 4 p m monday that is the most likely location of heavy snow and the most likely time frame for treacherous travel a less urgent less severe winter weather advisory has been issued for salem gloucester camden and northwestern burlington counties for the same time frame 4 a m to 4 p m monday less snow on the ground but still potential travel impacts coastal storm warnings dark green and advisories light green are posted for the entire jersey shore and delaware river during the monday morning midday high tide cycle townsquare media aerisweather a coastal flood warning is also posted for atlantic and cape may counties the monday morning midday high tide cycle is forecast to cause widespread moderate flooding of tidal waterways that may necessitate road closures and could even cause property damage farther up the jersey shore a coastal flood advisory called for minor category flooding at high tide monday what should i do to prepare for the storm by now you ve already taken the most important step you know there s going to be a winter storm in the neighborhood make sure all your friends and family know of the potentially bad weather on the way carefully consider your plans on monday and whether it will be safe to travel during your normal routine the answer to that question will depend largely on what when and where those plans are your vehicle your driving ability etc school superintendents business owners and organization leaders within the warning zone and the advisory too should consider whether to close school on monday or switch to a remote learning day as i ve said previously there seems to be little point to a delayed opening or early dismissal for this one if you haven t already it s probably not too late to stock up on salt batteries and or french toast supplies you may want to strategically park your vehicles to mitigate snow and or coastal flooding issues finally be ready to change your plans as the weather goes downhill and the forecast evolves throughout the day monday what s next our on air and online coverage will ramp up starting early monday morning i take over the weather center at 3 a m for the duration of the storm expect one more comprehensive online write up about the snow potential around 7 a m monday and then regular play by play both on the radio and on social media until the final flakes fly dan zarrow is chief meteorologist for townsquare media new jersey follow him on facebook or twitter for the latest forecast and realtime weather

medford massachusetts likening today s capitalist economies to the communist bloc of yesteryear may seem far fetched what could the free market possibly have in common with soviet style central planning in fact the comparison increasingly offers useful insights into what has become of the winning side since the end of the cold war consider the soft budget constraints that socialist state owned enterprises soes used to enjoy and that turned out to be one of the main reasons why soviet bloc economies failed similar financial conditions are becoming pervasive in capitalist america as the hungarian marxist apostate jános kornai famously argued soes could ignore losses and consumer preferences because they could always count on the state to keep them afloat kornai s thesis was popular with the chinese reformers of the 1980s seeking to make soes more responsive to the market they hardened companies budget constraints by contrast capitalist america seems to be on the same misbegotten path as the soviet economies though it is starting from a different place the result is the same budget constraints are softening and capital is increasingly being funneled toward the fashionable and the well connected fantasists and schemers to be sure borrowing can up to a point energise capitalist enterprises contrary to what one reads in introductory economics textbooks real world consumers budgets are not capped and venturesome consumers can borrow to pay for the next new hot item by consuming beyond their means they boost the demand for iphones and teslas creating incentives for innovators likewise tesla and other upstart businesses often rely on external funding not profits to advance their innovations just as governments issue bonds to help pay for highways bridges harbours and airports savers also benefit instead of stuffing surplus cash into mattresses they can profitably cover the financing needs of consumers businesses and governments but too much financial flexibility can be toxic though individuals businesses and governments can reasonably predict next month s wages revenues and tax receipts respectively they can only guess at their capacity to meet obligations many years from now the more optimistic one s forecast the greater one s willingness to spend beyond one s current means or invest more than just one s retained earnings in principle financiers due diligence should impose countervailing limits on this overextension but estimating creditworthiness and investment returns is not an exact science and competition in the financial sector can produce a race to the bottom as borrowers flock to the most lenient creditors moreover fractional banking and fiat money can further soften financing constraints banks do not lend out only the savings of their depositors they leverage those deposits several fold and central bankers have even more potent powers to create funds out of thin air as traditional financing constraints have weakened in recent decades the growth in households and businesses debt has exceeded the growth in their incomes and profits by a wide margin similarly the growth in the us government s debt now exceeding 29 trillion boggles the imagination yet while borrowing has jumped interest rates have plummeted encouraging even more borrowing and imprudent lending these lax lending standards have apparently spilled over into equity markets last year some 4 million self described apes bought billions of dollars of amc stock saving the movie theatre chain from bankruptcy celebrities now float spacs special purpose acquisition companies with a strangely effective pitch give us your money but we won t tell you what for hedge funds and private equity firms have piled into venture capital vc valuations have soared nearly 340 new businesses raised funding at valuations exceeding 1 billion in 2021 and the kind of due diligence that once took months has been compressed to days or even to just hours with some spray and pray vcs this combination of manic investing and careless lending has not emerged spontaneously or resulted from the complacency that comes with an extended period of stability as hyman minsky the great theorist of financial crises argued the collapse of the internet bubble in 2000 and the global financial crisis eight years later should still be fresh in most financiers and investors memories the problem rather is that central bankers have deliberately incited indiscriminate lending and risk on trading on a historically unprecedented scale worse while central bankers have apparently dropped plenty of proverbial helicopter money the funds have not been evenly spread monetary policies have been designed to lower credit standards thereby favouring feckless borrowers the central bank furnished liquidity that has been pouring into stock markets has found its way to fashionable meme and spac stocks in addition to a few trillion dollar big tech firms vcs favour well connected founders with shiny resumes yet as they bid up the most glamorous ventures valuations they fund less than 0 5 per cent of all us start ups one well known vc firm has even started a fund dedicated to buying cryptocurrencies savers who are too sensible to speculate have fallen behind so too have the businesses that resisted the temptation of cheap money under current conditions their less prudent competitors can pay more for scarce employees and other resources what kind of reckoning capitalism faces or when is impossible to predict in the end kornai s hungary failed slowly not suddenly it and other soviet style economies that fed the investment hunger of favoured soes kept shop shelves bare of the goods that consumers wanted and that less connected producers might have supplied in the absence of wartime or 1970s style price controls of the kind imposed by president richard nixon such shortages and rationing regimes seem unlikely in the capitalist west the current inflationary surge may yet subside as supply chain bottlenecks ease while the us federal reserve forestalls another financial meltdown but staunchly defending stock markets simply extends the state sponsored misallocation of capital and unfortunately the current crop of central bankers seem to lack the resolve that enabled the late paul volcker to harden financial constraints when he led the fed four decades ago amar bhidé professor of business at tufts university is completing a book on knightian uncertainty copyright project syndicate 2021 www project

eu goes green for nuclear energy poland selects site for 1st new nuclear reactor south korean presidential candidate calls for nuclear energy exports south korea announces new plan on nuclear fusion r d japanese heavy industries sign on to supply chain for terrapower eu goes green for nuclear energy despite setbacks in germany and belgium the european union this week published a draft document that labels nuclear energy as being green because they are zero co2 emission power plants it also applied this label to gas power plants which emit half the co2 of coal fired units both designations are intended to facilitate financial support for new nuclear power plants in eu member countries the eu taxonomy guides and mobilizes private investment in activities that are needed to achieve climate neutrality in the next 30 years eu fact sheets on sustainable finance taking account of scientific advice and current technological progress as well as varying transition challenges across member states the commission considers there is a role for natural gas and nuclear as a means to facilitate the transition towards a predominantly renewable based future the european commission said in its statement a majority of eu members support the policy eu states including the czech republic finland and france which gets around 70 of its power from the fuel see nuclear as crucial to phasing out co2 emitting coal fuel power the czech republics is expected to release a tender for a 1200 mwe pwr for dukovany finland is expanding its nuclear fleet and is opening europe s first deep geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel in addition poland and romania also eu members have ambitious plans which are not yet funded to swap out coal fired power plants with new nuclear reactors poland is looking at smrs and romania wants to complete two partially built 700 mwe candu type units ap reported that france has asked for nuclear power to be included in the so called taxonomy by the end of the year leading the charge with several other eu countries that operate nuclear power plants and want to make it eligible for green financing french minister for european affairs clement beaune said the proposal is good on a technical level and insisted on sunday that the bloc cannot become carbon neutral by 2050 without nuclear energy germany stands behind its renewable energy investors the eu s decision to release the draft with nuclear energy getting the green designation set off a political food fight with germany it issued a strongly worded protest to the publication of the draft document even as it took steps to close three of its remaining six nuclear reactors austria spain and luxemburg support germany s position german economy minister robert habeck criticized the plan to classify investments in gas and nuclear power plants as climate facilitating each eu country meeting its climate goals ap reported he said that the eu commission s proposals water down the good label for sustainability habeck who represents the germany s environmentalist greens in the country s coalition government told german news agency dpa we don t see how to approve the new proposals of the eu commission in any case it is questionable whether this greenwashing will even find acceptance on the financial market habeck stressed referring to the practice of painting investments as sustainable when they actually are not the german reactors are brokdorf grohnde and gundremmingen c run by e on and rwe and began operation in the 1980s the pwrs have a gross combined capacity of 4 254 mw the last three nuclear power plants isar 2 emsland and neckarwestheim 2 will be turned off by the end of 2022 removing another 4 291 mwe gross of capacity from the grid this heart of the food fight over the green label is that investors in renewables do not want to have to compete for eu financial support with nuclear power plants the green classification will support access to capital as well as setting a reduction in financing costs germany has gone all in on the use of renewable energy technologies and in effect the government has been captured by investors in solar and wind energy industries the decision by germany to phase out nuclear power and shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy was first taken by the center left government of gerhard schroeder in 2002 in 2005 shortly after his term ended schröder joined the board of directors of the nord stream joint venture gazprom which is intended to ship russian natural gas to germany if the nord ii gas line is completed and turned on it will tighten russia s grip on germany s energy security russia uses gas supplies as a tool of geopolitical influence the combination of reliance on renewable energy and russian gas has backed germany into a corner instead of figuring a way out of the hole its has dug itself into apparently its plan is to keep on digging us newspaper calls germany s energy policies a mistake in the us the washington post published an editorial which called germany s energy policy a mistake the newspaper pointed out that the consequences of germany s decision to phase out its nuclear plant are that it now has the highest electricity rates in the eu due to its reliance on the intermittent nature of solar and wind power also germany is now burning more lignite which is the dirtiest type of coal in terms of conventional pollutants and co2 emitted per ton of the fossil fuel in october of this year as gas prices rose germany stepped up its coal burning operations the post praised france s emmanuel macron for his renewed commitment to nuclear energy next door french president emmanuel macron is moving in the opposite direction announcing plans for new nuclear reactors france relies more on nuclear power than any other nation a major reason the country has about half the per capita greenhouse emissions germany does mr macron rightly sees expanding the nation s nuclear capacity as a better alternative than attempting to rely on renewables alone eu green taxonomy will drive energy investments the draft document defines the criteria for classifying investments in nuclear or gas fired power plants for electricity generation as sustainable with the objective of directing green finance towards activities that contribute to reducing greenhouse gases reuters reported that by focusing the green label on climate friendly projects the system aims to make those investments more attractive to private capital and stop greenwashing where companies or investors overstate their eco friendly credentials the brussels proposal sets conditions for the inclusion of nuclear and gas including a time limit for the construction of new nuclear power plants projects will have to have obtained a building permit before 2045 work to extend the life of existing plants will have to be authorized before 2040 it also required guarantees regarding waste treatment and the dismantling of nuclear installations at the end of their operational life the eu draft text which has been under discussion for months was sent to all member states on 12 31 21 member states have four months to decide whether to support the final document given the contentious nature of the debate within the eu so far it is likely the decision will be postponed while the eu sorts things out poland company overseeing nuclear project announces preferred site in pomerania nucnet warsaw has ambitious new build plans and is targeting commercial operation of first reactor in 2033 a site in the northern province of pomerania near the baltic coast has been selected as the preferred location for poland s first commercial nuclear power station polskie elektrownie jdr pej the company charged with managing the project said in a media statement monitored in brussels the largest city in the region is gdansk the site lubiatowo kopalino in the coastal province of choczewo was chosen on the basis of detailed site investigation and environmental surveys according to pej three of the key factors in choosing the site were the area s lack of existing stable power generation unlimited access to cooling water and the potential for transport of oversized loads by sea at the beginning of the site selection process more than 90 potential locations were considered analysis took into account factors such as land features availability of cooling water nature conservation and infrastructure pej said it will now apply for administrative approvals and permits we are working as planned and the site selection has confirmed it said anna moskwa minister of climate and environment piotr naimski the government s lead official for strategic energy infrastructure said poland aims to diversify its energy mix and the announcement of a preferred nuclear power station site is tangible proof of that fact poland wants to build from 6 000 to 9 000 mwe of installed nuclear capacity based on proven large scale pressurized water nuclear reactors of the generation iii and iii design commercial operation of a first nuclear reactor unit in a proposed set of six is planned for 2033 pej has not yet chosen the technology type for the project but france s edf us based westinghouse and south korea have all expressed their formal interest in warsaw s nuclear plans in july 2021 edf opened an office in warsaw to support the preparation of a nuclear offer at the time the company said the move confirmed its long term commitment to support the polish nuclear ambition by proposing the development of four to six epr units in the country in september westinghouse opened a global shared services centre in krakow where about 160 staff will work to support the company s global operations and to provide poland with the best technology to support its climate change goals and secure the energy needs of its economy separately there is intense competion among us and uk vendors to sell small modular reactors smrs to polish industrial firms that want them for their ability to provide combined heat and power to their plants ge hitachi recently announced it has hired bwxt canada to build the major components of 10 bwrx300 smrs to be sold to polish firms south korean presidential candidate calls for nuclear energy exports main opposition presidential candidate yoon suk yeol said last week that he will export 10 nuclear power plants by 2030 if elected and he continued to slam the moon jae in administration s nuclear phase out policy yoon said he will deepen nuclear cooperation with the united states to create 100 000 jobs by winning orders for more than 10 nuclear power plants from eastern europe and the middle east yoon said he will form a pan governmental organization for exports of nuclear power plants and build a process to push for exports of nuclear power plants by strengthening the foundation for exports of nuclear power plants i will create decent jobs at home and abroad for future generations yoon said yoon also vowed to resume construction of two nuclear reactors shin hanul no 3 and no 4 construction work for the two reactors has been suspended since 2017 under the nuclear phase out policy he announced the campaign pledges on the nuclear industry as he visited the construction site of the two reactors in the coastal county of uljin 330 kilometers southeast of seoul the nuclear phase out scheme set by moon s government centers on refraining from building additional plants while retiring old ones under the roadmap south korea plans to decrease the number of nuclear plants in operation to 17 by 2034 from this year s 24 voters go to the polls on march 9 2022 there are multiple candidates who are on the ballot and nuclear energy isn t a leading issue with voters moon has seen a significant drop in his ratings in the polls which accounts for the number of candidates who want his job south korea announces new plan on nuclear fusion r d south korea s national fusion research institute is leading the development of its superconducting tokamak advanced research kstar project minister of science and ict lim hye sook visited the national fusion research institute and attended a virtual fusion reactor demonstration on 12 30 21 the government is preparing an r d roadmap regarding a demonstration reactor for nuclear fusion based power generation she said adding it is going to provide extensive support for the commercialization of nuclear fusion energy she said the new plan of the government also focuses on commercial nuclear fusion in order to be able to initiate nuclear fusion based power generation in the 2050s it is going to accelerate the development of eight key technologies and increase the domestic procurement of key components in terms of progress to date the minister said the ultra high temperature of 100 million degrees celsius was maintained for 30 seconds which is a world record the institute is planning to continue to improve its technology so that the temperature can be maintained for 300 seconds in 2026 which is critical for commercial nuclear fusion at the same time it is going to work more closely with other governments so that the development of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor can be accelerated and related construction plans can be improved japanese heavy industries sign on to supply chain for terrapower s wyoming nuclear project wire services the japan atomic energy agency jaea and mitsubishi heavy industries ltd 7011 t are set to cooperate with terrapower to build an advanced nulear reactor in wyoming the project is funded under a cost sharing arrangement with the u s department of energy under its advanced reactors demonstration program the 345 mwe sodium cooled reactor is intended to replace an existing operational coal fired power plant natrium reactor fact sheet jaea and mitsubishi heavy industries mhi will provide technical support and data from their respective subject matter experts mhi is also expected to be a supplier of some of the key components of the reactor the japan times reports while the specifics of the collaboration are still being discussed the jaea is also considering using its sodium experimental facility athena in ibaraki prefecture to develop safety technology jaea which has a history of operating sodium cooled fast

by matthieu favas finance correspondent the economist c ovid 19 has had a counter intuitive effect on food prices in early 2020 when much of the world went into lockdown the fear was that stockpiling and closed borders would cause prices to rise instead they barely budged it was only months later when the pandemic seemed to ease off in the rich world and economies reopened that prices started to climb alarmingly fast by may 2021 they had reached their highest point since 2011 after rising by 40 in 12 months according to an index from the un s food and agriculture organisation in 2022 the same forces that created this surge will continue to cause trouble which means there is little chance that prices will cool a key factor explaining the boom is an outbreak of swine flu in china in 2018 which reduced its pig herd by half that forced the country to import a lot of pork and alternative sources of protein chiefly poultry and fish along with the grain to feed them throughout 2019 and 2020 reducing global stocks the ensuing restocking seemed to be nearly over by the middle of 2021 but evidence that the disease has been spreading again is feeding fears of another cull those doubts will persist in 2022 helping to keep food markets volatile a key factor explaining the boom is the outbreak of swine flu in china in 2018 another factor has been the spate of logistical hiccups caused by the swift reopening of international trade at a time when covid 19 is still gumming up activity at important bottlenecks a shortage of containers as well as the continued grounding of many passenger planes which often carry the most delicate foodstuffs in their bellies mean that shipping fresh fruit and vegetables remains tricky staples like grain and sugar travel by bulk on huge ships but capacity there is also limited it does not help that oil prices have rebounded fuelling inflation in everything from fertilisers and chemicals to the cost of transport across fields and oceans in the coming year these forces may abate but only gradually but perhaps the greatest source of uncertainty as ever with agriculture will be the weather in early 2021 prices rose partly as a result of droughts in the grain producing regions of north and south america planting and harvest conditions improved throughout the year but scientists now think there is a high probability of another la niña a weather event of the sort that disturbed climate patterns a year ago over the winter meanwhile disasters made more frequent by climate change such as floods and wildfires of which there were plenty in 2021 may hurt production in the world s breadbaskets more severely this time around prices will probably remain below the peaks reached in 2007 08 still barring a worst case scenario the world should have no reason to panic despite recent inflation prices will probably remain below the peaks reached in 2007 08 when a global food scare sparked riots across the world most countries have eschewed the kind of protectionist measures export bans and stockpiling that inflamed the crisis back then and much of the food people consume is processed which means the higher cost of raw materials is often partly absorbed by those who transport process and market it at every step but dearer agricultural commodities will still cause great harm in developing countries because their populations eat much less processed food more eggs and coarse grain fewer chocolate bars and ready meals and processing margins there are often thinner the harm will be exacerbated by other problems that hit poor countries the hardest such as the depreciation of local currencies covid related restrictions and disruptions and the loss of household income because of the pandemic and its fallout a powerful remedy would be vaccination so that economies outside the rich world can reopen for good and their incomes start to rise again unfortunately the prospects for rapid progress on that front are dim matthieu favas finance correspondent the economist this article appeared in the finance section of the print edition of the world ahead 2022 under the headline unhappy meal

update this article is outdated for the latest winter storm forecast information please refer to my newest weather blog post what s new since my comprehensive sunday morning weather blog post we have two more model runs and a lot more analysis under our meteorological belts the bottom line of this winter storm forecast remains the same significant snow for south jersey hardly anything for north jersey our initial big cooldown is on schedule as temperatures have already started to cool rapidly in the northwest corner of the state thermometers will tumble about 25 degrees within a few hours sunday night accompanied by a brisk northwest wind for my latest snowfall forecast map i decided to compress the totals a bit dry north jersey goes down snowy south jersey goes up the contours the lines and colors pretty much stayed the same on this map i just tweaked the numbers a bit latest snow accumulation forecast for monday as of sunday evening dan zarrow townsquare media latest snow accumulation forecast for monday as of sunday evening dan zarrow townsquare media loading going by raw model output maximum snowfall for inland south jersey would be on the order of 20 inches yikes but don t pay attention to that drama and hype there are so many limiting factors at play dry air warm ground rain mix at onset i think we ll end up far from those huge totals but still firmly within plowable snow range for all or part of 8 counties in the southern half of nj one of the biggest challenges in this forecast is nailing down the duration of initial mixing we should be all snow by 9 a m at the latest the other big issue is figuring out the most likely location of heavier mesoscale snow bands that will develop monday morning the rest of this article takes a question and answer format to run down when and how this winter storm may affect you why does this storm seem like such a surprise if you scroll back through my blogroll you ll see we have been peripherally watching this chance of wintry weather since last monday but i largely wrote it off figuring post frontal dry air would win out and the storm will stay off the coast then models took a dramatic shift late on saturday leading forecasters including myself to take the snow threat much more seriously in addition coming off winter break many new jerseyans are headed back to school and back to work on monday for the first time in 2022 i m sure many of them haven t paid close attention to the weather forecast while on vacation of course it is january now on average our second snowiest month of the year behind february what is the overall timeline for the snow first snowflakes and raindrops will enter southern new jersey just after midnight sunday night spreading northward through early monday morning we ll enter the brunt of the storm the period of heaviest and most widespread precipitation bands starting about 5 a m that s when the snow will begin to accumulate first on cold and grassy surfaces and then eventually on paved roadways sidewalks etc note yes it will likely take several hours for falling snow to stick and start to accumulate snow should start to taper by mid monday afternoon with much improved conditions by the evening commute final flakes should fall in new jersey by 6 p m monday at the latest when will be the worst time to travel generally monday morning let s say 8 a m to noon there s reason to hope the heaviest snow bands will hold off until mid to late morning after the am rush hours road crews wil hopefully be able to get ahead of the snowy icy conditions through the afternoon will it be all snow winter storms are always complicated a difference of a single degree on the thermometer can lead to a completely different scenario in this case i do think temperatures at the surface in southeastern new jersey will be just above freezing at the onset of precipitation that means through the morning commute much of south jersey will probably experience rain and or icy mix for several hours no accumulation yet eventually temperatures will fall below freezing statewide for the duration as i mentioned above after 9 a m at the latest everything that falls from the sky will be snow through the rest of the storm how much snow will fall how much snow will stick as i referenced above it may take a while for snow to start to whiten up the ground so the answers to those two questions are very different and it s really the second once that matters accumulations i ve bumped up my snow totals in se nj to 5 to 10 inches that qualifies as a major winter storm leading to widespread travel disruptions snow plows are revving their engines and shovels are ready for the first use of the season if i had to guess the overall snow bullseye will probably be inland atlantic county farther north up to a line between about salem and brick moderate snowfall of 3 to 6 inches is forecast certainly enough to slicken up roads snarl traffic and force schools business to close it s important to note that the bottom and top of these snowfall ranges represent the lowest and highest case scenario respectively this is very much a boom or bust situation and i do not expect snow totals in the middle of those ranges here the nam model forecast as of 10 a m this is the least snowy solution keeping accumulating snow over a stretch of southern and coastal nj only college of dupage meteorology the nam model forecast as of 10 a m this is the least snowy solution keeping accumulating snow over a stretch of southern and coastal nj only college of dupage meteorology loading the gfs model forecast as of 10 a m monday this is the most widespread snow scenario with accumulations reaching through central nj the southern coast still sees the heaviest snowfall and biggest totals in this solution college of dupage meteorology the gfs model forecast as of 10 a m monday this is the most widespread snow scenario with accumulations reaching through central nj the southern coast still sees the heaviest snowfall and biggest totals in this solution college of dupage meteorology loading how far north will accumulating snow reach south of a trenton perth amboy line it does look like a snowy morning although that s not a slam dunk forecast i ve cautiously painted 1 to 3 inches for the i 195 and i 295 corridors and the farther north you go the harder it will be to see any snow accumulation that s because north jersey will be pretty far from the center of the storm system and it s also because dry air will prevent precipitation from fully reaching the ground on my latest snow map above i have noted the possibility of a coating or an inch of snow along and south of the nj turnpike corridor note zero is also a distinct possibility here far nw nj this isn t your storm flurries are possible but little to no accumulation any other issues to know about northerly wind gusts will probably hover near 30 mph for most of the day the high res nam model shows 30 mph wind gusts through the afternoon the high res nam model shows 30 mph wind gusts through the afternoon loading that will contribute to blowing snow and further reductions in visibility that could also lead to power outages due to downed trees and power lines finally the wind chill the feels like temperature will be stuck in the teens all day long bundle up what warnings advisories have been issued a winter storm warning pink and winter weather advisory purple blankets the southern half of nj from 4 a m to 4 p m monday townsquare media aerisweather a winter storm warning pink and winter weather advisory purple blankets the southern half of nj from 4 a m to 4 p m monday townsquare media aerisweather loading a winter storm warning has been posted for ocean southeastern burlington atlantic cape may and cumberland counties from 4 a m to 4 p m monday that is the most likely location of heavy snow and the most likely time frame for treacherous travel a less urgent less severe winter weather advisory has been issued for salem gloucester camden and northwestern burlington counties for the same time frame 4 a m to 4 p m monday less snow on the

tide cycle townsquare media aerisweather loading a coastal flood warning is also posted for atlantic and cape may counties the monday morning midday high tide cycle is forecast to cause widespread moderate flooding of tidal waterways that may necessitate road closures and could even cause property damage farther up the jersey shore a coastal flood advisory called for minor category flooding at high tide monday what should i do to prepare for the storm by now you ve already taken the most important step you know there s going to be a winter storm in the neighborhood make sure all your friends and family know of the potentially bad weather on the way carefully consider your plans on monday and whether it will be safe to travel during your normal routine the answer to that question will depend largely on what when and where those plans are your vehicle your driving ability etc school superintendents business owners and organization leaders within the warning zone and the advisory too should consider whether to close school on monday or switch to a remote learning day as i ve said previously there seems to be little point to a delayed opening or early dismissal for this one if you haven t already it s probably not too late to stock up on salt batteries and or french toast supplies you may want to strategically park your vehicles to mitigate snow and or coastal flooding issues finally be ready to change your plans as the weather goes downhill and the forecast evolves throughout the day monday what s next our on air and online coverage will ramp up starting early monday morning i take over the weather center at 3 a m for the duration of the storm expect one more comprehensive online write up about the snow potential around 7 a m monday and then regular

this year was supposed to be one of recovery but it has been far from that it began with the insurrection at the capitol a second impeachment of then president donald trump and president biden s inauguration as the year went on trump continued to lie about the election results while he remained one of the most popular figures among republicans with new coronavirus variants the deadly pandemic has continued to drag on and even though the stock market has boomed and unemployment is down americans have felt the pinch of rising prices biden has paid the political price ending the year with his approval ratings at their lowest point since he took office as we count down to the new year we asked our readers what they thought were the top political stories of 2021 more than 1 000 responded here s what they picked 10 afghanistan withdrawal as he promised on the campaign trail biden ended the united states almost 20 year war in afghanistan america s longest war but the withdrawal of troops was chaotic and deadly with 13 u s servicemembers and some 170 afghans killed in a suicide bombing by the kabul airport the u s and its afghan allies didn t foresee the speed at which the taliban would take control of the country it has meant a reversal of years of progress for women s rights in afghanistan and it hurt u s credibility abroad and biden s credibility at home that he could govern competently 9 extreme weather events david mcnew getty images getty images the windy fire blazes through the long meadow grove of giant sequoia trees on sept 21 near california hot springs floods tornadoes fires and drought all were too common in 2021 multiple one in 1 000 year events aren t supposed to happen in a single year but that s exactly what happened in 2021 as the climate continues to change and legislators appear paralyzed to find solutions and as global emissions and temperatures rise the number of weather disasters is likely only to increase 8 rise of the far right in the house this year has seen the trump wing of the republican party continue to be ascendant led by brash and controversial far right voices in the house gop members like reps marjorie taylor greene of georgia and lauren boebert of colorado seem more in touch with the base than minority leader kevin mccarthy and senate republican leader mitch mcconnell the intraparty divisions came to a head with an altered anime video by rep paul gosar r ariz that portrayed him killing new york democratic rep alexandria ocasio cortez and attacking biden with knives the house censured gosar but only two republicans voted with democrats liz cheney of wyoming and adam kinzinger of illinois both of whom have already broken with trump 7 biden and harris take office mandel ngan afp via getty images afp via getty images president biden and vice president harris arrive on the south lawn of the white house on nov 15 for a signing ceremony for the infrastructure bill they were elected largely in response to trump and the coronavirus pandemic trump was one of the most divisive figures in the history of the office and biden ran as something of a panacea and his running mate kamala harris was a historic pick the first woman first asian american and first black vice president their supporters saw a brighter day on the horizon but that would soon dim biden was able to get through a covid 19 relief bill and eventually infrastructure legislation but democratic infighting got most of the attention the right found its footing in opposition to biden biden s popularity hit its lowest point at the end of the year and harris favorability ratings tanked the duo has to hope for a turnaround in the pandemic and for inflation to recede to turn around their prospects 6 jan 6 committee investigation the democratic led congressional committee looking into what happened on jan 6 hit its stride toward the end of the year it issued dozens of subpoenas held trump officials who didn t cooperate in contempt and read explosive text messages from the former president s son and fox news personalities all urging trump s then chief of staff to get him to call off the insurrection the clock is ticking on the committee however if it hopes to piece together all of what was happening behind the scenes republicans are favored to take back control of the house in 2022 and in all likelihood would shut down the investigation 5 trump s continued lies about the election trump lost the 2020 presidential election but he was never able to accept that for a man who built his brand on winning losing was unacceptable he s lost plenty in his life he s taken businesses into bankruptcy and written off almost 1 billion in losses but he was always able to spin his way out of those things that was far more difficult to do with a presidential election so his only off ramp was to lie about what happened trump has continued to falsely assert that he won when he didn t and managed to convince millions of his followers of the same the first time since the civil war that there wasn t a peaceful transfer of power with both sides accepting the outcome 4 new restrictive voting laws tamir kalifa getty images getty images demonstrators gather outside the texas state capitol in austin during a voting rights rally on july 8 states have moved in opposite directions this year when it comes to voting laws democratic led states like nevada or california have codified expansions offered during the pandemic while republican led states have enacted new restrictions on voting the most notable changes have happened in those gop led states like arizona georgia florida texas iowa and montana most of these states enacted an omnibus package with many new restrictions such as to mail in voting all in the name of restoring election integrity some other key states would have joined them had they not had democratic governors veto the legislation 3 ongoing coronavirus pandemic more than 800 000 americans have now died from covid 19 biden was close to declaring independence from the coronavirus in july as a result of widespread distribution of the vaccine and dropping case numbers but the delta variant led to more infections and more restrictions and fears began to rise again toward the end of the year with the massive surge in cases due to the omicron variant which has infected many who are vaccinated 2 abortion restrictions and court battles chip somodevilla getty images getty images demonstrators gather in front of the u s supreme court on dec 1 as the justices hear arguments in a key case about a mississippi abortion law the landmark u s supreme court decision that made abortion legal in this country appears in jeopardy trump s appointment of three conservative leaning justices has meant that this year the high court took steps to gut roe v wade all indications are that it will uphold restrictions like a 15 week ban in mississippi and it has so far let a texas law stand that has all but shut down access to abortion in the state 1 jan 6 insurrection no shock here this was an unprecedented event that capped off a chaotic trump presidency a mob of pro trump supporters breached the capitol building and marauded through the halls in an attempt to disrupt the ceremonial counting of states votes that confirmed biden s victory in the 2020 election despite the violent images broadcast on television the handful of deaths 140 members of law enforcement who were injured and more than 1 million in damage as a result some on the right continue to dismiss what happened calling it a peaceful protest so far more than 700 people have been charged with crimes due to their actions that day copyright 2023 npr to see more visit

beijing seeks more control of supply and prices of rare metals beijing s creation last month of a new group that will produce more than a third of its rare metals shows it wants more control over global supply and pricing of these strategic materials and the ability to use them in a trade war the new group is a merger of minmetals rare earth chinalco rare earths metals co and china southern rare group co the group has not been named it is based in ganzhou jiangxi province a national centre for production of the 17 minerals used in smart electronic devices electric cars and military equipment the biggest shareholder is china state assets supervision and administration commission which owns a stake of 31 12 per cent the new group will control 37 6 per cent of china s rare metals mining including nearly 70 per cent of its heavy raw metals it will own resources in jiangxi sichuan hunan guangxi and shandong it becomes the second biggest company in the field in the country after china northern rare earth group which is based in baotou inner mongolia and listed on the shanghai stock exchange according to a report by the u s geological survey in 2015 china has 55 million tonnes in reserves of rare metals out of the 130 million in the world ranking number one it is the only country with reserves of all 17 minerals this gives it rare bargaining power in the world market in 1992 deng xiaoping said the middle east has oil china has rare metals in a trade war with the united states japan or other countries they would be a potent weapon in a bulletin in may 2019 the national development and reform commission said will rare earths become china s counter weapon against the u s unwarranted suppression what i can tell you is that if anyone wants to use products made from rare earth to curb the development of china the whole chinese people will not be happy the rationale for the new group was laid out on march 1 last year by xiao yaqing minister of industry and information technology and formerly head of chinalco our rare earths do not sell at the rare price but at the earth price because of competitive bidding which wasted the precious resources xiao told a news briefing in beijing the government should play a role in maintaining market order loosen what can be loosened and control what should be controlled some companies are producing excessive amounts of rare metals causing environmental issues and leading to low resource utilization rates he said other problems are smuggling and illegal mining during 2021 prices of rare earths were erratic that of praseodymium neodymium reached record levels because of strong demand from makers of electric cars but those of cerium and lanthanum used in catalysts for oil refining were depressed due to abundant supply zhou lisha a researcher with the institute for state owned enterprises at tsinghua university said that the new group would increase investment strengthen research and development and promote the sector s shift toward more value added and technology intensive growth it will increase the influence of market leaders facilitate phasing out of outdated capacity for better allocation of resources and spur high quality development in the sector she said in 2014 china accounted for 86 per cent of global output of rare metals this dominance alarmed countries in the west whose industries rely on the materials in the 1980s the u s used to be the world s largest producer but closed mines because of the high cost and heavy environmental damage since 2014 production abroad has increased faster than in china in 2020 the u s produced 38 000 tonnes 36 per cent higher than in 2019 output in myanmar in 2020 reached 30 000 tonnes up 20 per cent and in madagascar 8 000 tonnes double that in 2019 china s production in 2020 was 140 000 tonnes up six per cent year on year giving it a 58 3 per cent share of global output this reduction in market share limits beijing s ability to use rare metals as a tool in a trade war many of them are used in intermediate and downstream products often made in third countries before being shipped to the u s restrictions would also tell customers that china was an unreliable supplier in any event the formation of the new group is a step in preparing beijing for such a conflict contact us at

hospitals ban visitors as dramatic rise in omicron cases among staff makes 25 000 workers absent on new year s day some of britain s biggest hospitals are banning visitors amid concerns about the dramatic rise in omicron cases more than 110 000 of service s 983 000 staff in england missed the turn of the year due to any type of illness but 50 000 of these health service employees were forced into self isolation after testing positive for covid the figure was a huge jump on those off over boxing day when less than 25 000 were out of work due to virus patients faced 40 hour waits at a e delayed operations and long waits for ambulances as the nhs creaked some of britain s biggest hospitals are banning visitors amid concerns about the dramatic rise in omicron cases they included guy s and st thomas and barts in london along with trusts in bath ipswich lancaster liverpool nottingham preston rotherham sheffield and sunderland several other major trusts had already reinstated bans from november nhs bosses said the new rules set to be in place for several weeks were among difficult choices faced by hospitals coping with a very tough situation due to the omicron surge visiting is now only allowed in exceptional circumstances such as when a patient is dying if they are a child or an elderly person with dementia and women giving birth sir john hayes chairman of the common sense group of backbench tory mps said it could be fair to say this is lockdown by the backdoor but chris hopson chief executive of nhs providers which represents nhs trusts said no trust makes the decision to suspend or restrict visiting lightly but patient safe it came as official figures revealed that less than half of the nhs staff off sick on new year s eve had coronavirus fewer than 50 000 of the 110 000 not in work on the day had the virus the nhs dashboard shows the total figure meant one in 10 of the health service s employees which amounts to some 983 000 people were not in hospitals due to illness compared to pre pandemic levels it showed a five percentage point rise in the number of people off sick over the period the figure was also higher than those off over boxing day when fewer than 25 000 were out of work due to the virus the nhs has not revealed what those not suffering from coronavirus were ill with on new year s eve and boxing day meanwhile patients faced 40 hour waits at a e delayed operations and long waits for ambulances as the health service creaked one nhs boss warned operations could start being cancelled from next week if hospitalisations surge and said the country will need to bring in more restrictions the chief executive of nhs providers said the next few days are crucial and the health service was under arguably more pressure than this time last year it comes as the omicron variant continues to wreak havoc across the country as infections continue to rise forcing people to lock themselves away for a week there were 137 583 new cases in england and wales on sunday compared with 162 572 cases in england on saturday according to government data there were 73 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in england and wales a drop on the 154 reported in england on saturday the data for scotland and northern ireland will be updated after the new year holiday elsewhere in coronavirus chaos today ministers have rejected calls to reduce the isolation period for coronavirus sufferers from seven to five days bosses warned nhs trusts could start cancelling operations next week if covid hospitalisations escalate black people are more than three times more likely than average to have been hospitalised with omicron secondary school pupils will be told to wear face masks from the moment they arrive until they leave a pregnant woman has become the first person in the world to be infected with covid and the flu in israel just one in 40 nhs hospital staff were unavailable to work because of covid late last month official figures show while official figures show the number off with covid did double in the run up to christmas the virus has prevented only a small fraction of hospital staff from working file image ministers say no to five day covid isolation fears rise that schools hospitals and transport networks could grind to a halt as government defies calls from business chiefs to follow the us lead because up to 30 of sufferers would still be infectious ministers have rejected calls to reduce the isolation period for covid sufferers from seven to five days because up to 30 per cent would still be infectious business leaders and some tory mps had urged ministers to follow the lead of other countries including the us and greece by cutting self isolation for those showing no symptoms to five days but a government source told the mail on sunday that while the option was discussed it was rejected because so many people could still go on to infect others if released from self isolation that early it comes amid growing concern that lengthy self isolation is harming vital services and the economy and with a growing row over the lack of access to lateral flow tests lfts as millions prepared to return to work after the festive break labour accused the government of failing to order sufficient numbers of lfts which are increasingly seen as essential to keep the country moving while minimising the threat from omicron advertisement the 110 000 figure for nhs staff off over new year s eve was for all the health service s workers the nhs dashboard showed by december 31 86 716 were off with illness at acute trusts a leap of 27 per cent of these 49 921 were away for coronavirus related reasons which was up 62 per cent in just five days these were 19 143 nurses and midwives and 2 120 doctors this was a huge leap on boxing day when just one in 40 nhs hospital staff were unavailable to work because of covid nhs england s medical director professor stephen powis last week talked of the nhs being on a war footing a phrase since frequently repeated by broadcasters but while figures show the number off with covid did double in the run up to christmas the virus has prevented only hit a small fraction of hospital staff on december 1 12 508 staff at english hospitals were absent due to covid 19 either through sickness or self isolation according to data from nhs england by boxing day that had almost doubled to 24 632 but with 983 000 working in nhs hospitals in england according to official workforce statistics for 2021 it means only 2 5 per cent of the workforce or one in 40 were off due to covid towards the end of the month meanwhile non covid sickness absences actually fell over the same period from 47 628 on december 1 to 43 450 on boxing day as a result overall sickness related absences among nhs hospital staff only rose by 13 per cent in december from 60 136 on the first of the month to 68 082 on december 26 consequently around 93 per cent of hospital staff were still fit and healthy from a work point of view at christmas however the picture is varied between england s 138 nhs hospital trusts five reported overall sickness or self isolation absences exceeding ten per cent on boxing day sheffield teaching hospitals 12 2 per cent nottingham university hospitals 12 per cent wirral university teaching hospitals 10 9 per cent warrington and halton hospitals 10 8 per cent and manchester

university hospital in london 7 1 per cent royal united hospitals bath 6 9 per cent and sheffield teaching hospitals 6 7 per cent but nine reported covid related absences of less than one per cent of their workforce on december 26 compared to pre pandemic levels the figures for new years eve showed a five percentage point rise with december 2019 only having 4 69 per cent of staff off in total nhs trusts could start cancelling operations next week if covid hospitalisations escalate significantly hospital chiefs have warned modelling shown to ministers suggests that hospital admissions are doubling every 16 days and could peak in the middle of january pictured an nhs health worker at a pop up vaccination centre at redbridge town hall east london on christmas day black patients are over three times more likely than average to have been hospitalised with omicron figures show black people are more than three times more likely than average to have been hospitalised with omicron while black communities make up about 3 5 per cent of england s population data from the uk health security agency shows they make up 12 5 per cent of those who have ended up in hospital with the variant so far the number may be even higher as ethnicity was not recorded in more than a fifth of cases advertisement chief executive of nhs providers chris hopson warned more restrictions may be needed soon to stem the flow of patients ending up in hospital he said that any more people flooding in will see already flat out staff being asked to perform flexible heroics again he wrote on twitter nhs now under different arguably more pressure compared to last jan much busier urgent and emergency care pathway many more planned care cases that cannot be delayed without patient harm booster vaccination campaign significantly more resource intensive complex staff absences having greater impact in many trusts much greater pressure on social primary care all having big impact nhs community mental health ambulances and hospitals alike and social care beyond full stretch staff facing mountainous workload day in day out he continued if growth rates go back up again e g xmas effect trusts likely to have to start standing up extra surge capacity late next week putting pressure on less urgent elective activity trusts will do all they can to keep going with urgent and high priority elective activity he added nhs not been able to grow capacity to meet growing demand had to try to close gap by asking staff to work harder giving them an impossible workload meaning they can t provide care they feel patients need and successive govts failed to solve growing social care problems these are all major contributors to current issues and need to be addressed longer term but secondly right now nhs facing potential immediate emergency it needs to prepare for he added choice could potentially be leaving patients untreated or creating extra temporary capacity his comments are a dramatic volte face as before the new year he said there was no need for any new lockdown measures to tackle omicron because severe cases are remaining stable secondary school pupils will be told to wear face masks all day when they return this week secondary school pupils will be told to wear face masks from the moment they arrive until they leave when they return to classrooms this week in a desperate effort to protect the education of millions of youngsters amid a sharp rise in cases of the omicron variant ministers have requested that pupils cover their faces all day including while they are being taught students are already asked to wear masks in communal areas education secretary nadhim zahawi last night said he and boris johnson saw schools as their no 1 priority adding that they wanted to do everything in our power to minimise disruption advertisement england s covid cases breached 160 000 for the second time in as many days yesterday data showed as ministers continued to avoid enforcing new restrictions uk health security agency data shows there were 162 572 new infections over the last 24 hours an increase of 33 per cent on the number recorded on christmas day when there were 121 880 it is the highest total reported on a day in england ever with 160 276 cases recorded on friday some 154 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded across the nation up 83 per cent from the 84 recorded in the uk last week figures were not available for wales scotland and northern ireland because of differences in reporting schedules over the new year weekend hospitalisation data was also not updated the figures come after millions of britons partied into 2022 at late night venues across restriction free england on new year s eve thousands came from scotland where measures such as table service in bars and no nightclubs prompted them to seek entertainment on the far side of the river tweed revellers joined boozy celebrations from newcastle to portsmouth and manchester to brighton on the final day of 2021 as they ignored the threat from omicron partygoers packed into pubs bars and clubs until the early hours of the morning despite heightened fears about the spread of the covid after the uk recorded 189 846 new cases on friday and 203 deaths the office for national statistics reported an estimated 2 3million people in the uk had the virus in the week ending december 23 setting another pandemic record but in a fresh boost for the nation s businesses sajid javid hinted tighter restrictions remain unlikely as he implored the nation to try to live alongside the virus secondary school pupils will be told to wear face masks all day when they return this week as pm says keeping classrooms open is his number one priority in the face of omicron and testing chaos students will have to wear masks in all communal areas including classrooms ministers are bringing in the rules because of the threat posed by omicron the rule will not be law although schools will be expected to follow the guidance ministers are braced for a big bang when pupils are tested returning to school secondary school pupils will be told to wear face masks from the moment they arrive until they leave when they return to classrooms this week in a desperate effort to protect the education of millions of youngsters amid a sharp rise in cases of the omicron variant ministers have requested that pupils cover their faces all day including while they are being taught students are already asked to wear masks in communal areas education secretary nadhim zahawi last night said he and boris johnson saw schools as their no 1 priority adding that they wanted to do everything in our power to minimise disruption school teachers and pupils will have to wear masks when they return to the classroom next week under new guidance issued by the government british made lateral flow tests are banned in uk despite being cleared for use in eu the government is relying on chinese suppliers for lateral flow testing kits because most british manufacturers have failed to be cleared for use in the uk it has been claimed despite millions of pounds of investment to create a world leading testing programme in the uk only one british manufacturer has produced a rapid test that meets uk requirements reports suggest according to the sunday times several british companies are frustrated that despite their tests being certified for use in europe they have not passed checks in the uk the newspaper reports that omega diagnostics based in stirling and global access diagnostics a bedford based firm have produced testing kits that did not pass regulation and so the government has not placed any orders with them both companies were in receipt of government funding after signing contracts in march 2021 the sunday times reports and it is understood the government is now asking for 2 5million to be repaid by omega advertisement the wearing of masks is not a legal requirement but ministers expect schools to follow the guidance which also applies to teachers and support staff the measures will be reviewed on january 26 with a government source saying they will not be in place a minute longer than they need to be and adding it is obviously a better classroom experience without masks ministers are braced for a big bang of omicron cases and staff shortages when students and teachers are tested for coronavirus this week a substantial surge in either could see larger class sizes or a return to remote learning for some pupils in london where rates of omicron are particularly high parents have been warned that school closures cannot be ruled out as a general rule the more you test the more you are going to find covid the source said but the idea is that by containing it early you stop the spread in schools many mps are opposed to online lessons given the damage already done to the education of millions of youngsters by successive lockdowns writing in the mail on sunday today conservative mp robert halfon who chairs the education select committee says pupils do not need to take any more time off every day lost is another day that we are damaging children s lives as well as the new measures on masks the government is deploying 7 000 extra air cleaning units across the education sector to improve ventilation and slow the spread of omicron the schools regulator ofcom is also temporarily suspending inspections ministers fear there will be a massive increase in omicron cases when children return to the classroom next week education secretary nadhim zahawi last night said he and boris johnson saw schools as their no 1 priority adding that they wanted to do everything in our power to minimise disruption the moves came as a daily record of 162 572 covid cases was recorded in england up 47 9 per cent on last saturday there were 1 915 hospital admissions up almost 50 per cent week on week and 154 deaths ministers rejected calls to cut the isolation period for those with covid 19 from seven to five days because up to 30 per cent would still be infectious the continued shortage of lateral flow tests sparked fears of staff shortages in schools and hospitals and travel chaos when britain returns to work this week official figures show that 132 million coronavirus jabs were given last year with more than 90 per cent of over 12s now having had at least one jab health secretary sajid javid said the figure was astounding and a true reflection of the fantastic work of our nhs and its volunteers the head of nhs providers which represents health trusts said the next few days would be crucial in understanding the impact of omicron and ministers must be ready to introduce new restrictions at pace if they re needed as a dozen hospitals temporarily suspended routine visits the british medical association said further public health measures should be urgently introduced but analysis of official figures reveal that just one in 40 nhs hospital staff were unavailable to work because of coronavirus in late december mps called for action after health trusts reintroduced covid restrictions which force pregnant women to attend scans and appointments alone thousands of revellers from scotland and wales where tougher coronavirus restrictions are in place crossed the border into england to welcome in

sensible move given the circumstances dr mary bousted joint general secretary of the national education union neu said the decision was overdue and urged ministers to make it a requirement no 10 is understood to have ruled out a return of the bubble system which saw entire classes and sometimes years sent home if a single pupil tested positive that s all in the past we want to carry on classroom teaching the source said given the prospect of staff shortages ministers have renewed efforts to lure retired teachers back to the classroom a website through which former teachers can volunteer has received 30 000 visits and tory mps jonathan gullis and caroline ansell both qualified teachers have signed up teaching unions broadly welcomed the government s move on masks paul whiteman general secretary of the national association of head teachers said reintroducing face masks in secondary classrooms appears to be a sensible move given the circumstances prime minister boris johnson pictured has been warned to expect a big bang of omicron cases in schools when they return next week teachers and support staff will also be required to wear masks the measures will be reviewed on january 26 tom hunt another conservative mp who sits on the education select committee urged the government to keep an open mind on reducing the isolation period from seven to five days as countries including the us and greece have done remote learning should not be on the table it is mission critical to keep schools open and keep kids physically in school no stone should be left unturned he said mr hunt also urged teaching unions to be constructive his call came as it emerged guidance issued by the neu advised school leaders that teachers should only have to cover for colleagues on rare occasions further guidance issued by the union before christmas said if you are asked to cover for a colleague who is off with covid or any other absence greater than two days you should refuse to do it chris mcgovern the chairman of the campaign for real education said this is educational sabotage teachers have a choice the best and the bravest will continue to put their pupils first and they will be remembered for doing so ministers say no to five day covid isolation fears rise that schools hospitals and transport networks could grind to a halt as government defies calls from business chiefs to follow the us lead because up to 30 of sufferers would still be infectious by stephen adams for the mail on sunday ministers have rejected calls to reduce the isolation period for covid sufferers from seven to five days because up to 30 per cent would still be infectious business leaders and some tory mps had urged ministers to follow the lead of other countries including the us and greece by cutting self isolation for those showing no symptoms to five days but a government source told the mail on sunday that while the option was discussed it was rejected because so many people could still go on to infect others if released from self isolation that early lateral flow tests have been ring fenced for schools so they can open safely next week commuters face significant disruption because of large numbers of train and bus workers forced to self isolate leading to cancelled services it comes amid growing concern that lengthy self isolation is harming vital services and the economy and with a growing row over the lack of access to lateral flow tests lfts as millions prepared to return to work after the festive break labour accused the government of failing to order sufficient numbers of lfts which are increasingly seen as essential to keep the country moving while minimising the threat from omicron ministers insist hundreds of millions more lfts will soon be available just before christmas self isolation was reduced from ten to seven days as long as the individual is negative for covid on two lfts the first on day six and the second on day seven asked about the proposal for a further cut to five days the government source said the data we have is that almost one in three people could still be infectious five days after testing positive with omicron it isn t thought it would be safe to cut self isolation that far the decision differs from that taken in the us where the influential centers for disease control and prevention said the move to halve self isolation from ten to five days would ensure people can safely continue their daily lives to re enter everyday life after five days americans must be symptom free and wear a mask around others for a further five days in greece health minister thanos plevris indicated that omicron s relative mildness compared with previous variants lay behind its decision to cut the period of self isolation the evidence we have from omicron is encouraging he said rather than solely rely on being symptom free after five days the uk government could in theory require people to have two negative lft results but move them forward to days four and five the system is however self policing and people who test negative on lfts can still be infectious as they are less sensitive than the gold standard pcr tests another consideration would be the current poor availability of lfts with many pharmacies out of stock due to soaring demand isolation is also causing problems in hospitals with nhs staff forced to remain at home last night labour s health spokesman wes streeting said health secretary sajid javid needed to pull his finger out to ensure people had access to the tests he added given how critical testing is going to be over the course of the coming months the government really does need to get an immediate grip on this testing is going to be vital to keep people working and keeping children at school if families can t do that because ministers haven t got their act together they will have a lot to answer for around one million lfts are being taken every day twice as many as pcrs when omicron emerged in early december health officials were adamant there would be enough supplies to meet higher demand mr streeting said the health secretary said before christmas the challenge was distribution not supply and there were plentiful stocks of tests in warehouses but i think it s more likely the government has simply underestimated demand hasn t ordered enough tests and doesn t want to fess up about it ministers insist hundreds of millions of tests will soon be available and education secretary nadhim zahawi says tests have been ringfenced for schools to ensure they can reopen safely this week with britain returning to work this week commuters are also worried that covid related staff shortages will bring misery on trains more than 20 rail companies have already reduced services or plan to do so as a result of covid infections and self isolation rules british made lateral flow tests are banned in uk despite being cleared for use in eu leaving the government relying on swab kits from china british manufacturers reportedly frustrated with strict uk new checks on tests only one british firm surescreen is cleared to supply lateral flow tests to uk government relies heavily on two chinese companies to fill testing requirement the government is relying on chinese suppliers for lateral flow testing kits because most british manufacturers have failed to be cleared for use in the uk it has been claimed despite millions of pounds of investment to create a world leading testing programme in the uk only one british manufacturer has produced a rapid test that meets uk requirements reports suggest according to the sunday times several british companies are frustrated that despite their tests being certified for use in europe they have not passed checks in the uk the newspaper reports that omega diagnostics based in stirling and global access diagnostics a bedford based firm have produced testing kits that did not pass regulation and so the government has not placed any orders with them both companies were in receipt of government funding after signing contracts in march 2021 the sunday times reports and it is understood the government is now asking for 2 5million to be repaid by omega the government is relying on chinese suppliers for lateral flow testing kits because most british manufacturers have failed to be cleared for use in the uk it has been claimed flowflex made by chinese manufacturer acon biotech is one of the approved tests in the uk the delays in approval comes after new regulations were introduced in november which require tests in the uk to pass the coronavirus test device approvals tim peto is a professor of medicine at oxford university is on the committee that checks porton down s assessments of tests he told the times some of the english manufacturers are very unhappy their kits have failed and some of them think that they ve been unfairly tested i don t know on what grounds they think it s unfair other than it came out negative british made tests are now being sold abroad because they are unable to get certification for use in this country the main suppliers of nhs lateral flow tests are chinese brands orient gene made by zhejiang orient gene biotech and flowflex made by acon biotech according to the times who reports that both companies are more experienced in manufacturing lateral flow testing kits on a large scale compared to british companies it comes after the government came under fire for a widespread shortage of testing kits over the christmas period despite ministers urging friends and families to get tested before socialising over christmas and new year people struggled to get hold of kits the government s website frequently suspended the delivery of home tests while walk in appointments for pcr tests were regularly booked up orient gene biotech a chinese firm is one of two major approved manufacturers in the uk surescreen is the only british manufacturer to have received government approval for tests pharmacists called on the government to increase its supply as they said they were being forced to turn customers away empty handed due to a lack of stock in response to the backlash the uk health security agency insisted it had increased its capacity to enable the delivery of 900 000 testing kits a day meanwhile sir roger gale conservative mp for north thanet said he had been told by the health secretary there was a world shortage of testing supplies he told mailonline last week originally it was a delivery problem now it s a supply and delivery problem was very upfront and straight about it he said there is a world shortage of lateral flow tests the mp for north thanet added the british company making them has cranked up its production by four times and is now producing 20million a week instead of five million we the brits are buying all those plus anything else we can get our hands on but we are competing with everybody else on a worldwide market pharmacists last week urged the government to increase its supply of lateral flow testing kits as they said they were being forced to send people away empty handed due to a shortage the only approved british supplier of lateral flow devices is derby based surescreen diagnostics who were officially announced in september the government championed the company saying it had created more than 370 jobs in the midlands and that it has the capacity to manufacture 7million tests per week with plans to increase this to 14million by the end of december the ukhsa said in building the largest diagnostic industry in uk history we have delivered 400 million tests since the start of the pandemic playing a vital role in tackling the spread of covid 19 nhs test and trace has drawn on expertise from across

lateral flow tests mother of three 31 gives up being an anti vaxxer and gets two jabs after she and father fell badly ill with covid saja ali 31 was severely ill with covid in february last year which left her bed bound at her home in didsbury for four weeks and hospitalised her father the mother of three got her jabs after recovering and now credits the vaccine with keeping her safe and healthy when she tested positive a second time a mother of three and self proclaimed anti vaxxer has changed her views on vaccinations after contracting coronavirus twice and after the virus hospitalised her father saja ali 31 was severely ill with the virus in february last year leaving her bed bound at her home in didsbury south manchester for four weeks meanwhile her father also contracted the virus and spent 11 days in hospital she admitted that she had not taken up the offer to receive her vaccination at the time because she had been wary of it due to what she had heard and read for me it was all because it was new it was a new vaccine and i was hearing a lot of conspiracy theories she said saja ali 31 was severely ill with the virus in february last year at the time my husband was also really against it i did not think twice about not having a jab then i got it it totally changed my mind a week later my dad caught covid and needed hospital treatment we were prepared for the worst with him he was in hospital for 11 days and needed help it made me think i have three kids and it just made me realise after recovering she got her jabs and is now speaking out to encourage others to get theirs she now credits the vaccination programme with keeping her safe and preventing severe illness once again after she tested positive for the virus a second time before christmas a lot of people are still claiming the vaccine doesn t work she said i think those who have caught covid more than once should speak out to raise awareness the vaccine does work and does prevent worse symptoms i was a complete anti vaxxer until i got covid 19 really really badly back in february i had it again and i honestly felt fine i believe that it was purely down to the vaccine after recovering saja got her jabs and is now speaking out to encourage others to get theirs stock image i felt a bit tired but nothing to stop me doing what i would normally do in a day it was nothing like it was back in february i believe the vaccine won t stop people from being poorly but it will help prevent you from falling really ill and needing hospital treatment britain is currently considering giving out fourth covid vaccines in a bid to stop the surge of omicron cases following the lead of germany and israel the rollout of a second set of boosters is being examined by experts on the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation jcvi those with weakened immune systems are already entitled to a fourth job but the elderly and other vulnerable groups could soon be included advertisement the fourth jab would likely come four months after the third if it gets the green light
update this article is outdated for the latest winter storm forecast information please refer to my newest weather blog post what s new since my comprehensive sunday morning weather blog post we have two more model runs and a lot more analysis under our meteorological belts the bottom line of this winter storm forecast remains the same significant snow for south jersey hardly anything for north jersey our initial big cooldown is on schedule as temperatures have already started to cool rapidly in the northwest corner of the state thermometers will tumble about 25 degrees within a few hours sunday night accompanied by a brisk northwest wind for my latest snowfall forecast map i decided to compress the totals a bit dry north jersey goes down snowy south jersey goes up the contours the lines and colors pretty much stayed the same on this map i just tweaked the numbers a bit latest snow accumulation forecast for monday as of sunday evening dan zarrow townsquare media latest snow accumulation forecast for monday as of sunday evening dan zarrow townsquare media loading going by raw model output maximum snowfall for inland south jersey would be on the order of 20 inches yikes but don t pay attention to that drama and hype there are so many limiting factors at play dry air warm ground rain mix at onset i think we ll end up far from those huge totals but still firmly within plowable snow range for all or part of 8 counties in the southern half of nj one of the biggest challenges in this forecast is nailing down the duration of initial mixing we should be all snow by 9 a m at the latest the other big issue is figuring out the most likely location of heavier mesoscale snow bands that will develop monday morning the rest of this article takes a question and answer format to run down when and how this winter storm may affect you why does this storm seem like such a surprise if you scroll back through my blogroll you ll see we have been peripherally watching this chance of wintry weather since last monday but i largely wrote it off figuring post frontal dry air would win out and the storm will stay off the coast then models took a dramatic shift late on saturday leading forecasters including myself to take the snow threat much more seriously in addition coming off winter break many new jerseyans are headed back to school and back to work on monday for the first time in 2022 i m sure many of them haven t paid close attention to the weather forecast while on vacation of course it is january now on average our second snowiest month of the year behind february what is the overall timeline for the snow first snowflakes and raindrops will enter southern new jersey just after midnight sunday night spreading northward through early monday morning we ll enter the brunt of the storm the period of heaviest and most widespread precipitation bands starting about 5 a m that s when the snow will begin to accumulate first on cold and grassy surfaces and then eventually on paved roadways sidewalks etc note yes it will likely take several hours for falling snow to stick and start to accumulate snow should start to taper by mid monday afternoon with much improved conditions by the evening commute final flakes should fall in new jersey by 6 p m monday at the latest when will be the worst time to travel generally monday morning let s say 8 a m to noon there s reason to hope the heaviest snow bands will hold off until mid to late morning after the am rush hours road crews wil hopefully be able to get ahead of the snowy icy conditions through the afternoon will it be all snow winter storms are always complicated a difference of a single degree on the thermometer can lead to a completely different scenario in this case i do think temperatures at the surface in southeastern new jersey will be just above freezing at the onset of precipitation that means through the morning commute much of south jersey will probably experience rain and or icy mix for several hours no accumulation yet eventually temperatures will fall below freezing statewide for the duration as i mentioned above after 9 a m at the latest everything that falls from the sky will be snow through the rest of the storm how much snow will fall how much snow will stick as i referenced above it may take a while for snow to start to whiten up the ground so the answers to those two questions are very different and it s really the second once that matters accumulations i ve bumped up my snow totals in se nj to 5 to 10 inches that qualifies as a major winter storm leading to widespread travel disruptions snow plows are revving their engines and shovels are ready for the first use of the season if i had to guess the overall snow bullseye will probably be inland atlantic county farther north up to a line between about salem and brick moderate snowfall of 3 to 6 inches is forecast certainly enough to slicken up roads snarl traffic and force schools business to close it s important to note that the bottom and top of these snowfall ranges represent the lowest and highest case scenario respectively this is very much a boom or bust situation and i do not expect snow totals in the middle of those ranges here the nam model forecast as of 10 a m this is the least snowy solution keeping accumulating snow over a stretch of southern and coastal nj only college of dupage meteorology the nam model forecast as of 10 a m this is the least snowy solution keeping accumulating snow over a stretch of southern and coastal nj only college of dupage meteorology loading the gfs model forecast as of 10 a m monday this is the most widespread snow scenario with accumulations reaching through central nj the southern coast still sees the heaviest snowfall and biggest totals in this solution college of dupage meteorology the gfs model forecast as of 10 a m monday this is the most widespread snow scenario with accumulations reaching through central nj the southern coast still sees the heaviest snowfall and biggest totals in this solution college of dupage meteorology loading how far north will accumulating snow reach south of a trenton perth amboy line it does look like a snowy morning although that s not a slam dunk forecast i ve cautiously painted 1 to 3 inches for the i 195 and i 295 corridors and the farther north you go the harder it will be to see any snow accumulation that s because north jersey will be pretty far from the center of the storm system and it s also because dry air will prevent precipitation from fully reaching the ground on my latest snow map above i have noted the possibility of a coating or an inch of snow along and south of the nj turnpike corridor note zero is also a distinct possibility here far nw nj this isn t your storm flurries are possible but little to no accumulation any other issues to know about northerly wind gusts will probably hover near 30 mph for most of the day the high res nam model shows 30 mph wind gusts through the afternoon the high res nam model shows 30 mph wind gusts through the afternoon loading that will contribute to blowing snow and further reductions in visibility that could also lead to power outages due to downed trees and power lines finally the wind chill the feels like temperature will be stuck in the teens all day long bundle up

moderate flooding of tidal waterways that may necessitate road closures and could even cause property damage farther up the jersey shore a coastal flood advisory called for minor category flooding at high tide monday what should i do to prepare for the storm by now you ve already taken the most important step you know there s going to be a winter storm in the neighborhood make sure all your friends and family know of the potentially bad weather on the way carefully consider your plans on monday and whether it will be safe to travel during your normal routine the answer to that question will depend largely on what when and where those plans are your vehicle your driving ability etc school superintendents business owners and organization leaders within the warning zone and the advisory too should consider whether to close school on monday or switch to a remote learning day as i ve said previously there seems to be little point to a delayed opening or early dismissal for this one if you haven t already it s probably not too late to stock up on salt batteries and or french toast supplies you may want to strategically park your vehicles to mitigate snow and or coastal flooding issues finally be ready to change your plans as the weather goes downhill and the forecast evolves throughout the day monday what s next our on air and online coverage will ramp up starting early monday morning i take over the weather center at 3 a m for the duration of the storm expect one more comprehensive online write up about the snow potential around 7 a m monday and then regular

the santa barbara city council is considering an ordinance that would restrict annual rent increases to 2 plus an annual consumer price index adjustment the proposed ordinance first introduced as the community stabilization initiative would outdo california s cap of 5 plus cpi the proponents of this kind of market meddling argue that it s necessary to keep rents low enough for people who might otherwise have to relocate to a more affordable community or be forced onto the streets because price controls typically shrink supply by discouraging investment rent caps are likely to deter increasing rental housing who wants to make the costly investment in constructing rental housing if returns will be arbitrarily limited meanwhile owners of existing rental apartments might prefer to convert them to condos for sale ironically then the only good reason to support rent caps may be that by discouraging the construction of more rental housing they inhibit population growth rent control proponents condemn landlords as being greedy for renting at market rates but the people who want to force landlords to rent to them at below market rates are not greed can be found anywhere along the wealth continuum the crux of the local housing issue is not greedy landlords or covetous tenants it is demand exceeding supply proponents of increasing supply argue that the local economy will collapse if what is called workforce housing is not ample and affordable these cassandras have chronically claimed that the community s critical workforce police firefighters medical staff et al will abandon santa barbara for places where housing is less expensive and that recruiting their replacements will be stymied by the pricey housing here before succumbing to this canard consider several observations first providing more housing workforce or otherwise has never lowered housing prices here but it has increased the population which then requires an increased workforce which then requires more housing satisfying housing demand becomes as futile as a dog chasing its tail but a town that caps its population at a certain level will only need to attract and retain a critical workforce sufficient for that level that to borrow a euphemism would be community stabilization second regardless of occupation cardiologist or waiter those whose priority is a bigger better house rather than where it is will always be loose leaves on any workforce tree what attracts and holds most residents here is the singular beauty cultural ambience and delightful climate not the housing stock that s why people will pay 2 million for a modest mesa bungalow and feel fortunate to have a home here third those of us who have lived here quite a while have heard cassandras wailing the same warnings about housing shortages for many decades now some of you may have read the transcript of a 1940s city council meeting at which there was much hand wringing over the lack of housing and prophecies of dire economic consequences that would befall the city economies calibrate to their markets santa barbara s economy was vibrant when the population was half of what it is today it was not on the verge of collapse that is because most economic activity is recurrent and not jeopardized by a static population a small town will have fewer plumbers lawyers doctors and retailers etc than a bigger town but neither s economy will be on the verge of collapse if its population isn t increasing the reality is that for a place like santa barbara there will never be enough housing for everyone who wants to live here in that respect santa barbara is no different than many of the other highly desirable places on the planet that the vast majority of people can only visit attempting to accommodate the endless demand for housing can only result in the degradation of what makes this place so desirable sadly a process well underway let s for a moment indulge the cassandras and contemplate what might happen if no more housing is built here and rents and home prices continue to escalate housing is affordable here but not for everyone do not conflate desire with deserve housing becomes unaffordable only when no one can or will pay the asking price how much housing for sale or rent lingers on the market here would those who can afford a home in santa barbara have to do without critical workforce services or would they pay enough to have them it would be the latter as it always has been the local economy scales up to a level that ensures the necessary workforce a dentist plumber or mechanic in santa barbara charges more than those in saginaw michigan as well santa barbara s police and firefighters are paid more than their counterparts in saginaw consequently the cost of living here is considerably higher and yes there is an obvious homeless population here there has been for decades people stubbornly cling to this attractive place even though housing here is well beyond their means but subsidized housing won t end homelessness here anymore than sugar ends ants there are critical environmental concerns with adding housing and thus more population here chief among them are limited water resources and increased susceptibility to wildfires both growing more severe with climate change making the case for protecting this extraordinary place from the ravages of overpopulation invariably elicits indictments of elitist nimbyism but such indictments aren t a cogent refutation of the case being made they are a feeble attempt to dismiss the realities of the argument by discrediting those making it the reality is that santa barbara s superlative singularity is being steadily diminished by the persistent packing in of more residents there are already plenty of places in california overrun with population congested with cheek to jowl housing choked with traffic and plagued with all the other soul sucking tribulations of urban mass santa barbara doesn t need to be another one of them as a nation we have created national and state parks to preserve and protect special places for current and future generations places like santa barbara are worth preserving for the same reasons that won t happen if these places are allowed to be packed with people in the recent past wiser city councils placed a cap on santa barbara s population given california s misguided mandates overruling local zoning ordinances that is more difficult to do but the response to such short sighted destructive government mandates is to resist resist resist randy

inflation is an issue again in 2021 for the first time since 1981 with prices jumping 6 8 percent in the past year the price of regular gas important to rural and suburban voters who drive longer distances is 1 00 higher than it was just 10 months ago heating oil natural gas and other energy products that affect the bills of ordinary people are up sharply also dormant as a political problem since 1983 inflation is a serious one now despite a strong job market and rising wages the question is what should the government do about it it may help to look back at what happened in the 1970s to see what policies worked to end that longer period of inflation the inflation of the late 1970s was led by energy prices like the inflation this year energy prices in the 1970s though did not go up by just 30 percent as they have this year they quadrupled from 3 00 a barrel to over 12 after opec cut supplies in 1972 what is important to note however is that when the opec pricing cartel collapsed in the early 1980s energy prices and inflation dropped like a stone as they will if opec s more limited ability to set prices is broken in 2022 transportation costs are a second large contributor to inflation in 2021 as they were in the 1970s they are up 21 percent according to the wall street journal again the history is important inflation due to rising transportation costs had been recognized by a succession of presidents starting with franklin roosevelt to deal with the problem after presidents nixon and ford took a pass president carter signed the motor carrier act of 1980 in july of that year that act ended legal price fixing by regional rate bureaus dominated by large truckers and eliminated other inflationary artifacts carried over from the great depression the reforms brought trucking costs down almost immediately rail freight had to follow or lose business to trucks the staggers rail act signed in october 1980 brought railroad rates into line air freight and passenger airfares tumbled too as a result of pro competitive policies at the civil aviation board cab then there was inflation prone manufacturing a sector dominated in the 1970s by the big three automakers their dominance shaped markets for steel machine tools metal parts and much else the automakers raised prices year after year more or less in lock step what broke this oligopoly was the arrival of smaller well made volkswagens followed by toyota and other japanese makes politically influential local car dealers wanted to sell the imports because the margins were generous in part because of this and with gas prices rising the u s international trade commission itc decided not to prevent smaller foreign cars from entering the u s market the big three had to face competition that took away much of their pricing power the breakup of at t s telecommunications monopoly during the 1980s also worked to bring inflation down the monopoly called ma bell had about 85 percent of the market through the 70s major business users however who were increasingly using phones for data felt that the monopoly was charging them too much but the powerful lady essentially ignored their complaints the big data users to the surprise of many then backed mci an illinois upstart that wanted to compete with the monopoly the fcc let mci in and gradually supported telecom competition more broadly breaking mabell s inflationary stranglehold the political and economic question today is whether to fight inflation by slowing the economy or to attack bottlenecks the way the country did successfully in the 1980s what is clear is that none of the anti inflationary changes cited above that made the economy from 1980 to 2020 so much less inflation prone than the economy of the 1970s had to do with raising interest rates and reducing government spending to slow the economy such policies championed by a succession of fed chairmen and many economists and businesspeople did nothing to reduce the arbitrary pricing power of many american industries what worked was attacking structural bottlenecks and opening politically powerful industries to competition businesses in all these sectors energy transportation manufacturing telecommunications lobbied hard to maintain their pricing power but carter and the congress beat them and ronald reagan backed and supplemented what had been accomplished by his predecessors today as the u s faces some months of inflation caused overwhelmingly by the post covid 19 economic surge the american economy is not the inflation prone one of the 1970s there are only a few u s industries that have the power to raise prices arbitrarily the way many important ones could in the 1970s the most prominent of these is health care a bloated 17 percent of the u s economy where prices rise arbitrarily every year health care costs rise because local monopolies shady sweetheart supplier relationships needless paperwork and insane insurance arrangements guarantee inflation and because the public and political leaders confused by the industry s chaos accept it as the country enters 2022 temporary bottlenecks in areas where prices are surging in late 2021 will be eliminated inflation in the energy sector will be overcome as it was in the 1980s by production increases and new energy technologies that weaken opec s pricing power bottlenecks at ports and transit hubs shortages of containers trucks and drivers will be dealt through the market with important government help new investment will deal with shortages of computer chips used car prices will come back to earth once covid surges fade none of these industries will have anything like the market power to keep raising prices the way incumbents could in the 1970s labor shortages almost all closely related to covid also could be dealt with in ways that lead to a fairer sharing of economic rewards today the political power of the wealthy promotes bloated paydays for executives pocket lining financial engineering stock buybacks and the like these abuses are the result of the same kind of arbitrary pricing power that existed in many industries in the 1970s it is long past the time to attack them economists who knowingly or innocently carry water for those who profit from these cozy financial arrangements will say the fed needs to slow the economy to deal with them in effect keeping down the wages of ordinary people the economic story of the period from 1980 to 2020 should tell us to ignore them and attack bottlenecks paul a london ph d was a senior policy adviser and

update this article is outdated for the latest winter storm forecast information please refer to my newest weather blog post what s new since my comprehensive sunday morning weather blog post we have two more model runs and a lot more analysis under our meteorological belts the bottom line of this winter storm forecast remains the same significant snow for south jersey hardly anything for north jersey our initial big cooldown is on schedule as temperatures have already started to cool rapidly in the northwest corner of the state thermometers will tumble about 25 degrees within a few hours sunday night accompanied by a brisk northwest wind for my latest snowfall forecast map i decided to compress the totals a bit dry north jersey goes down snowy south jersey goes up the contours the lines and colors pretty much stayed the same on this map i just tweaked the numbers a bit latest snow accumulation forecast for monday as of sunday evening dan zarrow townsquare media going by raw model output maximum snowfall for inland south jersey would be on the order of 20 inches yikes but don t pay attention to that drama and hype there are so many limiting factors at play dry air warm ground rain mix at onset i think we ll end up far from those huge totals but still firmly within plowable snow range for all or part of 8 counties in the southern half of nj one of the biggest challenges in this forecast is nailing down the duration of initial mixing we should be all snow by 9 a m at the latest the other big issue is figuring out the most likely location of heavier mesoscale snow bands that will develop monday morning the rest of this article takes a question and answer format to run down when and how this winter storm may affect you why does this storm seem like such a surprise if you scroll back through my blogroll you ll see we have been peripherally watching this chance of wintry weather since last monday but i largely wrote it off figuring post frontal dry air would win out and the storm will stay off the coast then models took a dramatic shift late on saturday leading forecasters including myself to take the snow threat much more seriously in addition coming off winter break many new jerseyans are headed back to school and back to work on monday for the first time in 2022 i m sure many of them haven t paid close attention to the weather forecast while on vacation of course it is january now on average our second snowiest month of the year behind february what is the overall timeline for the snow first snowflakes and raindrops will enter southern new jersey just after midnight sunday night spreading northward through early monday morning we ll enter the brunt of the storm the period of heaviest and most widespread precipitation bands starting about 5 a m that s when the snow will begin to accumulate first on cold and grassy surfaces and then eventually on paved roadways sidewalks etc note yes it will likely take several hours for falling snow to stick and start to accumulate snow should start to taper by mid monday afternoon with much improved conditions by the evening commute final flakes should fall in new jersey by 6 p m monday at the latest when will be the worst time to travel generally monday morning let s say 8 a m to noon there s reason to hope the heaviest snow bands will hold off until mid to late morning after the am rush hours road crews wil hopefully be able to get ahead of the snowy icy conditions through the afternoon will it be all snow winter storms are always complicated a difference of a single degree on the thermometer can lead to a completely different scenario in this case i do think temperatures at the surface in southeastern new jersey will be just above freezing at the onset of precipitation that means through the morning commute much of south jersey will probably experience rain and or icy mix for several hours no accumulation yet eventually temperatures will fall below freezing statewide for the duration as i mentioned above after 9 a m at the latest everything that falls from the sky will be snow through the rest of the storm how much snow will fall how much snow will stick as i referenced above it may take a while for snow to start to whiten up the ground so the answers to those two questions are very different and it s really the second once that matters accumulations i ve bumped up my snow totals in se nj to 5 to 10 inches that qualifies as a major winter storm leading to widespread travel disruptions snow plows are revving their engines and shovels are ready for the first use of the season if i had to guess the overall snow bullseye will probably be inland atlantic county farther north up to a line between about salem and brick moderate snowfall of 3 to 6 inches is forecast certainly enough to slicken up roads snarl traffic and force schools business to close it s important to note that the bottom and top of these snowfall ranges represent the lowest and highest case scenario respectively this is very much a boom or bust situation and i do not expect snow totals in the middle of those ranges here the nam model forecast as of 10 a m this is the least snowy solution keeping accumulating snow over a stretch of southern and coastal nj only college of dupage meteorology the gfs model forecast as of 10 a m monday this is the most widespread snow scenario with accumulations reaching through central nj the southern coast still sees the heaviest snowfall and biggest totals in this solution college of dupage meteorology how far north will accumulating snow reach south of a trenton perth amboy line it does look like a snowy morning although that s not a slam dunk forecast i ve cautiously painted 1 to 3 inches for the i 195 and i 295 corridors and the farther north you go the harder it will be to see any snow accumulation that s because north jersey will be pretty far from the center of the storm system and it s also because dry air will prevent precipitation from fully reaching the ground on my latest snow map above i have noted the possibility of a coating or an inch of snow along and south of the nj turnpike corridor note zero is also a distinct possibility here far nw nj this isn t your storm flurries are possible but little to no accumulation any other issues to know about northerly wind gusts will probably hover near 30 mph for most of the day the high res nam model shows 30 mph wind gusts through the afternoon that will contribute to blowing snow and further reductions in visibility that could also lead to power outages due to downed trees and power lines finally the wind chill the feels like temperature will be stuck in the teens all day long bundle up what warnings advisories have been issued a winter storm warning pink and winter weather advisory purple blankets the southern half of nj from 4 a m to 4 p m monday townsquare media aerisweather a winter storm warning has been posted for ocean southeastern burlington atlantic cape may and cumberland counties from 4 a m to 4 p m monday that is the most likely location of heavy snow and the most likely time frame for treacherous travel a less urgent less severe winter weather advisory has been issued for salem gloucester camden and northwestern burlington counties for the same time frame 4 a m to 4 p m monday less snow on the ground but still potential travel impacts coastal storm warnings dark green and advisories light green are posted for the entire jersey shore and delaware river during the monday morning midday high tide cycle townsquare media aerisweather a coastal flood warning is also posted for atlantic and cape may counties the monday morning midday high tide cycle is forecast to cause widespread moderate flooding of tidal waterways that may necessitate road closures and could even cause property damage farther up the jersey shore a coastal flood advisory called for minor category flooding at high tide monday what should i do to prepare for the storm by now you ve already taken the most important step you know there s going to be a winter storm in the neighborhood make sure all your friends and family know of the potentially bad weather on the way carefully consider your plans on monday and whether it will be safe to travel during your normal routine the answer to that question will depend largely on what when and where those plans are your vehicle your driving ability etc school superintendents business owners and organization leaders within the warning zone and the advisory too should consider whether to close school on monday or switch to a remote learning day as i ve said previously there seems to be little point to a delayed opening or early dismissal for this one if you haven t already it s probably not too late to stock up on salt batteries and or french toast supplies you may want to strategically park your vehicles to mitigate snow and or coastal flooding issues finally be ready to change your plans as the weather goes downhill and the forecast evolves throughout the day monday what s next our on air and online coverage will ramp up starting early monday morning i take over the weather center at 3 a m for the duration of the storm expect one more comprehensive online write up about the snow potential around 7 a m monday and then regular play by play both on the radio and on social media until the final flakes fly dan zarrow is chief meteorologist for townsquare media new jersey follow him on facebook or twitter for the latest forecast and realtime weather

twenty three new texas laws go into effect on jan 1 none are as high profile as some of the big ticket items that passed during the state s four legislative sessions this year like the state s strict abortion and voting laws but they ll nonetheless impact texans in some fashion below is a list of every new law on the books in the new year flood disclosure for renters in many states across the country including texas property owners don t have to disclose flood risk to potential tenants they don t have to tell potential renters if a property flooded in the past or if it s in a flood prone area a new texas law hopes to address that starting in the new year landlords in texas will be required by law to alert tenants if the property they re renting is in a 100 year floodplain the law requires landlords to alert tenants to any flood damage that occurred in the five year time period prior to leasing previously only home sellers not landlords were required by law to disclose flood information landlords will also have to give leasers a notice that says most renters insurance policies don t cover flood damage so renters should also purchase a flood insurance policy the law which gov greg abbott signed in june was written by houston democratic state rep armando walle and passed the house 94 52 on may 24 and the senate 31 0 on may 19 but the new law is not without its critics housing advocates say expecting renters to bear the burden of paying for flood insurance instead of landlords isn t equitable landlords need to take the lead and have the responsibility be on them to ensure that their renters are fully served and that the responsibility is not shifted said chrishelle palay executive director of the houston organizing movement for equity that s what we see time and time again throughout the state long term care transparency another law taking effect on jan 1 house bill 3961 requires nursing and assisted living facilities to post information on their websites about theoffice of the state long term care ombudsman an independent organization within the texas health and human services commission that advocates for the rights of long term care facility residents while the office has been around for decades many people are still unaware of the services it provides ombudsmen touch on issues like health and safety and residents rights they hear complaints about any number of problems including residents activities and complaints about visitor access we re here to really be the voice and the advocate for folks that are living in nursing and assisted living facilities said alexa schoeman the deputy state ombudsman aarp texasis one of the groups that supported the bill associate state director for advocacy and outreach amanda fredriksen said it was essential to ensure residents and their families have access to the information she added it s even more important after facilities were closed to visitors during the pandemic previously the information needed to be posted in the facility but if family can t get into the facility then they don t have access to the information fredriksen said during fiscal year 2021 staff and volunteers with the office of the state long term care ombudsman investigated 5 829 complaints at nursing and assisted living facilities restaurant trademark protections texas restaurants will have more control working with third party delivery companies under one of the new laws taking effect new year s day kelsey erickson streufert with the texas restaurant association says sb 911 includes new rules to prevent trademark infringement restaurants have seen cases in which delivery apps put restaurants on their platforms without permission many did not have knowledge that they were listed on those apps streufert said the new law also makes it easier to qualify as a restaurant in texas without requiring a location s alcohol sales total 60 percent or less of total revenue the law is trying to create some fairness better communication and protecting each party s right to be in that space if they want to be streufert said other laws going into effect jan 1 copyright 2022 houston public media news 88 7 to see more visit houston public media news 88 7
it is 1922 in southern illinois and you are a hard man life has been hard with summer days without a breeze and winter days with the soil frozen solid your fields sit fallow because you are too poor to buy seed it seems the only thing you or your father or your grandfather ever got to grow was sandstone rock every year you go out into the fields with your oldest boys in a mule cart and carry away a ton of sandstone hoping to avoid breaking a plow blade corn grows thin and erosion exposes the roots wheat is prone to wild onions there is not yet a market for soybeans hay grows well at least but it sells cheap and doesn t transport out of the local area you would buy more cattle but the bank is not going to give you any more loans face the facts the farm is not going to turn a profit it is the roaring twenties and you keep hearing about people getting rich but you are not seeing any evidence of that this great disparity between the rich and poor is leading you ever closer to the great depression which will hit in about 7 more years but you don t know that yet you think life is about as hard as it can get right now there is an industrial revolution going on and industry needs power coal mines open nearby and they pay in cash you gain specialized knowledge suddenly you are the in demand technologist of the era you are a coal miner use those profits to pay off loans and land taxes and you just might be able to keep the farm your grandfather bought this is the difference between homelessness and having food on the table this coal mining operation is important to you and your hard wife and your lean children your father worked in the coal mines too starting back around 1899 things were different back then harder meaner your hard mean dad worked for 14 hours a day in a shaft that was only three feet high sometimes up to his ankles in water he would spend all day bent over loading coal onto carts that would be pulled to the surface by old mules the mules would go blind from so much time in the dark dad died in the mines from bad air everyone died back then from bad air or collapses or shaft fires the lucky ones made it out of the mines alive only to face the future with black lung you remember watching poor people die while the rich got richer then came the union in the early 1900 s there were strikes violence and deaths but the unionization came anyway the mine owners had to clean up shop the last attempt at operating a non union mine in southern illinois got some people murdered i think the message is pretty clear now don t you treat the workers as people or lose your business air got better along with lighting structural support and even pay you are making 8 50 an hour now finally you are seeing some of that roaring twenties profit your life is beginning to stabilize you see a future the stock market is wild with enthusiasm cresting on a great bullish bubble industry and your place within it has made you into an important cog in the wheel of our nations financial well being you want more pay you deserve it you are the basis of this whole wild economic ride in april 1922 you work at a strip mine ran by the southern illinois coal company owned by william j lester you have about 50 coworkers every single one of them card carrying members of the united mine workers of america umwa when the umwa sent an announcement organizing a nationwide strike every single one of you complied but come on now it doesn t make sense to force lester into closing the mine a local arrangement is made and william lester is given permission to mine coal and keep you all busy until the umwa orders the strike off this special provision has one important point though that coal must not be shipped or sold this puts lester in a favorable position the moment the nationwide strike ends lester will be ready to ship his coal at huge profit which will really help in paying those high wages everybody wins right on june 16 1922 william j lester had 60 000 tons of coal just sitting around waiting for a strike to end and the price per ton had sky rocketed he shipped 16 cars of coal some people never learn so now the strike is real you quit working completely your union manager is throwing a shit fit wanting to get a hold of lester and slap some sense into him the states attorney general the national guard and the umwa are calling lester up trying to convince him to stop shipping coal he is warned that this could lead to violence lester thought otherwise he hired some strikebreakers out of chicago these scabs are working the mine now you are unemployed back to the farm you go hayseed just in case though lester relocates to chicago stop for a moment visualize the rage you feel the hatred the fear you just lost your paycheck you are no longer in control if lester gets away with this then you have two choices one to starve to death or two to wind up in the same miserable conditions that killed your father take your time to think about the answer no wait there is a third choice kill them all on june 21 1922 hardware stores are looted you have a shotgun you and your neighbors surround the southern illinois coal company mine and fire shots at the scabs telling them to come out with their hands up the scabs call the sheriff s office but he is not available one of the scab guards comes out carrying a broomstick with an apron tied to it waving it over his head he says they agree to surrender if they can leave town unharmed you say come on out and we ll get you out of the county the strikebreakers come out and are told to sit with shotguns pointed at them as you and some others blow up the steam shovels and draglines with dynamite you told them that this mine was out of business and now they see you meant it it s getting on late into the evening the strikebreakers are stood up and told to march you and the rest of your gang march them toward herrin you re drinking you re mad you re armed somewhere near crenshaw crossing a car pulls up it s the local umwa representative hugh willis he offers some advice that seems reasonable at the time listen don t you go killing these fellows on a public highway there are too many women and children around to do that take them over in the woods and give it to them kill all you can and the massacre begins beaten with the butts of guns stabbed with pitchforks the strikebreakers take off running many get shot immediately some get trapped trying to climb over a barbed wire fence and are gunned down by the time morning comes all the rest are found hiding in the woods they are lead to the herrin cemetery where a crowd has formed they are all killed every single one of them a woman you know is holding her child s hand see that man she says pointing at a strikebreaker s corpse he tried to take the food out of your mouth another man you know urinates on one of the corpses newspapers hear of the event the massacre becomes an object of national outrage but locally you are a hero you killed the scabs depending on eyewitness testimony the prosecution fails to convict you you got away with murder in williamson county illinois why did i put you in the story because there are plenty of sources for reading about the herrin massacre and bloody williamson in the more traditional newspaper reporter format i put you in the story because that s how it was always relayed to me as a child told to me by my father what would you do he would ask sources

but don t pay attention to that drama and hype there are so many limiting factors at play dry air warm ground rain mix at onset i think we ll end up far from those huge totals but still firmly within plowable snow range for all or part of 8 counties in the southern half of nj one of the biggest challenges in this forecast is nailing down the duration of initial mixing we should be all snow by 9 a m at the latest the other big issue is figuring out the most likely location of heavier mesoscale snow bands that will develop monday morning the rest of this article takes a question and answer format to run down when and how this winter storm may affect you why does this storm seem like such a surprise if you scroll back through my blogroll you ll see we have been peripherally watching this chance of wintry weather since last monday but i largely wrote it off figuring post frontal dry air would win out and the storm will stay off the coast then models took a dramatic shift late on saturday leading forecasters including myself to take the snow threat much more seriously in addition coming off winter break many new jerseyans are headed back to school and back to work on monday for the first time in 2022 i m sure many of them haven t paid close attention to the weather forecast while on vacation of course it is january now on average our second snowiest month of the year behind february what is the overall timeline for the snow first snowflakes and raindrops will enter southern new jersey just after midnight sunday night spreading northward through early monday morning we ll enter the brunt of the storm the period of heaviest and most widespread precipitation bands starting about 5 a m that s when the snow will begin to accumulate first on cold and grassy surfaces and then eventually on paved roadways sidewalks etc note yes it will likely take several hours for falling snow to stick and start to accumulate snow should start to taper by mid monday afternoon with much improved conditions by the evening commute final flakes should fall in new jersey by 6 p m monday at the latest when will be the worst time to travel generally monday morning let s say 8 a m to noon there s reason to hope the heaviest snow bands will hold off until mid to late morning after the am rush hours road crews wil hopefully be able to get ahead of the snowy icy conditions through the afternoon will it be all snow winter storms are always complicated a difference of a single degree on the thermometer can lead to a completely different scenario in this case i do think temperatures at the surface in southeastern new jersey will be just above freezing at the onset of precipitation that means through the morning commute much of south jersey will probably experience rain and or icy mix for several hours no accumulation yet eventually temperatures will fall below freezing statewide for the duration as i mentioned above after 9 a m at the latest everything that falls from the sky will be snow through the rest of the storm how much snow will fall how much snow will stick as i referenced above it may take a while for snow to start to whiten up the ground so the answers to those two questions are very different and it s really the second once that matters accumulations i ve bumped up my snow totals in se nj to 5 to 10 inches that qualifies as a major winter storm leading to widespread travel disruptions snow plows are revving their engines and shovels are ready for the first use of the season if i had to guess the overall snow bullseye will probably be inland atlantic county farther north up to a line between about salem and brick moderate snowfall of 3 to 6 inches is forecast certainly enough to slicken up roads snarl traffic and force schools business to close it s important to note that the bottom and top of these snowfall ranges represent the lowest and highest case scenario respectively this is very much a boom or bust situation and i do not expect snow totals in the middle of those ranges here the nam model forecast as of 10 a m this is the least snowy solution keeping accumulating snow over a stretch of southern and coastal nj only college of dupage meteorology the nam model forecast as of 10 a m this is the least snowy solution keeping accumulating snow over a stretch of southern and coastal nj only college of dupage meteorology loading the gfs model forecast as of 10 a m monday this is the most widespread snow scenario with accumulations reaching through central nj the southern coast still sees the heaviest snowfall and biggest totals in this solution college of dupage meteorology the gfs model forecast as of 10 a m monday this is the most widespread snow scenario with accumulations reaching through central nj the southern coast still sees the heaviest snowfall and biggest totals in this solution college of dupage meteorology loading how far north will accumulating snow reach south of a trenton perth amboy line it does look like a snowy morning although that s not a slam dunk forecast i ve cautiously painted 1 to 3 inches for the i 195 and i 295 corridors and the farther north you go the harder it will be to see any snow accumulation that s because north jersey will be pretty far from the center of the storm system and it s also because dry air will prevent precipitation from fully reaching the ground on my latest snow map above i have noted the possibility of a coating or an inch of snow along and south of the nj turnpike corridor note zero is also a distinct possibility here far nw nj this isn t your storm flurries are possible but little to no accumulation any other issues to know about northerly wind gusts will probably hover near 30 mph for most of the day the high res nam model shows 30 mph wind gusts through the afternoon the high res nam model shows 30 mph wind gusts through the afternoon loading that will contribute to blowing snow and further reductions in visibility that could also lead to power outages due to downed trees and power lines finally the wind chill the feels like temperature will be stuck in the teens all day long bundle up

moderate flooding of tidal waterways that may necessitate road closures and could even cause property damage farther up the jersey shore a coastal flood advisory called for minor category flooding at high tide monday what should i do to prepare for the storm by now you ve already taken the most important step you know there s going to be a winter storm in the neighborhood make sure all your friends and family know of the potentially bad weather on the way carefully consider your plans on monday and whether it will be safe to travel during your normal routine the answer to that question will depend largely on what when and where those plans are your vehicle your driving ability etc school superintendents business owners and organization leaders within the warning zone and the advisory too should consider whether to close school on monday or switch to a remote learning day as i ve said previously there seems to be little point to a delayed opening or early dismissal for this one if you haven t already it s probably not too late to stock up on salt batteries and or french toast supplies you may want to strategically park your vehicles to mitigate snow and or coastal flooding issues finally be ready to change your plans as the weather goes downhill and the forecast evolves throughout the day monday what s next our on air and online coverage will ramp up starting

scientists finally explain why mosquitos relentlessly bite some people and ignore others and what you can do to make them less interested scientists explained why some people attract mosquitos more than others us entomologist dan kline revealed there were several factors that played role smelly feet produced by bacteria similar to one found in cheese was one cause scientists have revealed why some people are more prone to mosquito bites than others and busted the top myths that claim to keep the blood sucking critters away american entomologist dan kline has spent years studying the insects and believes he has come across important clues to explain their behaviour one of the more bizarre discoveries he made was that mosquitos were attracted to smelly feet in particular they were attracted to a bacteria that gave off the same smell as limburger cheese scientists have revealed why some people are more prone to mosquito bites than others and shared the top secrets to repel the blood sucking critters stock image dr kline conducted a study in the 1990s to determine if mosquitos were more attracted to particular types of cheese based on smell he experimented with different variations and discovered blue cheese and limburger were the most popular dr kline then presented them with a pair of smelly socks he had been wearing for four days and discovered the mosquitos were immediately drawn to them he pointed out the link between the smelly feet and limburger made sense as the cheese was traditionally produced by barefoot monks the monks used their feet in the production of this cheese he told abc thus the toe bacteria were involved in the production of limburger cheese dr kline also discovered that mosquitos were drawn to scents produced by bacteria produced on human skin as well as volatile chemicals that are exhaled out of the mouth he learned his colleague naturally produced a chemical that dulled the sense of smell in mosquitos and was less likely to be bitten by one her ratio of this compound compared to other compounds was higher he said other factors included body heat genetics and what cosmetic products you wear and some people s skin reacts to bites differently and may not even notice them different mosquitoes are also attracted to different parts of the body some that certain people cover and others don t as much there are plenty of mosquitoes that are known to be ankle biters or face biters so there s presumably different volatiles on those different parts of the body that are attracting them dr norris said medical entomologist cameron webb has also lent a hand to understanding the behaviours of the mosquitos and dispelled several myths about types of food that are believed to repel the insects us entomologist dan kline pictured has spent years studying the insects and believes he has come across important clues to explain their behaviour one of the more bizarre discoveries he made was that mosquitos were attracted to smelly feet stock image eating bananas and drinking beer is commonly believed to be an attracting force for mosquitos while garlic and vitamin b supplements are considered to be repellants dr webb revealed these were actually an old wives tale while some food or drink may subtly change the attraction of mosquitoes changing diet won t stop you having to use insect repellents he said unfortunately pregnant women are more likely to be bitten by a mosquito than a man advertisement higher carbon dioxide and temperatures during the later stages of pregnancy are believed to increase the body s release of volatile chemicals and bacteria that normally attract mosquitos

by wim laven sebastian santos tom hastings the questions of faith and values are ubiquitous especially during the holiday season especially troubling is the fraught intersection of organized religion mainstream and social media politics and the classroom for example the words of my hero rev dr martin luther king jr are regularly twisted to advocate positions antithetical to the spiritual guidance he offers they use his dream that children be judged by the content of their character to justify not more affirmative action but less not more accurate history but less not more economic equity but less we will not be surprised if the us navy names a warship the uss martin luther king i wim teach the power of nonviolence in my classes and i make sure that i distinguish between the two lanes principled and pragmatic the principled argument is one that connects to values whether rooted in religious teachings or philosophical arguments the pragmatic argument on the other hand comes directly from evidence and logic it examines methods of social struggle by costs and benefits the science of peace makes the benefits clear nonviolence is more effective than violence and costs are a tiny fraction of violence preparing for war and waging it are costing us taxpayers more than any other item 768 billion in new expenses and more billions for past harms including lifetime care for veterans survivor family benefits and environmental clean up listening to politicians we might think that the ethics of helping young families with the extra burdens of covid 19 impacts is only a nice frill that we really can t afford but maintaining huge overseas military bases is somehow vital and that trumps help with childcare or rent power to inflict death and destruction is more important than morals if we watch how our federal elected officials vote and very few church mosque or temple leaders are teaching congregants anything different preparing for peace is priceless using humanitarian aid diplomacy and fair trade agreements for starters can radically lower international hostilities and reduce the likelihood of war developing strong international coalitions that use economic carrots and sticks to enforce human rights and environmental protection uses both good values and moral methods martin luther king jr used both principles and pragmatism when he backed up rosa parks in montgomery alabama that struggle used nonviolent resistance as begun by parks but also used economic sanctions by refusing to take the bus and also waging a court case with some of the best lawyers arguing all the way to the supreme court this mix of religious teaching and practical organizing was the model that produced a decade of victories for the civil rights movement the lives of religious founders were usually lives of the dispossessed of the refugee of someone persecuted by the rich and powerful yet we hear rich and powerful gaslighting commentators like tucker carlson pretend to be religious in the most loony exhortations we saw trump order american citizens teargassed so he could stand in front of a church holding a bible the stories of the lives of king and jesus describe what happens when we unselfishly commit ourselves to doing good we have a handful of such examples valiantly trying today such as the rev william barber whose efforts are indeed reminiscent of rosa parks dr king rev james lawson and the many who taught and acted in a better fashion in a more moral way and led to victories they actively listened to empathize with others even their enemies and like king proclaimed the time is always right to do what is right we think it is time to recommit ourselves to doing right the time is right wim laven ph d syndicated by peacevoice teaches courses in political science and conflict resolution sebastian santos syndicated by peacevoice is a graduate of portland state university and is currently pursuing a master s degree at lewis and clark college dr tom h hastings is coördinator of conflict resolution ba bs degree programs and certificates at portland state university peacevoice senior editor and on occasion an expert witness for the defense of civil resisters in court

beijing seeks more control of supply and prices of rare metals beijing s creation last month of a new group that will produce more than a third of its rare metals shows it wants more control over global supply and pricing of these strategic materials and the ability to use them in a trade war the new group is a merger of minmetals rare earth chinalco rare earths metals co and china southern rare group co the group has not been named it is based in ganzhou jiangxi province a national centre for production of the 17 minerals used in smart electronic devices electric cars and military equipment the biggest shareholder is china state assets supervision and administration commission which owns a stake of 31 12 per cent the new group will control 37 6 per cent of china s rare metals mining including nearly 70 per cent of its heavy raw metals it will own resources in jiangxi sichuan hunan guangxi and shandong it becomes the second biggest company in the field in the country after china northern rare earth group which is based in baotou inner mongolia and listed on the shanghai stock exchange according to a report by the u s geological survey in 2015 china has 55 million tonnes in reserves of rare metals out of the 130 million in the world ranking number one it is the only country with reserves of all 17 minerals this gives it rare bargaining power in the world market in 1992 deng xiaoping said the middle east has oil china has rare metals in a trade war with the united states japan or other countries they would be a potent weapon in a bulletin in may 2019 the national development and reform commission said will rare earths become china s counter weapon against the u s unwarranted suppression what i can tell you is that if anyone wants to use products made from rare earth to curb the development of china the whole chinese people will not be happy the rationale for the new group was laid out on march 1 last year by xiao yaqing minister of industry and information technology and formerly head of chinalco our rare earths do not sell at the rare price but at the earth price because of competitive bidding which wasted the precious resources xiao told a news briefing in beijing the government should play a role in maintaining market order loosen what can be loosened and control what should be controlled some companies are producing excessive amounts of rare metals causing environmental issues and leading to low resource utilization rates he said other problems are smuggling and illegal mining during 2021 prices of rare earths were erratic that of praseodymium neodymium reached record levels because of strong demand from makers of electric cars but those of cerium and lanthanum used in catalysts for oil refining were depressed due to abundant supply zhou lisha a researcher with the institute for state owned enterprises at tsinghua university said that the new group would increase investment strengthen research and development and promote the sector s shift toward more value added and technology intensive growth it will increase the influence of market leaders facilitate phasing out of outdated capacity for better allocation of resources and spur high quality development in the sector she said in 2014 china accounted for 86 per cent of global output of rare metals this dominance alarmed countries in the west whose industries rely on the materials in the 1980s the u s used to be the world s largest producer but closed mines because of the high cost and heavy environmental damage since 2014 production abroad has increased faster than in china in 2020 the u s produced 38 000 tonnes 36 per cent higher than in 2019 output in myanmar in 2020 reached 30 000 tonnes up 20 per cent and in madagascar 8 000 tonnes double that in 2019 china s production in 2020 was 140 000 tonnes up six per cent year on year giving it a 58 3 per cent share of global output this reduction in market share limits beijing s ability to use rare metals as a tool in a trade war many of them are used in intermediate and downstream products often made in third countries before being shipped to the u s restrictions would also tell customers that china was an unreliable supplier in any event the formation of the new group is a step in preparing beijing for such a conflict contact us at

covid 19 nationally and only five had died from the virus in november nonetheless the word was out from the top prime minister shinzo abe s white whale had been the olympics yoshihide suga s to carry out whatever his master abe had left undone for his own obsession pm kishida had chosen to keep japan free from the dreaded omicron the new variant has since been widely acknowledged to be rather milder than all its covid 19 predecessors but the prime minister was on the warpath and japan s bureaucrats had their marching orders on december 20 my son ryo a japanese american dual citizen arrived at tokyo s narita airport to spend christmas and new year s with us armed with two negative pre flight pcr test results from the united states he was flabbergasted when he tested positive on arrival interior scene at nearly deserted narita airport photo youtube he protested and demanded a retest but the staff at narita were unsympathetic this happens every single day they said people come in from the us or europe with negative results we test them and they re positive the tests overseas are very poor our japanese tests are very exacting and very accurate needless to say there was no re test ryo 26 was whisked to the marroad international a large resort hotel a few miles from narita offering a pool a gym a spa and fancy restaurants with gorgeous views of chiba prefecture but if you look at the website it says temporarily closed in english and all the choices of language have been disabled except for japanese the news section of the website displays just two words not applicable in fact the entire hotel has been taken over by the government to house those unfortunate returning japanese and permanent residents who test positive on arrival at the marroad today guests are prohibited from leaving their rooms with the exception of a once weekly pre reserved trip to the washing machines no one may visit the pool gym or spa the bars and restaurants are shuttered instead packed meals are left outside the guests rooms three times a day followed by a piped announcement that they may now open their doors long enough to bring the meal inside using government issued pulse oximeter and thermometer they are instructed to record their statistics on a web form several times a day until their mandatory six day quarantine has run its course this entire operation run with military precision and thousands of staff is provided free of charge at the expense of the japanese taxpayer ryo started his stay totally asymptomatic with no fever aches or pains not even a sniffle but on the third day he did experience the telltale loss of his sense of taste so at least we knew it was probably true that he had covid 19 on december 23 he received a call from a tense sounding staffer pack your things you re leaving in 90 minutes the impact of two days of solitary confinement in a small hotel room had compromised his ability to carry on a conversation perplexed he just managed to ask where am i going you re going to the hospital because you have omicron ryo was shuttled into town to a room in a special locked wing in a big tokyo metropolitan hospital in sumida ward soon he was missing even the very basic stripped down comforts of the marroad since japanese tend not to take sick days when they actually do end up in the hospital they re so exhausted they can t do anything except lie in bed perhaps this is one reason why japanese hospitals are so spartan patients are expected to provide their own towels and drinking cups luxuries like a box of tissues or a bar of soap are not provided there is no desk or chair as the patient is expected to stay horizontal this was a challenge to ryo who had brought his computers and a pocket wifi for use in finishing off lots of year end work a further challenge for ryo was that he typically spends two hours a day in the gym to maintain his remarkable set of muscles part of this discipline involves eating five carefully planned meals a day as his sense of taste had returned and the provided meals are tiny we began delivering packed meals and snacks we took him a workout mat and a couple of sets of dumbbells which the ward nurses received with many giggles on christmas day a doctor came into ryo s room and shoved a swab up his nose for his first quantitative antigen test japan uses the lumipulse sars cov 2 ag test kit manufactured by fujirebio an inconspicuous but tokyo stock exchange section 1 listed pharma company with more than 70 years of history photo fujirebio the test employs a technique that goes by a mouthful of a name chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay abbreviated as cleia and how very precise it is ryo s christmas day result was 9 which the hospital explained to the bewildered and asymptomatic patient was neither negative nor positive apparently a reading of less than 10 is below a cutoff level that makes it statistically almost equivalent to zero ryo was told that if his test on december 26 was negative he would be discharged sadly the reading the next day was 65 the doctors told us that people who are actually infected have readings in the thousands symptom free days continued ryo had finished all his work and sent it to his clients in the usa for feedback but of course they were all out for the holidays my wife and i continued to deliver meals and snacks ryo craved sushi but the nurses had told us they couldn t accept raw foods because of the health risk they pose strange for a country that gorges on sashimi every day no matter i hollowed out a loaf of bread and hid some of ryo s favorite maguro inside no wasabi on the subsequent four days ryo s test results were 65 50 85 and 3 8 all of which are levels which both dr k and dr s of the hospital agreed were statistically hardly distinguishable from negative but as much as they felt sorry for us they could not possibly allow ryo to check out the kishida cabinet had instructed the ministry of health and the ministry of health had instructed the quarantine office that no one with omicron could be released until they had utterly negative tests two days in a row by now my wife and i were beside ourselves i took some unofficial legal advice that a hospital did not have the right to physically detain a patient and we plotted a jailbreak ryo had been forced on arrival at narita to sign a pledge to the ministry of health that he would quarantine for a full 14 days not use public transport avoid going out and not come into contact with other people he was allowed to ride in a private car and to quarantine at home we prepared a spare room at home for him and we laid our plans our ruse involved taking a care package to the hospital so we would be admitted to the door of the ward once at the door of the ward we handed the nurses a note saying that we had decided of our own accord that ryo would leave the hospital he would quarantine safely at home and honor his pledge he would stay in an isolated room in our house and not come in contact with others finally we assured the hospital that we would never hold them responsible for any negative consequences of our own violation of the rules our scheme seemed to be going well the doctors and nurses had been assuring us all along that they were on our side they were just unable to go against government guidance we thought they might somehow let him slip out instead a nurse brought us two stools to sit on and dr s came out to the hall to give us a little pep talk don t do it he said you re going against the government and the government isn t known for their sense of humor we doctors have been telling them for two years that their rules are scientifically and medically spurious but this is political not medical please let me have the quarantine officer from narita call you please japanese new year s food photo fromjapan after a few minutes ms y from narita quarantine called starting with a few pleasantries about how she felt sorry for us she then put on her most severe bureaucrat tone legalese was not far behind should we persist in our scheme to bust ryo out of the hospital we would be in violation of japanese quarantine law sections 9 and 15 and if found guilty could be subject to punishment by a fine of up to one million yen and up to one year s imprisonment not only might we parents end up in jail but our son might too as we digested this new wrinkle ms y entreated us as nicely as a bureaucrat can to wait just a few more days until ryo had the requisite two negative tests in a row on december 31st ryo s test result came back as 1 25 after the previous day s 3 8 we begged the hospital to spring him all the doctors knew ryo by now he was the young man who was always dripping with sweat from working out with weights in his room the nurses knew him as the polite young man whose mother brought packed dinners to him every day one of the nurses had even come into his room before dawn to examine him while he was asleep and commented when he awoke with a start you ve got great muscles one doctor hinted in jest that perhaps he could apply the swab lightly to get a sample with an even smaller viral count but no one was going to go against the government we were up against the unquestioning acceptance of authority and dogged adherence to rules that are at once the best and the worst japanese traits the prime minister of japan was elected in a democratic process and his policies reflect the will of the people his policy is that omicron must be stamped out at any cost the ministries report to the prime minister quarantine reports to the ministry omicron has now been contracted by dozens of japanese in 23 cities and prefectures and not one of the infected has been abroad or has disclosed any idea of how the infection occurred these people are hospitalized too as soon as they are diagnosed and the hospitalizations will continue until the policy changes the policy is that the tests must be negative negative is defined as a test result of zero there can be no ambiguity as i type this closing paragraph ryo s january 1 2022 test result just came back as negative if he can stay that way tomorrow he will come home and the year of the tiger at the jaeger home will begin with the retroactive celebration of christmas 2021 educated as a japan scholar new york native peter jaeger is a writer translator and veteran of 30 years in tokyo financial markets

menafn jordan times medford massachusetts likening today s capitalist economies to the communist bloc of yesteryear may seem far fetched what could the free market possibly have in common with soviet style central planning in fact the comparison increasingly offers useful insights into what has become of the winning side since the end of the cold war consider the soft budget constraints that socialist state owned enterprises soes used to enjoy and that turned out to be one of the main reasons why soviet bloc economies failed similar financial conditions are becoming pervasive in capitalist america as the hungarian marxist apostate jános kornai famously argued soes could ignore losses and consumer preferences because they could always count on the state to keep them afloat kornai s thesis was popular with the chinese reformers of the 1980s seeking to make soes more responsive to the market they hardened companies budget constraints by contrast capitalist america seems to be on the same misbegotten path as the soviet economies though it is starting from a different place the result is the same budget constraints are softening and capital is increasingly being funneled toward the fashionable and the well connected fantasists and schemers to be sure borrowing can up to a point energise capitalist enterprises contrary to what one reads in introductory economics textbooks real world consumers budgets are not capped and venturesome consumers can borrow to pay for the next new hot item by consuming beyond their means they boost the demand for iphones and teslas creating incentives for innovators likewise tesla and other upstart businesses often rely on external funding not profits to advance their innovations just as governments issue bonds to help pay for highways bridges harbours and airports savers also benefit instead of stuffing surplus cash into mattresses they can profitably cover the financing needs of consumers businesses and governments but too much financial flexibility can be toxic though individuals businesses and governments can reasonably predict next month s wages revenues and tax receipts respectively they can only guess at their capacity to meet obligations many years from now the more optimistic one s forecast the greater one s willingness to spend beyond one s current means or invest more than just one s retained earnings in principle financiers due diligence should impose countervailing limits on this overextension but estimating creditworthiness and investment returns is not an exact science and competition in the financial sector can produce a race to the bottom as borrowers flock to the most lenient creditors moreover fractional banking and fiat money can further soften financing constraints banks do not lend out only the savings of their depositors they leverage those deposits several fold and central bankers have even more potent powers to create funds out of thin air as traditional financing constraints have weakened in recent decades the growth in households and businesses debt has exceeded the growth in their incomes and profits by a wide margin similarly the growth in the us government s debt now exceeding 29 trillion boggles the imagination yet while borrowing has jumped interest rates have plummeted encouraging even more borrowing and imprudent lending these lax lending standards have apparently spilled over into equity markets last year some 4 million self described apes bought billions of dollars of amc stock saving the movie theatre chain from bankruptcy celebrities now float spacs special purpose acquisition companies with a strangely effective pitch give us your money but we won t tell you what for hedge funds and private equity firms have piled into venture capital vc valuations have soared nearly 340 new businesses raised funding at valuations exceeding 1 billion in 2021 and the kind of due diligence that once took months has been compressed to days or even to just hours with some spray and pray vcs this combination of manic investing and careless lending has not emerged spontaneously or resulted from the complacency that comes with an extended period of stability as hyman minsky the great theorist of financial crises argued the collapse of the internet bubble in 2000 and the global financial crisis eight years later should still be fresh in most financiers and investors memories the problem rather is that central bankers have deliberately incited indiscriminate lending and risk on trading on a historically unprecedented scale worse while central bankers have apparently dropped plenty of proverbial helicopter money the funds have not been evenly spread monetary policies have been designed to lower credit standards thereby favouring feckless borrowers the central bank furnished liquidity that has been pouring into stock markets has found its way to fashionable meme and spac stocks in addition to a few trillion dollar big tech firms vcs favour well connected founders with shiny resumes yet as they bid up the most glamorous ventures valuations they fund less than 0 5 per cent of all us start ups one well known vc firm has even started a fund dedicated to buying cryptocurrencies savers who are too sensible to speculate have fallen behind so too have the businesses that resisted the temptation of cheap money under current conditions their less prudent competitors can pay more for scarce employees and other resources what kind of reckoning capitalism faces or when is impossible to predict in the end kornai s hungary failed slowly not suddenly it and other soviet style economies that fed the investment hunger of favoured soes kept shop shelves bare of the goods that consumers wanted and that less connected producers might have supplied in the absence of wartime or 1970s style price controls of the kind imposed by president richard nixon such shortages and rationing regimes seem unlikely in the capitalist west the current inflationary surge may yet subside as supply chain bottlenecks ease while the us federal reserve forestalls another financial meltdown but staunchly defending stock markets simply extends the state sponsored misallocation of capital and unfortunately the current crop of central bankers seem to lack the resolve that enabled the late paul volcker to harden financial constraints when he led the fed four decades ago amar bhidé professor of business at tufts university is completing a book on knightian uncertainty copyright project syndicate 2021

the world faces a glaring ambition gap for electricity supply concerns about system flexibility risky progress and development and an electricity demand shakeup several other overarching trends are affecting the world s power sector as the transition unfolds while 2021 unfolded with some relief from the chaotic global pandemic that jolted the world in 2020 the year may be remembered for its extraordinary series of energy crises after a cold snap prompted mass generation outages across a swath of the central u s most prominently in texas volatile energy markets and power supply vulnerabilities jacked up turmoil in california china india and across europe and latin america the international energy agency iea took stock of these events as it rolled out its world energy outlook weo2021 in october ahead of the united nations climate change conference cop26 meeting in glasgow scotland scenarios that could move the world toward limiting global warming to 1 5 degrees celsius may usher in a new energy economy centered on electricity but they must at the outset take into account that the system is ridden with risks to energy security affordability and sustainability the agency warned here are eight overarching trends gleaned from the paris based autonomous intergovernmental agency s annual outlook a glaring ambition gap for electricity supply continuing their trajectory massive additions of solar photovoltaics pv and wind capacity in 2020 raised renewables share to 30 of total generation and squeezed fossil fuels share to 61 the lowest level in the last three decades according to brent wanner head of iea s power sector unit policy support in more than 130 countries and very low technology costs have driven this growth decarbonization and electrification demands including for hydrogen production from electrolysis will continue to fuel new renewable installations and the iea expects that existing and already announced policies outlined in the stated policies scenario steps may lead to an increase in combined renewable capacity additions from a record 248 gw in 2020 to 310 gw in 2030 however unabated coal fired generation is still slated to remain the largest source of electricity through 2030 under steps wanner said while financing new coal power plants has become increasingly difficult 140 gw of new coal capacity was under construction and more than 430 gw were in planning stages when the report was released before cop26 during the historic climate conference 47 countries supported a statement to cease new construction of and stall permitting of new unabated coal generation these include several coal heavyweights like indonesia which suggested it may target a 2040 phaseout with international financial and technical assistance ukraine vietnam poland and south korea also committed to phaseouts while india announced it would target a 2070 net zero goal these announced pledges could halt investment decisions and facilitate retirements of nearly 150 gw of coal fired capacity by 2030 even so the world still faces a substantial ambition gap of the carbon emissions reductions needed to put the world on a solid pathway to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 figure 1 the iea said 1 the international energy agency iea reported that fossil fuels accounted for 61 of global electricity generation in 2020 the lowest level in 30 years while renewables accounted for nearly 30 by 2030 wind and solar photovoltaic growth will lead renewables to a share of nearly 50 under announced pledges and potentially much higher it said courtesy iea we estimate additional wind and solar pv and hydropower expansion in developing economies as well as some nuclear power expansion and lifetime extensions are cost effective measures that could cut the gap by 60 going forward said wanner how much new hydro and nuclear capacity could come online is still in flux however given shifting policy and investment decisions the iea is more resolute about its outlook for natural gas generation which it projects will increase between 5 and 15 to 2030 natural gas already the largest source of power in advanced economies remains broadly stable in those economies over the next decade while it increases by about one third in the emerging market and developing economies helping to moderate coal the agency said if a broader push for net zero emissions is implemented however unabated natural gas will likely begin a long term decline before 2030 it said figure 2 2 natural gas demand drivers vary by market but coal to gas switching is slated to increase gas demand across the board low carbon fuels like hydrogen and ammonia may also moderately affect future natural gas demand courtesy iea concerns about system flexibility the massive influx of non dispatchable variable generation from renewables is driving more emphasis on greater flexibility from minute to minute hour to hour and season to season the weo2021 suggests that in the u s the european union eu and china average flexibility needs will rise by more than 40 from 2020 to 2030 if net zero ambitions are achieved by 2050 global average flexibility will need to quadruple it suggests so far system planners have relied on thermal generators for flexibility but over the longer term the iea projects hydropower bioenergy and even nuclear power plants may become more central to system flexibility figure 3 3 coal and natural gas generation will remain cornerstones of electricity flexibility but flexibility profiles are slated to change as power generation mixes across the world transform the iea suggested this graphic shows three iea scenarios the stated policies scenario steps which explores where energy systems might go without further policy intervention the announced pledges scenario aps which assumes announced policies as of october 2021 will be implemented and the net zero emissions by 2050 scenario nze courtesy iea storage technologies including batteries pumped hydro compressed air energy storage gravity storage and hydrogen and ammonia energy storage will likely play a much larger role in all scenarios but the weo2021 also notably highlights demand side response s potential which will depend heavily on the implementation of necessary regulations and digital infrastructure efforts could include demand time shifting from air conditioners heat pumps and electric vehicles transmission lines could also assist in balancing demand and supply within and between regions for example by linking hydro rich systems to centers of high demand progress and development has been limited risky time to act on transition measures will be essential pramudya sub coordinator of power system planning at indonesia s ministry of energy and mineral resources noted his country s utilities are balancing new resource additions policy shifts and implementation of new grid codes at existing plants we re facing an over supply inventory if we need to add more renewable plants in order to increase the share of renewables the issue will affect all aspects of the power business including generator compensation pramudya noted when variable renewable energy resources come onto the grid that will the capacity factor of baseload power plants which will decrease the availability factors agreed to in power purchase agreements policy shifts could also affect utility bottom lines particularly as they affect power plant lifetimes he said infrastructure is also limiting offering a developer s perspective enrique de las morenas head of competitor intelligence market studies and strategic analysis at enel s global power generation division noted two very different realities exist depending on market dynamics in developing countries we are reaching a point where saturation of renewables is creating a lot of difficulties in regards to the permitting process and we need to make sure that governments put in place measures to bring renewables closer to the population permitting issues must go hand in hand with grid planning he suggested in the developing world we are reaching many bottlenecks in terms of distribution and networks that are no longer capable of providing access to all the renewables we want to deploy he said expanding infrastructure is costly and may take decades the weo2021 suggests grid investments alone may require 370 billion on average over the next decade with most of the increase going to distribution to achieve net zero by 2050 grid investment will need to soar to 630 billion a year as the transition unfolds and energy systems become more coupled markets must also recognize flexibility s broader value morenas suggested the electricity demand shakeup complicating the supply picture is how electricity demand is shaping up we observe that key parts of energy demand are increasingly becoming electrified as we see with the rapid growth of sales for electric vehicles as well as electric electrification of buildings heating and some industrial processes in an increasingly complex energy system said michael waldron head of iea s energy investment unit the weo2021 suggests that under steps demand could soar 80 by 2050 above today s level of 23 300 twh to 42 000 twh the electrification of transport under announced policies alone could drive demand by 900 twh in 2030 improved energy efficiency will be critical to tempering demand growth but at an economy level increased electrification may offset almost 50 of the demand savings from energy efficiency improvements in the steps to 2030 the weo2021 notes energy security already highly vulnerable meanwhile the already precarious supply demand balance is also vulnerable to a long list of factors several which prompted the energy crises that characterized 2021 the weo2021 suggests challenges afflicting reliability are rooted in the increasingly complex set of interactions between electricity fuels and storage the iea s modeling of a net zero scenario suggests that 40 of energy consumed worldwide by 2050 will undergo at least two conversion steps on the way to consumers by contrast hardly any of the energy reaching consumers today has been converted more than once it notes electricity security is a specific focus in the report given the world s growing reliance on solar and wind generated power and their associated ever growing need for various forms of flexibility to maintain reliable system operation addressing challenges will require recognizing these new sectoral interlinkages the iea said they should also allow for appropriate investment signals resolution of inadequate market designs bottlenecks arising from a lack of infrastructure and cybersecurity risks stemming from a new reliance on digitalization the world should also recognize that it will suffer new physical risks from changing climate including disasters and water shortages the iea warned meanwhile trade patterns and geopolitical considerations could pose new complexities to resource procurement including a long list of critical minerals that will be needed for clean energy technologies and hydrogen production hydrogen ammonia co firing and ccus emerging as lifelines for thermal power because energy security and affordability are at stake and to alleviate flexibility challenges posed by variable renewable energy integration as well as address systemic and infrastructure limitations the iea notably suggested dispatchable generation which includes existing and future coal and gas plants may have a key role to play in a comprehensive report released alongside the weo2021 the iea suggested that the possibility to combust high shares of low carbon hydrogen and ammonia in fossil fuel power plants could provide countries with an additional tool for decarbonizing the power sector while simultaneously maintaining all services of the existing fleet outfitting them with carbon capture utilization and storage ccus technologies could also preserve these generators crucial attributes which include providing system adequacy and inertia which is a key source of grid stability by 2030 79 of existing coal and gas plants in advanced economies and 83 in emerging economies will still have useful technical lives the iea noted early retirement of coal and gas fired generation will require additional investment in those affected regions to ensure a just transition and avoid economic and social disruption financial pressure will also increase on the owners of the assets that would become stranded as a result of policy decisions it said retrofitting plants to enable the use of low carbon fuels or with ccus would allow thermal plants to operate into the future as low emission sources of firm capacity while reusing their existing assets associated infrastructure and supply chains and it could also reduce costs and economic and social dislocations associated with the large scale transformation of the power sector pivotally retrofits for use of low carbon fuels and ccus also provide a hedge against the risk that cost reductions in newer generating technologies like offshore wind enhanced geothermal or advanced nuclear do not materialize the agency said technologies to enable low carbon fuel combustion already exist or are under development the iea noted while hydrogen plays only a negligible role in the power sector today accounting for less than 0 2 of electricity generation globally several gas turbine original equipment manufacturers oems have already developed turbines that can combust 100 hydrogen by volume some oems are also developing gas turbines that can be fired with ammonia and while several companies have announced plans to convert large scale plants for hydrogen or ammonia co firing or operate dedicated hydrogen fired power plants some countries are pushing to make hydrogen power part of their generation profiles japan notably wants to use 0 3 million tons mt year of hydrogen for up to 1 gw of hydrogen fired power capacity and 3 mt year of ammonia in the power sector by 2030 south korea meanwhile has a target of 1 5 gw installed fuel cell capacity in the power sector by 2022 and of 15 gw by 2040 still by 2030 low carbon hydrogen and ammonia are likely to remain expensive energy carriers for power generation the iea said however costs will depend on the market our analysis suggests that co firing 60 of low carbon ammonia in a japanese coal power plant in 2030 would lead to a generation cost that is 30 higher than energy market value in baseload but just 15 higher in peak load conditions it said by contrast using the same low carbon ammonia in indonesia would lead to a four fold increase in generation costs compared with the variable operating costs of a coal power plant the impact would be fully felt due to the absence of both a wholesale electricity market and a carbon price digitalization is playing a more prominent role as the connected energy system grows more complex digitalization has begun playing a more concerted role to provide more insight flexibility and potentially cut costs through increased efficiency the weo2021 notes spending on digital grid technologies that are accommodating more inverter based generation enabling two way flows reached 40 billion in 2019 making up about 15 of total network investment technologies include sensors machine learning and drones that are being leveraged to improve power plant performance extend asset lifetimes boost operations and maintenance detect outages reduce downtime and improve transmission and distribution of power on a broader level they span from smart meters connected appliances and electric vehicles to unlock the full potential of demand side flexibility investment is lagging perhaps the factor that most concerns the iea as well as sustainability committed governments and organizations across the world is that insufficient investment is contributing to uncertainty over the future in the weo2021 the iea estimated 4 trillion will be needed by 2030 to get the world on track to address climate change the iea has been warning for years that current investment levels in the global energy sector are inadequate both to meet near term energy needs and long term transition goals noted dr fatih birol iea executive director it is hard to understate the dangers inherent in today s shortfall in spending on clean energy transitions compared with the levels required if we do not correct it soon the risks of destabilizing volatility will only grow as we move forward he said sonal patel is a power senior associate editor sonalcpatel powermagazine
michael berman via getty images if the pizza brings you joy just eat it those vague and lofty new year s resolutions eat better or be healthy often don t last past january why not keep it simple this year we talked to nutritionists nationwide for their suggestions on smart doable resolutions to take nourishing care of yourself in the year ahead resolution 1 begin with your mind not your mouth registered dietitian marissa meshulam told huffpost she wished people would resolve to go for enjoyment this year and abandon all or nothing thinking around eating it doesn t matter what you ate yesterday she said your body still needs nourishment today every time you eat you have the opportunity to feel your best and that s a superpower all its own advertisement i wish more people would resolve to give themselves permission to eat the foods they love registered dietitian nutritionist chelsey amer told huffpost this year learn how to make peace with those foods and incorporate them into your diet regularly resolve to find joy in the kitchen said registered dietitian nutritionist vicki shanta retelny instead of focusing on what to avoid focus on adding a bounty of whole foods to your eating repertoire this year resolve to stop overthinking your eating choices which robs you of truly being present registered dietitian nutritionist amanda frankeny told huffpost reflect on your eating behaviors challenge your irrational or negative thoughts and move on it s quite a process but taking these steps allows you to let go learn and look ahead advertisement resolution 2 eat more plants several of the nutritionists made a case for the simple resolution to eat more plants they re extremely nutrient dense and they contain plenty of antioxidants to keep our cells healthy meshulam said i always recommend that at least half of your plate should be plants and while fresh is great you can also lean on convenience produce with frozen and dehydrated options for example registered dietitian barbara ruhs hopes this is the year we can resolve to turn around the recent decline in plant consumption given the power of fresh fruits and vegetables to reduce the risk for disease and death it s astounding that we re actually eating less of them she told huffpost ruhs further suggested avoiding packaged goods and heading right for the real thing why look for plant based on a processed food label when you can simply walk to the produce aisle and load up on delicious fresh plants resolution 3 start a garden if you ve resolved to eat more plants the easiest way to do that is from your own backyard patio or windowsill garden registered dietitian nutritionist jerlyn jones told huffpost you don t have to start with an extravagant space that has enough vegetables to fill a farmers market your garden can be as simple as a few window boxes of herbs or a potted tomato plant advertisement a good first step she said is to figure out what to grow when buying seeds or plants ask what varieties will do best in the conditions you have to work with for example several compact tomato plants do particularly well in containers aniko hobel via getty images a 3 ounce serving of alaskan salmon contains 19 grams of protein and 82 of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin b12 resolution 4 consider seafood if you re in search of a perfect protein source look no farther than seafood ruhs said it s chock full of nutrients like omega 3 fats selenium and vitamin d those nutrients are hard to find elsewhere but they re abundant in most seafood and shellfish she eats seafood that s raised through land based aquaculture which she described as involving no pollution to the environment no invasive species escaping no overfishing of fragile wild stocks and zero exposure to toxic metals advertisement resolution 5 mindful meals this year resolve to monotask at meals meshulam said eating while distracted is one of the biggest eating issues i encounter with clients when we eat while distracted our brains don t actually recognize what is happening leading to eating amnesia that takes us well past the point of fullness research shows for example that eating while using a smartphone can lead to consuming 25 more calories to be energised by what you eat listen to your hunger and fullness and eat mindfully retelny added resolution 6 source food with care registered dietitian nutritionist sharon palmer told huffpost that she encourages people to get to know how the food you re eating got on your plate ask yourself questions like is the produce from local producers how did they grow it where is the bread baked how was this morning s breakfast cereal produced where do all the ingredients come from resolve to support fair just socially conscious food producers with your food dollars resolution 7 try alcohol free drinks registered dietitian nutritionist amy gorin loves the trend of alcohol free drinks as part of resolution making drinking less but still enjoying what you drink is a great way to cut back on both alcohol intake and calories she said there are so many options out there that you can try a few different alcohol free drinks and see what you like

gordon stark outlined the ambitions held by the long established firm which he said are backed by the firepower of its private equity owner murgitroyd which was established by the late ian murgitroyd in 1975 was acquired by london based sovereign capital partners in december 2019 in a deal that valued the business at around 65 million the firm had been listed on the london stock exchange since 2001 since becoming part of sovereign murgitroyd has showed its willingness to make acquisitions to expand in august 2021 it completed a deal to acquire dublin based hanna moore curley a move that strengthened its presence in europe and the far east and it quickly followed that in october with the acquisition of udl intellectual property in a transaction that looked to be worth than 10m the effect of the acquisitions was to cement murgitroyd s status as one of the largest ip firms in europe with a headcount of around 440 people operating out of 20 offices across the uk and european union the firm also has client liaison offices in the us and china mr stark who joined murgitroyd in 1998 and rose to become chief executive in 2020 told the herald it s been a very positive time we have made two acquisitions one in august one in october that s brought us a meaningful step forward in growth 40 per cent increase in the size of the company about 100 new colleagues taking us up to 440 across the business and it s really been the first step to delivering a scaled up growth ambition asked if the current growth strategy flowed directly from its acquisition by sovereign two years ago mr stark who has an academic background in biotechnology said absolutely the recent growth is reflective and realisation of that growth ambition what they bring is not just financial backing but support of our strategy and vision for growth some of that has started to be realised by the recent acquisitions on whether murgitroyd was actively looking to do more deals he added yes our growth plans involve a combination of both organic growth and acquisitive growth we have a pipeline of businesses that we are talking to all the time what s important to us is the correct curation of businesses particularly in a people focused business getting the right fit culturally and strategically is hugely important the acquisitions at murgitroyd come against a backdrop of consolidation in the wider market of ip and trademark legal services if anything mr stark said he would have expected to have seen more consolidation citing the example of the accountancy sector but he noted that the pace is starting to pick up we re starting to see consolidation in the intellectual property adviser market mr stark said in many ways we are positioning ourselves to be at the forefront of that consolidation we feel the pace of change around consolidation is increasing mr stark said integrating new people and businesses presents different challenges in the pandemic era he noted murgitroyd has taken steps to strengthen its leadership team to help with the process and highlighted the recruitment of helen archibald from dundee s thorntons solicitors as chief operating officer as a key move he said ms archibald brings additional experience and resource around integration of acquisitions acquisition is not the only means through which murgitroyd is generating growth the pandemic has also seen the birth of new enterprises and ideas many focused on the digital world murgitroyd has witnessed the major trends first hand in its work as has been common in many sectors covid has sped up the pace of innovation and change mr stark said we already saw as a backdrop coming into covid some large macro trends with our clients for example oil and gas repositioning into renewables and green tech we see our clients in the automotive sector already moving from internal combustion engines into electric motors and battery technology we see our clients in the brand area trying to understand where the future lies with virtual digital goods so there s been a lot of change then on top of that covid has made many businesses think around how they operate how they deliver to their clients innovation has been central to so much of that change it has been a very buoyant time in terms of businesses innovating and looking to protect that innovation along with the excitement of acquisitions and helping clients protect their innovations the year just gone by was also tinged with sadness at murgitroyd on february 3 2021 the firm s founder ian murgitroyd passed away suddenly for mr stark and other staff it was a devastating blow that left us in shock he said mr murgitroyd whom he had worked alongside for 20 years until the sovereign deal had left a huge legacy that he and his colleagues were determined to continue six questions what countries have you most enjoyed travelling to for business or leisure and why being part of a business with an international footprint has brought travel opportunities japan and nicaragua insightful in understanding business culture and practices west coast usa always brings new ideas when you were a child what was your ideal job why did it appeal i always had an attraction to being in business in particular to identifying new ideas and opportunities and seeing what could be made of them what was your biggest break in business my first job with murgitroyd shortly after graduating there s an enduring confidence and gratitude that comes from a company believing you can make a difference and that it will invest in your development what was your worst moment in business the sudden death of the company s founder ian murgitroyd so soon after stepping back from the business he created i spent 20 years working with and learning from him as he led the growth of a global business who do you most admire and why eliud kipchoge the only person to run a sub two hour marathon there is a lot to learn from his humble outlook

we will remember 2021 as a special year it had been special for us because it gave us the golden jubilee of our independence which we celebrated once again along with our v day dec 16 and the birth centenary of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman the architect of our nation while celebrating these glorious events we also took stock of 50 years of our journey as an independent nation and had a fresh look on what we did right and where we went wrong that in the just gone year the un recognized bangladesh s credentials to become a developing nation effective from 2026 will long be an occasion to be proud of our people s talent hard work courage resilience and sacrifices this has been an excellent achievement for a nation that was left in ruins by an unjust war imposed on it by a power that in the guise of being our brothers gleefully exploited us in all fronts and did not hesitate to unleash a horrendous reign of killings rapes and arson in the name of safeguarding islam bangladesh today is regarded in the international arena as a nation that has defied the doomsters not only we have survived as a nation but we have gracefully proved our worth in many a front especially in the economic growth social development women education and empowerment innovation in small enterprises sports and culture even though this can t be said equally enthusiastically about politics democracy human rights social justice and values and spirit of our liberation war in 1971 if we have progressed in some fronts we have regressed in many more way too the violence that swept the durga puja celebration of the hindu community in october will continue to haunt us for long the violence and resulting deaths throughout the up elections across the country will refuse to recede from our memory book of 2021 the up now and down again management of our government s response to the covid 19 pandemic and subsequent setbacks in procurement of vaccines the chaotic declaration of lockdowns and their pathetic execution leaving tens of thousands of mostly marginal and poor people on a trail of untold miseries on the roads and waterways will continue to make us feel uncomfortable for long for sure before we could finish our appreciation of the government in handing out stimulus packages for the industries to recover from the pandemic induced losses came the unhappy news that a large section of small businesses had failed to get the benefits the migrants returned home in thousands losing jobs abroad mostly in the middle east and gulf nations and the promise of providing them held did not quite materialize to their satisfaction throughout the year 2021 our migrants whose remittances have been fattening our foreign exchange reserve of which the government takes full credit had been left to fend on their own with little help from the authorities and when it came it had always been late _ beginning from getting new jobs businesses at home to timely vaccination and finally exorbitant hike in the air fare to the me destinations we could have done much better and more humanely in this regard how about the three crore people who slipped back to poverty due the pandemic the outgone year witnessed a renewed chaos in the country s road and river transports over the unusual rise in bus and launch fares in response to the government s arbitrary hike in fuel diesel and kerosene citing price surge in international market this also led to a short lived return of the student protest against deaths on the roads and a half fare bus ride in the cities before we could recover from the tragic death of over 50 workers some of them teenaged and young and women at sezan food factory in narayanganj in july the nation was hit by another shock the dec 24 fire on mv avijan 10 launch on sugangha river off jhalakathi town leaving more than 40 dead many struggling to recover from burn injuries and many others missing prompting relatives to use boats to search through the river for their loved ones like in the case of sezan food victims the police have to resort to dna test of the charred launch fire bodies to identity them before they could be given to the families in these two instances like most such tragedies in bangladesh it had been the utter negligence of the owners and their staff that caused the human made disasters worse still is that the culprits are likely to get scot free and live their lives as usual keeping in the nation in wait for another calamity the year 2021 had been quite good for the media too apart from the much condemned incident of the arrest rozina islam a senior reporter of prothom alo daily after unlawful confinement at the health ministry at bangladesh secretariat for her reporting on health ministry s alleged corruption and covid 19 mishandling the media in general lived under the threat of the 2018 digital security act or dsa throughout the year journalists editors and media activists raised their voice against the dreaded law that they see as a tool of suppressing expression freedom of press and free thinking this law has continued to affect free and independent journalism as it is intimidating cases are filed against the dissident voices this year also saw the return of the use of the british era official secrets act of 1923 with its application in the case of rozina islam this and several other cases undermined bangladesh government s efforts at making the international community to consider it as a democratic administration respectful to free media and human rights in regard to bangladesh s relations with the united states dhaka s alleged abuse of human rights in the form of extrajudicial killings had finally been flagged off by washington in the month of december when the nation was preparing for its 50 years of v day celebrations the news came that the us treasury department sanctioned our crime busting elite force rapid action battalion rab and its seven former and current officials for abuse of human rights amid the shockwave cause by the not entirely surprising report the government has been trying to prepare a uniform response so that dhaka washington relations don t go further down before the sanctions related shock could ease came another tiding from washington this time the us leahy law that wants dhaka to place a detail outline of its use of us security cooperation assistance as we bade farewell to 2021 we look forward to a better 2022 even the wish sounds like a cliché will it be too much to ask for an improvement in our performance card with regard to democracy human rights secular and humane values and social justice

atlantic build to rent model comes to uk new york based kkr s involvement might come as a surprise the firm founded by billionaires henry kravis and george roberts made a name for itself as a ruthless corporate raider that pioneered leveraged buyouts a far cry from the cosy image cultivated by an industry seeking to attract liberal millennials but industry sources say kkr immortalised in bryan burrough and john helyar s book barbarians at gate is unlikely to change the rental sector s softer approach one source at a rival developer says unlikely to try and turn things on their head as it s all working the marketing and lower margin approach works as typically tenants are very eager to stay in these properties i can t see them cutting costs and raising margins at least not immediately experts say investor interest from across the atlantic comes from experience build to rent may still be considered an alternative investment market in britain with volumes significantly lower than logistics or office real estate markets but hedge funds and private equity investors are betting that will change rapidly annabel turbutt day of south carolina based developer greystar says the demand to buy into build to rent in the us will almost certainly be followed by brits north american investors are familiar with the institutional rental housing market given its maturity in the us and they can see the future opportunity in the uk where the market still has plenty of room to grow she says demand for housing is strong so the build to rent sector offers relatively safe harbour for global investors particularly against the backdrop of recent uncertainty in the office and retail real estate sectors post pandemic she adds the uk market has grown strongly in recent years but it is still just over a third of the us private rented sector we do not need to convert people to renting we just need to provide a better service to people who choose or need to rent the competition from the buy to let sector is weak in terms of asset quality amenity provision and security of tenure obstacles remain planning issues could still threaten to choke development however kurt mueller at residential rental developer grainger said last year that the company had struggled to get a new block in north london through planning for 13 years johnny caddick chief executive at moda living agrees that the lack of approvals for big schemes so far means the market for trading large blocks of flats as exists in other countries has not fully established in the uk one challenge the sector faces from an investment perspective is that there is a shortage of quality assets in the uk market which is yet to reach full maturity he says investors are overcoming this challenge by partnering with businesses that are able to deliver their own quality stock getting involved in the projects from the ground up comes with its own associated risks but ultimately pays off when they have stabilised modern assets in an underprovided market turbett day meanwhile says the biggest put off for investors looking at the british market is a lack of space land supply is a perennial issue for developers she says it seems unlikely there will be enough land to satisfy demand for the foreseeable future that being said she still believes the industry has room to grow and attract more money at the moment institutional investors have the opportunity to buy into a supply constrained market at the bottom of the rental cycle without too much exposure to the business cycle and other risk factors turbett day says we re seeing strong occupancy at assets fast lease ups and positive online reviews indicating that there is increasing demand for the product the rise of buildings like the lexington might represent the fracturing of the british dream of mass home ownership but us investors are hoping they are a sign of a bigger transformation to come
patricia massy and i have been trying to find a time for this interview which has not been easy she and i both have young children it s the holidays and well omicron on top of that she s the owner of the eponymous massy books which means she s also managing staff and stock during the busiest season for retailers i do not know how i do it some days says massy trying to turn off her possessed printer as we talk it s a juggling act reading books is the ideal covid 19 hobby solitary sedate no heavy breathing unless you re reading bear by marian engel or something and massy like other booksellers has experienced a pandemic related bump in sales and support but even prior to the pandemic massy who is of mixed cree métis and english descent had developed a loyal customer base by offering a rich array of indigenous literature and a curated trove of rare books at her vancouver bookshop located in chinatown it turns out bookselling is in her dna her father told her that their family tree includes seven generations of booksellers including the proprietor of a massey books in 18th century cork ireland and stephen massey founder of the christie s book department after a family argument massy s branch of the family tree dropped the e in 2016 massy was just a few credits shy of a creative writing degree from the university of the fraser valley when she got caught up in opening her bookstore i wrote a lot of stories around indigenous identity but i m just not a good writer she says laughing and that s ok i ve come to terms with that i m better at reading i m a really good reader for massy books are more than diversions they re facilitators of connection and community a co founder of the indigenous brilliance reading series which in partnership with room magazine spotlights indigenous women and queer authors she also created the massy arts society in 2019 to provide space for arts programming and exhibitions we ve had over 100 events this year online and in person she says it s really wonderful to have a space that the community can use for book launches fundraisers all kinds of events 2022 looms as a year of uncertainty but for massy no matter what happens it will definitely include books reading them selling them and sharing them she took some time in the final hours of 2021 to talk about a few of her favourites how a ceremonial vision heralded her journey into entrepreneurship and what makes massy books unique among local bookstores michelle cyca i feel like every bookish kid dreams of opening a bookstore is that something you always wanted to do patricia massy i worked at various bookstores before i opened my own and i never really thought it was possible i didn t feel as though i had the money or the capability to do it but in 2013 or 2014 i was at a crossroads in life where i didn t know what i wanted to do and i went to a ceremony to figure it out during the ceremony i had a vision of opening up a bookstore i wanted to live a life that was surrounded by stories and healing and live my days in a more peaceful environment i was working as a support worker and then an indigenous outreach worker one day i was walking to work and i saw a fellow running toward me with a machete i thought he was going to attack me but he was actually running at a man behind me i ran into the office and hid until the police came and it was a violent scene and at that moment i realized i needed a change how did you start that journey i started by finding books at garage and estate sales and then selling them at flea markets after eight months i opened up a pop up shop on main and east fifth avenue and ran that for a year by then i felt confident that i could run a store i knew i could pay the bills and make money and i was ready to rent a permanent space in 2017 it was pure happenstance that i acquired a large 10 000 book collection from a retired physics professor named bill dalby he was going into a retirement home and needed to get rid of all his books i didn t have the budget to buy them all but i offered him a set amount of money for part of his collection and he decided to give me the entire collection for that amount it was very very generous and i probably wouldn t have been able to open up the store if it wasn t for that donation i m still selling some of his books today he was an avid reader a collector of everything he had the whole gamut including some rare items like a first edition stephen hawking they ve really kept me going over the years what makes massy books unique among local bookstores when i opened the store right from the get go i wanted to showcase and highlight the books where i could see my history and the histories of others who had been overlooked and forgotten i wanted to see those reflected on the shelves i wanted books that reconcile reconnect and transform what it means to be an indigenous person and so we ve always had a really generous collection of indigenous material from the very beginning why was that significant to you as a mixed urban indigenous person it s been hard to know where i come from and where i belong when i m not immersed in the land or the culture so opening the bookstore has been a huge part of my personal journey in reconnecting and reconciling as well are there any books in particular that have a part of that journey there are some that are really foundational that have reflected my experience of being caught in two worlds in search of april raintree by beatrice mosionier halfbreed by maria campbell ceremony by leslie marmon silko those are books that talk about being a mixed indigenous person and finding your way and then there are more contemporary authors that inspire me and shape my life billy ray belcourt leanne betasamosake simpson alicia elliott is there anything you ve read over the past year that you really love the last book i read that i m almost finished is called the 1619 project put together by nikole hannah jones it includes poems essays and works of fiction that challenge and reframe u s history by putting enslavement and the continuum of racism at the forefront it places the beginning of u s history in 1619 with the arrival of the first enslaved people not with the american revolution one interesting part that blew me away is that it argues the u s went to war with england so they could continue slavery which is not something people are taught in schools the british promise to the enslaved during the revolutionary war was a tactic to get those enslaved to rebel the british were by no means abolitionists it s pretty captivating and engaging i respect that it throws american history on its head and shows it for what it is which is a country built on slavery i also read caste by isabel wilkerson which is also a great book on the topic of how racism is infused in every institution in the u s and in canada too do you keep a lot of books at home i do but once i read a book i tend not to keep it i ll bring it to the store a lot of the books on my shelves are books i want to read not ones i have already read but there are some that i m going to hold onto which are rare or hard to find i have a whole collection of signed books by lee maracle and eden robinson i have a dictionary of the cree language from the 18th century and i have a limited edition leather bound edition of e pauline johnson poems and a first edition of one of her books that is bound in buckskin those are special items that i ll keep unless someone offers me a lot of money then maybe i ll think about it but i d never give up any of my lee maracles that s for sure what has the pandemic been like for massy books to give you an idea at the beginning of 2020 we had two staff we re in chinatown so we felt the effects of covid 19 before anyone else because there was a lot of racism around the pandemic and people were avoiding the neighbourhood in february we announced that we were offering free shipping and people just started flooding our store with orders i think it was because it sent a message to the world that said hey our business is suffering and we re going to try whatever we can to keep our doors open and keep the sales coming through so that we survive from that moment on we ve been selling more than ever in june 2020 we sold more books than we did in all of 2019 now we have eight staff most of our orders come from online whether they re picked up or shipped we want to make it as easy to buy from us as from amazon from talking to other independent booksellers who have adapted and made their books available online i think they ve fared well too that s reassuring to hear i like knowing that other bookstores are doing well as a bookseller have you noticed a change in readers interests around indigenous literature over the last few years i ve only had my own store since 2015 but in that time there s definitely been a change in customers buying habits indigenous stories have always been here but in the last two years there s been a huge uptick in demand there is definitely a desire now from non indigenous folks to learn more about residential schools schools are trying to bring indigenous authors and books about residential schools into the curriculum in 2020 with the murder of george floyd we saw a lot of books being sold about black history and racism and that kind of overflowed into indigenous topics as well during covid 19 there s been a movement to support independent bookstores but people also want to support black and indigenous businesses right now too but for indigenous readers there has also been a shift in desiring more books for and about indigenous characters that don t centre on addiction or residential school or suffering there are some great books that have come out recently like the prairie chicken dance tour by dawn dumont firekeeper s daughter by angeline boulley a whole series of indigenous horror novels we re starting to see more of that it s just so exciting to see all the indigenous authors coming out with this work and working in a bookstore i get to buy all of them i love all the different genres indigenous writers are working in like joshua whitehead s anthology love at the end which is like post apocalyptic queer romance oh if you like that chelsea vowel has a new book coming out in 2022 buffalo is the new buffalo which is an indigenous science fiction anthology i always ask people what books they recommend to others and most authors are very reticent to answer this question book recommendations are so personal but since this is part of your job i m curious how you approach it if someone comes up to me and wants a book i don t automatically recommend what i like i need to know who i m dealing with so i ask them what do you read what are the last three books you ve read what are you in the mood for i have very specific interests indigenous non fiction history cultural studies psychology but if my tastes don t align i pull from staff recommendations and if those don t work i make recommendations based on general knowledge i don t consume a lot of sci fi or children s books or craft books for instance so sometimes i just have to say well this is really popular there are some books i always recommend one is ceremony by leslie marmon silko it s a story of a second world war vet who returns home after serving abroad and finds himself through healing and ceremony it s about struggling with the old ways and finding ways to bring ceremony into your contemporary life it s an extremely well written classic novel that s also infused with poems also anything by richard wagamese his words feel like going to ceremony and they connect me to the land my dad passed a few years ago and medicine walk was one of his favourites so reading it is a way to stay connected to him knowing that he read that book and those words as i read them is cathartic medicine walk is a story about a son and a father their relationship redemption compassion and the power of the land to heal it s one of his best novels and then one native life too is non fiction essays and writing over the course of his life about reclaiming his indigenous identity and the things he s learned about being human it s one of those books where you can see his journey unfolding any others that you recommend i know it s not a very popular genre but i ve read a lot of books on mortality death and dying one of the books that i think everyone should read because we all have an expiration date is being mortal by atul gawande it s one i don t want to say favourite no one has a favourite book about dying laughs but it was really helpful and enlightening around when my dad died it s less about the science of dying more about our humanity and what it means to have quality at the end of life he s a beautiful beautiful writer we don t talk about death a lot and we don t celebrate death it s a book that s been really important in my life also anything by lee maracle i love lee maracle i ve read most of her non fiction very fierce and her book of poetry talking to the diaspora is really good too i also love how it was put together graphically what books or book events are you most looking forward to reading in 2022 events we ve already got 30 events lined up for 2022 let me look at the massy arts calendar we have fire is not a country by cynthia dewi oka coming we ll have a new art show every five weeks too for books i m excited about so many one is bad cree by jessica johns meet these writers they re book people read more i think that s coming out in 2023 oh i ll keep promoting it until then i m a big fan of her in general who wouldn t want to read about supernatural dream worlds and the urban indigenous experience in a novel have you read her poem kokum is so metal in how not to spill it s such a cool poem another book i m excited about is half bads in white regalia by cody caetano he s the winner of the 2020 indigenous voices award and it was written under the mentorship of lee maracle it s a coming of age story with humour warmth and deep generosity i ve just received the arc

the head of australia s largest pharmacy chain has slammed the federal government over the bungled rapid antigen test situation chemist warehouse boss mario tascone spoke to 2gb radio on monday morning saying the government could lessen the financial burden on sick aussies by removing gst on the tests if they won t immediately subsidise them i m sure they can get on zoom and run an emergency session of parliament because the thought the government is making 10 per cent off millions and millions of packets off sales of rapid antigen tests really doesn t sit right he said chemist warehouse boss mario tascone says the federal government should cut gst on rapid antigen tests to help make the kits more affordable to sick australians the demand for tests around australia has seen single kits sell for as much as 100 with many chemists unable to re order stock poll should rapid tests be free for everyone yes no should rapid tests be free for everyone yes 2010 votes no 528 votes now share your opinion there have been reports of rapid tests costing as much as 100 per unit as covid cases skyrocket throughout australia due to the emergence of the highly infectious omicron variant on monday nsw recorded 20 794 new covid cases and four deaths victoria s tally hit 8 577 infections and queensland saw 4 249 as the strain rips through the east coast mr tascone said the federal government need to be doing significantly more to ensure sick australians have easy and affordable access to rapid tests they really need to be as affordable as possible he told 2gb the chemist warehouse director said the demand for rats was unprecedented similar to that of the toilet paper hoarding at the start of the pandemic and said dropping gst would see immediate results they ll be 10 per cent cheaper overnight we ll drop the price its not much but that 50 pack of five becomes 45 overnight he said so that s one thing they can do immediately apparently it needs parliament sitting mr tascone said the federal government need to be doing significantly more to ensure sick australians have easy and affordable access to rapid tests the uk government has mailed free rapid tests to people s homes since april but the pm has refused to adopt a similar model in australia over cost fears chemist warehouse customers can only buy two rapid antigen tests at one time to ensure they were available for everyone when you ve got 25 million people who want a rapid antigen test within the space of a week that s impossible he said the calls were dismissed by the prime minister on monday however with scott morrison saying we can t go round and make everything free the uk government has mailed free rapid tests to people s homes since april but the pm has refused to adopt a similar model in australia over cost fears instead rapid tests are free at testing centres but cost at least 10 per swab at pharmacies and supermarkets which are low on stock due to a lack of supply members of the public queue in their cars for a covid 19 pcr test at the mascot laverty pathology drive through clinic in sydney on monday several medical experts called for rapid tests to be free for everyone including university of sydney infectious disease specialist robert booy who said free tests could make a real difference to controlling disease but in an interview on sunrise on monday morning the prime minister said this was a bad idea we re at another stage of this pandemic now where we just can t go round and make everything free we have to live with this virus this isn t a medicine it s a test and so there s a difference between those two things he said australia s gross debt is expected to reach a record 1 2 trillion by 2024 25 after huge pandemic spending including 100 billion on the jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme the prime minister is keen to avoid further cost blowouts saying on monday he wants to take that pressure off the budget but mr morrison said he was working with states and territories to reduce the price for vulnerable groups with concessional access to pensioners and others the cost of subsidising the tests will be shared 50 50 with states and territories mr morrison also said he would not make tests free because he didn t want to deter private companies from ordering them so they could make money the private market whether it s in the big warehouse pharmacies or the other pharmacies or the supermarkets they can now go and stock their shelves with confidence that they won t be undercut by the government he told the today show groups representing manufacturers and suppliers of rapid antigen tests said the industry supported tests being free for everyone the industry doesn t have a position because we sell to the government for market price and we don t care if they are free or not dean whiting the chief executive of pathology technology australia told guardian australia a brisbane resident lines up for a test on sunday woolworths has denied lobbying against free tests while coles declined to comment university of nsw professor of epidemiology mary louise mclaws warned in a series of tweets that rapid tests are becoming reserved for the privileged and wealthy saying governments need to rethink their current stance to reduce cost test hubs could use pcr on those with symptoms rapid antigen test rats on all others cheaper but still effective professor mclaws tweeted on sunday without providing free rats to households only privileged wealthy will be able to protect themselves reduce wider risk of spread mr morrison s comments also sparked outrage from political opponents who demanded free tests independent senator rex patrick wrote on twitter the case for widespread free rats is clear but scott morrison says you can t just make everything free he didn t say that to big business as they took billions in jobkeeper money they didn t need the boss of australia s biggest trade union sally mcmanus

advertisement labor leader anthony albanese stopped short of demanding free tests instead calling for a means tested system people who can t afford them should be given them he said however nsw one nation leader mark latham backed the pm s position saying the tests would be over used if handed out for free the problem with unlimited free rapid antigen tests however is over use he said the level of public fear and panic will have some people the covid curiosity cohort testing every few hours the need for rapid tests has become urgent as testing queues in melbourne and sydney stretched to five hours over the past week due to queensland s entry test requirements clinic closures and more people wanting a negative result before visiting family over the christmas holidays but there is a
