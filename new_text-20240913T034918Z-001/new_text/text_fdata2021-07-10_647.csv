reduction which is the overarching theme of most of what i write my goal is to provide a baseline or ground rules for debating strategies to deal with the pandemic and similar disasters article content on april 29 last year i wrote about how to implement a covid zero strategy of extreme lockdowns the next day i gave the arguments in favour of the alternative viewpoint of avoiding lockdowns entirely my point was to provide insight into what kinds of strategies the people in charge of decision making were considering so the public could understand and if they so desired provide their

article continues below article content speaking generally about how we respond to disasters like covid 19 some people understand what is at stake and adapt accordingly others feel the problem is too big for them to influence while a third group ignores the issue of adaptation and is then surprised when governments do what disaster management experts predicted they would do most people fall into the second category where they feel the problem is too big for them to influence as individuals in that context let s examine the theory that the covid 19 pandemic began with a lab leak at the wuhan institute of virology in china recommended from editorial vezina tragedies like florida condo collapse can and have happened here vezina what we learn from the normal distribution of lowlifes vezina the willpower paradox a lesson for future pandemics advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the reality is that multiple countries around the world have significantly more dangerous viruses in labs smallpox in the united states and russia in particular come to mind the world health organization has repeatedly recommended smallpox stores be destroyed because no essential public health purpose is served by their retention now we could stop our analysis there and simply conclude that powerful countries don t listen to the who china s government for example has a history of telling who inspectors what they can and cannot do or see when searching for the origins of diseases like covid to the point that even if china was telling the truth many people wouldn t believe it that said it turns out that in 2017 canadian scientists working at a small lab in alberta recreated an extinct virus known as horsepox which is in the same family of viruses as smallpox although not known to infect humans advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content they did this to demonstrate that if it could be done with horsepox it could be done with smallpox as well the immediate disaster risk reduction question this raises is could a terrorist organization working with scientists either forced to co operate or willing to do so secretly make and distribute a virus that could wipe out more than 20 of the human population to put it bluntly are we at a point in scientific advancement where a handful of individuals can wage an effective war on the global population the answer to both these questions is yes which leads to the next question how can we completely stop this from ever happening we apologize but this video has failed to load tap here to see other videos from our team try refreshing your browser or play video the response from a disaster risk reduction expert would be that to completely eliminate such a threat would require setting up a surveillance state on the scale of the 2002 science fiction movie minority report where authorities arrested and immediately imprisoned criminals based on the concept of pre crime but the most important question to consider here is whether the cure could be implemented in a way that would not make it worse than the disease especially in a democracy if the answer is yes then we should do something about it but if the answer is no then we should take all reasonable steps to prevent the global spread of disease and then move on to other problems we can solve alex vezina is the ceo of prepared canada corp and has a graduate degree in disaster and emergency management he

this was always going to be about joshua ferris s dad you catch me pretty fresh the author deadpans over zoom i haven t talked about it the it refers to his long awaited new novel a calling for charlie barnes little brown sept and to talk about it he discovers over the course of this conversation is indistinguishable from talking about his grief after the loss of his father who died in 2014 it s an experience that led ferris down a long winding road toward a book that he calls a culmination of all of the other books that i ve written quite a statement for the 46 year old literary star ferris hadn t hit 35 before his 2007 debut then we came to the end received a national book award nomination his celebrated 2010 sophomore novel the unnamed was followed by 2014 s to rise again at a decent hour which was a booker prize finalist days after the latter was published ferris got to work on his next novel sort of coming off to rise ferris felt challenged by his father s perception of his calling he didn t see the worth of fiction ferris says to arrive at the answer for why that s a facile perspective is very very difficult so ferris began putting stories of his family including his uncle and grandmother and cousin to the page very often i had nothing he admits that was so mystifying to me all this life that these people generated all of the wit and the confusion and the drama it didn t make for a good scene it didn t make for a good line it didn t make for a good story pushing up against his late father s perceptions ferris sought to figure out what the relationship was between real life and the written word the resulting book feels like both a radical departure from and a natural evolution of ferris s work it s his version of a memoir says judy clain ferris s editor at little brown the story is narrated by jake barnes a nod to the central character in the sun also rises and one of many overt literary references in the book it opens in late 2008 when jake s father charlie is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer while reeling from catastrophic financial losses due to the plummeting stock market but life for the oft divorced ever discontented man improbably goes on and he s granted a second chance his son so we re told is prepared to tell his story ironically it follows my father s actual biography ferris says when he was diagnosed with a pretty damning cancer he should have been dead within six months but in fact he lived almost eight years during that time he had an opportunity to reflect upon the ways that he was and the ways he wished to be and to bring them into closer alignment i got an education in second chances by digging into the relationship between his father s life and the art of writing fiction ferris keyed into the truth behind it we are sustained by certain illusions until the day we die he says those fictions are dearly held and deeply felt and without them life would not be worth living as a calling for charlie barnes progresses the eponymous hero s mystery becomes increasingly entwined with the narrator s image of it if this history of charlie barnes has its breaks in chronology and the occasional gaping hole well i wouldn t know how to write it any other way one passage reads i couldn t possibly hope to highlight what the man himself would have highlighted or for that matter present the arguments he might have presented against what i have chosen to highlight the narration reflects the way ferris talks about his book the leap into my father s perspective and the conflicts that he carried around with him i didn t really want to do that he says upon doing it i recognized how difficult it is to do that in a fundamental way even with somebody you re incredibly close to the emotional work that it takes to get into somebody else s perspective is extraordinary clain zeroed in on this autofiction aspect and came away with a changed notion of it i learned that the truth in fiction doesn t exist she says just the truth of fiction ferris fans can rest assured that biting laugh out loud humor one of his signature strengths returns in full force here as ever it s tied up in the foibles of modern existence from generational and political divides to the corrupt systems under which we all rather dutifully operate in any kind of pattern of life you see these ironies that rise above your own understanding ferris says it is my preferred mode to always try to guess in my own life what those ironies are so i don t feel like a dupe there s nobody who feels more confused and benighted than me but i m at least out there doing my best to think where s the pothole where s the banana peel if this is not quite ferris s silliest work it feels like his most personal but it doesn t shy away from the political it s easy to see that the book was written during the trump era nonetheless the author makes clear that the novel is not a political statement as it connects individual and collective experiences one of the things that was continually put forth was trump is tearing at the fabric of our dearly held illusions he is tearing apart the fictions we ve maintained about being a diverse inviting country ferris explains this was very similar to the ways in which we hold on dearly to our own private notions that other people would more than happily destroy i saw parallels all the time which brings us back one last time to ferris s father the power of a calling for charlie barnes rests exactly in those parallels between its patriarch s journey and the national undoing happening subtly around him ferris s work cuts to the heart of who we are by focusing very painfully on who one man was i am both trying to capture some of the psychological underpinnings that created a man like my father and show the ways in which he used his brain and his heart to become not only a better father and a better man but a better american ferris says consider this book not just a work of grief or love or memoir then but a work of hope too david aaron is a book critic and magazine editor he lives in los angeles

in the end will the rate hike start in the latter half of 2023 at the federal open market committee meeting held on june 16 attention was drawn to the outlook of the 18 members on the commencement of rate hikes which changed significantly from three months prior causing surprise in the financial markets a dot plot in march showed that the majority of members forecast no rate hikes until 2024 nevertheless although the view in advance of this fomc meeting that these would be moved to 2023 was originally said to be spreading most members outlook had changed to two rate hikes in 2023 even at the fomc meeting three months ago there were many expectations that rate hikes would be moved to 2023 and the assumption that the rate hikes would start was largely unchanged my previous fomc forecast was correct however once confirmation of rising inflation is received how long will the federal reserve continue its zero interest rate policy just before this fomc meeting i thought that the possibility of a rate hike being moved up to 2023 was almost 50 50 and if anything it would be left unchanged in 2024 however as stated before the timing of the rate hike was moved up beyond the expectations of market participants including myself the reality of fomc members different outlooks the latest two rate hikes during 2023 outlook became the general view of its members but presumptions about the commencement of rate hikes have diverged considerably in other words the number of members who expect an early rate hike by the end of 2022 has increased to seven on the other hand the number of members who expect zero interest rates to continue until 2023 as before has changed to a minority of five the number who support raising interest rates in 2023 is six the members assumptions about when to start raising interest rates have expanded significantly considered to be dovish chair jerome powell s shift to the assumption of a 2023 rate hike has been subtle but it seems likely that several of the executive members including the vice chair have moved their assumptions for the time of rate hikes to 2023 this time i couldn t predict an advance in the rate hike phase so it was a disappointing result as a fed watcher in the following i would like to include a subsequent explanation of my thoughts on the changes in the fed s judgment first of all regarding the current inflation upturn fed members have expressed the opinion that it is temporary and i emphasized this point even if the current inflation rate rises the average inflation target framework proactively allows room for inflation to rise for this reason i thought that the inflation rate rise would not influence the mainstream judgment on the timing of rate rises much in practice however the significant rise in inflation has increased uncertainty about future inflation expectations in the financial markets there is a great variety of discussion over what degree of inflation is a sustainable phenomenon and it seems that the discussions are also active among the fomc members as a result it is expected that several executive members who always have the right to vote have moved up their estimates for the start of 2023 interest rate rises since the members outlook for the 2022 2023 inflation and unemployment rates still have not changed significantly this time the policy for initiating future interest rate changes may be mainly a change in risk management while interpreting the current inflation pace as temporary the rise in inflation up to now has influenced the fomc members judgment on interest rate rise timing what sort of meaning does this hold first regardless of the average inflation target framework that the fed is advocating it appears that the members differ in their interpretations and applications and it is presumed that the degree of tolerance for inflation rise held by some members is not large for example if a line is drawn for a 2 increase in the core inflation gauge preferred by the fed the personal consumption expenditures price index from the beginning of 2019 the 2020 price level downturn will have already returned to the 2 line due to the significant increases until april 2021 if the making up for price downturns strategy were set to about 2 3 years then the making up for the covid 19 disaster price level downturn has come to an end if that is the case then rather than thoroughly strengthening monetary easing the thinking will change to assertively preventing an increase in inflation why did hawkish inflationary tolerance weaken on the one hand the fed has adopted an average inflation target to constantly boost inflation expectations which had been declining for many years to 2 by actively allowing short term inflation to rise above 2 and then at the same time as introducing an average inflation target employment maximization once again was raised as a priority target however it can be deduced that many members mainly hawks have weakened their stance on inflation upturns due to the recent price increases on friday the day after the fomc meeting the american stock markets fell sharply in response to remarks from the president of the st louis federal reserve bank james bullard who is now quite hawkish in the bond market long term government bond interest rates declined and the yield curve flattened significantly as a result of economic slowdown and lower inflation rate expectations bullard and other hawkish members who are anticipating rate hikes beginning in 2022 may insist that tapering decreasing asset purchases start early and move smoothly to rate hikes in 2022 if the hawkish scenario which is gaining adherents among fomc members materializes the premise of thorough monetary easing by the fed will change which will be a big transition for the stock market after june 22 powell and others once again reiterated that the timing of the rate hikes was far distant the american stock markets rebounded sharply with the s p 500 hitting a new high on june 24 and long term interest rates which had fallen sharply at one point also stopping their decline the financial markets may have simply recognized that there is a difference between the hawkish scenarios and the fomc mainstream view still taking this fomc meeting as a start the stock markets suspicions about the fed s stance which is expected to begin tapering discussions in the summer with the fomc will not easily be dispelled we should not be overly optimistic about the american stock markets which have repeatedly hit all time highs why is the fed s early rate hike unlikely nevertheless i see the fed s early rate hike implementation as unlikely for one thing the mainstream fomc members expect to start raising rates from 2023 onward in a situation where employment recovery is gradual and there is a corresponding length of time before full employment it is unlikely that the start of tapering will be hastened as current hawkish members insist second the fomc members assumptions of satisfactory economic growth through 2022 to 2023 and favorable unemployment rate declines may not be realized specifically fomc members expect the unemployment rate to improve to around 3 5 in 2023 but such full employment would justify the start of rate hikes in 2023 however in reality after mid 2022 i anticipate we will see a dampening of the effectiveness of boosting economic growth by means of fiscal policy a deceleration of economic growth and that the declines in the unemployment rate expected by the fomc members will not be achieved in short overheating of the american economy and subsequent sustained inflation rises justifying advancement of a rate hike in 2022 by the hawkish members whom the stock markets have begun to fear will not materialize at any rate i expect that the fed will commence rate hikes in the latter half of 2023 as the assumptions of the hawkish members who had shaken up the stock markets fall back into line

several countries around asia and the pacific that are experiencing their first major surges of the coronavirus rushed to impose tough restrictions a year and a half into a pandemic that many initially weathered well faced with rapidly rising numbers of infections in recent months authorities in such countries as thailand south korea and vietnam announced or imposed measures friday that they hope can slow the spread before health care systems are overwhelmed it s a rhythm familiar in much of the world where repeated surges deluged hospitals and led to high numbers of deaths but many asian countries avoided that cycle by imposing stiff travel restrictions combined with tough measures at home now some are seeing record numbers of new cases and even deaths blamed in part on the highly contagious delta variant combined with low rates of vaccination and decisions to ease restrictions that have hit economies hard though overall numbers are nowhere yet near those seen during outbreaks in hotspots in europe and the united states the rapid rise set off alarm bells just as many western countries with high vaccine rates began to breathe a sigh of relief thailand reported a record number of new deaths on thursday with 75 and they came in at 72 on friday south korea set a record for number of new cases on thursday only to break it on friday with 1 316 infections according to the korea disease control and prevention agency for the first time indonesia is seeing a surge that has hospitals turning patients away and oxygen supplies running out of thailand s 317 506 confirmed cases and 2 534 deaths since the pandemic started more than 90 have come since the start of april prime minister prayuth chan ocha s handling of the surge has been widely criticized including the decision to allow people to travel for april s songkran festival celebrating thailand s new year thailand already has strict regulations on wearing masks and other rules to prevent the spread of covid 19 but the government announced even more stringent measures friday for bangkok and the surrounding area including closing spas limiting the hours of public transit and restricting the opening times of markets and convenience stores there is something wrong with the government policies our vaccinations are too slow and we should get better vaccines said resident cherkarn rachasevet a 60 year old it analyst who hustled to the grocery store to stock up on supplies after hearing new restrictions were coming wearing four masks and a face shield she lamented that she isn t due for her first shot until the end of the month across the asia pacific region immunization rates have lagged for a variety of reasons including production and distribution issues as well as an initial wait and see attitude from many early on when numbers were low and there was less of a sense of urgency in south korea widely praised for its initial response to the pandemic that included extensive testing and contact tracing critics are now blaming a current spike in cases on the government s push to ease social distancing because of economic concerns meanwhile a shortage in vaccine supplies has left 70 of the population still waiting for their first shot the recent death toll has been low however and authorities attribute that to the fact that many who have been vaccinated were at risk older koreans amid a spike in infections in the seoul area authorities announced friday that starting next week they would impose the strongest restrictions yet those include prohibiting private social gatherings of three or more people after 6 p m shutting down nightclubs and churches banning visitors at hospitals and nursing homes and limiting weddings and funerals to family only gatherings no country has been worse hit in the region recently than indonesia the seven day rolling averages of daily cases and deaths both more than doubled over the past two weeks health experts say a partial lockdown imposed july 3 was too little too late and warned the current wave which is mostly on the islands of java bali and a few cities on the island of sumatra will soon start to spread across the vast archipelago and the health system is already buckling under the pressure despite a strict national lockdown in nearby malaysia under which residents are confined to their homes with only one person per household allowed out to purchase groceries new cases since it began june 1 continued to shoot up and a record 9 180 daily cases were reported friday the total death toll more than doubled to 5 903 since june 1 it s the second national lockdown over the past year and the government said it will stay in place until daily infections fall below 4 000 and at least 10 of the population is vaccinated but it comes at a tremendous cost deepening economic hardships with scores of businesses forced to shutter and thousands losing their jobs vietnam also imposed tighter restrictions on friday locking down ho chi minh city the country s largest metropolis and its economic and financial hub for two weeks the southern city s 9 million residents are only permitted to leave home to buy food medicine and for other urgent matters during that time vietnam was able to limit its total coronavirus cases to 2 800 during the first year of the pandemic and reported almost no new cases in the three months up to the end of april when they began to climb rapidly in the last two months the country has recorded some 22 000 new cases and the less stringent restrictions imposed so far have been unable to stem the rise it is a difficult decision to lock down the city but it is necessary to curb the pandemic and get back to normalcy prime minister pham minh chinh said during a government meeting thursday evening currently about 4 of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine though the health ministry said it hopes to inoculate 70 of the country s 96 million people by the end of the year one exception to the regional rule appears to be india where the delta variant was first detected perhaps because its surge came first the country has slowly emerged from a traumatic april and may when a devastating spike in infections tore through the nation hospitals ran out of beds and oxygen supplies and overwhelmed crematoria were forced to burn bodies in pyres outdoors new cases and deaths are now decreasing but with less than 5 of the country s eligible population fully vaccinated authorities are scrambling to distribute more shots and are investing heavily in field hospitals and icu beds and stockpiling oxygen supplies japan and australia also announced new restrictions this week japan is particularly being watched since its state of emergency means spectators will be banned at most venues a the upcoming olympics with the detection of the delta variant last month in australia s new south wales state premier gladys berejiklian said friday that this is now the scariest period of the pandemic yet as she announced new restrictions in sydney after the city reported 44 new cases in line with the country s approach to move quickly with targeted measures to stamp out new outbreaks new south wales is facing the biggest challenge we have faced since the pandemic started she said and i don t say that lightly

chaotic but cool leah weller tells julia llewellyn smith what it s like being part of paul weller s extended clan and how he changed her life with a heart shaped guitar leah weller dad can be blunt with me he wasn t afraid to give constructive criticism but he did it nicely leah weller laughs as she describes family gatherings with her seven siblings aged between 33 and three and all children of the jam and style council legend paul weller it s hard to get us all together but when we do it s just chaotic she says we tried to go to a restaurant once and i thought please i m nothing to do with these kids running around and things being smashed did paul 63 the modfather icon of cool keep calm during his offspring s outbursts erm says leah 29 making a face that indicates not i don t think you can ever be that relaxed in those circumstances and he can t ever stop working he s got eight mouths to feed when he can be he s a very hands on dad although a lot of people might assume he wouldn t be but he s getting old so i just don t know how much more running around he can do she continues jokingly leah is the daughter of paul and ex wham and style council singer dee c lee she was three when they divorced mum and dad always kept it civil in front of us and dad was in our lives a lot we d spend pretty much every other weekend with him and when he wasn t touring he d pick us up from school any time he could be there he was she and her elder brother natt also spent a lot of time with paul s parents in his home town of woking berkshire so we had the structure of a two parent home with them for her 12th birthday paul gave leah a heart shaped guitar i begged him for it as i wanted to learn both my parents have always been really supportive but they ve never pushed us in any direction although leah liked playing and singing privately she was too shy to sing in front of people i didn t know so turned to modelling after she was spotted by an agent in a nightclub when she was 15 i shouldn t have been there it was illegal she d never considered a career in the industry but thought let s see what happens which led to a really crazy experience although she modelled for brands such as vivienne westwood tag heuer and boucheron leah was struggling behind the scenes with panic disorder and depression i missed out on a lot of opportunities because of it and i couldn t open up about it at the time she says now some days i didn t see the point in living any more i was so embarrassed and frustrated i became a victim a shadow of my former self she wrote on her instagram when she finally told the world what she d been suffering she tried numerous therapies realising i might not be able to fix it instead i can accept that it s there and learn to manage it better leah and dad paul 2013 as a young woman suffering from such potentially debilitating conditions modelling was not the most supportive or nurturing of industries like many leah became plagued with insecurities you start seeing flaws you didn t think you had before i was told a few times you need to keep your weight down and you wonder why did they photoshop my nose to make it smaller or my skin to be lighter or my legs to be skinnier then you start thinking maybe i need to be skinnier i definitely went through a phase where i tried to stop eating it gives you a very warped sense of what you should look like as if that wasn t enough although she herself never experienced sleazy advances from predatory men leah acknowledges such incidents were prevalent i know a lot of people who did she was also upset by the lack of diversity in the fashion industry as a mixed race woman i d have a lot of stress with things like no one knowing how to do my hair which is naturally an afro i d get it straightened and then they d go and purposefully make it curly again i would think oh my god you re ruining it it was these pressures that in the end led her to quit modelling i just couldn t continue being unhealthy like that it s only in the past couple of years that i m happy with how i look but when you re younger it can be really dangerous being constantly criticised so with the encouragement of her father leah picked her heart shaped six string back up it was a nerve racking moment when she first played her music to paul when he listens to something he listens as an artist rather than as a dad which i appreciate because obviously i want an honest opinion but he can be quite blunt he wasn t afraid to give constructive criticism though he did it nicely throughout all this she was supported by her husband tomo kurata 31 a japanese model the pair met as teenagers when he was at an international school in london where his family had relocated for work it was really nice because if you have famous parents you re always worried is this person with me because they think there s something in it for them is this genuine but with him i didn t have to worry about that because he didn t know or care who my parents were three years ago they married at goodwood house in sussex paul dee and natt all gave speeches but her proud dad didn t perform instead he spun his daughter around the dancefloor it was a very emotional day leah says life now at leah and tomo s west london home which they share with their chihuahua sounds pretty staid i started going out very young at 14 so i feel like i got it all out of my system then i m such a homebody i like just going for a walk around the park leah quit drinking when she was about 21 partly because she didn t like the adult behaviour she witnessed seeing people in altered states shall we say means there s nothing left for me to rebel against mum and i joke about it all the time that i m like saffy in absolutely fabulous and she s edina my parents are rock stars you see them doing their thing and you re like well i don t want to be like that after admitting he was an alcoholic paul quit boozing eight years ago that was amazing and now he goes to the gym and he s looking good but all of us including his wife say you just need to stop smoking now otherwise you re not going to be ok leah weller s first child with husband tomo is due in september soon there s going to be another addition to the weller clan as leah s first child a boy is due in september he will be her parents first grandchild it s a big deal for them they re really excited leah beams as if that wasn t enough september s also the month when leah turns 30 half of me wants to say i feel great about it but half of me thinks wow i m an adult now and i don t know how i feel about that and releases her new single something sacred next year she s planning to release an album and is hoping she and paul will tour together sharing a career in music though is where leah and her father s similarities end when i finish our interview by asking if she d like to match the modfather s eight children she has no hesitation in replying definitely not leah s new single something sacred will be out next month instagram lunachildxox the modfather s greatest hits numbers 1 2 natt 33 and leah 29 mum dee c lee leah and elder brother natt

commerce department says 14 firms have enabled beijing s campaign of repression against uyghurs the u s commerce department on friday added 14 chinese companies to its entity list for direct involvement in human rights abuses in china s xinjiang uyghur autonomous region xuar saying they have enabled beijing s campaign of repression mass detention and high technology surveillance against uyghurs kazakhs and members of other muslim minority groups the action restricts the export reexport or in country transfer of commodities software and technology subject to u s export regulations in cases in which the entities are a party to the transactions the department of commerce remains firmly committed to taking strong decisive action to target entities that are enabling human rights abuses in xinjiang or that use u s technology to fuel china s destabilizing military modernization efforts said secretary of commerce gina raimondo in a statement rushan abbas founder and executive director of the nonprofit campaign for uyghurs welcomed the move by the biden administration to blacklist more chinese companies we welcome the u s government s sanctions on 14 companies involved in the genocide of the uyghurs she told rfa we hope that such measures will be taken by the european union and other governments in the future and call on the international community to be aware of the trade relations that are enabled by the enormous plight of uyghurs in east turkestan abbas said using the uyghur name for the xuar the commerce department previously blacklisted dozens of chinese government or commercial entities that it said were connected to human rights abuses against uyghurs and other muslim minorities in the xuar when asked about the addition of chinese companies to the u s entity list at a press conference in beijing on friday china s foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin said the government opposed the measure calling the list a tool for suppressing specific companies and industries in china under the pretext of human rights and a means for the u s to destabilize xinjiang and contain china china will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of chinese companies and foil u s attempts to interfere in china s internal affairs he said the u s government in january designated abuses in the xuar as part of a campaign of genocide and in response has ramped up punishments against china including targeting chinese firms that manufacture solar panel material wigs electronics tomatoes and cotton with suspected forced uyghur labor a good step rayhan asat international human rights lawyer and nonresident senior fellow at atlantic council said the latest sanctions will prevent americans and u s listed companies from contributing to genocide and from implicating unwitting consumers in crimes against humanity entities aiding and abetting genocide and crimes against humanity cannot continue to benefit from the u s financial market she said the u s has laws and regulations which businesses must follow these standards exist to protect human rights and must be applied without exception william nee research and advocacy coordinator at chinese human rights defenders called the move by the u s a good step given the unprecedented human rights abuses occurring in the uyghur region it s highly appropriate for governments to take action including sanctioning companies that participate in and even facilitate such abuse he told rfa from that point of view this is a good step but nee said that washington s actions would probably have received greater buy in from the international community if officials provided detailed and specific evidence of the abuses and tied it to the u n s guiding principles on business and human rights the normative framework for assessing business and human rights compliance the framework requires that businesses conduct human rights due diligence to show how they identify prevent mitigate and account for human rights impacts so if the u s government s criticism and ultimately sanctions were tied to this process it would be more beneficial in producing a multiplying effect especially since many european jurisdictions are developing human rights due diligence laws nee said chinese authorities have conducted a campaign of mass incarceration in the xuar since 2017 during which an estimated 1 8 million uyghurs and other muslim minorities have been locked up in a vast network of internment camps beijing has denied all allegations of abuse of the uyghurs saying that the facilities are vocational training centers set up to prevent religious radicalization and protect the country from terrorism but reports by rfa other media outlets rights groups and independent researchers indicate that the detainees are being held against their will and are subjected to political indoctrination and maltreatment eu parliament s resolution the addition of new chinese companies to the u s entity list came a day after the european parliament passed a nonbinding resolution on thursday calling on the eu to boycott the beijing 2022 winter olympics unless china improves the human rights situations in hong kong tibet inner mongolia and the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region xuar home to predominantly muslim uyghur minority the 28 point resolution mainly condemned china s recent actions in hong kong and the erosion of freedoms there including the forced closure last week of the pro democracy newspaper apple daily the arrests of journalists the silencing of pro democracy activists and the rapid deterioration of the human rights situation the resolution also noted the importance of the eu continuing to raise the issue of human rights violations in china in particular the case of minorities in xinjiang and tibet at every political and human rights dialogue with chinese authorities and in line with the eu s commitment to project a strong clear and unified voice in its approach to china the resolution repeated a call for the eu and its member states to work towards the holding of a special session or urgent debate on china at the u n human rights council and the launching of an independent un investigation on china the resolution passed with 578 votes in favor 29 against and 73 abstentions when asked about the move at the

as the credit market heats back up due to the growing consumer demand amid the reopening america s third largest bank wells fargo unexpectedly announced this week that it will permanently shut down all of its existing lines of credit a very popular product provided by the retail focused wall street giant and the move is already infuriating a legion of customers the revolving credit lines that are about to be discontinued in the coming weeks typically allowed customers to borrow from 3k to 100k when they were launched in the first place the bank s goal was to offer users a way to consolidate higher interest credit card debt pay for home renovations or avoid overdraft fees on checking accounts attached to the loan in a statement released on thursday the bank said the decision came as an effort to simplify their product offerings so they chose to no longer offer personal lines of credit as the bank feels it can better meet the borrowing needs of their customers through credit card and personal loan products another major disruption caused by the sudden shutdowns is that many customers will be left without what may be considered as a critical source of liquidity even though the bank didn t reveal how many customers used the credit lines it is eliminating recent data showed that wells fargo had had 24 9 billion in loans in a category called other consumer as of march and that category was 26 lower this year than during the same period last year many of the users of the credit lines that are shuttering will actually be the ones penalized by the bank s decision according to the cnbc report it will get much harder for the customers whose credit lines will be involuntarily closed to receive credit from a new source because their fico scores will be penalized as if they had elected to close the credit line willingly economists have been advising users to stop making withdrawals and turn their attention to repayment to avoid disruptions in their credit scores according to one cnbc analyst once the account is closed and you can no longer draw from it your annual percentage rate will be frozen and that s the rate you ll pay on the remaining balance in essence the move is wells fargo s latest in a series of lending products closures in 2020 the bank announced it would no longer provide home equity lines of credit for its customers and that it would stop giving auto loans to most independent car dealerships back then financial analysts argued that happened because the bank was having a hard time making enough money to keep these areas going since the federal reserve placed penalties and growth limits on its business the last time wells restricted consumer credit was because of the mounting uncertainty about the remaining purchasing power of the american consumer amid what was the worst economic recession facing the united states since the great depression of the 1930s but that uncertainty pretty much vanished ever since trillions of dollars in federal stimulus money were pumped into the financial markets and fueled several asset bubbles and an unprecedented boom in both stock and housing markets that s why the timing of this latest decision is sparking so much curiosity amongst financial experts it seems that the bank is engaging in some prudent risk management as it could already realize that the u s economy is on the edge of an inflationary collapse that will likely force the fed to hike interest rates much sooner than expected as wells fargo tries to restructure its operations and takes cautionary measures to prevent future losses the bank s move says more about our overheating economy and a bleak outlook for the reopening than many can realize those who have previously seen warning signs indicating that a catastrophic financial crisis was approaching already know that they have to run for the exits before the whole system starts melting down while triggering huge losses and acute financial imbalances one thing is certain when big banks suddenly start to close down their credit lines is because they can see that trouble is ahead we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us

house minority leader kevin mccarthy who trekked to mar a lago to make peace with former president donald trump after the jan 6 riot at the capitol is coming to new jersey to headline state sen thomas h kean jr s fundraiser next week the fundraiser which will kick off kean s 2022 campaign for congress will charge guests from 125 for general admission to 5 800 for founding members according to two republicans invited to the event the location was not disclosed in the invitation kean the state senate minority leader is making his second try for the 7th congressional district against incumbent rep tom malinowski d ringoes kean narrowly lost to malinowski last year by 5 300 votes just 1 of the total ballots cast mccarthy of california presides over a caucus that largely remains in defiant lockstep with trump and has helped fuel trump s big lie that president joe biden s 2020 election was stolen in a vast conspiracy of fraud two thirds of house republicans voted against certifying biden s win and house republicans later rejected forming a commission to form a 9 11 style commission to investigate the trump incited riot at the u s capital on jan 6 a commission that was to be modeled on a panel that kean s father former new jersey gov thomas h kean co chaired with distinction while mccarthy s own relationship with trump has been at times contentious mccarthy initially blamed trump for the riot and got into an expletive laden shouting match with trump as the riot unfolded he is now the face of a pro trump resistance in congress mccarthy was also instrumental in ousting wyoming rep liz cheney a fierce trump critic from her leadership post the fundraiser was first reported by new jersey globe a political website kean s decision baffled some veteran new jersey republicans who feared that mccarthy s pro trump toxicity will tarnish kean s brand of inclusivity and claims of independence more movers and shakers afl cio s bipartisan tradition frays in chase for endorsements one longtime gop official said the decision to invite mccarthy amounted to a reality in which the leading inclusive family in new jersey is supporting the guy who is a defender of trump and stop the steal mccarthy s appearance is also likely to arm the democratic party s attack machine which will surely portray kean if elected as a rubber stamp for mccarthy the ads could be potent in a swing district that biden carried by almost 10 points last year the fact that tom kean jr chose to invite kevin mccarthy to his campaign kickoff event after mccarthy did more than anyone in washington to promote the trump agenda and refused to hold the radicals who invaded the capitol accountable should tell voters everything they need to know about where kean jr stands said phil swibinski spokesman for the state democratic party but kean supporters dismissed the criticism and suggestions that the event would harm his brand for one thing as the party supported trump s refusal to accept the election result kean conceded his close race to malinowski without seeking a recount he also issued a joint statement with democratic majority leader loretta weinberg on jan 6 demanding the rioters call off their assault on the u s capitol nj primary election 2021 5 takeaways from the results and what it means for november and even if kean publicly disavowed any support for mccarthy democrats will still cast kean as an all but certain mccarthy foot soldier if elected so given that likelihood it only makes sense for kean to accept mccarthy s support and the national party s backing and donors who will follow his lead kean supporters reasoned new jersey residents need tom kean s strong decisive and independent leadership in washington not another morally bankrupt self serving politician like tom malinowski said tom szymanski executive director of the new jersey republican state committee szymanksi slammed malinowski over reports that he profited from stock trades in companies that were involved in the national covid 19 response and failed to disclose the earnings mccarthy s support for tom kean signifies one simple fact congressman tom malinowski is in deep trouble szymanksi said yet the mccarthy visit also illustrates the conundrum kean will face the same conundrum facing jack ciattarelli the republican nominee for governor this year republican candidates need to excite their base voters but embracing the base also runs the risk of alienating disillusioned democrats and independent or unaffiliated voters a shrinking bloc in the electorate that challenge has been complicated by trump s refusal to recede from the spotlight statewide there are 2 391 034 unaffiliated voters or 47 000 more than registered at this time four years ago unaffiliateds are sometimes referred to as independents since they haven t registered with either major party they now represent only 36 5 of the electorate down from 41 in 2017 the year of the last governor s race in new jersey the unaffiliated loss has been mostly the democratic party s gain democrats in new jersey now count more than 1 million registered voters than the republicans unaffiliateds have also declined from 41 to a 38 share of the 7th congressional district although it remains the district s largest bloc of registered voters meanwhile democratic registration climbed in the 7th which represents hunterdon county and parts of essex morris somerset union and warren counties from 28 in 2017 to 32 democrats added 43 000 new voters to their rolls in comparison republicans gained 15 500 new voters over the past four years yet the party s share of the total 7th district pie remained the same at 30 the unaffiliateds haven t been in the republican fold for a long time said micah rasmussen director of the rebovich institute of politics at rider university kean has a history of avoiding radioactive national figures kean took the unnecessarily long route from trenton to a 2006 fundraiser in newark for his u s senate campaign headlined by the unpopular vice president dick cheney taking route 1 instead of the new jersey turnpike made kean conveniently late for the event cheney was gone by the time he

on tuesday one small village tied with death valley for the highest temperature recorded that day in north america 49º c only to be incinerated by a fast moving wildfire days later summer in the northern hemisphere may officially only be two weeks old but since the start of june texas has seen a scorcher that threatened the state s electric grid heatwaves have roiled the middle east and central asia with temperatures topping 52º c and ground temperatures in siberia have reached 48º c melting chunks of permafrost containing tons of pent up planet warming methane every new high is a harsh reminder that the climate crisis is upon us there is no subtlety left to climate change it is merely wreaking the havoc we were all amply warned of the bad weather is here to stay on friday an underwater gas pipeline ruptured in the gulf of mexico setting the ocean on fire living in new orleans i typically pay close attention to this particular body of water for several months out of every year regardless of whether or not it s engulfed in flames last october at the tail end of the busiest atlantic hurricane season on record i followed news of a tropical storm forming in the gulf graphics released by the national hurricane center show the projected path of a storm several days out from landfall an x marking the storm s current location with two lines fanning out from each side and growing further apart the closer they get to solid ground the lines meet again at the end of a storm s track and the interior of this bulbous shape is filled in with a shade of semitransparent white creating an abstract speech bubble emanating from the depths of the gulf inside of this bubble is what meteorologists call the cone of uncertainty if you added up all the days louisiana spent within this cone last summer it would amount to about a month concerns were raised about the 2020 hurricane season even before it officially began as above average air and water temperatures in the gulf signaled an elevated chance of supercharged storms when hurricane laura struck the southwest coast of louisiana late last august it carried with it 241 km per hour winds and a storm surge of roughly ten feet it was the strongest hurricane to hit louisiana since 1856 causing around 17 5 billion in damages and killing thirty three six weeks later the same area was hit by yet another powerful hurricane that dumped fifteen inches of rain onto the storm ravaged city of lake charles recently climate researchers looked at over ninety peer reviewed scientific articles on tropical cyclones and concluded that anthropogenic global warming was to no one s surprise making storms more powerful meanwhile louisiana continues to heat up with cities throughout the state experiencing up to an extra month of extreme heat when compared to fifty years ago as i began writing this the new orleans area was under an excessive heat warning with a possibility of feels like temperatures nearing 43º c i posted up in front of an air conditioner a window unit set to 28º c i d describe it as comfortable but what does that even mean much of eric dean wilson s new far reaching study of air conditioning after cooling on freon global warming and the terrible cost of comfort deals directly with this question while it may not be a surprise to learn that euro american standards of comfort have been largely dictated by rich and sweaty white men how exactly this standard was set makes for a fascinating narrative of technological innovation and environmental destruction air conditioning is a relatively new phenomenon like other corollaries of american progress snapshot photography and nuclear weapons mobile phones and machine guns mechanical cooling has reshaped the world both materially and culturally while one of the earliest air conditioners dates to the 1850s wilson argues that america s obsession with climate control what we ve come to call comfort didn t take hold until much later as wilson explains one of the earliest air conditioning systems was not even built for human comfort when the new york stock exchange was redesigned at the start of the twentieth century the building commission worried about the internal temperature of the building beams of sun shooting through large glass windows would make the trading floor hellish during the hot summer months the traders would be miserable but of greater concern was that trade would be compromised as a result to avoid that an engineer installed a vast system of ducts to send mechanically cooled air through vents in the trading floor stabilizing the temperature for the sake of keeping stock trades moving around the same time manufacturing began to utilize air conditioning to maximize profit cooling places down or heating them up depending on the needs of particular products for a material like cotton which required high humidity conditions for workers could be excruciating for products like camera film reliant on cool dry air workers labored in a more agreeable atmosphere while air conditioning became normalized in industry and education by the 1920s wilson notes that the idea of air conditioning for public and private comfort remained absurd even for the wealthy early model air conditioners tended to be clumsy and dangerous using toxic natural refrigerants like ammonia that could corrode copper piping and leak thereby infusing a space with the smell of urine and potentially killing anyone who remained inside for comfort cooling to achieve mainstream acceptance safer more efficient systems needed to be created enter chlorofluorocarbons cfcs the synthetic refrigerant better known as freon which facilitated the widespread adoption of mechanical cooling and massively fucked up the planet in the process also read in defence of air conditioning but when thomas midgley jr introduced the world to freon in 1930 the eccentric engineer was determined to demonstrate the chemical s safety unlike other industrial refrigerants freon was a stable chemical compound odorless noncorrosive nonflammable and nontoxic it also had a spectacularly low boiling point making it ideal for refrigeration and air conditioning on a conference stage in front of some of the nation s top chemists midgley boiled the supercooled liquid in a glass pail then inhaled its vapors an act likened by wilson to a giant bong rip midgley then exhaled the refrigerant gas into a separate glass pail containing a lit candle the flame was extinguished applause ensued before developing freon midgely was pivotal in the 1921 creation of another harmful concoction leaded gasoline an invention that enabled the smooth functioning of internal combustion engines and poisoned countless people even in the earliest days of leaded gas hundreds of workers involved in its manufacturing suffered from lead exposure causing them to hallucinate and develop permanent brain damage several workers were fatally poisoned including one man who reportedly died in a straitjacket violently insane despite its dangers lead was distributed throughout the environment by gas powered automobiles for decades until its ban in 1996 exposing millions to a well known toxin wilson seeks to handle midgley s story with nuance taking into consideration that the inventor who died in 1944 long before the banning of chlorofluorocarbon and leaded gasoline likely passed away thinking he had materially improved the world he believed his work would open the door for the complete eradication of viral pandemics the elimination of food spoilage and increased comfort and health for some for some time in an artificially cooler world writes wilson and in fact it did though it s now difficult to see his inventions beyond their environmental impact while wilson might be understating this difficulty the pages that follow clearly illustrate harm after cooling concisely charts how midgley s chemical progeny helped secure a victory for the allied forces during world war ii as air conditioning allowed for the streamlined round the clock production of warships bullets and bombs extend the limitations of time and space by homogenizing the air after the war air conditioning helped enable the suburbanization of less temperate regions like the sunbelt the single family home became increasingly sealed off and separate from the outside world laying the foundation for an insular form of architecture and a new concept of domestic comfort air conditioning was born of a certain american belief in the nation s invincibility its power to master the wildest aspect of the earth the weather writes wilson in 1955 about 2 percent of u s residents had air conditioning by 1980 it could be found in more than half of all u s homes climate control spread to vehicles too first as an option and then as a standard feature all of this was of course fueled by freon some forty years after its invention freon was everywhere along with being in air conditioners cars refrigerators and aerosol spray cans it was also in the atmosphere producing a bonafide climate emergency the depletion of the ozone layer aptly described by wilson as quite simply what makes possible all life on earth the story of how scientists detected the danger of cfcs and how the transition away from the ubiquitous chemical has played out is one of after cooling s most complex and riveting narratives it s also where the book begins to closely connect with the present revealing how we may have averted one crisis but steered directly into another in 1987 an international treaty known as the montreal protocol was drafted in order to phase out the use of ozone destroying chemicals throughout the world it s since been signed by 197 countries while there are indications that the ozone layer has healed since scientists first discovered its freon induced damage wilson estimates the final traces of the ozone depleting chemical will not fully disappear from the atmosphere until roughly 3021 while the use of cfcs tapered off the use of air conditioning increased alternative refrigerants namely hydrofluorocarbons hfcs allowed us to continue keeping things cool however hfcs are potent greenhouse gases that heavily contribute to global warming beyond the energy consumption of individual systems the appearance of hfcs as a solution pushed us even further into the climate crisis by encouraging the overall spread of air conditioning a growth that assumed we could increase our consumption of energy without significant cost to the planet wilson writes why this fixation though when considering some of the key contributors to climate change like fossil fuel consumption intensive agriculture and deforestation why focus on air conditioning these questions went through my mind when i first picked up after cooling but i realized early on that wilson was focusing on climate control to discuss how larger cultural forces like western hegemony rampant industrialism and mass consumerism facilitated its spread his writing is thoughtful and informed by an eclectic mix of research including scientific articles environmental reporting american history critical theory television and science fiction it s also occasionally dense particularly when wilson attends to biochemistry and climate policy also read how heat waves can kill in one passage wilson quotes james baldwin any real change implies the breakup of the world as one has always known it the loss of all that gave one an identity the end of safety over half a century later baldwin s words still feel like they re referencing a moment that has yet to arrive wilson posits that at the time of baldwin s writing white middle class prosperity was weakening the resolve of americans making the comfortable less likely to risk creating short term personal instability for the possibility of a better world comfort became something that could be purchased by an individual rather than attained by a collective what s more america exported this standard of comfort to the rest of the world the consequences have been catastrophic in china sales of air conditioners have grown fivefold since 2000 as have carbon dioxide emissions for wilson whether an individual uses an air conditioner is not the problem rather it s the mechanisms in place that allow us to do so without giving it much thought the point is not to eradicate comfort he writes but to overthrow our definition of it to question our threshold of discomfort and to confront the fact that our comfort is contingent on the discomfort of others of all the world s weather phenomena extreme heat poses the greatest risk a 2015 heat wave in pakistan where few have air conditioning killed over one thousand people last week jacobabad in pakistan s sindh province became the hottest city on earth when temperatures hit 52º c hotter than the human body can handle as the world warms faster than scientists grimmest predictions air conditioning will become increasingly essential to the preservation of human life even as it continues to heat up the planet putting the most vulnerable among us in even greater peril whether a more sustainable form or definition of comfort is possible remains to be seen when the storm i was monitoring back in october started getting closer i began to worry it ended up making landfall in southeast louisiana as hurricane zeta a category 3 top winds were 185 km per hour it was the latest in the season a major storm had ever made landfall in the continental united states zeta barreled straight toward new orleans and i watched its arrival from my front door perhaps this is one way the world gets broken up the storm clouds cleared as the eye of the storm passed over the city it happened just as the sun was setting a weird and beautiful moment of calm not before the storm but in between it then the sky darkened again the wind picked back up and out went the power this article was originally published by the baffler and has been republished here with permission
