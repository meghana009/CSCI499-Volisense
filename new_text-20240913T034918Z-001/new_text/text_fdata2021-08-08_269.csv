zuckerberg is a very dangerous adolescent who has clearly not grown up personally i would never own a single share of facebook when its management is just so questionable us congressman thomas massie has come out stating in a series of tweets to say that facebook s independent fact checkers are removing what they call vaccine misinformation these people are funded by johnson johnson manufacturers of one of the vaccines massie said who pays the paycheques of the fact checkers the vaccine fact checkers at factcheck org who claim to be independent are funded by an organisation that holds over 1 8 billion of stocks in a vaccine company and is run by a former director of the cdc fact checkers responded claiming that as you know we disclose our funding sources here www factcheck org they cleverly used legal jargon to deny the allegation but admitted that they are indeed funded by johnson johnson s parent organization they said the views expressed by factcheck org do not necessarily reflect the views of the foundation the fact is that factcheck org is funded by the robert wood johnson foundation whose current ceo is richard besser who just so happens to be the former head of the cdc the foundation holds almost 2 billion in shares for johnson johnson one of the very pharmaceutical companies manufacturing covid vaccines this is outright consumer fraud that anyone else would be thrown in prison for doing zuckerberg is beyond walking on water he can float in the air above it i believe the deep state worked against trump at every stage of the election to ensure he would not just lose the election but he would never exercise power therefore he should not have had to go after bigtech and even the un american propaganda machine cnn which has done more to undermine the united states than anyone as its broadcasts are watched around the world now the epoch times reports that facebook is covertly working with the cdc thanks to the freedom of information act the cdc was forced to release documents that shocked many and prove that facebook s claims to censor people pretending they are not the government is a lie they have lost all immunity and can now be outright sued for violating everyone s civil rights has zuckerberg proven that he is not really qualified to run a company of this size the rise in the share value had nothing to do with his management skills but the pending decline has everything to do with his unqualified decision making he may think he is a demigod and all powerful but sometimes the bigger they are the harder they fall facebook may not exist after 2035

empowered by data these platforms offer innovative solutions to digitalising traditional sectors but they also enjoy higher pricing and bargaining power hampering market competition innovation and consumer interests in april alibaba took a hefty penalty from chinese regulators according to regulators the company controlled more than half of china s online retail between 2015 and 2019 since 2015 alibaba has required merchants to choose between its platform and competitors using data and algorithms to implement this pick one from two strategy a violation of chinese anti trust law alibaba was also accused of other data related monopolistic behaviour its data driven solutions such as tailored search results for customers make it difficult for merchants to switch platforms without losing their customer base transaction records and review histories national security is also a concern when examining company behaviour in cross border exchanges of data the probe into didi global was grounded in china s national security and cybersecurity laws under which ipo related cross border activities require critical infrastructure operators to first seek evaluation from ad hoc chinese regulators to pre empt national security risks millions of users advertisement two more companies came under scrutiny on the same grounds both control the personal data of millions of chinese users and were recently listed on the us sharemarket one of the companies manages large amounts of data on user identification and contact information flow of vehicles and people and china s transportation infrastructure chinese regulators made revisions to the cybersecurity review measures days after investigations into didi these made it compulsory for operators handling the data of more than 1 million users to register with the cyberspace regulator for safety related reviews before listing overseas the cyber security examination will be undertaken by 14 chinese regulators and the securities regulator is the latest addition to this mechanism the revisions referred to the data security law which will come into effect next month when it comes to national security countries often decide that it is better safe than sorry the revisions are a typical case of policymaking lagging behind developments in industry advertisement but when it comes to national security countries often decide that it is better safe than sorry as evidenced by the escalating screening of foreign investment in critical infrastructure by the united states japan australia and the european union didi s treatment sent a ripple through the tech industry some tech companies such as meicai chose to delay their planned overseas ipos to adjust to the new compliance requirements venture capitalists may have second thoughts over regulatory risks when investing in chinese tech start ups and see it as a hurdle for cashing in on their initial investments through ipos chinese tech companies may be less favoured after foreign investors were spooked by the consecutive drops of didi s share price some companies may choose to instead list on the hong kong stock exchange some positives despite the chaos there are some positives the regulations restrain tech companies from illegal collection and use of data since may companies have been prohibited from collecting data without consent beyond defined basic personal information advertisement big companies are more careful about monopolistic practices the rival chinese super platforms wechat and alipay are reported to be considering opening their ecosystems to each other and ending some inter platform choice restrictions for users companies have put more effort into data governance and privacy protection the development of technical solutions such as privacy preservation computation is accelerating safer cross border data sharing companies will learn to consult chinese regulators to minimise regulatory risks hopefully the regulators will gain experience in providing a more controlled process for firms to meet compliance needs china s rapid legislation on data sovereignty is partly driven by its competition with the united states though china is the world s largest e commerce market and home to numerous tech unicorns its data legislation is relatively undeveloped compared with places such as europe singapore and australia its soon to come into effect data security law serves both development and safety purposes china s rapid legislation on data sovereignty is partly driven by its competition with the united states since

amendment to the controversial u s infrastructure plan that proposes expanded cryptocurrency taxation to raise an additional 28 billion in revenue the amendment maintains stringent reporting requirements for blockchain developers and validators while exempting miners however the amendment s vague wording and lack of clearly defined terms suggest that crypto developers and proof of stake

covid patients are taken through the emergency department before they are transferred to the covid wards or the covid intensive care units for seriously ill patients the transfer of patients is conducted in an infection prevention control manner ensuring there is no contact with other patients or medical staff only a limited number of health workers transfer these patients there are also different pockets within the different wards where the non covid patients are kept these include the tailevu namosi wards acute medical and acute surgical wards which also has a section for covid patients the number of patients requiring treatment varies averaging between 40 and 80 patients per day at the emergency department for non covid patients with underlying medical conditions they would average between 30 and 40 per day in a particular shift there are eight nurses five doctors and two consultants who attend to covid and non covid patients each teamwork three shifts and get three days off work emergency departments are different we need a large team to respond to mass traumas cardiac arrest resuscitation that s why we have that pool of people ready to respond to those emergencies head of the department dr amit sewak said the ministry of health has done a tremendous amount of work in preparing the place staffing transporting and providing the consumables ed frontliner mr lewenilovo has been given extra responsibilities during this crisis there are now two teams at the department a team stationed inside and another outside in the tents mr lewenilovo oversees the outside tents i have to double check if all my patients have oxygen medications are given temperatures are taken and make sure that all my patients are comfortable in the tent and they enjoy their stay he said for mr lewenilovo his greatest challenges are nursing covid positive patients it s worse when he must deal with deceased positive patients it hurts me a lot to experience that and i feel a lot of compassion for the family because i know they won t be able to farewell their relative properly during this crisis he said mr lewenilovo last saw his son girlfriend and parents when he left vanua levu in february he misses them he longs for the day to finally meet them the misinformation out there does not make things easy for us especially when people post negative comments on social media it s mentally challenging and sometimes it really affects me emotionally often i ve felt like quitting but it remains an honour to serve the people of fiji he said to see his patients recover happily is the best part of his career mitigation phase while things look grim already dr amit and his team are expecting a further surge in covid case numbers over the coming weeks so far our resources and projections have been in response to the situation he said this includes the training by the australian medical assistance team ausmat the ausmat teamwork with our health workers at the fiji emergency medical assistance team femat and ministry of health in creating capacity and rapid vaccination dr amit said their priority was to prevent positive covid 19 patients from getting sicker and ensuring that non covid patients did not contract the virus the 2021 2022 national budget was also positioned to not only cushion the impact of the pandemic but also facilitate the growing crisis the attorney general and minister for economy aiyaz sayed khaiyum announced the allocation of an increased budget of 403 3 million to the health sector the budget included the hiring of 238 intern nurses 140 medical interns 114 doctors 10 nurse practitioners 43 midwives and 25 million covid 19 contingency fund ausmat response two significant issues stood out for ausmat bravo team dr dan holmes first the tireless efforts of the frontline health workers and secondly the amount of preparedness by the ministry to deal with this ongoing outbreak he said it s very clear that the nurses and doctors and all the other staff in various healthcare facilities are working incredibly hard it s tiring in many overseas countries we ve seen how this pandemic has affected healthcare workers disproportionately and in places people have become sick fiji is no different when health workers become sick it puts extra stress on the health system fiji has done a lot of preparedness work in getting ready for this event over the past few months you can already see what s happened with the tent facilities the extra capacity that was set up by the femat team and also outside the cwm hospital dr holmes said ausmat provided personal protective equipment ppe to cater for the shortage in supplies the team is focused on training frontline health workers in dealing with the growing crisis these areas include infection and prevention control training given healthcare staff are one of the ways that diseases are transmitted on hands on equipment it s not only about protecting staff but the patients as well ensuring that frontliners do not transfer the virus from covid to non covid patients covid safe movement within the hospital how the patients have to move from one area of the hospital to another how the ward works how the staff moves in and out and how the staff need to wear the ppe and how to take it off to ensure low risk of cross contamination dr holmes said the hospital and the other healthcare facilities were managing the crisis admirably but we ve seen in high income countries like the united states and the uk that their health systems have buckled under the pressure that this disease causes no health system in the world was built to cater for the number of patients that we ve seen because of this pandemic but for how long can fiji s health sector deal with this invisible threat as we reach 100 days since the start of this current outbreak dr holmes believes the situation has increasingly become serious it will strain the country s health system what we are seeing is now i don t think we have reached the peak of what this covid can do yet and for the next few weeks it will be a challenging time for the health system this is the second ausmat team to visit fiji since the second wave of outbreak they are here until mid august ausmat is a world health organisation verified emergency response team that attends to requests for assistance during a disease outbreak who response moh has been working with the support of who and partners like australia the european union new zealand and the united kingdom to expand current capacity these included setting up remote monitoring systems for patients at home focusing on the highest risk expanding intensive care units and establishing intermediate care sites such as the ones at vodafone arena and the fmf gymnasium this was the response from who technical officer risk communication and community engagement rose aynsley to questions sent by shine a light countries around the world have recognised that this virus would be with us for some time to come the only way to return to the old normal is to fully protect ourselves through vaccination covid 19 is a highly infectious disease and the new delta variant spreads even more easily until enough people around the world are vaccinated this virus will continue taking lives she said ms aynsley said the recent death of 15 year old semaema rabukawaqa was a tragic reminder of how this virus does not discriminate although most cases reported in fiji have occurred in younger age groups people over 50 years of age have been most likely to experience severe disease and death hence their prioritisation for vaccination she said the experience in fiji is in line with global data e g only 0 2 per cent of deaths worldwide have been reported in people under the age of 20 years she reiterates that while younger people are at much less risk of suffering severe covid 19 they must remember that low risk is not zero risk practising covid safe measures is critical during this growing crisis edited by rosi doviverata feedback ivamere nataro fijisun com fj

fits the theme i e italian french the final product may then go through a market research process does it taste good will the guests like it what will it cost to produce some ideas are added to the menu others are discarded concerned with freshness and quality mccabe sources his antelope from the broken arrow ranch in texas the 1 million acre ranch does not put the animals in cages or use

vaccinated i felt very safe there just does not seem to be any reason why mexico had suddenly gone on the red list it is a bit like the decision to stop people travelling to france by making them

edging closer to a deal but senior european commission sources said that britain only formally applied for the app to be recognised across the 27 member bloc on july 28 it should take a few weeks for the process to be completed but i have no crystal ball said one eu official a british government spokesman refused to deny the july 28 date eu certificates are not automatically available to uk nationals due to brexit a deal with the eu executive would legally oblige all 27 eu countries to recognise the nhs covid app with britain accepting the eu s digital covid certificate in return the uk government said there were constructive technical talks between our experts and the eu before the application advertisement the cost of a flight back to britain was being sold for between 2 000 and 4

are planning to help individuals who have found themselves in a situation like this claire 30 from south london said i had access to the wifi so i found out in mid air i just wanted to grab the tannoy and tell everyone because i could see all these families looking forward to their holiday and it was obvious they didn t know it s crazy the lack of notice i had no inkling mexico was about to go on the red list another tweeted landing in mexico to find out it s been added to the red list whilst i was up in the air has got to be one of the worst things i ve ever experienced father of two david hing 40 arrived in mexico with his wife and children aged four and seven on july 31 they were supposed to stay until august 21 five days before the travel list is looked at again mr hing told mailonline we knew the risks and while at the moment it seems like a bad dream and is very stressful and i ve been up all night looking at alternative options we are just going to try to enjoy the holiday it broke my heart when my two little ones said they wanted to stay on holiday and would lend us money if we needed it the notice period doesn t really give long enough to make changes especially when it s hard to get through and talk to anyone at the airlines the slog back home grant shapps said up to 6 000 britons are currently in mexico after ministers warned they would place the country onto its travel red list at 4am on sunday those who have received both doses have unrestricted entry meaning they do not have to quarantine or provide a negative test result when travelling to germany france spain latvia romania and georgia but those who are not double jabbed are still subject to some regulations upon arrival and in the cases of germany and slovakia can be denied entry the price of the only direct flight from mexico city to london before mexico moves to the red list has soared to a staggering 6 878 the images of the food and hotels do not seem like they are worth the cost so that s why we are going to try and fly back somewhere else first i feel sorry for the people who were already on the flight from the uk and hope they can make alternative arrangements a young couple cut short their honeymoon in mexico from two weeks to two days after they discovered the new restrictions upon landing in mexico early on thursday morning joe coward 29 said basically we touched down to find that our two week honeymoon which had already been rearranged several times was going to be a two day visit we ve arranged a flight for tomorrow and will be spending today getting ready to turn right around and go home mexico is in the grip of a third wave of covid and on wednesday another 611 deaths were reported taking the total number of deaths due to the virus to 242 547 another 611 deaths were also reported and the country has recorded a total of 2 901 094 infections and 242 547 deaths the government has said the real number of cases is likely significantly higher and separate data published recently suggested the actual death toll is at least 60 above the confirmed figure seven european countries austria germany latvia norway romania slovenia and slovakia will turn green from sunday 4am india bahrain qatar and the united arab emirates will switch from red to amber meaning arrivals from those countries will no longer have to spend 11 nights at pricey

285 for a single person additional adults and teenagers will be charged 1 430 more than double the current 650 rate the decision to place mexico on the red list also reflects worries about a new variant which originated in colombia and which has concerned british scientists passengers arriving from mexico city at heathrow terminal 5 today slammed the new rules leidy corrales 35 a dental assistant who was travelling back to switzerland from playa de carmen in mexico said i m travelling back to geneva with my two children joshua and carla and my husband putting mexico on the red list is not logical because when you go there everything is normal they are taking all the same protections masks hand sanitisation and social distancing the quarantine costs are just unreasonable i think when people go on holiday they should just have to do two tests and only quarantine if it s positive mexico is a tourist hotspot and people here like going to hot places but the government doesn t want people to go on holiday they want to control them it s like a dictatorship of security in a democracy because they keep changing the rules and no one can afford that her husband denys added we re so happy to have been able to enjoy our holiday without having to pay for a hotel on the way back thank god changing travel rules what you need to know there have been more changes to the rules for international travel with some popular destinations climbing the ladder to the green list and others sliding down on to the red the government has also hiked the price of hotel quarantine meaning a trip to a red list country is a pricey affair here is the state of play for your summer holidays is there any good news seven countries will be added to england s green travel list from 4am on sunday the government announced on wednesday anyone returning from germany austria slovenia slovakia latvia romania and norway will no longer need to quarantine on arrival france has also lost its confusing amber plus status which meant all travellers and not just those who are not fully vaccinated had to self isolate for 10 days upon return our nearest neighbour had been in a category all by itself because of concerning levels of the beta variant of covid 19 there is that it sadly yes but it just got slightly easier to visit india bahrain qatar and the united arab emirates as they have been downgraded from the red to the amber list meaning arrivals will no longer have to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel there are currently 24 countries on the green list including the popular holiday destinations of barbados croatia and malta unfortunately 16 of these are on the green watch list meaning they could be suddenly be shunted up to amber australia and new zealand are both unambiguously green unfortunately neither are welcoming british travellers at the moment has anyone joined the red list yes mexico georgia and the french overseas territories of la reunion and mayotte are joining the red list if you have a holiday to one of those destinations already booked and want to press ahead bear in mind the cost for solo travellers in a quarantine hotel in england will be ramped up from 1 750 to 2 285 from august 12 the charge for an additional adult sharing a room will more than double from 650 to 1 430 to better reflect the increased costs involved the government said is my trip to spain safe there were fears in the travel industry that spain the most popular overseas destination for uk holidaymakers could be added to england s red list the government announced it would keep its amber status but urged travellers arriving in the uk from spain to take a pcr test for the mandatory pre departure test as a precaution against the increased prevalence of the virus and variants in the country many travellers have been relying on the cheaper lateral flow test kits which are less reliable than pcrs things keep changing what do i have to do when i get home again there are different rules for countries on the red amber and green lists that also differ according to a traveller s vaccination status passengers to england returning from a red list country must have proof of a negative covid 19 test before departure and must book a hotel quarantine package including two covid 19 tests even if they have had both jabs they must also complete a passenger locator form if you have come from an amber list country you need proof of a negative test before travel and those who are not fully vaccinated must self isolate 10 days upon arrival and take a pcr test on day two and day eight you might be able to get out of quarantine early if you pay for a private pcr test to be taken on day five under the test to release scheme those with two vaccines only need to take a pcr test on day two of their arrival and can skip self isolation the same rules apply to those who are under the age of 18 regardless of their vaccination status anyone returning from a green list country need only have proof of a negative covid 19 test before travel fill in a passenger locator form and take a test on day two after arrival do these changes apply elsewhere in the uk the devolved nations have control over their own amber red and green lists of countries as well as the rules around quarantine upon return and the recent changes have attracted criticism from some quarters the welsh government is still advising against all but essential travel abroad and those who have been to a red list country cannot even enter until they have completed 10 days of quarantine in england or scotland first in a statement a spokesman for the welsh government said we have long called for a clearer system of rules regarding international travel the ad hoc nature of the decisions made by the uk government on the issue does little to instil confidence or provide clarity for travellers we continue to advise against all but essential travel abroad because of the continuing risk of infection including with new variants of coronavirus which may not respond to our vaccines we will consider the latest changes announced by the uk government advertisement amy perez 39 a marketing director from putney south west london who has been travelling around mexico with her family said it s inconvenient and expensive and there seems to be an entire industry surrounding covid testing we were on holiday for two weeks and are really chuffed that we don t have to quarantine for 10 days we would have been locked up in a hotel with these two little monsters maxi 18 months and emilia who just turned four yesterday her husband jorge said the government wants people to get vaccinated but then people don t see the benefits it would have made more sense for us to take the fine rather than shell out thousands of pounds not be able to work and be locked up with our children alejandro seama 42 a filmmaker from london said i think it s terrible and stupid because it seems they just want rich people to be able travel look at my dad he s 72 he s been double vaccinated he s absolutely fine but for some reason they don t accept his vaccines here i had to spend 600 on mandatory covid tests just to get my parents here if the rules had already changed they would not have been able to visit and i would have never left i had no clue that mexico was going on the red list but thank god we came back today returning from mexico after the deadline will see britons face a steep hotel quarantine bill after the government raised the price to reflect increased costs involved a single person will have to stump up 2 285 from next thursday during their isolation while additional adults and teenagers will be charged 1 430 more than double the current 650 rate the price for children aged five to 12 will remain at 325 while under fives will continue to stay for free it means that for a family of four with two teenage children the cost will jump from 3 700 to a staggering 6 575 a rise of 78 per cent mr coward said if the couple do not receive a refund from british airways for their holiday based near cancun they will be several thousand pounds out of pocket he said staying is not an option due to the cost of quarantine hotels which from august 12 will rise to 2 285 for a solo traveller plus an extra 1 430 for additional adults sharing a room ayo faley a call handler for nhs test and trace in london also landed in cancun on thursday morning but she plans to stay for her holiday as planned and pay for quarantine she is returning on august 11 so will pay the lower rate of 1 750 but said she is absolutely distraught the 24 year old said i only found out travel restrictions had changed the minute i was able to connect to wifi at the airport i went into a state of panic i tried to locate other brits and see whether they knew and what their next plan of action was you could see the look of confusion fear and regret all in their faces i am absolutely distraught i ve decided to just stay and enjoy the time here i ll just have to face the consequences when i arrive ms faley works from home and had planned to do so on her return from cancun but said she will not be able to access her equipment in quarantine she added how are the government planning to help individuals who have found themselves in a situation like this leaving the uk thinking their country of destination was safe to then land and find out they better return asap or risk being stuck in a hotel for 11 days aaron who did not wish to share his second name is relocating his family to edinburgh in late august and will now have to pay for them all to quarantine on arrival the 43 year old arrived in mexico in early july to witness the birth of his son aviv and his wife who is from sinaloa had her uk visa approved on july 28 aviv was due to be born july by c section but they brought the date forward so i arrived in the airport at 3am and just made it to the hospital before my wife went to surgery aaron told pa aaron is a self employed data and audiovisual engineer and said he can t quantify how much quarantining will cost his business i have previously taken out a bounce back loan to keep my business afloat he added i have no idea why i should have to pay to isolate in a hotel when i ve had both astrazeneca vaccinations in edinburgh proof of vaccination took a test on my way here and will take one on arrival in scotland james dean 38 from bournemouth had already spent 8 000 on a fortnight in cancun with wife rebecca and their four children lilly 16 jack 13 isabella nine and

john soones 62 from south west london was travelling to mexico with his wife and their 18 year old daughter he said it s just incredible it s terrible to get no notice that this is likely to happen and no time to change plans in more positive news it was announced that double jabbed tourists returning from france will be spared quarantine from sunday and seven european countries including germany and norway were added to the green list of destinations spain has also been spared being given red status potentially forcing thousands into 2 285 a stay quarantine hotels but the government is urging travellers to take a pcr test before they fly home from the iberian country grant shapps said today that people can travel without looking over their shoulders for the next three weeks as countries will not move lists unless something exceptional and unexpected happens but the transport secretary added that full vaccination for travel will be a feature for britons forever more and admitted that countries could turn red again by the end of the month tens of thousands more britons are now expected to head to france for august although tourism chiefs have warned millions more frenchmen are staying in the country this summer so there is serious a lack of accommodation if the traveller is without a second home there is a particular shortage of gites camp sites and hotel rooms in the south of the country especially near beach resorts such as biarritz narbonne île de ré and saint tropez while experts have said there are much larger numbers of tourists from holland belgium and germany in the country this year austria germany latvia norway romania slovenia and slovakia will all move to the quarantine free tier at the end of the weekend in a huge boost for those looking to book a late summer getaway on the continent but while there is no quarantine people will still have to take a negative test before returning and a pcr test on day two back in the uk meanwhile the status of india bahrain qatar and the united arab emirates will switch from red to amber meaning arrivals from those countries will no longer have to spend 11 nights at pricey quarantine hotels while spain avoided joining them those flying back will soon face higher testing costs after ministers urged holidaymakers to take a pcr for the mandatory pre departure test rather than the cheaper lateral flow alternatives as a precaution against the increased prevalence of the virus and variants in the country queues at st pancras international this morning as france was opened up both ways for british tourists and people jumped on the eurostar not wearing a face mask on the tube should be a criminal offence says sadiq khan sadiq khan has said that failing to wear a face mask on the tube should become a criminal offence the london mayor has been pushing the the government to allow transport for london tfl to impose a by law requiring face coverings on the capital s transport network since the easing of restrictions on july 19 freedom day passengers have only been required to wear a covering as a condition of carriage rather than a legal requirement this means tfl staff can tell non compliant customers to leave a bus or train but are powerless to impose fines but mr khan now wants a bye law put in place to effectively bring back the rule that was dropped on july 19 the rule change would also mean british transport police officers could be used to enforce it speaking to the bbc s newscast podcast mr khan said we are trying to lobby the government to allow us to bring in a bye law so it will be the law again so we can issue fixed penalty notices and we can use the police service and btp to enforce this advertisement with the guidance being advice rather than law many travellers may feel entitled to refuse to take the gold standard test which can cost as much as 175 per person french tourism chiefs have welcomed the news that britons can more freely come and go from sunday especially because britons are by far the biggest spenders in the country but only around ten per cent of the usual number of uk tourists are in the country this summer but in the past month mr macron has enforced a high alert covid 19 level hit in 37 departments in france because of rising cases of the delta variant and increasingly busy hospitals in occitanie in south west france a white alert has been imposed meaning medics on holiday can be forced to return to work because of increasingly packed covid wards changes to the traffic light system are a positive step forward but the government needs to make faster progress in opening up international travel industry experts have warned four countries are being removed from england s red list as part of the latest update to the international travel system while seven more including germany are being added to the green list it has also been confirmed that arrivals from france will no longer need to self isolate aligning the nation with other countries on the amber list from which arrivals only need to quarantine at home if they are not fully vaccinated scotland and northern ireland have followed england in introducing the same travel relaxations however the changes have attracted criticism from the welsh government which has continued to advise against all but essential travel confirmation that france is joining the amber list is positive especially during the critical school holiday period said mark tanzer head of abta the travel association but he warned the government is failing to capitalise fully on the success of the vaccine rollout with a very cautious approach to the green list and failure to relax restrictions on travel including requirements for multiple tests even when visiting low risk destinations karen dee chief executive of the airport operators association said the extension of the green list is a positive step forward but warned that the uk remains a long way off a full and meaningful restart of international travel tim alderslade boss of airlines uk the industry body representing uk registered carriers described the announcement as another missed opportunity covid cases in the uk and france look set to pass each other in the coming days as a wave of delta cases in britain drops while it is on the rise across the channel he added that the travel industry has not had anything like the reopening it was hoping for meanwhile rory boland travel editor at which welcomed the addition of more green list countries but warned that the constant chopping and changing would cause further disruption for many the cost for travellers can be significant he said some holidaymakers whose countries have now been placed in the red category will find that their airline or tour operator is unwilling to give them a refund other providers won t refund or even facilitate rebooking if a country is moved from green to amber paul charles chief executive of travel consultancy the pc agency said while there s some welcome progress the government is still being too cautious at a time when they should be opening up travel faster to help the sector s recovery johan lundgren chief executive of easyjet said now summer is fully under way this provides some reassurance to consumers by keeping the status quo for key holiday destinations as well as adding some green list destinations for last minute bookers where there are still great flight and holiday deals available but we remain disappointed at the double standards applied to travel versus the domestic economy with infection rates remaining lower in much of europe and the high vaccination levels in the uk if not now it is hard to know when the time is for much of europe to genuinely turn green and government urgently needs to tackle this expensive testing regime which is adding unnecessary cost especially for the fully vaccinated no one wants to see flying become a preserve of the rich again particularly when so many need to get away or reunite after such a long time
today the world we live in is dominated by a western alliance that includes the us and much of europe along with some smaller players this alliance is threatened by two major forces radical islam whose most dangerous expression is the revolutionary iranian regime and the people s republic of china prc still smarting from its oppression by the west prior to its emergence as a great power i ll discuss iran first last week iranian drones attacked a ship near the coast of oman killing the captain and a crew member apparently the motivation was a tenuous israeli connection more recently a ship in the same region was hijacked and several others were disabled apparently by a cyberattack although iran denies being connected with any of these incidents most observers believe that the iranian regime was responsible for them advertisement the iranian regime finances and arms terrorist groups throughout the region including in lebanon syria and yemen lebanon which survived a brutal civil war an attempt by the plo to set up a palestinian state within her borders an israeli intervention to throw out the plo and the systematic murders of members of its government by syrian agents has finally been brought to her knees by her exploitation by the iranian controlled hezbollah the covid epidemic and a massive explosion of a cache of hezbollah s explosives at the port that leveled a third of her capital city didn t help israel which fought a vicious little war with hezbollah in 2006 now lives in the shadow of 130 000 rockets located in south lebanon these rockets which include ones with precision guidance systems that can strike within a few meters of targets anywhere in israel are deeply embedded in the civilian population including private homes israeli defense officials have said that if hezbollah activates its rockets the idf will be forced to employ massive firepower that will essentially destroy the country the possibility of war breaking out due to escalation between hezbollah and israel is a constant threat westerners who visit relatives in iran or go there for business educational or other reasons are often arrested on trumped up charges and held hostage either for ransom or political advantage sometimes they are tortured conditions in prisons for iranian political dissidents are atrocious with torture and rape common hundreds of iranians are executed every year some for serious crimes like murder or rape but also for being gay committing adultery sex outside marriage and drinking alcohol political opponents of the regime are sometimes charged with spying and executed as well iranian women protesting islamic dress codes that are forced on them are beaten arrested jailed and tortured masih alinejad an iranian feminist now living in exile in the us was the target of a plot to kidnap her and bring her back to iran the plan was foiled by the fbi kidnapping and murdering dissidents abroad has been standard procedure for the regime since it came to power in 1979 the new iranian president ebrahim raisi has been nicknamed the butcher of tehran because of his responsibility for the execution of thousands possibly tens of thousands of people during a reign of terror in 1988 raisi is considered one of the top candidates to succeed ali khamenei as supreme leader last but not least is the regime s plan to develop nuclear weapons which is advancing rapidly whether such weapons would be directly used something which is difficult to judge due to the religious aspects of iranian ideology or whether they would be employed as an umbrella to shield its more conventional military aggression it s likely that the imminent attainment of nuclear capability would greatly change the balance of power in our region and make war likely the regime has consistently and explicitly threatened to wipe israel off the map and israel takes these threats seriously the iranian regime while it is economically and militarily weak has developed means of leveraging asymmetric warfare which along with its aggressive and even messianic ideology makes it a serious threat not just to the region but to the western alliance and its leader the us which it calls the great satan the threat is immediate in the short term due to its nuclear program it is a highly repressive society and although there is a strong domestic opposition attempts to overthrow the regime will be and have been met with great brutality as an israeli naturally i am concerned about the local and immediate threat of iran but the prc is a far greater threat to the western alliance china is already a nuclear power and has recently been reported building up its stock of weapons china s military and economic power is thousands of times greater than that of iran and is every bit as brutal in its repression of internal dissent although china does not publicly announce that the us is satan it is quietly moving its pieces military and economic on the world s chessboard to increase its power and influence it operates an unprecedented system of industrial espionage that has already neutralized the technological superiority of the us it is building infrastructure throughout the world under its belt and road initiative that will not only provide its industries access to markets but the large debts incurred by the recipients will provide china political leverage over them chinese technology that is used in the most critical communications infrastructure may contain backdoors that allow access to traffic on the networks everything from mobile phones to pcs to military communications systems have been suspected to be compromised the us and other developed countries are experiencing a long term transition of their economies away from agriculture and manufacturing and toward service based economies manufacturing has moved to china and to other countries most of which are or soon will be in the chinese sphere of influence at the time of the outbreak of the covid 19 epidemic the us suffered a severe shortage of personal protective equipment and medical devices such as masks and so forth it was simply not produced in the usa china does not as far as i know export violent terrorism as does iran but it has been engaging in territorial expansionism in all directions chinese pressure on hong kong and taiwan make headlines while china quietly nibbles away at japanese islands territories under indian control bits of nepal and bhutan and so on in the south china sea china has built artificial islands which have greatly extended its territorial waters and provided locations for military installations including missile silos i have not discussed the possible exploitation of the covid 19 epidemic certainly the misinformation and disinformation that was provided by china at the time of its outbreak exacerbated the harm to western societies there is even a credible argument that once the disease had become established in wuhan authorities there under the direction of the national government deliberately allowed the residents of the city to travel worldwide during the chinese new year period knowing that this would spread the disease the chinese strategy is safer and surer if somewhat slower than the iranian one but the west has done little to protect itself either against the immediate danger of nuclear weapons in the hands of a proven rogue aggressor state or the long term combined economic military and possibly biological domination of a rising totalitarian superstate western nations should be confiscating the iranian regime s nuclear toys reestablishing self sufficient economies protecting their technological intellectual property and strengthening their military forces they are not doing any of these things instead the most advanced states of the west are self destructing over issues of race and gender identity

realpolitik has an unsavoury connotation in pursuit of benefits we are willing to sacrifice seemingly eternal moral principles henry kissin ger as the architect of richard nixon s visit to china in 1972 comes to mind who checkmated the soviet union by embracing the other communist dictator mao zedong yet when it comes to investing in china to trade with sell to and source from the biggest trading nation on earth we pursue our own realpolitik with gusto dismissing moral scruples for pecuniary gain china is the predominant trading partner for 75 per cent of all countries global investors are holding usd800 billion worth of chinese shares an increase of 35 billion since january alone since the inclusion of chinese stocks and bonds in broadly used global indexes investment funds and

under the pretext of outlawing anti competitive behaviour and data mishandling the chinese communist party ccp is cutting its technology behemoths down to size and humbling its billionaires into submission to the detriment of global investors some western observers look with quite some admiration at china s anti competition crackdown comparing it to our futile attempts to reign in our own internet krakens merely bemoaning the fact that in the process the rule of law is somewhat substituted by the rule of the ccp robert armstrong commentator of the financial times points out that shares of chinese companies are always trading at a discount to their peers in the west precisely because they do not grant real ownership this discount just got a little steeper now he thinks in other words we are not real investors but merely donors hoping for a fair reward it is argued that the ccp may act ruthlessly but that it is neither irresponsible nor unpredictable investors have to under stand that invariable data and populace control and financial stability will always be prioritised over buccaneering private enterprise i think the reality is more profane with xi jinping china now has a leader who has little sympathy for private entrep reneurship he prefers state enterprises run by subordinates to jet setting oligarchs his distains the unruliness of markets and envies china s billionaires hogging the limelight there s no predictable end to this two thirds of world growth depends on china decoupling means self immolation we have seen it all before the besmearing incarceration and expropriation of billionaires under the pretence of felony and trumped up accusations the bone of contention is regularly independent wealth often the intended flotation of a company

there are many more cases in the case of saudi arabia perhaps less legalistic what they have in common are not real violations of a law but political abuse of the law russia and china are not upholding the rule of law they are ruling with the law while we may shrug off russia as an investment opportunity it is hard to do the same with china we can pique russia with embargoes yet must fear china doing the same to us talk about pro democracy protests in hong kong the cultural and physical annihilation of china s muslim population or about the wuhan institute of virology and the instant death of trade will follow be it in korean pop music japanese chocolates or australian coal while we may refuse to be the sacrificial investor lamb on moral or financial grounds we cannot choose a world without china two thirds of world growth depends on it decoupling means self immolation we therefore have to set the rules of engagement with china firmly and solitarily otherwise we will be

writer and poet xxx even though counting heads is not an ideal way to govern at least it is better than breaking them federal judge learned hand 1872 1961 i understand the politics behind the new providence teachers contract which includes only minor changes to promote better teaching in the poorly functioning district the pact s details were kept secret from the public before the teachers overwhelmingly voted for what many would see as a sweetheart deal rhode island gov mckee looking ahead to next year s election wanted calm especially after the severe disruptions to school operations of the past year and a half because of covid 19 but the agreement means that reforms needed to make the schools measurably better will have to wait until the new three year contract expires mr mckee and his predecessor gina raimondo wanted to avoid a legal tussle with the union though i think that the issues are important enough to have been worth that risk the whole thing reminds me of why i don t like public employee unions among other reasons because of too many conflicts of interest with politicians civil service protections yes unions no the contract will probably lead to more pressure to create and expand charter schools to get around some of the stultifying effects of this and previous contracts and encourage more innovation and more parents will see if they can afford to send their kids to private schools in the providence area still the biggest challenge facing providence schools is the high level of poverty and the vast number of single parent and or dysfunctional families in this and other cities which sorely undermine attempts to educate young people social chaos keeps bubbling up narrow the streets there s been an increase in the number of u s pedestrians struck and killed by cars running into them in the last few years with a 21 percent increase from 2019 to 2020 to 6 721 and many more people were injured the pandemic partly explains this less traffic encouraged more speeding and being hit by those proliferating high profile heavy suvs is more dangerous than being struck by smaller cars but that reminds me that too many of our roads are too wide encouraging speeding narrower streets are generally safer among other reasons because they slow down drivers and are easier for pedestrians to cross of course you need space along the roads for parking you d need less if there were fewer cars and more public transit and of course the mania for superwide streets in our car based culture reduces the land available for housing which jacks up its price greenery and bike paths and by maximizing heat absorbing and emitting pavement raises air temperatures in urban heat islands even as global warming intensifies using reflective surfaces on streets and parking lots in paved over america would help reduce the heat among alternatives to blacktop are such reflective materials as concrete or lighter colored aggregates or binders residential streets a street design guide jointly published by the american society of civil engineers asce the national association of home builders nahb the urban land institute uli and the institute of transportation engineers ite summarizes the right of way width should be only as wide as necessary for the street pavement and other facilities and uses including sidewalks drainage street trees snow storage and grading blanket requirements for right of way of 50 feet or more often mandated by ordinances are seldom justified for subcollectors and access streets residential street designers should select the minimum width that will reasonably satisfy all realistic needs thereby minimizing construction and annual maintenance costs while at the same time maximizing the livability of the community please hit these links for more information or here this reminds me of lewis mumford s line in 1963 increasing road width to reduce congestion is the same as loosening your belt to fight obesity mumford was an american historian sociologist philosopher of technology and literary critic he was particularly noted for his study of cities vote grabbers a providence mayoral candidate could get a lot of votes with credible promises for the city to crack down hard on atv and dirt bike users they must be made very scared to ride in the city the state of rhode island through the state police and new laws must also bring much more force to bear against these potentially lethal and out of control offenders arrest immediate jail conviction and a memorable stay in the aci and a candidate could also gain more than a few votes by supporting a ban on gasoline fueled shrieking and polluting leaf blowers it used to be that these infernal devices were mostly confined to blowing fallen leaves into piles to be trucked away in mid and late autumn now they re used year round to often pointlessly blast dust and other debris around turning the surrounding neighborhoods into dead zones while they work affluent property owners employ yard crews of hard working undocumented aliens too few of whom are wearing ear protection to wield these things i ve noticed that many of the owners often arrange to be away at their summer or weekend houses when the crews show up getting physical 1 the current big federal infrastructure bill as does virtually any legislation especially one like this put together in such a narrowly divided congress has plenty of flaws for instance it doesn t provide nearly enough money for public transit even as an aging population and environmental crises demand more resources for trains and buses and the gop qanon following the strict commands of its fascistic big donors has blocked reasonable efforts to help pay for the program even sabotaging efforts to make it easier for the irs to collect money that the government is already owed the measure may survive republican attempts to kill it to deprive biden of a politically popular victory and extortion by quasi democrats joe manchin of west virginia which as part of the bargaining would get goodies far in excess of its fair share based on population size and arizona sen kyrsten sinema both of whom are wallowing in their current power if it does it would raise most americans morale at the sight of congress actually doing something america needs to focus more on investment and less on consumption if it is to prosper in the next decade view larger by the time that you read this new york gov andrew cuomo as stubborn and arrogant as he is may have bailed in the wake of the report citing him for serial sexual harassment he should have resigned immediately to save state government the disruption time and expense of impeaching him cuomo had many talents as a strong and articulate leader but he has also shown himself as dishonorable and even dangerous meanwhile it s interesting that as almost always happens when political sex scandals bubble up leading democrats have demanded the ouster of this fellow big

depressing stretch planting many more trees along the way would help camouflage some of its horrors and maybe as the world wide web continues to kill brick and mortar stores some of the lands can be

executive officer thanks jeff good morning and thank you everyone for joining us today as you can see from our earnings release we delivered strong results across the board in the second quarter highlighted by 18 total revenue growth and 17 annual recurring revenue growth annual recurring revenue or arr totaled a record 252 4 million at quarter end providing us with visibility to a solid second half of the year cloud arr increased 24 year over year to 225 6 million or 89 of total arr and reflects zix s transformation into a cloud first company operationally we migrated more than 1 900 encryption customers to our secure cloud platform in q2 this accelerating secure cloud adoption is helping our partners and customers be more productive secure and compliant in turn we are deepening our partner and customer relationships and enhancing their experiences which is enabling us to layer on additional services more effectively cloudally is continuing to perform exceedingly well validating our m a thesis and reflecting cloud backups increasingly critical role within a secure modern workplace we continue to grow cloud backup arr at approximately 50 year over year as we take advantage of the strong secular tailwinds of protecting increasingly valuable cloud data sets from ransomware and employee error we launched secure cloud into german market this quarter adding 16 new german partners in the short weeks since our launch the encouraging acceptance we ve seen in this new market is validation of our investment in germany and in the international expansion more generally before i go further i will now turn the call over to our cfo dave rockvam to provide details on our financial results for q2 dave dave rockvam chief financial officer thank you dave and good morning everyone the second quarter again demonstrated our ability to continue driving profitable growth in addition to robust revenue and arr performances and strong cash flow generation we delivered meaningful gross margin dollar expansion in the period highlighting our success in layering on organic higher margin products looking at the numbers in more detail at the end of q2 our arr totaled 252 4 million up 17 from q2 of last year our cloud based arr grew 24 over q2 of last year and comprises 89 of our total arr or a record 225 6 million new customers added in the quarter totaled roughly 5 232 for the second quarter our net dollar retention was 101 4 which represents our renewals plus new sales into the installed base divided by the renewals that were available at the beginning of the quarter 101 4 is the highest level we have seen since pre covid and we are pleased to once again be above the 100 plus level revenue for the second quarter increased 18 to 62 8 million from 53 3 million in the same quarter last year the 62 8 million of revenue exceeded our guidance range for the second quarter in q2 as in the past we saw the majority of all new customers on board to the zix secure cloud platform given we are running over 95 and the only meaningful cohort of customers not coming on to secure cloud are mostly our single license desktop users we won t be highlighting this metric in the future we are pleased that just one year past the launch of secure cloud the adoption has been so strong secure cloud has helped us move from 1 24 services per customer in the second quarter of last year to 1 32 services per customer at the end of q2 2021 this additional attach is driving revenue and gross margin growth and we feel as a trend that will continue to build as our customers and partners continue to gain more and more value from our solutions and platform our adjusted gross profit for the quarter was 31 3 million or 50 of total revenue this was 2 1 million or a 7 improvement from 29 2 million in q2 of last year and an increase of 1 3 million over q1 of 2021 this quarter s gross margin dollar performance was our highest level of growth since the first full quarter after acquiring appriver we feel confident in building on this trend as we go throughout the rest of the year our ability to assist our msp partners and direct customers as they move to the cloud continues to make us an even more valuable partner to them the macro acceleration of the business cloud journey and increased focus on email security give us confidence we can continue to capture meaningful growth opportunities well into the future moreover our current base of more than 5 600 partners and over 100 000 end customers provide us a built in growth opportunity to attach zix s organic higher margin products our adjusted r d expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were 5 7 million or 9 of total revenue this compares to 5 2 million or 10 of total revenue in q2 of last year the year over year dollar increase for the quarter was primarily amortization due to certain development projects we completed in the quarter we anticipate r d expenses to continue to increase during the year we don t expect this to be in current cash expense increases but amortization of past projects that are being deployed on secure cloud while these expenses impact our net income and eps they are adjusted out of ebitda our adjusted selling and marketing expenses for the quarter were 10 9 million or 17 of total revenue compared to 10 1 million or 19 of total revenue in q2 of last year the higher selling and marketing expenses on a dollar basis reflect the pickup in travel and trade show activity by our sales and marketing teams and increased direct and partner commissions due to increased revenues on the other hand the decline in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue reflects the benefits of our lower cost of customer acquisition from our high velocity sales model and the success we are having winning new customers and wallet share gains from our active msp partners we do expect to see increases in selling and marketing the rest of the year as we continue to lean into the growing opportunity we are seeing in the market for the second quarter of 2021 our adjusted general and administrative expenses were 4 5 million or 7 of total revenue which compares to 3 4 million or 6 of total revenue reported in q2 of last year on a gaap basis we recorded a net loss attributable to common shareholders of a loss of 5 3 million or a loss of 0 10 per fully diluted share the 0 10 loss for the quarter compares to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of a loss of 4 1 million or a loss of 0 08 per fully diluted share in q2 of last year the change in the quarter was primarily driven by higher stock based compensation over the prior year we did incur severance expenses as a result of the elimination of approximately a dozen positions from the organization these changes were made predominantly better align our workforce for changes in work as a result of covid work from home and hybrid work our second quarter non gaap adjusted net income before deemed evident excluding deferred tax was 7 9 million or 0 14 per fully diluted share which was in line with our guidance this compares to 8 million or 0 15 per fully diluted share that we reported in q2 of last year the slightly lower net income compared to last year is due to the increase in amortization of r d projects that were completed during the past 12 months these are non cash impacting on the quarter and the amortization is removed as part of our adjusted ebitda calculation and finally our adjusted ebitda for q2 2021 totaled 13 3 million an increase from 12 7 million we reported in q2 of last year as a percentage of total revenue adjusted ebitda for q2 2021 was 21 which was in line with our guidance and compares to 24 in q2 of last year cash flow from operations for the second quarter of 2021 was 14 7 million an increase of 212 or 10 million over q2 of last year the increase in cash flow from operations was primarily driven by continued focus on the business operations and continued careful working capital management capex and other intangibles for the second quarter of 2021 were 3 7 million which consisted primarily of normal business capital purchases and capitalized internal use software development billings for the second quarter of 2021 totaled 60 million up 15 from 52 8 million in q2 last year turning to our balance sheet we ended the quarter with 33 9 million in cash which was an increase of over 10 million from the first quarter of 2021 in addition to our strong cash position we also have 25 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility in terms of our capital structure and debt metrics we had 211 3 million of total debt on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter our trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda of nearly 53 5 million reflects a leverage ratio of approximately 3 3 times adjusted ebitda at the end of q2 putting us below the maximum permitted leverage ratio of four and a half times for the quarter shifting gears to our financial guidance for the third quarter of 2021 which is based on current market conditions and expectations and doesn t take into account potential market changes such as increased covid 19 activity or the delta variant in q3 we currently expect revenue to range between 64 million and 64 4 million our revenue forecast for the third quarter of 2021 implies a 17 growth rate compared to q3 of last year we are forecasting a fully diluted gaap loss per share attributable to common stockholders to be in the range of a loss of 0 09 and a loss of 0 08 and fully diluted non gaap adjusted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders before deemed dividends and excluding deferred tax benefits expense to be 0 15 for the third quarter of 2021 we are currently forecasting adjusted ebitda to be approximately 22 of forecast revenue for q3 2021 the per share guidance figures are based on approximate basic share count of 56 9 million for q3 2021 based on our current visibility we are increasing our revenue guidance for 2021 to be between 253 1 million and 253 9 million representing an increase of between 16 and 16 2 compared to 2020 we also expect fully diluted gaap loss per share attributable to common stockholders to range between a loss of 0 38 and a loss of 0 36 for the year on a non gaap basis adjusted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders is expected to range between 0 58 and 0 60 adjusted ebitda is forecasted to be approximately 56 million or approximately 22 of total revenue for 2021 and a year over year increase of approximately 10 compared to fiscal year 2020 the per share figures are based on an approximate basic share count of 55 5 million for 2021 based on our current outlook we expect to generate continued strong operating cash flow in 2021 we are forecasting approximately 9 million in interest expense on our bank credit facility and other interest bearing items for 2021 in summary as we execute this strategy we believe our 100 subscription model favorable profitability profile and strong cash flow generation positions us well to meet our manageable debt obligations and achieve our adjusted ebitda guidance of approximately 56 million this completes my financial summary for a more detailed analysis of our financial results please refer to today s earnings release as well as our 10 q which we plan to file by august 9 also visit our investor relations website to view our most recent investor presentation dave dave wagner chief executive officer thanks dave as our financial performance reflects we experienced reacceleration in our business in q2 and we re seeing a steady growth market ahead as businesses globally continue their journey to the cloud with an increased focus on email security compliance and resilience as you ve heard me talk about our growth strategy is built on three key pillars new partner and customer acquisition partner and customer add ons and retention i ll take a few minutes to provide updates in each of these areas starting first with new partner and customer acquisition during q2 we added 5 232 new customers our global partner expansion continues to gain traction especially in the u k and germany in fact all five of our top new partner wins were international with three in the u k and two in germany our u k msp wins in the quarter included a highly accredited u k based msp who initially moved over the microsoft users and more recently moved over more than 1 000 seats of email security to our advanced email threat protection we are working with this partner to add additional seats and services including cloud backup another nice u k win was a msp who consolidated with us as one strategic partner providing a range of offerings including replacing their current backup solution with cloudally these wins contributed to a record new partner recruit quarter in emea with 39 16 of which were in germany we remain enthusiastic about our opportunity in germany because secure cloud is so well positioned to help it providers in that market transition their businesses from traditional break fix focused businesses to becoming higher value add subscription billing msps our u k and german expansion reflect the success of those strategic investments and our commitment to strengthening our partners security compliance and resilience tools equally exciting are the examples we re seeing of cloud backup helping us capture new partners and new customers our u k team secured a new partner that was dissatisfied with the level of service and support they were receiving from a competitive cloud backup and cybersecurity provider when the partner heard the zix story they not only chose our cloud backup solution for 3 000 seats but also brought over the microsoft licensing of 5 000 seats as well this partner plans to add more than 1 000 seats of archive later this quarter in north america one of our partners learned of a situation where an end customer was dissatisfied with a competing backup offering when they learned of zix s sales force backup capabilities they selected us for both their 650 salesforce backup seats as well as their 5 500 microsoft backup seats as well this new win gives us the opportunity to demonstrate our value and expand even further with more solutions over time it s these types of success stories that reflect the value of secure cloud our phenomenal service and the effectiveness of our account management capabilities in terms of our top five new wins through our var and direct sales team we had two in healthcare two in consumer and one in the government vertical four of the top five wins included email encryption our largest var direct win in the quarter was a six figure encryption win with a large government defense contractor we displaced an incumbent vendor and were selected in a competitive process for our superior end user experience and support turning to our second growth pillar which is sales to existing partners and customers in his portion dave mentioned our updated partner and customer numbers when we include cloudally s partners we are up to more than 5 600 transacting partners and more than 100 000 end customers this space and the white space in it is the key source of growth for us going forward in the second quarter sales to existing customers through msps accounted for 51 of the mrr increase in the quarter which compares to 44 in q1 we see this largely as the reversal of the covid trend of reducing users to reflect the increase in smb hiring we saw in north america especially in march and april in terms of our top five add ons through our var and direct sales team four were in healthcare and one was in construction the largest add on was with a healthcare organization who wanted to consolidate encryption data loss prevention and microsoft licenses with one vendor who provides phenomenal support our top five add on customers in q2 had an average of more than three solutions per account as we continue to successfully attach more solutions to existing accounts we re also doing a great job of introducing zix s cloud backup capability to our existing partners and customers we already had more than 100 and 60 direct customers signed on with a cloud backup offering this adoption has us well on track to meet or exceed our attached goals for cloud backup in 2021 moving to our third growth pillar increasing retention total company net dollar retention increased from 98 in q1 to over 101 this quarter gross retention at the company level remained over 90 which is in line with historical trends we anticipate our retention rates to remain strong as we attach more services to our base over the past five years we ve successfully transitioned zix from an email encryption provider to a cloud first provider with a broad range of solutions based on our secure cloud platform as much we have accomplished and as proud as we are of zix today we are still in transition our growth strategy in 2021 remains centered around transformation in addition to driving predictable and profitable growth our focus is on improving partner and customer experiences by consolidating more of our services onto our secure cloud platform the migration of our encryption customers to secure cloud is going phenomenally well in fact nearly all new customers have been onboarded to secure cloud this year and we ve migrated more than 2 000 existing encryption customers to secure cloud year to date the integration of cloudally cloud backup into our secure cloud platform will be completed this quarter which will further unify the platform and allow our partners and customers to protect business critical data within today s modern saas applications like microsoft 365 salesforce google workplace dropbox and box looking ahead zix remains well positioned to capitalize on secular market trends and cloud adoption ensuring that hybrid work environment s productive secure compliant and resilient our building cloud momentum has us on track to realize our financial goals for 2021 while also setting us up for even greater success down the road this includes long term growth with a goal of achieving 500 million in annual recurring revenue by 2025 that concludes our prepared remarks operator we re ready to open the call for questions operator questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from chad bennett with craig hallum chad bennett craig hallum capital group analyst great thanks for taking my questions congrats guys re acceleration was really impressive especially on the secondary metric so i m just curious on the mailbox numbers i mean they you know you saw like huge step function growth there from last quarter and then from a new customer standpoint just i guess i know you know based on microsoft results we saw some acceleration in mailboxes in their numbers or office 365 i should say in their growth rate numbers and i know nfib has ticked up nicely just other than those kind of macro but highly correlated metrics what really happened i mean it s a pretty dramatic uptick in those two figures dave wagner chief executive officer yes so thank you for the question chad we do feel much better about those macro items that you mentioned and those are absolutely key drivers you know dave and i the whole leadership team are really proud of the execution which i think is improving as we don t always execute well but the team really came together this quarter and what does feel good about the way they re driving and executing right now chad bennett craig hallum capital group analyst and then just in terms of the attach rate or services per secure cloud you know again do we have i mean i love the examples you gave david of all the displacements and add ons with various partners and customers in the quarter if we look a year from now or exiting this year can 1 32 go to 1 36 or how do we think about that attach rate and should we expect some acceleration from what it s been in the last couple of quarters dave rockvam chief financial officer yeah i think you re right we ve seen really good attach especially since secure cloud launched in april of last year and 1 32 services per customer now that s been coming up one point to two points every quarter we think with as long as things continue on the recovery that we ve seen and you know that we can continue to see that grow secure cloud we know we re going to get customers over on to secure cloud it makes it easier for them to trial the products makes them easier to buy and implement the products so we do expect that we can continue to drive that number and that s what drives our long term model going forward dave wagner chief executive officer and chad the other thing i think you heard in my commentary there is that how pleased we are with cloud backup you know the product we have is really good the market for cloud backup is really strong and that s one of the things that s helping the acceleration is that new product that s in our area of high market demand right now chad bennett craig hallum capital group analyst right well just one last one for me i assume cloudally cloud backup is the highest success rate from attach standpoint right now what would be kind of two and three from a service product standpoint in your mind dave wagner chief executive officer well our no 1 attach product by seats is that advanced threat product it s the natural second layer of defense that we believe every one of our customers should have and then the cloud backup we also believe every cloud data set key data set should be backed up so irrespective of compliance posture regulatory demands on the organization we believe those are the two additional layers that every business mailbox has so those are the two highest attached opportunity products we have chad bennett craig hallum capital group analyst got it thanks nice job again operator so our next question comes from andrew king with colliers securities andrew king colliers securities analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question sorry if you already addressed this i got pulled off the call a couple of times but you obviously saw some nice new partner adds in emea can you give us a little color into the u s new partner adds and specifically how do you see that ramping to pre pandemic levels given the return of in person msp events dave wagner chief executive officer yeah that s a great question andrew so it was new partner adds actually they have been steady in north america during covid and this quarter i think we let folks know may was our first in person partner event that s an area that we re leaning into as north america s new partner accrue obviously we re all watching the delta variant closely but we do have a team out doing in person events and are getting a lot more focused on new partner accrued here in north america but that like i said was kind of steadier during covid we re looking for that to pick up here in the second half dave rockvam chief financial officer yeah and you saw in my comments i mentioned your selling and marketing continue to invest see investment in the second half of the year we really want to lean into the opportunity we re seeing the seat license counts come up that we saw in q2 we think that there s opportunity there in q3 and q4 and the leaning on the selling and marketing side is going to be to support that effort for north america and international partner adds along with our direct as well but mainly focusing on as dave said is that accrued function andrew king colliers securities analyst great and then just double clicking on international investments can you give us a little bit more color as to where you re at in those initiatives specifically regarding hiring and where you re at with the german markets there have you completed the hiring there are you still building that out and what functions dave wagner chief executive officer yeah that s right andrew yeah so we re really pleased with the first hires where the salespeople in region they re doing a great job as you can see from those numbers we had a nice small team already in germany we re adding support and implementation people in the german market it s not there s not dozens of people but by a handful of folks to make sure we have the resources in the region doing first call doing the implementations that obviously the partner relationship work it s largely staffed in all functions in geography at this time and we expect to continue to invest there as we bring our new partners and customers andrew king colliers securities analyst great thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter operator thank you and our next question is from nehal chokshi with northland capital nehal chokshi northland capital analyst thanks great results so you had 9 million of 2q arr growth this quarter did you break that up between appriver and the higher margin services dave rockvam chief financial officer yeah i would say we re running probably 65 70 probably coming from the productivity in microsoft and 35 coming from the ip that balance as you probably write in on that 50 gross margin that we re seeing today nehal chokshi northland capital analyst great ok and i love that you pointed out that you had the highest amount of gross profit dollars sequential increase since the closing of the appriver acquisition and that s really great to see there are lots of elements going on in terms of the gross profit trajectory in the past you ve cited a headwind of hosted exchange and then there s also just simply revenue growth and then there s also the tailwind of what you guys talked about zixi organic services to the appriver customers can you help break out these three elements in terms of that 1 2 million q to q increase there dave wagner chief executive officer yeah as you do point out that of course the hosted exchange is one that over time microsoft is encouraging and actually we re encouraging other partners and customers to move off hosted exchange onto the newer cloud offers to empower more as customers with the teams and additional functionalities so that headwind remains but we are pretty careful in pointing out in the q1 call that that kind of excess churn we saw early in the year that has leveled out and stabilized which is one of the things that helped drive a stronger q2 gross margin i talked about the execution of the team generally when chad asked his question and that s really what they re focused on it s the attached services the addition of the cloud backup capability that we pointed out the really strong success we re seeing there at least relative to the plans that we had at acquisition which now seems quite modest but those are the things that are helping drive that attach and of course the biggest tailwind and we re it was a premise from the beginning of appriver the biggest tailwind is that rotation to the cloud of the office 365 and that s what we really saw in the quarter as we pointed out in one of my lines that as we suffered the contraction of mailboxes remember when covid hit we didn t lose customers we lost mailboxes of existing customers and we saw that move back again as we said in that call at q2 march and april really strong months for existing customers to add back employee mailboxes which was good for us nehal chokshi northland capital analyst great awesome and then dave last quarter you gave us a little bit of a color as far as what we should expect for gross profit dollars trajectory in the june quarter which was super helpful can you help out again with that for the september quarter dave rockvam chief financial officer yeah we as i said in the script we expect gross margin dollars to continue to increase this 1 3 million increase this quarter really got a little bit of a rubber band which was good from march through june so that really helped drive the number significantly in q2 coming off of a disappointing q1 for us on that metric so we do see it coming up 1 3 million maybe a high bar for next quarter as far as gross margin dollar increase but we do continue to see that from here the next couple of quarters nice increases but the 1 3 million is a really strong number this quarter nehal chokshi northland capital analyst great thank you very much operator and our next question is from brian colley with stephens brian colley stephens inc analyst so really impressive cash flow in the quarter i m curious i mean i m curious specifically what drove that strength and how sustainable you think that is because i mean 17 5 free cash flow margin is pretty impressive dave rockvam chief financial officer yeah no we think that cash flow is really important to us we ve been focused on it the last i d say four quarters and we ve been able to our operating cash flow numbers have continued to come up i think we ve got three of our four best quarters probably in company history and we ll continue to keep that focus i think that i don t know that we ll like last quarter we were 10 million this is 14 7 million i don t know that we ll be at the 14 7 million level again you know we stayed very focused as we always do but on making sure that all of our working capital things are all in line and i think we ll continue to do that and build on that earnings continue to increase so as we do that we ll be able to continue to grow that and you know our guidance is a 65 to 70 conversion of ebitda dollars to cash flow and so we ll keep focused in on that this quarter was nicely ahead of that and we ll keep pushing through there brian colley stephens inc analyst got it well that s really encouraging i mean especially if there s nothing abnormal in there i mean that s a much higher cash flow profile than i had kind of thought historically so and congrats dave rockvam chief financial officer yeah i think we pushed a little high this quarter like i said i wouldn t call it for that number every quarter but you know it s a strong focus and that s been our premise all along is that we can drive good gross margin dollar growth we can drive it to the bottom line through our ebitda adjusted ebitda and we can drive it to cash brian colley stephens inc analyst absolutely understood so just looking at the guidance based on the 18 growth you posted this quarter i mean the guidance for 4q implies a bit of a slowdown i mean is there anything specific happening in 4q that would drive that or should we just kind of interpret that outlook as you guys being prudent with on the guidance dave rockvam chief financial officer i d say being prudent on the guidance so you know there is a little bit of inorganic when you look at bringing in cloudally we ll head up against that in q4 in q4 it will be about 1 point delta so we ll almost be back together on our organic versus inorganic and right now it runs a couple of points so still good strong growth but i think that just to be a little bit conservative there s we don t know exactly what s going to happen as covid that picks its head back up and the delta variant and stuff so we ll be pushing hard for the second half of the year as always but i think we just wanted to be prudent as we continue to move the numbers up we started the year at 12 to 14 revenue growth so we re pleased to be in a position to be at 18 this quarter and ended up a full year guide just over 16 now that we got through the second quarter brian colley stephens inc analyst yeah absolutely i agree with that approach so i m curious on the services per customer metric just as it relates to gross margins just driving higher attach rates and seeing a stabilization in margins i completely understand the strategies to drive the gross profit dollar growth but i am curious is there what s kind of the number as you run the math what level of services per secure cloud customer like what level does that need to get to in order for margins to kind of stabilize like from a gross margin perspective dave wagner chief executive officer yeah i don t know brian there s a number that stabilized that the microsoft pricing value that they have puts that into 100 a mailbox today and growing i m really enthusiastic about the microsoft opportunity one that they have and two we have as their partner to drive more and more value for us to make more and more margin for us working and supporting their suite so i actually am really really bullish on the microsoft opportunity as it continues to lead the market we continue to draft their growth in the market we just see lots of opportunity to continue working with them so the margin percentage i understand in the transformation that zix is in the challenge that puts on some analysts and investors thinking about the pure software company that we once were to what we are now which is really a tightly integrated solution set that our partners and customers enjoy and we re going to exploit both opportunities till their maximum they re just they just they work so well together from a partner and customer perspective consolidating the services went under one tight integration simplicity flexibility extensibilities you could use these are the value propositions that we re bringing to the market and it s not going to i don t think it s going to be a number of attaches that drives gross profit back to 80 those days are gone i think those days for most software companies are gone as we continue to leverage the cloud and aren t running on our own appreciated hardware so we really are focused on this gross profit dollar growth and i think the margin percentage is something that we really are trying to encourage investors and analysts to not pay as close attention to i don t think it s a good metric for us brian colley stephens inc analyst understood well if you keep putting up cash flow like you are then i don t think people will care so one last question here you ve given the 2025 arr target for 500 million i mean how should we think about maybe an ebitda margin range for that time frame is 20 to 25 a decent range or any type of ballpark there you could give dave wagner chief executive officer so two things when you re processing through that so that the arr objective is a december 31 objective so the revenue in 2025 i have the math on a spreadsheet but you d have to kind of back down the revenue which would be in the mid to high mid or 100s and then put an ebitda percentage on it you know there s been some compression to ebitda percentage line is at the gross margin line but we would be thinking in terms of 20 ebitda in that kind of time frame there s no other ways we would think of it we are not putting out a strict guide as i said because how the next five years or four years unfurl themselves in terms of the mix is going to have a really big difference on that but we in terms of some compression from ebitda percentage but really very strong at the ebitda line as well brian colley stephens inc analyst got it well that s super helpful i appreciate you guys answering all the questions and congrats again operator thank you our next question a follow up from nehal chokshi with northland capital nehal chokshi northland capital analyst thank you i want to double click on the strong free cash flow here it looks like there were two main elements on the strong free cash flow one was that you had a good increase in accounts payable and then also a good increase in deferred revenue can you discuss why you had nice sequential upticks in both of these balance sheet items dave rockvam chief financial officer yeah on the accounts payable side it was just being conservative on our payables down at the end there s a few things of course that will clean themselves up in the third quarter and year end which like i said we ll put a little bit of pressure on those there s certain bills that sit out there a little longer with different types of services people you re working with and stuff so that s why i said i wouldn t the 14 7 million is a really good number and we can continue to put up good cash flow numbers and operating cash flow numbers it might not hit that number every quarter dave wagner chief executive officer yeah one thing just to hold it to remind you and you ve been around long enough that the zix s annual billings that they are a good strong quarter in q2 so that s the deferred revenue does move a little more than the arr number which is really consistent steady upward moving we do have some timing of billings obviously still with our annual contracts that contribute to the volatility and then i m really pleased with dave and the whole team on the working capital management but payables were at a kind of a high watermark as dave alluded to the other question but i think that longer term thinking about it as that 65 to 70 grower in terms of ebitda to cash flow over time we ve had quarters we ve been off that and we ve gotten pressure now we re way ahead of it but we do expect that to be more stable over time nehal chokshi northland capital analyst if i look at the days payables relative to pre pandemic levels it s still below that so do you think that you still have room for extending your days payables or those are just different days dave rockvam chief financial officer yes those are different days nehal chokshi northland capital analyst ok all right and two other nitpicky things it looks like you re guiding to a 2 million q over q increase in shares outstanding why is that dave rockvam chief financial officer it s how the balance works coming through it s all based on averages and so we do our grants in the second quarter mainly in the first quarter and last year they also came through in the second quarter so it s just the timing of grants and how that works its way through so it s just it was lower in q1 and q2 than we expected but it is pulling through on the average coming up in q3 and q4 nehal chokshi northland capital analyst got it ok and then your g a did increase 0 4 million q to q and 1 1 million year over year what s the narrative behind that dave rockvam chief financial officer yeah a lot of it has to do with expenses coming back up related to q2 of last year we really pulled back everything with covid hitting so not a lot of travel but travel coming back in variable compensation coming back in you can read our q or k from last year our proxy variable compensation was in 60 range we re accruing now toward a better higher number so those are kind of things that go into that number that have pushed it up nehal chokshi northland capital analyst great thanks very much and again congrats on a strong quarter thanks again operator and thank you and at this time this concludes our q a session i would like to turn the call back to mr wagner for his closing remarks dave wagner chief executive officer well i would just add thank you everybody for joining us early this morning in a pre market earnings release we look forward to meeting with you all again in about 90 days and then i m going to talk through our q3 results i thank you all and have a great day

periodic reports filed with the sec this quarter we have continued to advance pacritinib toward a potential u s 10 stocks we like better than cti biopharma when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and cti biopharma wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 approval and commercial launch this year the fda s acceptance with priority review of our nda submission for the use of pacritinib in myelofibrosis patients with thrombocytopenia underscores the unmet medical need in this area our pdufa target action date is november 30 2021 and the fda is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application as a reminder the nda was accepted based on data from phase 3 persist 2 and persist 1 and the phase 2 pac203 clinical trials with a focus on the severely thrombocytopenic patients that is those with platelet counts less than 50 times 10 to nine per liter patients enrolled in these studies with severe thrombocytopenia and patients receiving pacritinib 200 milligrams twice a day were the focus of the nda and included both frontline treatment naive patients and patients with prior exposure to jak2 inhibitors one third of the existing myelofibrosis patient population has severe thrombocytopenia approximately 7 000 patients a population with suboptimal and limited treatment options and an urgent need for new therapies to address this need our team has been working diligently on pre commercialization activities including market access distributions supply chain disease education and field force deployment we are eager to commercially launch pacritinib immediately upon approval from the fda and given our applications prior to review status we are prepared to launch on the pdufa date or earlier in preparation for an early launch we have completed the hiring of our field force leadership team and started to recruit our key account managers who will be our sales force moving on from myelofibrosis last year we launched the study pacritinib in severe covid 19 patients in response to the pandemic this study pre vent is a randomized double blind placebo controlled multicenter phase 3 clinical trial comparing the use of pacritinib plus standard of care versus placebo plus standard of care in hospitalized patients with severe covid 19 the primary endpoint of the trial will assess the proportion of patients who progress to invasive mechanical ventilation and or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or die by day 28 we continue to expect to report on the outcome of the interim analysis from this trial during this quarter finally as we have previously discussed we are investigating the use of pacritinib in the prevention of acute graft versus host disease or gvhd the investigator sponsored phase 2 component of the ongoing phase 1 2 study investigating the addition of pacritinib to the standard prophylaxis of sirolimus and low dose tacrolimus in the treatment of gvhd continues to enroll and we remain on track to provide an update on the progress of the phase 2 trial and any potential regulatory interactions around this indication later in the year as a reminder the american society of hematology meeting in december 2020 data was presented from this study that showed adding pacritinib to the standard prophylaxis regime resulted in significant reduction in the expected acute graft versus host rates in patients within the first 100 days of therapy as compared to historical data without compromising transplantation outcomes and without any new safety concerns i will now turn the call over to david to review our quarterly financials david david kirske chief financial officer thank you adam as of june 30 2021 cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled 71 9 million as compared to 52 5 million as of december 31 2020 operating loss was 19 5 million and 10 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively no revenues were recognized for the three months ended june 30 2021 or for the three months ended december 31 2020 net loss for the three months ended june 30 2021 was 19 7 million or 0 21 for basic and diluted loss per share as compared to a net loss of 14 million or 0 19 for basic and diluted loss per share for the same period in 2020 so with that i ll hand it back to you adam adam craig president and chief executive officer thank you david so with the pdufa target action date of november 30 2021 and commercial preparations well underway we are well positioned for a potential u s launch later this year we look forward to working closely with the fda as it completes the final stages of the review of the application this concludes our formal remarks laurie please open the call for questions questions answers operator our first question is from ben burnett of stifel please ask your question mr burnett your line is open carolina ibanez stifel nicolaus analyst hi can you hear me now adam craig president and chief executive officer yes david kirske chief financial officer yes we can carolina ibanez stifel nicolaus analyst ok yes sorry about that so this is carolina ibanez on for ben burnett i have one quick one on the data for pacritinib in covid 19 coming in in the third quarter could you elaborate on the type of data we ll be getting and where the bar is set for the results also in the context of further jak inhibitors that are already being used with emergency use authorization adam craig president and chief executive officer yes thank you carolina for your questions so the analysis is a futility analysis we have not made public nor will we what the bar is but as we said we should be announcing the data later this quarter and i can t comment on how based on that i can t comment on how we compare to other pac inhibitors other jak inhibitors carolina ibanez stifel nicolaus analyst ok understood and then a quick follow up also on the hiring that you are doing to support the launch of pacritinib in myelofibrosis how should we think about the pacing and volume of additional hires for modeling purposes adam craig president and chief executive officer yes well obviously over the last six months particularly since the nda filing was accepted we have expanded and we have currently around 60 full time employees we do expect that number to approximately double as we complete the commercial hires by the end of this year carolina ibanez stifel nicolaus analyst ok ok thank you so much adam craig president and chief executive officer thank you carolina operator our next question is from reni benjamin of jmp securities please ask your question reni benjamin jmp securities analyst great thanks very much for taking the questions guys and congratulations on all the progress adam i know that we ve talked about how you re thinking about pricing of pacritinib when it comes out and likely to be i think as we ve talked about in the past hopefully of pretty nice premium to the jak inhibitors that are already out there but one of the things that we re always trying to get our hands around is the duration of therapy for pacritinib and the phase 3 data that you ve submitted to the fda show us one thing but i m trying to get a good sense as to what is the average months of duration on therapy that you ve seen to date adam craig president and chief executive officer yes ren i m going to defer that question to we ve actually submitted some data for ash and if that abstract is accepted you will get to see it will answer some of your questions the data i m talking about is from the expanded access with respect to the treatment on the current trials persist 1 and persist 2 we have projections on that but unfortunately i m unable to make that public for competitive reasons reni benjamin jmp securities analyst ok and then i guess just turning to the commercialization side can you just remind me have you guys already identified the centers or the community docs that you will be targeting right off the bat or how should we be thinking about the initial phases of the launch adam craig president and chief executive officer bruce will you answer that question bruce seeley chief operating officer reni in initial launch we re not surprised we re going to target the high volume accounts in the academic centers and then we ve identified also the large community accounts that treat quite a few patients the group practice the large group practices and that s where the far majority of the patients are treated reni benjamin jmp securities analyst and bruce about how many would you be able to tell us like how many accounts are there academic versus community bruce seeley chief operating officer it depends on how you look at it just in terms of number of physicians the majority of physicians are going to be in the community accounts they treat anywhere from zero one or two patients to five ish patients the large practices are the ones that we re going to be focused on and the academic centers we re focused on they can treat 20 to 50 patients per year depending on the site reni benjamin jmp securities analyst thanks very much guys good luck bruce seeley chief operating officer thank you operator your next question is from thomas flaten of lake street capital please ask your question thomas flaten lake street capital markets llc analyst hey guys thanks for taking the questions adam how do you how should we think about pacifica enrollment once you guys go live commercially do you see there being some cannibalization there or do you have a strategy for segregating patients in this study versus commercial product adam craig president and chief executive officer yes thomas thank you it s a very important question it s most likely that pacifica will continue ex u s after approval we are no doubt toward the end of the nda process we ll have some discussions with the fda around the program around that trial with maybe some changes to it but big picture i don t expect there to be cannibalization of u s sales opportunities the drug is performing very well ex u s at the moment and i think we could successfully complete the trial outside the u s on time thomas flaten lake street capital markets llc analyst you mentioned one abstract submission to ash could you qualitatively share what other types of information we might be seeing at ash coming out on pacritinib in particular adam craig president and chief executive officer yes so one of them is duration of therapy on expanded access which i ve already alluded to if accepted of course the abstracts haven t been accepted we re also providing a lot of we ve put together abstracts that really describe the safety profile of pacritinib in the lower platelet count patients and with some comparison to the data we have on the safety profile ruxolitinib in that setting as well and we ve got some nice some very favorable data that we re presenting on that at this point in time i really prefer not to go any further than that because we have to be careful that we don t break the rules with ash and i d rather let you know in november when the abstracts are hopefully accepted thomas flaten lake street capital markets llc analyst no problem just one final one any intelligence on the nccn guidelines update process adam craig president and chief executive officer yes so again a very important question we ve already started our communications with the nccn and we ve sent a preliminary notification of where we are and we do expect once the drug is approved that we ll enter into discussions with them quite quickly and that we ll get on the nccn guidelines as soon as possible after the launch thomas flaten lake street capital markets llc analyst excellent thanks guys appreciate it adam craig president and chief executive officer thank you thomas operator our next question is from gil blum of needham and company please ask your question gil blum needham company analyst hi everyone and thanks for taking our questions most of my questions have already been answered but i think maybe a bit of a regulatory question here with the spike in covid and your pdufa coming in november is the fda having any issues accessing production sites and factories that are making pacritinib or is this not an issue at all adam craig president and chief executive officer as i ve said previously the inspection process for us started very early we ve nearly i think we re coming to the end of it we probably nearly completed it we ve not encountered any issues with the fda with respect to inspections some inspection work has been done remotely that has been very successful without any issues and some inspection work has been done in person again we haven t encountered any issues we seem to have been the resources put by the fda into our inspections have seemed to be very good and it s so far gone very well operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call over back to dr adam craig for his closing remarks adam craig president and chief executive officer thank you laurie and thank you everyone for joining the call today we look forward to continuing the conversation over the coming months and we look forward to a potential approval of pacritinib later this year thank you operator duration 22 minutes call participants adam craig president and chief executive officer david kirske chief financial officer carolina

conference call i am john heilshorn of lha investor relations amsc s investor relations agency of record with us on today s call are daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer and

those of you who have not seen the release the copies are available at the investors page of the company s website at www amsc com before starting the call i would like to remind you that various remarks that management may make during today s call about american superconductor s future expectations including expectations regarding the second quarter of fiscal 2021 financial performance plans and prospects constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements as a result of various important factors including those set forth in the risk factors section of american superconductor s annual report on form 10 k for the year ended march 31 2021 which the company filed with the securities and exchange commission on june 2 2021 and the company s subsequent reports filed with the sec 10 stocks we like better than american superconductor when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and american superconductor wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 these forward looking statements represent management s expectations only as of today and should not be relied upon as

specifically disclaims any obligation to update these forward looking statements also on today s call management will refer to non gaap net loss a non gaap financial measure the company believes that non gaap net loss assists with management and investors in comparing the company s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding these non cash nonrecurring or other charges that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance the reconciliation of gaap net loss to gaap net loss can be found to non gaap net loss can be found in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings press release that the company issued and furnished to the sec last night on form 8 k all the american superconductor s press releases and sec filings can be accessed from the investors page of its website at www amsc com with that i will now turn the call over to chairman president and chief executive officer daniel mcgahn daniel daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer thanks john and good morning everyone i ll begin today by providing an update on our grid and wind business units john kosiba will then provide a detailed review of our financial results for the first fiscal quarter which ended june 30 2021 and provide guidance for the second fiscal quarter which will end september 30 2021 following our comments we ll open up the line to questions from our analysts at the top i just want to say i m very excited about the progress we ve been making on the reg installation in chicago both teams have been working very well together and i hope that we ll be able to update you soon we are growing and diversifying our business our grid segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 grew by more than 30 versus the year ago period and accounted for over 90 of amsc revenue in fact this was the largest grid quarter we have had ever since the start of this fiscal year we have been building momentum while further strengthening our backlog and extending our grid visibility well into fiscal 2021 and also a glimpse into fiscal 2022 this certainly is a very different and stronger business than it even was a few years ago our grid business was driven by strong new energy power system shipments as well as higher ship protection system revenues total revenue for the entire business grew by nearly 20 versus the year ago period in fact our first quarter revenue of approximately 25 million was our highest quarterly revenue in some time just so people understand the numbers a bit better and the impact of neeltran remember we said that we expected that neeltran would be accretive to earnings per share within 12 months from closing not right away neeltran delivered revenues of about 5 million during the first quarter this did come in line with our expectations the operating cash flow number came in line with how we would anticipate that the business would typically operate in revenues of about 20 million per quarter when john goes through the numbers he will highlight this and as you look at the guidance for next quarter please keep this in mind we have integrated nepsi nicely into the business we are working to do the same with neeltran we are starting to see leverage between the product lines as evidenced by the recent 21 million in orders that were just announced which was driven by the mining and semiconductor markets to give you some color on these orders nearly half of the orders come from mining and about a quarter come from semiconductor fabs we are getting leverage across the product line selling into mining we are presenting more content and getting orders from semiconductor in the middle of what is a challenging period for supply chains while we re seeing an increase in capital investment to build semiconductor capacities these are 2 markets mining and semiconductor that may continue to be tailwinds for the business as you ll see from our revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we are anticipating growth given our current momentum in existing backlog we certainly could surpass the 30 million quarterly revenue level as soon as this fiscal year now that we ve reached 25 million we have our sights set on 30 million our revenue backlog is more than 50 higher than this time a year ago and we ended the first quarter with much more than 60 million in cash in fiscal 2021 we expect year over year revenue growth again in our grid and in our overall business our new energy power systems backlog is very strong we are manufacturing ship protection systems for the first san antonio class ship platform lpd with our first delivery expected this year we are supporting inox with commissioning in the field and providing electrical control systems or ecs as they need and pay for it and our south korean wind partner has begun erecting offshore wind turbines utilizing amsc s 5 5 megawatt turbine design and ecs our new energy power systems business has been supported by a strong base of projects in the renewable and industrial segments our systems have gained notable momentum and we expect that they will drive growth and diversification for our company this fiscal year our new energy power systems include dynamic power correction platforms our static power correction line of capacitor banks and harmonic filter systems as well as our rectifiers and transformers our dynamic power correction platform consists of our voltage management solutions these solutions are focused on addressing renewable energy installations on the transmission grid and industrial installations like the semiconductor fab which would reside on the distribution grid we are presenting more content to customers as we leverage the strong combination of our new energy power systems solutions in may 2021 we acquired neeltran inc a connecticut based company that supplies rectifiers and transformers to the industrial market the acquisition of neeltran as well as it was with nepsi which we acquired last october directly in line with our strategic priorities to accelerate profitable growth independent of our wind business broaden our product offering and expand both market reach and content per sale we believe our new energy solutions will play an important role in accelerating us to being operating cash flow positive and position us hopefully for even more dramatic growth our growth through grid strategy is working our business development and manufacturing teams are driving very hard our supply chain so far has been able to respond to the increasing demand for our new energy products we work closely with the semiconductor industry on long lead items supply to date we have not felt impacts of the semiconductor shortage on shipments we continue to monitor our suppliers and try to work closely with them to make sure we don t miss a beat in production we are seeing lead times trending upwards but we believe that we have the time to react to this and have built that into our material flows when many manufacturers rely on lean production we believe for critical components you cannot run so lean i m very happy that we ve been running our business this way we are starting to see product costs on the rise specifically around commodity metals this impacts every product of ours from the cabinets that enclose them down to the materials used in the semiconductor wire we are proactively updating our prices where we can to include these additional costs we can t adjust much against the backlog already established but the good news is that in most cases we have either procured the material or have material contracts in place for a large portion of our existing backlog moving forward on new orders we are reviewing all our cost estimates and raising prices when appropriate the markets in general understand that prices for many commodities have been rising and we are adjusting accordingly we anticipate that new energy shipments should provide a strong base of grid revenues in the second quarter as well as the balance of this fiscal year this expectation is driven by the strong backlog that we have for new energy power systems as well as the overall grid business now turning to our ship protection systems or sps our ship protection system is the navy s baseline degaussing design for the san antonio class ship platform lpd in fiscal 2020 we announced two separate delivery contracts for our sps systems these two contracts represent our third and fourth ship protection system orders for deployment on lpd 31 and lpd 29 the sps is designed to reduce the magnetic signature of a ship which can interfere with undersea mines ability to detect and damage the ship amsc has worked with the u s navy to develop a lighter weight more power efficient high temperature superconductor version of this degaussing system the sps we are now manufacturing for the navy the navy s plan is to build 15 additional san antonio class ships starting with lpd 28 we are working very closely with the navy and our supply chain to ensure timely delivery of our sps orders our sps team is very busy and focused on delivering our first systems the san antonio class is our first design win with the u s navy other potential platforms include but are not limited to carriers frigates destroyers and littoral ships sps grew and contributed to our strong grid segment revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 moving on to wind doosan is now erecting their first series production of 5 5 megawatt offshore wind turbines utilizing amsc s design as well as amsc s ecs we believe southeast asia is a geography well suited for our 5 megawatt class wind turbine and for our partner doosan south korea intends to become one of the world s top five offshore wind power producers and we believe doosan is well positioned for a very high market share to date there are wind farms in the development pipeline which totaled nearly 9 gigawatts of wind capacity we understand doosan will supply wind turbines for the southwestern offshore wind project which is a 2 5 gigawatt development and the gunsan offshore wind farm a 1 gigawatt development our team is working very closely with doosan and we look forward to potentially penetrating the global offshore wind market with this partner regarding our onshore ecs business we stand ready to support our partner in india as they need support commissioning new turbines or need new stock of 2 megawatt ecs for now we are supporting inox with the commissioning of 2 megawatt turbines in the field and providing ecs products as they need and pay for it but let me note importantly today we expect to ship 2 megawatt ecs in the second quarter now i ll turn the call over to john kosiba to review our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and provide guidance for the second fiscal quarter of 2021 which will end september 30 2021 john john kosiba senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks daniel and good morning everyone amsc generated revenues of 25 4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to 21 2 million in the year ago quarter our grid business unit accounted for 92 of total revenues while our wind business unit accounted for 8 grid business unit revenues increased by nearly 33 in the first quarter versus the year ago quarter the year over year growth is due primarily to the revenues generated from both of our acquisitions nepsi and neeltran additionally we experienced growth within our sps product line wind business unit revenues decreased 45 in the first quarter versus the year ago quarter as a result of ecs shipments to doosan during the year ago period looking at the p l in more detail gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 13 compared to 24 in the year ago quarter the year over year decrease was due to an unfavorable product mix and additional costs related to purchase accounting adjustments associated with the neeltran acquisition i realized that with the two acquisitions being incorporated into our financial statements over the last nine months it may be difficult to get a sense of what normalized gross margins may look like after the full integration of both nepsi and neeltran to help you understand what a normalized consolidated gross margin could look like on this revenue profile i ve modeled amsc s consolidated gross margins assuming that neeltran and nepsi have gross margins consistent with similar product lines like d var in that scenario consolidated gross margins for the company would be between 20 and 25 depending on product specific mix as a reminder when we acquired neeltran we mentioned it would take up to a year from closing for neeltran to be accretive to earnings as we ship off existing neeltran backlog and replace it with new orders like the ones we announced on tuesday we expect to see neeltran s gross margins improved considerably over the next 12 months moving on to operating expenses r d and sg a expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were 10 2 million this was up from 8 1 million for the same period a year ago the year over year increase was primarily the result of absorbing the operating expenses for both our nepsi and neeltran acquisitions additionally in q1 of fy 2021 there were approximately 700 000 of acquisition related expenses to complete the neeltran acquisition approximately 13 of r d and sg a expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were non cash our non gaap net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 2 7 million or 0 10 per share compared with 2 4 million or 0 11 per share in the year ago quarter our net loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 5 4 million or 0 20 per share this compares with 3 4 million or 0 16 per share in the year ago quarter please see our press release issued last night for a reconciliation of gaap to non gaap results we ended the first quarter of fiscal 2021 with 63 1 million in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash this compares with 80 7 million on march 31 2021 approximately 12 7 million in cash was used to acquire neeltran in the quarter our operating cash burn in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 5 8 million i would like to take a moment to bridge the operating cash flow for this quarter if you recall when we announced the neeltran acquisition we stated that we anticipated neeltran would be additive to amsc s operating cash flow within 12 months from closing implied in that statement is that amc would absorb neeltran into the operations and it would take some quarters before we experience any meaningful cash contribution from this business to help normalize this quarter s cash flow if we back out neeltran s revenue in this quarter amsc s revenue is closer to 20 million in q1 of fy 21 on that revenue profile we would normally expect an operating cash flow of 3 million to 4 million with that said we re anticipating revenue growth in both our grid and wind businesses over the coming quarters as a result we are investing in working capital to support this growth this additional working capital investment is expected to continue into q2 then we expect levelized working capital in the second half of fiscal 2021 now turning to our financial guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we expect that our revenues will be in the range of 24 million to 27 million our net loss on that revenue is expected not to exceed 6 7 million or 0 25 per share our net loss guidance assumes no changes in contingent considerations not any purchase accounting adjustments associated with the neeltran acquisition our non gaap net loss is expected not to exceed 5 million or 0 18 per share the company expects an operating cash flow of 4 million to 6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we expect to end the second quarter with no less than 56 million in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash with that i ll turn the call back over to daniel dan daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer thanks john the emergence of covid 19 has created both operational challenges and macroeconomic concerns for all businesses and now just after it seems we re getting back to business as usual we see a surge in covid cases due to this new virus variant throughout the past 18 months of the pandemic amsc has demonstrated it can operate effectively through times of crisis we were early to implement physical separation at our manufacturing sites and did not miss a beat in production we instituted cleaning protocols for our offices to help keep everyone safe and healthy which is paramount we are focused on our people and the parts to make our products as well as on strong customer service and product quality our factories remain open and have been operational throughout the pandemic we have started fiscal 2021 on a very strong note grid represented over 90 of our revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and was our strongest grid quarter since we began reporting the grid segment our new energy power assistance business is very strong and we are beginning to see the initial benefits of our two recent acquisitions bookings are off to a strong start for the year we have ship protection system orders for deployment on lpd 28 lpd 29 lpd 30 and lpd 31 we are supporting doosan s efforts to penetrate the offshore wind market with our 5 5 megawatt turbine we are preparing for our onshore wind partner inox to transition to a larger 3 megawatt class wind turbine for deployment in india we are executing against our objectives and that is to the credit of our employees due to their hard work and dedication and i m very proud of all the amsc and comed employees that have worked very hard to make reg happen we have delivered the reg hardware to the site in chicago on time and we believe many utilities are interested in seeing the performance of our product in chicago i look forward to reporting back to you at the completion of our second fiscal quarter of 2021 sharon we ll now take questions from our analysts questions answers operator we ll now take our first question from eric stine from craig hallum your line is open please go ahead aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group analyst great this is aaron spychalla on for eric thanks for taking the questions daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer hey aaron good morning aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group analyst good morning maybe first on reg it sounds like we ll look for details there on the energization of that but can you just kind of talk about the impact when that happens on maybe phase 2 and you mentioned other utilities that are kind of interested in seeing how that performs can you just remind us of the opportunity there with other utilities as we look over the next couple of years daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think it s an important step for the product being in a permutative installation working with a world class utility like comed and exelon we know there are other opportunities within the city of chicago and within the broader exelon utility we know per our discussions with comed they really want to see this thing operate at least a year before they go forward and make additional decisions but the number of people that have been involved the level of training the level of deep conversations with such a broad group within the utility gives me strong comfort that this is really a product that s needed now for the grid and solves a lot of those problems we re seeing i ll say an uptick in demand and identification of specificity of products sorry of projects for the product in other cities that we ve talked about in the past i think the team has done a very good job canvassing the united states to look for potential opportunities to deploy reg but i do think it s now all gated by successful operation for at least a year in chicago aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group analyst great we ll stay tuned there and then second question with the infrastructure bill can you just kind of talk about thoughts on that and then how you might see that impact your business daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think they all represent tailwinds i think a lot of what we re doing is back in vogue it s the type of infrastructure that needs to be spent on but there seems to be funding being allocated for clean and renewable energies as well as the systems like the grid that support them so i think it s a very good time to be american superconductor aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group analyst all right thanks for taking the questions operator we will now take the next question from philip shen from roth capital partners your line is open please go ahead philip shen roth capital partners analyst hey everyone thanks for taking my questions just as a follow up on the reg project i think back in june daniel at our virtual london event you talked about made a comment in just a few weeks away and i was wondering if you could give a little bit of detail if you re seeing any bottlenecks or challenges as you guys kind of get to the final stages or is mostly everything kind of running smoothly and i know your original target was to get this done in the summer but i wanted to just check in to see if there s more detail you could share daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think that s still target s on track i see all green lights and i hope that we can report back to you guys soon with some news philip shen roth capital partners analyst ok and then i think in your prepared remarks you talked about mining and semiconductor end markets has been a nice source of steady demand ahead can you give us a little more color on what you might be seeing there are you seeing kind of more orders from the same customers you ve had in the past or do you see the diversity of customers increasing or possibly both and then would you say that these are key end markets to drive toward your target of 30 million per quarter run rate for grid thanks daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer yes everything you said and the answer is yes so we re seeing diversification of customers we re seeing repeat customers we re seeing expansion of content per sale given the acquisitions but just to kind of talk briefly when we think about doing semi there is a fit to add nepsi content to what we do traditionally with d var we are seeing an uptick in orders to do exactly that so that part of the acquisition certainly is working similarly in mining we see a lot of opportunities that have been coming through neeltran lot of opportunities coming through nepsi we re able to combine content on most of those opportunities which again translates to even more revenue growth we think that these acquisitions are a great fit to diversify our business we love what we do in renewables and in wind but we think we ve added a few more markets here that we can go penetrate and deliver additional growth philip shen roth capital partners analyst great and on that thread in fq1 i think i heard you said that neeltran did 5 million of revenue in the quarter i was wondering if you could give us a more specific split of what your core revenues were for grid and sorry if i missed it and then perhaps what it was for each of the other recent acquisitions daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer so we do break out wind we don t break out the details within the grid we did say that we added in neeltran as the 5 million and we did say that the ship protection systems grew and that s kind of the length of the color that i can give you philip shen roth capital partners analyst great well thanks very much and i ll pass it on daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer thanks phil operator we ll now take the next question from colin rusch from oppenheimer your line is open please go ahead colin rusch oppenheimer co inc analyst thanks so much guys in the grid business with these integrations can you speak to the cadence of the sales process are you seeing any shortening of the sales cycle and then also if you could give us an update on your conversion rate from pipeline into actual sales how that s trending daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer yes those are really good questions colin so i think what we re seeing is the cadence being kind of what we have thought typically we think about our existing products closing anywhere around six to nine months out we see kind of similar timetables for nepsi for some projects maybe a bit shorter we see similar timetables for nepsi but i d say usually a bit longer maybe as much as nine or 12 months out we do have some things that we re starting to book now that are 15 months out and more so i think what we re seeing is strengthening of the conversion and more clarity on what the year is going to look like and we re really comfortable to stand behind what we said about growth the conversion of the pipeline i think really where the team has done some really good work is strong identification of what truly is in that near term pipeline for things that we can close in the next 6 months and we ve seen i ll say an increase in the conversion rate or the win rate and i think that s again a testament to being able to deliver more content to the customer a lot of times in projects it s much more about the timing and the financing of the project than it is really losing to other parties but we see that with existing customers and new customers we re able to deliver quotes with more content and that s being well received colin rusch oppenheimer co inc analyst that s super helpful and then as you think about the medium term in that business now that you ve got a broader portfolio of solutions and i m sure looking at a little bit of longer term relationships with some of these customers is there a really meaningful opportunity to evolve the portfolio and design out some of the components and some of the costs or evolve the performance of those solutions to serve a different need daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer i think a little bit more of the latter i think in the longer term maybe some of the former we re trying to find what that sweet spot is particularly when we combine content from d var plus nepsi where we can buy content with neeltran plus nepsi are there ways to think about streamlining costs and supply chain but really we want to get the stickiness with the customer and to get the order size growing so that the effort per order should be roughly the same but the yield per order we re looking to grow or enhance so that s really the message that the team has colin rusch oppenheimer co inc analyst perfect thanks so much guys daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer thanks colin operator it appears that there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back to mr daniel mcgahn for any additional or closing remarks daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer thanks sharon i really just want to emphasize with people today we re really going for growth here we re starting to see the beginning of that in what we reported out for q1 you see in the guidance clearly that we re looking to grow as well in q2 you can hear in some of the remarks that we made john made about working capital and preparing for growth that we see growth coming on the horizon we re driving the team to become a much bigger business with these additional acquisitions we are acknowledging today that s going to take time and we said that on the outset when we bought these companies that it doesn t happen in a quarter to resolve it good news is we inherited some great backlog with great customers the challenge is how do we improve the financials on the orders going forward and i was very proud that the team was able to generate even more orders this quarter than last quarter i m very proud that the backlog is expanding and the backlog is getting better financially so we re really on the growth and a lot of what we ve talked about to put the company in position for the past few years you re going to see that to come to fruition here in 2021 and certainly 2022 and beyond happy with all the questions with reg really excited to hear about what s going on and we ll leave it at that and look forward to getting back to you guys with how we do with second quarter operations thank you everybody for your support and attention operator duration 41 minutes call participants john heilshorn investor relations daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief

even if you are only a casual shooter you have probably been impacted by the current ammunition situation covid 19 supply issues concerns with the president and congress have all impacted the availability of ammo i stopped in to talk with t j harding owner of the minnow bucket here is north platte harding carries quite a line up of firearms and ammunition so i wanted to get a feel for the situation first hand from a local retailer i think things are getting better harding began i ve had conversations with several of my suppliers where they said they were getting email and on conference calls saying that the major manufacturers have ammo but they are holding some back until it gets closer to hunting season i asked why that was a concern and the answer was basically shooters hoarding and stockpiling ammo the manufacturers know this is happening and are trying to ensure that some ammo will be available for hunters this fall it is still difficult to find some ammo but at least i m getting some now more than i have been able to get but not as much as i want or would be able to sell harding added i have a pretty fair selection of calibers in stock right now i may not have a specific bullet weight or bullet style like a cartridge loaded with a hornady sst bullet but i probably have a similar cartridge that you can use for practice or sighting in your gun as far as where i can get ammo norma has been very good i m getting more from hornady and winchester is getting better harding said another bright spot i saw this week is that the remington ammunition plant in lonoke arkansas is up and running almost at full capacity if you regularly read this column you probably remember me writing about remington going bankrupt last summer and selling off parts of the company all of remington s ammo production facilities closed when the company went bankrupt that left a shortfall of millions of rounds per day not being produced a lot of our current ammo has its roots here back in october 2020 vista outdoor which is the parent company for top ammo brands like federal premium cci and speer bought remington ammunition and the remington brand rights out of bankruptcy vista outdoor executives worked with existing remington ammo leaders to get the massive manufacturing facility in lonoke back up and running they hired back hundreds of employees and new employees to staff the facility they are now making several million of rounds every day remington ammunition is pushing hard to tell the story of its comeback they are keenly aware that what is at stake is more than 200 year old american company trying to get on its feet again but they are also very aware that there has never been more of a demand for ammunition remington definitely has an uphill battle previous remington owners cerberus capital management made years of bad financial decisions that hurt remington s quality and reputation anyone remember the lawsuits surrounding the model 700 rifles or the fiasco of the introduction of the r51 pistol i wrote a lot about those issues too nick sachse the director of product management has been with remington for 29 years and reported that the lonoke arkansas plant is running 24 7 at about 80 to 90 production capacity remington ammunition is again making millions of rounds each day never in the history of this company has there been more demand for our products than there is today sachse said we know that it s still frustrating that you can t find our product on every shelf that it was once on but i ll tell you this very soon we ll be making record levels of ammo remington s immediate focus is on its most popular products like core lokt hunting loads umc range loads and nitro steel shotshells sachse also said that within the next two months you will see some brand new products from remington the ammo side of things seems to be on the right track but the proof will be when i can walk into a store like the minnow bucket and buy the ammo i m looking for as the old saying goes talk is cheap plague problems we hear that california is burning almost every night via the national media if that wasn t enough now they are dealing with

construction as we have seen in the past the vantage group as the managing member of each project owning entity will position a property for sale upon stabilization our two owned student housing properties are now approaching the start of a new academic year which coincides with their standard lease term both are covering all of their obligations from project cash flow including operating expenses and in the case of the 50 50 at university of nebraska debt service both university of nebraska and san diego state have announced their intentions for the fall 2021 semester to be primarily in person on campus learning our two property managers are actively pre leasing units for the fall 2021 semester and as of today both are over 85 pre leased which is consistent with their leasing in years prior to the 2020 2021 covid 19 pandemic on our student housing mrb for the live 929 apartments at johns hopkins university we have seen a similar reversion to pre pandemic performance the property owner recently transitioned third party property manager at live 929 to the same management company that manages maryland economic development corporation s portfolio of student housing assets pre leasing currently stands at approximately 88 with additional lease applications still being processed the existing forbearance of principal amortization agreement with the borrower runs through the end of 2021 the need for forbearance into 2022 will be evaluated as part of the 2002 budgeting process once final leasing results are known like university of nebraska and san diego state johns hopkins university has announced that they expect a broad resumption of in person classes this fall the borrower on the provision proton therapy center mrb filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2020 and that case continues to work its way through the bankruptcy court process the debtor has retained houlihan lokey to evaluate their options with regard to the knoxville center and the two other centers that entered bankruptcy at the same time those options could be either an outright sale of the facilities or a restructuring of the existing bond debt or something else entirely based on those potential outcomes we felt it appropriate to make an additional credit loss impairment this quarter the second quarter of 2021 brought a modest improvement in the market for municipal bonds municipal bond mutual fund inflows have continued their strong performance since march of last year first half of 2021 saw inflows of approximately 57 billion according to refinitiv lipper data that is the highest level of muni bond flows for the first six months of the year since 1992 of that 57 billion almost 14 billion was directed to municipal high yield funds municipal market data s high grade muni bond scale reached all time low yields in mid august 2020 with a 10 year index at 0 59 and a 30 year index at 1 28 the recent rally in treasuries has had a positive impact on the muni market ten year mmd is currently at 0 82 and 30 year mmd is currently at 1 35 roughly 20 to 25 basis points lower in yield than last quarter this past week the bloomberg barclays index for unrated and non investment grade muni bonds hit its lowest level ever through 3 at 2 91 since we are still in a relatively low interest rate environment we continue to be mindful of the absolute level of rates where we can originate new fixed income investments we have continued our focus on shorter duration investments where match funding is more readily available and hedging is less costly in terms of our debt investment activity during the second quarter i had previously mentioned during may s call the early april closing on a longer term financing on an acquisition rehab lihtc project in mississippi in july we closed on our largest construction financing transaction to date 85 million for a new construction lihtc project in orlando we continue to see lending opportunities in both market segments in may 2021 the vantage at powdersville property located in powdersville south carolina was sold the partnership recognized 0 10 of net income and cad per buc in conjunction with the redemption of our membership interest as a result of the sale as i mentioned on last quarter s call in april 2021 we closed one new vantage equity investment for a project located in loveland colorado this is our first investment in the colorado front range market with vantage and continues our diversification of the vantage portfolio locations later on during the second quarter we closed on vantage at helotes another vantage project in the san antonio area which was followed by the acquisition of a second site in san antonio for the development of vantage at fair oaks we will continue to look to strategically work with our strongest sponsors on new investment opportunities where traditional sources of capital may not currently be available with that i will turn things over to jesse coury our cfo to discuss the financial data for the second quarter of 2021 jesse coury chief financial officer thank you ken for the second quarter of 2021 we reported total revenues of 16 4 million net income per beneficial unit certificate or buc basic and diluted of 0 13 and cash available for distribution or cad of 0 17 per buc on a year to date basis we reported total revenues of 30 8 million net income per buc basic and diluted of 0 22 per buc and cad of 0 28 per buc we reported 1 23 billion in total assets as of june 30 such assets make up our three main investment classes first being our net spread portfolio second our vantage investments and the third our mf properties in our net spread portfolio we currently hold 76 mortgage revenue bonds or mrbs across 14 states we hold a significant volume of mrbs related to properties in three states based on outstanding principal with texas representing 44 and california and south carolina each representing 17 as ken mentioned to date we have received no request for forbearance of principal and interest payments for mrbs with multi associated with multifamily properties in 2020 we granted forbearance for the live 929 apartments mrb associated with the student housing property in baltimore maryland forbearance consisted of the deferral of contractual principal payments through 2021 while the property recovers from the effects of the covid 19 pandemic as of mid july the property is 87 leased for the upcoming fall 2021 semester which is on pace with pre covid lease trends the borrower of our provision center mortgage revenue bond a proton therapy center treatment center located in knoxville tennessee filed a petition for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in december 2020 as ken mentioned the borrower is working through the bankruptcy process and we are assessing forbearance and restructuring options with other senior bondholders we recognized an additional impairment charge of 900 000 in the second quarter of 2021 based on our evaluation of the potential outcomes the debtor reorganization process as of june 30 we have investments in seven gils or governmental issuer loans totaling 130 million the gils are investments to finance the construction lease up and stabilization of affordable multifamily properties in four states and are functionally the equivalent to our mrbs and that they are non recourse obligations issued by governmental authorities secured by a mortgage on real and personal property of affordable multifamily properties we expect and believe the interest earned on gils is exempt from federal income tax in most instances we also commit to fund property loans in tandem with the gils that share our first mortgage lean and are typically funded after all gil funds have been advanced as of june 30 we had outstanding commitments to fund additional proceeds for gil investments totaling 71 million and related property loan commitments totaling 120 million such funding commitments will be advanced during the periods of construction not reflected in the amounts i just listed are the new gil and property loan commitments for the construction of a new affordable multifamily property new orlando florida that we closed in july 2021 our commitments for the gil and property loans are 60 and 25 5 million respectively and will be funded during construction also in july we entered into a new tob trust financing to leverage the gil and property loan investments and funds will be advanced as we fund our investment commitments moving to the vantage portfolio the vantage portfolio consists of 13 projects as of june 30 of which two investments are reported on a consolidated basis all investments are for the construction of market rate multifamily properties that represent in the aggregate over 3 700 rental units carrying value of our vantage investments totaled 92 million as of june 30 exclusive of the two investments reported on a consolidated basis of the 13 current projects nine are in texas two in nebraska and one each in tennessee and colorado seven projects are complete and in lease up and six are either under construction or in the planning phase two of the completed properties have achieved over 90 physical occupancy as of june 30 with two additional properties exceeding 90 occupancy by the end of july there have been no material delays or disruptions due to covid 19 for projects currently under construction as ken mentioned the vantage at powdersville property in south carolina was sold in may 2021 and our equity investment was redeemed upon redemption our initial 10 7 million investment of capital was returned and we realized 2 4 million of investment income and a 5 5 million gain upon sale this is our eighth vantage investment that has been redeemed which in the aggregate has generated approximately 35 million of gains on sales and contingent interest to date moving to our mf properties portfolio as of june 30 we owned two mf properties with a total of 859 student housing units and a net carrying value of approximately 56 million both properties provide college student housing which has been more significantly impacted by covid 19 than the general multifamily housing market the 50 50 mf property and the suit on paseo mf property primarily serve students of the university of nebraska and san diego state university respectively both universities have announced their attempt to resume on campus in person classes for the fall 2021 semester both mf properties are leasing for the fall 2021 semester and leasing velocity is relatively consistent with pre covid levels both properties continue to meet all operating and direct mortgage obligations with cash from operations moving to the liability side of our balance sheet we use our debt financing to leverage our investments in mrbs gils and property loans which totaled 742 million as of june 30 in the second quarter of 2021 we received gross proceeds of 31 million from various tob trust financings related to one new mrb investment and continued funding of our gil and property loan commitments of our 742 million of debt financing approximately 40 is fixed rate debt and 60 is variable rate of our 445 million of variable interest rate debt financing 132 million or roughly one third is secured by investments with variable interest rates such that they are at least partially hedged against rising interest rates without the need for separate hedging instruments such as interest rate caps or swaps in june 2021 we obtained a new secured line of credit facility with two financial institutions for up to 40 million subject to a borrowing base calculation the line of credit is secured by a first priority security interest in our vantage investments the suites on paseo mf property and the bank account proceeds will be used to purchase additional investments and to provide flexibility in meeting our general working capital and liquidity needs our unused capacity on the secured line of credit was 33 5 million as of june 30 greystone select holdings llc an affiliate of atax s general partner has provided the deficiency guarantee of atax s obligations under the facility greystone select holdings did not charge a fee in connection with the deficiency guarantee demonstrating greystone s continuing support for atax s operations we regularly monitor our exposure to potential increases in interest rates through our interest rate sensitivity analysis which we report quarterly and is included on page 72 of our most recent form 10 q the interest rate sensitivity table shows the impact to our net interest income given various scenarios of changes in market interest rates these scenarios assume that there is an immediate rise in interest rates and that we do nothing in response for 12 months the analysis based on those assumptions shows that an immediate 200 basis point increase in rates that is sustained for a 12 month period will result in a decrease of approximately 5 2 million in our net interest income and cad or approximately 0 085 per buc lastly we regularly provide our net book value per buc which as of june 30 was 5 67 which is up slightly from 5 63 as of march 31 our closing market price on the nasdaq on june 30 was 6 74 per buc which is a premium to our book value of approximately 19 with that ken and i are now happy to answer questions from the audience questions answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and from jonestrading we have jason stewart please go ahead jason stewart your line is open jason stewart jonestrading analyst yeah you got to unmute it all right my bad first question thank you sorry about that it s really more on the affordable side so first time i ve really we ve never heard anything about affordable from atax what do you think the strategy is there going forward ken rogozinski chief executive officer well i think jason in terms of affordability that really is the core focus of the mrb and the gil investments all of them in order to have the ability to have tax exempt debt issued for them have some level of affordability associated with it there are regulatory agreements that restrict in most cases both the tenant incomes and the rents that the underlying project owners can charge so you know that i think is something that we re going to continue to focus on from a debt perspective that s where we ve historically been an investor i think we have value that we can add to project sponsors around the country and so i think that will continue to be a focus from our perspective on the debt side on the vantage side though those are traditional market rate projects there is no regulatory agreement or rent or tenant income restrictions associated with those we ve been pleased with that strategy and results that the vantage team and we have been able to see from those investments so at least at this point in time i don t foresee any kind of change there from a market rate approach to an affordable approach jason stewart jonestrading analyst how does the new rating that you ve achieved help you accomplish that ken rogozinski chief executive officer i think from our perspective we were really pleased to see the announcement earlier this week of kbra s bb rating of the partnership s senior unsecured credit it s something that we worked hard with that team to educate them about our business educate them about the what we feel is the strong quality of our underlying investment base and so i think it was beneficial for us to be able to have that kind of dialogue with them and see the result that we saw with a rating that s just one notch below investment grade it s new news to the market it has only been out there for four days at this point in time but our goal is that by having that sort of public third party view of our credit that it will help us with our existing counterparties in terms of pricing for our credit and liquidity facilities it will help us with credit capacity with our existing lenders and will hopefully open the door for us to develop relationship with new lenders and counterparties who might not have necessarily focused on us absent this side of public view of our senior unsecured credit jason stewart jonestrading analyst ok got it and then pivoting to the overall balance sheet when you look at the exposure to plus or minus lean the number on interest rates like let s say we get a 1 and then 2 on two on 10 years what do you think the exposure is to atax i mean this has to it really seems like incredibly resilient to any sort of plus or minus move ken rogozinski chief executive officer a couple of things there jason to give you a little more detail i think the first is and jesse i d appreciate any color you want to add here as well the first is that a fair amount of that volatility that you see in that analysis is as a result of our undrawn proceeds on the mizuho secured note financing we ve got another nine months i think at this point in time left to be able to fully draw the balance of that facility if that is not drawn those notes will be redeemed and that will have a significant i think improvement in that analysis since we weren t sure at the time of closing of that transaction in august of last year we didn t put any sort of long term hedge on that cost of debt because we weren t sure how much of that we were going to be used and so i think if that redemption of those secured notes does happen we ll see a significant improvement in how that analysis works because that s right now a potential interest cost increase as a result of an increase in rates there is adding significantly to that analysis the other thing is that from an investment perspective we ve got probably roughly 80 million worth of mrbs that we have funded through one of our tender auction block counterparties we view that as warehouse financing that is not going to be our long term capital solution for how we re going to fund those positions we have them now in that form as we aggregate assets and fully get to a place we can do these virtual strategy like the tenant s trust that we ve done four other times previously so again i think that s more of a sort of once we decide what the long term funding deal bill is going to be for those assets we ll have a much tighter interest rate match funding to be useful at this point jason stewart jonestrading analyst ok last one for me and i ll jump out what s your best guess in terms of the core roe of mrb right now ken rogozinski chief executive officer that s a difficult question to answer jason because there are a lot of things that go into that part of it is what the tenure is of the vehicle whether it s a longer term 15 to 18 year mrb on a new construction lihtc deal that s being both construction and permanent financing from us versus the governmental issuer loans that we re doing which are roughly a 36 month facility it also depends a lot on where our funding vehicles are structured in terms of what the advance rates are from the counterparties and what and cost for credit liquidity are on those vehicles as well so everything is pretty much different for each transaction i can t really give you a firm level of what those levered roes are but i think the one blanket statement that i can make is that we are only doing additional transactions on both the mrb side and the gil side where based on our analysis they are accretive to the current dividend yield at the partnership level jason stewart jonestrading analyst appreciate it thank you operator looks like no further questions at the moment ken rogozinski chief executive officer ok well thank you again everyone for joining us and we ll look forward to speaking with you next quarter thank you operator duration 30 minutes call participants ken rogozinski chief executive officer jesse coury chief financial officer jason stewart jonestrading analyst more atax analysis all earnings call transcripts
sea cucumbers are a popular luxury and delicacy food items in asian markets these echinoderms possess a wide range of bioactive substances that can be used to produce pharmaceutical products recent depletion of natural populations of sea cucumbers requires involving new objects both in commercial harvesting and aquaculture the northern sea cucumber cucumaria frondosa is the most abundant sea cucumber in the barents sea in this paper we summarized literature data on the biology of this polar species to evaluate its fishery and aquaculture potential in the area this eurythermic sea cucumber is typically occurs at 20 100 m depth cucumaria mainly colonize rocky or pebbly bottoms their main food items are detritus pellets phytoplankton and small planktonic crustaceans spawning is registered in february may the age of commercial specimens body length 25 30 cm wet weight 300 350 g is 10 years the most abundant stocks of c frondosa are registered in the central and south eastern parts of the sea due to the low growth rate of cucumaria the most appropriate cultivation method for these holothurians is a combination of larval culture and sea ranching coastal sites of the barents sea merit all the criteria for sea ranching of cucumaria but the development of their extensive aquaculture requires significant investments with long pay back periods introduction the barents sea is a large marine ecosystem with a wide range of environmental conditions resulting from interactions of the cold arctic and warm atlantic waters dvoretsky and dvoretsky 2013 2018a 2019 this region is considered to be the most productive shelf region of the arctic wassmann et al 2006 in russian waters of the barents sea traditional marine fisheries are focused on two main fish species including northeast arctic cod gadus morhua and northeast arctic haddock melanogrammus aeglefinus dvoretsky and dvoretsky 2015 with annual catch rates of 305 500 and 88 000 t respectively anonymous 2021 two non indigenous crabs the red king crab paralithodes camtschaticus and the snow crab chionoecetes opilio provide commercial stocks for russian trap fisheries with relatively high total annual catches 10 820 t for king crabs and 13 202 t for snow crabs dvoretsky and dvoretsky 2015 2018b 2021 bakanev and pavlov 2021 non traditional marine resources of the barents sea include mollusks and echinoderms russian small scale fisheries focused on the iceland scallop chlamys islandica annual landings 100 t per year and the green sea urchin strongylocentrotus droebachiensis 70 g m 2 adopted from gudimova 1998a zakharov et al 2018 within the boundaries of these clusters the square of sites colonized by cucumaria varies from 600 to 3 000 km2 figure 1 gudimova 1998a b the maximum biomass of the sea cucumbers is 400 500 g m 2 mean value is 10 20 g m 2 the total stocks of cucumaria were estimated to be 150 000 30 000 t on spitsbergen bank and 215 000 50 000 t in the south eastern barents sea gudimova 1998a b the main products derived from c frondosa are the muscle bands and the boiled and dried body wall gudimova 1998a hamel and mercier 2008 the organs and muscles are typically boiled dried and salted before export while lesser proportions are marketed as frozen pickled or live products hamel and mercier 2008 mercier and hamel 2013 now the price per kilogram of processed c frondosa can vary from 20 360 us depending on the thickness and texture of the body wall skin color as well as processing integrity hossain et al 2020 although the muscle of cucumaria contains less protein than the meat of mollusks and crustaceans kizevetter 1962 nasedkina et al 1973 it is much richer in minerals p ca mg i fe mn cu and vitamins thiamine riboflavin supplementary table 1 the most common amino acids are alanine glutamine and leucine supplementary table 2 the levels of amino acids in c frondosa from the barents sea differ significantly in comparison to the gulf of st lawrence supplementary table 2 reflecting different habitat conditions in these areas since a lot of valuable biochemical components such as monosulfated triterpenoid glycoside frondoside a disulfated glycoside frondoside b trisulfated glycoside frondoside c eicosapentaenoic acid fucoidan 12 methyltetradecanoic acid cerebrosides and fucosylated chondroitin sulfate were reported in c frondosa avilov et al 1998 janakiram et al 2015 hossain et al 2020 this species has a promising potential for the pharmaceutical industry as well body wall tentacles muscles eggs and coelomocytes of c frondosa were found to have antibacterial anticoagulant antiaging and anti hyperglycemic properties haug et al 2002 whereas the anti oxidant and anti fatigue activity was registered for the gonads respiratory structures and digestive tract mamelona et al 2007 zhong et al 2007 metabolites of c frondosa were reported as anti cancer and anti inflammatory agents bruckner 2005 janakiram et al 2015 aquaculture experimental studies an experimental study was conducted by specialists from mmbi to analyze the feeding behavior of c frondosa a total of 12 sea cucumbers weight range 20 250 g were collected in the wild juveniles were harvested from laminaria kelps in a subtidal zone while adult animals were captured by trawls at 80 90 m depth in the sem ostrovov area 68 47 11 n 37 25 37 e the sea cucumbers were held in aquariums each aquarium was supplied with seawater at a rate of 1 200 1 400 ml min 1 the acclimation period lasted for 2 weeks feeding intensity was estimated as the total number of animals that fed simultaneously this index was found to be closely associated with variations of water temperature during the tidal cycle an increase in water temperature led to a decrease in feeding intensity since there were no salinity fluctuations in this experiment the pattern observed was more likely associated with a reaction of cucumaria on a decreased water density gudimova 1998a experiments by singh et al 1999 showed that the rate of tentacle insertions increases with increasing seston chloropigment concentration but decreases with increasing current speed canadian authors found that cucumaria can capture relatively large food items such as fish eggs diameter 1 500 m that make this food source a promising candidate for aquaculture of northern sea cucumbers gianasi et al 2017 a number of observations were undertaken to reveal growth patterns in tagged juvenile sea cucumbers weight 3 03 90 43 g reared in the same conditions as described above a one year study showed that some animals demonstrated zero or even negative growth of their weight while other animals had as high growth rates as 80 140 gudimova 1998a these results indicated high individual variability in growth rates of cucumaria at different seasons in addition environmental conditions such as water temperature current velocity light regime and food availability could affect growth in c frondosa gudimova 1998a 1999 for comparison in the st lawrence estuary the average growth rate of reared cucumaria was 2 mm per month with the fastest monthly growth of 5 6 mm occurring in the spring summer period from may to june hamel and mercier 1996 recent canadian studies have shown that adult cucumaria are not photosensitive and they do not exhibit any preference for either illuminated or shaded areas sun et al 2020 perspectives taking into account short metamorphosis and relatively high survival rate of larvae as well as the slow growth rate and low mobility of c frondosa the most appropriate cultivation method for this species in the barents sea is accepted to be a combination of larval culture and sea ranching of juvenile and adult sea cucumbers gudimova 1998a the process of artificial reproduction of juvenile seed stock includes broodstock collection and maintenance spawning larval development and nursery of juveniles figure 2 the method for cultivation of the japanese sea cucumber apostichopus japonicus developed by specialists from pacific research fisheries center tinro center vladivostok russia gavrilova 2005 gavrilova et al 2005 2006 gavrilova and kucherjavenko

sterilized with ultraviolet broodstock sea cucumbers are collected when individuals reach sexual maturity weight 300 350 g the females spawn after a period of acclimation to adapt to new conditions live phytoplankton have been found to be the most suitable spawning trigger for c frondosa whereas desiccation thermal shock potassium chloride and serotonin did not induce spawning in this species gianasi et al 2019 after spawning and fertilization the larvae proceed through the gastrula blastula vitellaria and pentactula stages in the rearing tank hamel and mercier 1996 the larvae are fed both artificial and natural diets the settled juveniles are held in a holding tank with artificial attachment substrates such as corrugated polyvinyl chloride plates the juveniles are fed with microalgae for 12 months the second stage of the cucumaria farming is sea ranching in bottom closures where juveniles with a body length of 3 mm are released and adults are harvested after reaching a commercial size gudimova 1998a alternatively the juveniles could be used in the stock enhancement of depleted natural populations yields of cucumaria from intensive ocean based systems could be increased considerably by using additional food items although natural seston microalgae diets and fish eggs could be consumed successfully by c frondosa nelson et al 2012 gianasi et al 2017 these items have low relevance for sea ranching due to seasonal fluctuations in their abundance in the case of the natural seston and high prices in the case of fish eggs and commercial shellfish diets more promising results have been recently reported by yu et al 2020 for the brown seaweeds ascophyllum nodosum and saccharina latissima both species are very common in the coastal barents sea malavenda et al 2017 and can be explored as diets for intensive aquaculture of cucumaria since environmental conditions at coastal sites of the kola peninsula are quite suitable for c frondosa dvoretsky and dvoretsky 2018b 2020a the area has a good potential for aquaculture of this sea cucumber and other echinoderms the development of extensive sea cucumber aquaculture is a great challenge for polar regions of russia because of environmental limitations low temperatures pronounced winter ice cover and slow growth rates of cucumaria for these reasons a significant investment must be made in this industry and the pay back period for this investment is as long as 15 20 years conclusion although c frondosa is a widely distributed and intensively studied sea cucumber of the world the commercial aquaculture of this species has not yet been developed in the barents sea cucumaria form two large stocks registered in the central and south eastern parts of the sea spawning period of c frondosa in is registered from february to may size at age data obtained from coastal sites of the kola peninsula showed very slow growth rate in c frondosa commercial sea cucumbers at a body length of 25 30 cm and wet weight of 300 350 g are 10 year old the life span of c frondosa lasts 22 years the total abundances of cucumaria are 150 000 t on spitsbergen bank and 215 000 t in the south eastern part of the sea a combination of larval culture in rearing tanks and sea ranching at coastal sites is the most appropriate cultivation method for this species in the barents sea russian scientists and businessmen are interested in developing the technologies for holoturian farming in the barents sea but substantial funding is required for this industry new investors such as large russian gas and oil companies need to be involved in the establishment of echinoderm aquaculture in the barents sea author contributions ad conceived the manuscript and wrote the manuscript vd drew the figures and reviewed the

will now turn the call over to bill bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer thank you paulenier good morning everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call before we begin i d like to acknowledge matt koeppen s departure from the company on june 30 matt and i worked very closely together over the last nine years and we had a very productive partnership on behalf of the two harbors team i d like to thank matt for his years of service to the company and we wish him good luck in his future endeavors as we announced a few weeks ago i have taken on the role of chief investment officer once again and i look forward to working with the investment team as well as the rest of the company to navigate through the complex market environment in front of us please turn to slide 3 at quarter end book value was 6 42 per share representing a negative 9 6 total economic quarterly return the second quarter performance is almost entirely the result of significantly wider spreads on high coupon rmbs the stubborn absence of prepayment burnout along with the introduction of government programs to help borrowers refinance both contributed to changing market expectations around prepayment speeds in these coupons the msr market was very active and we saw 125 billion upb in bulk deals come to market in the second quarter alone bringing the year to date volumes to approximately 180 billion which is roughly the volume that we might typically see for a full year we have been successful in deploying more capital in the msr space this quarter as we purchased 6 5 billion upb through bulk transactions and have commitments to add another 17 billion upb subsequent to quarter end additionally we settled on 16 4 billion upb in our flow sale program during the quarter core earnings were 0 19 per share however spread movements generally dominate the portfolio performance relative to core earnings and this quarter was no exception in the absence of spread movements and with more than one quarter in mind we believe the portfolio can support a dividend of 0 17 which the board declared for the second quarter post quarter end we issued approximately 256 million of common equity in a riskless nondilutive transaction by selling shares right at our book value besides being accretive to eps by virtue of the expense dilution alone we felt that it was advantageous to both current and new shareholders to be prepared to invest in our target assets when the opportunity to do so presents itself we expect that msr supply will be robust in the second half and we think that fed tapering and reduced bank buying will lead to wider not tighter rmbs spreads when that finally occurs either later this year or early next we have been disciplined in keeping our leverage low as mortgage spreads have hovered around all time tight levels this positioning has not cost us anything in terms of performance thus far and in fact has saved us from additional losses as every coupon has underperformed their hedges for the last two quarters as a result of our new equity and our liquidity positioning which mary will discuss further we have plenty of dry powder to invest at attractive levels please turn to slide 4 and i will briefly discuss the overall market environment the second quarter of 2021 was characterized by falling long term interest rates a flatter yield curve and despite continued buying of current coupon rmbs from the federal reserve and large money center banks wider mortgage spreads inflationary pressures have generally increased as the reopening of the economy has highlighted gaps in the supply chain and scarcity of workers especially in restaurants travel and the service sectors in general as an indication in mid july the cpi index printed at 5 4 which is the highest it s been in 13 years and is shown in figure 1 by the blue line compared to two years ago which removes the base effects from the pandemic overall cpi prices are still up a healthy 2 5 interestingly many market participants have pointed out that prices in the used car and truck sector shown by the gray line in the figure increased by more than 40 in the period and was responsible for a large part of the aggregate increase in cpi the fed and many economists have insisted that inflation spikes such as these are temporary although many other market participants aren t so sure at the june fed meeting the fed surprised the market by moving forward its median expectations for its first two rate hikes to late 2023 although the initial market reaction was for higher rates later interpretations focused on whether the fed in moving its median rate hike expectations had changed its reaction function and might choke off growth prematurely just as the economy is getting going some market participants have pointed to the delta variant of the covid virus as being a risk to forward growth or whether future growth can keep up with the optimistic expectations that are already priced into the equity markets at the july meeting last week the fed confirmed that the labor market has shown significant improvements but chairman powell indicated that multiple strong jobs reports are required before commencing the tapering process chairman powell also clarified that while there is little support to start tapering rmbs before treasuries it could possibly reduce rmbs purchases at a faster monthly pace whether for the reasons i just described or simply because of positioning and other technical factors 10 year interest rates ended the quarter 35 basis points lower retracing a large portion of the increase which occurred during q1 while shorter term interest rates were largely unchanged despite the fact that the fed is now clearly talking about tapering spreads on current coupon rmbs were largely unchanged on the quarter and still sit at very tight levels with current coupon oas at minus 3 basis points as seen in figure 3 compared to other periods of quantitative easing in the past where the fed was buying mortgages these spreads are still at least 10 basis points rich to those periods and compared to periods where the fed was not actively buying mortgages spreads are about 30 basis points lower the fed has stated that they are committed to a tapering process which is orderly methodical and transparent and we have no reason to doubt the fed s intentions however the picture is further complicated by the large amount of rmbs that has been purchased by the banking sector which has been fueled by increased deposits and low loan growth with the news that all of the large banks considered passed their dodd frank act stress test it is likely that dividend increases and share buybacks may lessen bank appetite for low yielding rmbs indeed we have already seen signs of decreasing demand from banks as the recent h8 data shows that banks bought 100 billion of rmbs in the second quarter as compared to about 180 billion in the first in addition it appears that the second quarter was the first since 2019 where the supply of mortgages was higher than the combined demand from the banks and fed please turn to slide 5 within the backdrop of the transitioning macroeconomic environment there has been more policy activity in the gse market than there has been since the onset of the pandemic recent leadership appointments at the fhfa and the hud along with new programs such as refinow and refi possible illustrate a shift from the previous administration toward providing continued relief for distressed low income or credit impaired borrowers supporting affordable housing and increasing the credit box and the footprint of the gses to support the administration s housing goals on the other side of the ledger steps have been taken to finally remove some of the accommodation that was provided at the onset of the pandemic such as the foreclosure moratorium and for fha va and hud borrowers the ability to enter into forbearance arrangements deferral still remains the best option for borrowers to become current again on their loans as an msr owner we are committed to working diligently with our subservicing partners to do everything we can to help keep borrowers in their homes i will now turn it over to mary to walk you through a discussion of our financial results mary riskey chief financial officer thank you bill and good morning everyone please turn to slide 6 to review our financial results for the second quarter comprehensive income was negative 194 6 million representing an annualized return on average common equity of negative 40 7 and our book value was 6 42 per share compared to 7 29 at march 31 resulting in a total economic return of negative 9 6 as bill mentioned earlier the quarter over quarter decline was the result of significantly wider spreads on high coupon rmbs where we have significant exposure moving on to slide 7 core earnings were 0 19 per share compared to 0 17 in q1 interest income decreased from 56 1 million to 43 4 million as our rmbs position continued to decline through a combination of sales and paydowns interest expense rose by 1 7 million reflecting the increase in financing related to the growth in our msr portfolio as well as a full quarter of interest expense on our convertible debt issued in february gains on other derivatives rose by 7 7 million as we benefited from a larger position in tba as well as increased roll specialness turning to msr net servicing income increased by 3 6 million to 47 4 million this was a result of higher balances slower speeds and fewer delinquencies there was also a notable decrease in expense the majority of which is related to servicing expenses and driven by a number of opposing onetime items with the first quarter incurring certain nonrecurring costs and second quarter including certain nonrecurring credits an average of the two quarters expense is a better indication of the run rate for the first half of the year in the table on the lower right we show our portfolio yields our realized net spread in the quarter rose by 28 basis points to 1 93 driven by a 47 basis point increase in our portfolio yield which more than offset a 19 basis point increase in funding costs this net increase was driven primarily by improved msr asset yields offset by increased msr financing which carries a higher borrowing rate net spread as of june 30 which reflects our estimates for the near term is expected to increase modestly due to a higher proportion of msr in the portfolio and slightly higher rmbs yields turning to slide 8 our liquidity and capital positions continue to be strong post quarter end we issued 40 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 256 million which when combined with excess cash on hand positions us to invest in msr and an rmbs when spreads widen out to more attractive levels our unrestricted cash balance totaled 1 3 billion at quarter end funding for agency rmbs due to repo market remains attractive as expected financing for msr through bilateral facilities has increased as we buy more msr assets as well as diversify and optimize our financing facilities given minimum use requirements finally leverage remained relatively unchanged from the prior quarter with both the average and quarter end economic debt to equity at 6 5 times i will now turn the call back to bill for a market overview and portfolio update bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer thank you mary let s turn to slide 9 to discuss our quarterly portfolio activity and composition we have remained disciplined in our positioning ahead of anticipated rmbs tapering and reduction in bank buying the portfolio balance decreased from 18 6 billion to 17 1 billion through a combination of sales and runoff in particular we sold some 2 5 and 3 coupon pools and bought 2 5 coupon tbas as we felt the pools were unattractive from a spread perspective while the roll specialness of the tba still allowed for positive return potential our msr value was down slightly even though we added more upb than prepaid which simply reflects lower prices into a lower interest rate environment please turn to slide 10 as we discuss our specified pool positioning prepayments and performance as you can see in figure 1 we remain positioned in loan balance and geography stories within the geography stories which are focused on new york collateral our investments are predominantly in the 4 and 4 5 coupons while our loan balance exposures are more evenly distributed in the 3 through 4 5 coupons figure 2 shows the quarterly total return performance by coupon on tba contracts shown by the gray bars and on our specified pool holdings shown by the blue bars the most notable properties of this chart are first the higher the coupon the worse the quarterly performance and second only the 2 5 coupon assets were spared from material underperformance which was clearly the result of fed and bank support to the coupon finally figure 3 shows a comparison by coupon of observed prepayment speeds from pools delivered into tba contracts again shown by gray bars to observe prepayment speeds on our specified portfolio again shown by blue bars overall prepayment speeds in our specified pools remain significantly slower than pools delivered into tba showing the value of the prepayment characteristics of that collateral we also show a comparison of this quarter s prepayment rates to last quarters which you can see by looking at the diamonds above each bar here you can clearly see the impact of the first quarter s rising rates had on prepayment speeds for at the money current coupon mortgages as speeds on 2 5 coupon tba slowed from 20 cpr to about eight cpr however it is also evident from this chart that prepayment speeds on the higher coupons both in tba as well in specified pools have not materially declined despite the sharply higher interest rates in the first quarter whatever the reason for this persistence of fast prepayments in the high coupon sector whether due to the introduction of the new government programs that i mentioned earlier or due to something else the market seems to have adjusted its forward looking expectations for prepayment rates and extrapolated continued fast speeds far into the future which was surely at least one of the causes behind the performance seen in figure 2 while there is no doubt that high coupon speeds have been fast we do not believe that long standing behaviors of mortgage borrowers have suddenly changed and we do expect burnout to manifest itself in the high coupons at some points indeed in the most recent prepayment reports we have started to see early signs of burnout as high coupon speeds slow more than day counts already some market participants are beginning to wonder whether the adjusted expectations have gone too far and have reduced their forecast on a high coupon somewhat despite the underperformance of the high coupon sector we are still comfortable with our exposure especially given the widening experienced this quarter high coupon specified pools have a long history of being attractive providing stable prepayment profiles along with generally wider spreads which has made them good assets from which to extract high risk adjusted returns and we do not see any reason to change that view moving to slide 11 you can see in figure 1 that our msr portfolio was valued at 2 0 billion as of june 30 based on almost 191 billion upb and with a gross coupon of 3 5 that translates into a price of about 1 06 on or right around a 4 0 multiple given the modest amounts of excess above the base servicing fee the percentage of msr in forbearance continued to decline throughout the quarter ending at 2 2 by loan count we settled on 16 4 billion upb of msr through our flow program during the quarter and 6 5 billion in bulk purchases which together was more than enough to offset runoff in the period and grow the upb by 3 6 billion in figure 2 we show our settled upb for the flow and bulk channels for the last four quarters as expected the flow channel settlements have declined since the fourth quarter in parallel with the lower refinancing activity bulk settlements are more opportunistic in nature and therefore less predictable nevertheless we have committed to purchasing 25 billion upb through the bulk channel year to date for reasons we have discussed previously we expect the bulk volumes in the second half of the year to also be robust despite the recent retracement in interest rates during the second quarter msr values have appreciated meaningfully since 2020 and we expect that small to medium sized servicers will be incentivized to reduce mark to market volatility in their balance sheets and monetize their holdings so while it is difficult to predict our activity and success in the bulk market we are confident that market dynamics will be favorable and allow us to continue to grow our portfolio in figure 3 we compare our servicing prepayment speeds in blue bars versus tba collateral in gray bars this is a similar chart to the chart on the previous page and shows that our msr prepayment speeds are slower than tba because of its collateral characteristics moving to the charts on the top of slide 12 we show the combined exposures of agency p i bonds msr and io as of june 30 as compared to our positioning at the end of the first quarter as indicated by the black diamonds given the performance this quarter i think some additional words about this page are in order to help describe our portfolio figure 1a in the top left shows the bond equivalent value of our securities and tba positions and you can see that we have holdings in bonds ranging from 2 5 through 5 coupons which in very round numbers are equally distributed we have discussed many times about the characteristics of msr but let s quickly review msr being an interest only instrument whose value rises when rates rise and falls when rates fall has negative interest rate duration which offsets the exposure of rmbs securities furthermore when primary mortgage rates rise future prepayments are expected to slow which makes interest only instruments more valuable and so msr prices rise in that case too in contrast in that scenario the prices of current coupon rmbs securities will fall as prices and yields move inversely to each other this behavior msr values rising when rates rise and when current coupon spreads widen looks smells and acts like a short position in current coupon rmbs securities and it is useful to think of msr in this way figure 1b shows the duration and spread risk equivalent of our msr expressed in current coupon short positions comparing the gray bars to the black diamonds the effective short position of the msr asset shifted down in coupon and is now represented by a combination of 2 and 2 5 exposures figure 1c shows the two charts on the left added together and represents our combined position as regular listeners know we often speak about how our portfolio to mortgage spreads is low and that is shown in figure 2 where we indicate that our portfolio could be expected to lose 1 1 in a 25 basis point spread widening but the important thing to remember is that that reflects a 25 basis point widening across the coupon stack including the current coupon spreads where the msr offset the effective short position is manifest the msr does not provide any spread hedge benefit if only noncurrent coupons experience material spread widening as happened during this quarter on net we are pretty flat to the current coupon complex as defined by the sum of 2 and 2 5 exposures with a bias for 2 5s over 2s and long the rest of the stack moving to slide 13 here we see our interest rate and curve exposures both are low and in line with our historical positioning i would call out again that the agency plus msr strategy provides significant interest rate offsets which you can see by comparing the dark gray bars to the blue bars in both figure 1 and figure 2 given the rate rally during the second quarter and the continued 25 basis point rally into july you may be looking at the left hand side of these charts for the first time in quite a while although the end of quarter positions indicate that we would lose 1 8 in book value for an instantaneous 25 basis point parallel shift downward in rates and 2 2 for a bull flattening of 25 basis points it is important to note that these numbers reflect a snapshot in time and we can and do actively hedge our portfolio as market conditions change in particular although we think that a less than 2 move for an instantaneous 25 basis point change in rates is not very big very early in the quarter we reduced this exposure even further finally i d like to discuss our outlook for two harbors and our return expectations for new investments on slide 14 this quarter we split out the expected returns for investments in current coupons and high coupon assets as we see significantly different return profiles for the two we also added some shading to show last quarter s returns even with the market s faster prepayment expectations we now see the long term return potential of higher coupons hedged with swaps to be in line with our investment goals in the high single to low double digits which is a significant increase from the mid single digit returns that we saw in these securities last quarter and as i mentioned earlier we feel that there is potential further upside to these returns in the case that burnout becomes manifest current coupon spreads widen as the fed and banks retreat over time or any other reason that prepayment speeds and expectations moderate current coupon specified pools hedged with swaps however still do not offer enough return and pose significant widening risk as a stand alone investment with tba still rolling special near term returns can remain reasonably attractive in the absence of spread widening with expected returns in the high single to low double digits to be clear the higher end of that range assumes roll specialists last forever and the lower end of that range assumes a quick reversion to normal implied funding levels and relies on today s historically tight spread levels for its return when msr is paired with specified pools the combined expected return ranges from mid single digits to mid teens depending on whether current coupon specified pools or high coupon specified pools are used in the paired construction and depending on a range of expected returns of msr finally when current coupon tba is paired with msr the range of expected returns is narrower than for msr hedge with pools and again depends on how long roll specialists last as well as the range of expected returns of msr and as long tba is expressed in current coupons then the exposure to spread risk will be very low we are excited about our investment opportunities in the paired agency plus msr construction and we are focused on deploying capital there as i mentioned previously we expect there to be attractive opportunities to deploy more capital in both msr and rmbs in the second half of the year msr supply should be ample as market participants look to monetize their msr holdings and we have a platform in place to acquire service and oversee significant new purchases rmbs spreads are tight still but they won t be this tight forever with the fed talking about tapering and the banks already beginning to at least moderate their purchases we expect spreads to widen maybe gradually maybe sharply but we are ready and able to participate in any such attractive investing opportunities when that occurs thank you very much for joining us today and we ll now be happy to take any questions you might have questions answers operator at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session our first question is from doug harter with credit suisse please proceed with your question doug harter credit suisse analyst thanks bill just i was wondering if you could just talk about your thoughts around longer term portfolio construction and kind of whether a quarter or two quarters like you just saw where you had significant divergence in coupon performance kind of makes you rethink about kind of how you would want to structure that coupon distribution with msrs and the pools and whether you d want more of a balance there bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer sure good morning doug thanks very much for the question so as we show on slide 12 the amount of msr that we currently hold hedges a certain amount of mortgages of current coupon mortgages right and so as we as you see from the chart and as we said in the prepared remarks we re generally net flat the current coupons if you look at 2s and 2 5s and we have some relative value thoughts around liking 2 5s more than 2s there which is why you see that positioning and then we have more capital and so we have to deploy that somewhere right and we have chosen to deploy that in the higher coupon specified pools for reasons we discussed as i said in my prepared remarks the high coupon specified have a long history of generally having wider spreads and having stable prepayment profiles which makes it easier to extract spreads from those investments now if i understand your question you re wondering well maybe we should have that amount of capital deployed instead to lower coupons and of course we thought about that during the quarter or before and we chose not to do that mostly because we felt that there was significant widening risk from the fed tapering in the low coupons now it s true right all spreads were tight in the quarter and i guess if you say what we were surprised by we were surprised that high coupons widened without low coupons widening right if everything had widened in parallel the performance would have been different and so going forward we think that it is much more likely for the low coupons to widen without necessarily the high coupons sharing in that going forward certainly more likely than it is than the high coupons continue to widen and the low coupons do nothing so we like our positioning here and we think the high coupons offer a fair amount of value doug harter credit suisse analyst great thank you for that color bill operator and our next question is from bose george with b riley fbr please proceed with your question bose george b riley fbr analyst hey this is bose actually i guess from kbw actually first in terms of the capital that you guys raised can you talk about just the deployment is that sort of the timeline for that or is that going to be based on spread widening and what you see out there bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yes good morning bose thanks for the question it s going to be a combination we have been deploying some amount of that capital into our target assets already in terms of msr and low coupon tbas we ve not deployed it all as we ve discussed previously and in the prepared remarks we expect better opportunities to invest in rmbs in the near term and in the pair construction that s still attractive so we are deploying our capital there where we can bose george b riley fbr analyst ok great thanks and then actually in terms of the msr as a percentage of the portfolio can you just remind us is there just kind of a level where it could go to as you keep deploying capital there bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yes we don t have a set limit in mind we manage the portfolio to a set of risks both drawdown risk and spread movement risk as well as liquidity risks and so forth so we don t have a firm number in mind but we feel that we can grow that portfolio substantially in the near term if opportunity presents itself bose george b riley fbr analyst ok great thanks ok just one more quick one can you give us an update on book value quarter to date bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yes sure book value is up slightly this quarter so far through the end of july we re up around 0 5 bose george b riley fbr analyst ok great thanks operator and our next question is from rick shane with j p morgan please proceed with your question rick shane j p morgan analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions this morning most have been asked and answered but i do want to talk about what we re seeing in the primary markets and how you think the competitive dynamics there are impacting prepayments you ve talked about some expectation of burnout on the higher coupon pools but given the intense competition for volume and the fights overspread by the originators why won t that persist as long as rates remain low and the refi activity opportunity remains attractive bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yes good morning rick thanks for the question well such a long question and there s lots of moving pieces there as you know certainly i think in the lower coupons and the at the money coupons speeds are expected to be fast and obviously depending on interest rates and if rates were to push lower still i think we would expect to see speeds there pick up one thing that s interesting though is what people call the restriking of the mortgage universe right which is that mortgage rates here to the borrowers i d say two and three quarters two and seven eighths something like that i read one thing this week that said that the percentage of mortgage borrowers who have a 25 basis point incentive fee is right now around 61 of agency borrowers the last time rates were here in january with that same mortgage rate 74 of borrowers were had 25 basis points or more of incentive in the money and so that s just reflective of the fact that lots of people have refinanced already right and there s fewer people that have incentive at this rate level and so in order to get the same refinancing response rates actually have to push a little bit lower in terms of higher coupons and so forth look the concept of burnout has been true for generations of mortgage borrowers and investors and simply reflects the fact that after investors after borrowers have had many opportunities to refinance at lower rates the people who remain who haven t are less likely to do so when they see it for the third time or the fourth time or the fifth time right and despite the competition and despite government programs just people are less reactive there and we expect that to remain sure at some point and as i said we re starting to see that in the july release of prepayments we re seeing it in our own servicing portfolio where we re able to track daily prepayments there s obviously a prepayment report released tonight and black knight data has is projecting that those prepayment speeds on high coupons will decline more than day count again and so i think that s just the behavior of the way mortgage borrowers are rick shane j p morgan analyst got it ok and very helpful thank you bill bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer you re welcome operator and our next question is from kenneth lee with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my question i m wondering if you could just share with us your current expectations for how long dollar roll specialists could be expected to last thanks bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer thanks kenneth good morning and thanks for being with us i think that dollar roll specialness is intimately tied to the fed and the bank buying so i think that once you see those things moderate or start to retreat i think you ll see roll specialists start to come off as well kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst got you very helpful and then just one follow up if i may just broadly speaking in terms of your hedging profile or positioning is there anything special that s being done ahead of the potential fed tapering and some scenarios being hedged specifically thanks bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yes well you know we think that tapering or reduced buying does not have to be coincident with the change in interest rates and so there s not much rate hedging or portfolio hedging to do but our very positioning of being short 2s and generally flat the current coupon complex is by its construction a hedge a portfolio hedge to that tapering process and so when i think about what the risks in the portfolio are one of the things that s not a risk for our portfolio is fed tapering kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst gotcha very helpful thanks again bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer thank you operator and our next question is from trevor cranston with jmp securities please proceed with your question trevor cranston jmp securities analyst all right thanks good morning a follow up on the question about your positioning within the coupon stack and being sort of neutral 2s and 2 5s and continuing to be along the high coupons i was curious when you think about the risks to the portfolio and that positioning what kind of scenarios could you foresee that would actually cause high coupons to continue underperforming after what we ve already seen in the second quarter would that be sort of related to policy risks around making refis easier or are there other things that you can foresee causing high coupons to continue to underperform thanks bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yes thanks for that question yes it would be something like that i mean many people have talked this quarter about whether the underperformance in high coupons has been a constant spread event and only changing prepayment expectations or not a change in expectations and only a spread widening event you know we sort of come down in the middle of that and we think that even with increased prepayment expectations in those high coupons that these expected returns on those assets are attractive and consistent with our goals as we show on page 14 right and so we think that you would have to see prepayment expectations increase even from here which i think has been done quite a lot and so i view that as unlikely and all these government programs and increased policy risk has really been incorporated into the prices already so it s hard for me to see how that would happen more and again i think there s a bigger risk to prices and spreads in the lower coupons and so as i said you know to the extent that we were surprised by something it was that the high coupons widened and lower coupons didn t but that happened differentially and now i think the risk is inverted to the other way and i think high coupons look more attractive than low coupons for the opposite reason trevor cranston jmp securities analyst ok that makes sense and i was curious you know when we listened to some of the earnings calls from the originators it sounds like a lot of them are focusing much more intently on trying to increased cash out refi so i was curious you know do you think increased focus there could be significant enough to prevent burnout and slow down or is that something that s likely to be a much more marginal and not that significant bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yes i mean it could be it s hard to know you know i think mortgage originators always like cash out refis because the balances are bigger and if they make you know a point or whatever or two points on every loan they like the bigger balances and so you know we do live in a period where there s been significant hpa and it s not surprising that the originators want to do that so i think that s part of the overall refinancing machine that is in people s prepayment expectations already i mean it could be significant but i think it s in people s expectations trevor cranston jmp securities analyst ok got it and then last thing apologies if you already addressed this i got on the call a little bit late but the increase in the portfolio yield during the second quarter could you just talk through what drove the jump there thanks bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yes i ll let mary take that one please mary riskey chief financial officer sure so the increase in yield came primarily from an increase in msr yields trevor cranston jmp securities analyst ok got it mary riskey chief financial officer the bulk of it trevor cranston jmp securities analyst yes ok that makes sense thank you operator and our next question is from eric hagen with btig please proceed with your question eric hagen btig analyst hey thanks good morning one follow up on the 17 5 billion in bulk since quarter end was that a single package or was it multiple packages and can you talk about how you expect to finance it like how much of the excess capacity for refinancing lines are being used to acquire those that package or packages bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yes i ll let mary take that one too mary riskey chief financial officer yes it s multiple packages and then i m sorry the second part of your question was relating to financing eric hagen btig analyst yes how much of the excess capacity from your financing lines is being used to acquire those packages mary riskey chief financial officer well i would just say that we will continue to increase the usage of the msr financing going forward as the portfolio grows we have plenty of capacity on our facilities and we ll use that to optimize the financing on that asset eric hagen btig analyst ok i guess what i m getting at is like what is the pro forma leverage i mean that s a big package of bulk what is the pro forma leverage for taking that onto your balance sheet considering the equity raise in july as well mary riskey chief financial officer well we typically the advance rates on msr s around 70 and we will optimize usage of the facilities given the use requirements and that compared with our excess cash on hand to determine the right amount of drawdown on those facilities eric hagen btig analyst ok thank you operator and we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i ll now turn the call over to william greenberg for closing remarks bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer well thank you very much for everyone for joining us today and thank you as always for your interest in two harbors have a good day operator duration 47 minutes

an aerial view of nairobi city from ngara when the british naturalist charles darwin came up with the theory of survival for the fittest on the origin of species no one knew it would aptly describe kenya s capital city in nairobi the affluent live large the middle class survive while the downtrodden merely exist in the hope that the next sunrise will bring better fortunes while living in the capital city was already a hassle the coronavirus pandemic made the situation even worse for residents job losses and covid 19 restrictions in the city put a strain on locals who were holding on to the last straws hoping for a change with the rate of inflation remaining relatively high recent reports show a two kilogramme pack of maize flour has risen above sh100 bread has gone up between sh5 and sh8 not forgetting the increase in the cost of milk fuel and electricity among other necessities prices for super petrol diesel and kerosene hit new highs last month retailing at sh127 sh107 and sh97 respectively this compares to january s sh106 99 petrol sh96 40 for diesel and sh87 12 for kerosene in nairobi the most recent report on consumer price indices and inflation rates by the kenya national bureau of statistics knbs backs the jump the housing water electricity gas and other fuels index increased by 0 59 per cent between february 2021 and march 2021 mainly attributed to the increase in prices of kerosene and electricity the transport index on the other hand also increased mainly due to a rise in the price of diesel prof xn iraki an economist from the university of nairobi says it is human nature to look for alternatives during tough times only that this time the majority have been affected these small medium enterprises smes were there before covid 19 we just had to downgrade ourselves to their level the flexibility with small scale economies in terms of location and pricing made them attractive he said but living to the city s mantra nairobi residents have found ways to make their stay in the city bearable iraki avers that this is not peculiar to kenya in informal economies this is common in developed nations the government is the fallback position in the us families got cheques from the government to help them survive the pandemic he said while the pandemic could be with us for some time governments across the world have come up with policies to help reboot their economies in kenya with the end of the pandemic not in sight economic experts advise small enterprises that had stepped in during the pandemic to capitalise on the opportunity to grow and maintain their customers post the pandemic the smes could expand and ride on that experience after recovery of the economy hence maintaining their new customers alternatively it is possible to see individuals who will get used to the survival mode as a method of saving said iraki here are a few markets that power the lives of nairobians as well as serve regional economies korogocho market located 11 kilometres northeast of the nairobi city centre the market specialises in selling fresh food and produce as well as new and second hand clothes it operates daily with no official hours albeit disorganised in terms of the arrangements but people trade within the constraints of this disorderliness but the market is famous for its vegetables and fruits that are sold cheaply serving the bulk of nairobi residents living in eastlands a close check from your mama mboga in the eastlands neighbourhood will trace the groceries back to this market that barely sits in a two acre piece of land here prices of tomatoes especially wholesale are sold at thrown away prices and mama mbogas retail them at cheap prices making nairobi city life bearable i cannot go and buy my groceries from supermarkets they are quite expensive unlike kwa mama mboga where i have room to bargain and it is cheaper said lynet awino a resident of umoja two the vegetables sold in this market come from the central kenya region while a few are said to be planted on sewer lines but what is certain is that this market makes nairobians life a bit easier eastleigh dubbed the little mogadishu or kenya s dubai this business hub is the number one spot for bargain hunters in the nairobi area here billions of shillings exchange hands daily eastleigh also has over 20 banks arguably kenya s beaming business hub thousands of people flock east of nairobi in the kamukunji constituency to buy products at relatively cheap prices while the area is known for its cheap newly imported clothes from china turkey and the middle east the business hub is slowly gaining traction for its relatively affordable food products with wholesales shops lined along the street on your way to california traders queue to find the best deal in food items that are largely sold at wholesale price i buy local rice here 25kgs at sh1 400 this will take me three months and saves me money and time i stopped buying foodstuff in retail in the supermarkets the wholesale is worth your money said nahashon wafula a city resident nairobians have capitalised on godowns that stock foodstuff in this area that act as chain distributors in the city foodstuff particularly wheat flour maize flour rice spaghetti and cooking oil are the most sought after for people who want to survive the economic meltdown of the city traders and hawkers at gikomba market continue with their daily normal business amid the covid 19 pandemic gikomba though imports have gone down owing to covid 19 according to data from the kenya national bureau of statistics these numbers represent kenya s biggest open air market in the kamukunji constituency gikomba arguably each wardrobe in kenya has pieces of merchandise from this market and no one knows its importance more than the common nairobi man i buy clothes from gikomba but sell them here in the cbd my target is office people who will not find time to rush to the crowdy market i sell the clothes to them cheaper compared to new clothes in the shop said anne wamaitha second hands clothes seller in nairobi cbd nairobi s new parents appreciate the market too newborn babies clothes are expensive but with the retail market parents can comfortably dress their kids from as low as sh30 a piece food stall vibanda the meal sold in shanty stalls vibandas is the allure of fresh food and affordability that has made it the most sought after dish during lunch hours according to nairobi county there are over 1 500 licensed eating places in the city 80 per cent of these being fast food joints and the number is not about to reduce with a bulging middle class and supporting other fringe industries the hot meals on wheels are not going anywhere any time soon but what has given birth to these businesses is the economic tough times that strangles the city on a daily nairobians must balance between transport money and a plate of lunch in the unforgiving tough street of kenya s capital the vibanda not only provides an affordable alternative to meals from high end hotels in the town but also gives a fresh taste just like at home i spend sh100 on lunch here in town because i eat in a kibanda if i try to go into the city s hotel the best i can get with my budget is a glass of tea said david omwoyo

the maine organic farmers and gardeners association which is celebrating its 50th birthday this week is best known for cultivating interest in locally grown organic food over the years some observers have also noticed its long standing vegetarian friendliness especially at the common ground country fair in 2012 for instance in a story about the fair the new york times mentioned the vegetarian crowd in the second sentence but mofga is not now nor has it ever been a vegetarian organization true as the state s organic certification agent mofga in 2020 certified 564 vegetable farms and plant based producers but it also certified 118 livestock and dairy farms and it trains farmers how to butcher chickens and pigs and similar tasks so why is the common ground fair the most vegetarian and vegan friendly agricultural fair in maine and likely new england too why does the mofga newspaper feature so many plant based recipes and underlying both questions how did mofga come to be linked with a welcoming attitude toward plant based eaters to sleuth out the origins of this baked in veg friendliness i ve read historical documents and connected with people who helped shape mofga the picture that emerges reveals a magic sauce of 1970s environmental concerns mixed with traditional maine thriftiness amplified by the number of vegetarians among the organization s founders and enriched by overflowing vegetable gardens the result is mofga s lasting vegetarian flavor early veg influencers advertisement by the 1970s helen and scott nearing were celebrity radicals two of the country s leading homesteaders and vocal vegetarians they were also key early influencers of mofga both nearings spoke at the 1971 thomas point beach gathering in brunswick that led to the formation of mofga four months later the nearings farm in harborside is listed in the first directory of 24 certified maine organic farms published in august 1972 by the fledgling organization mofga s story must begin with helen and scott nearing whose 1954 book living the good life about their homesteading experiences in vermont impelled so many people to seek the rural life gardening expert barbara damrosch wrote in the forward to fertile ground celebrating 40 years of mofga published in 2011 damrosch lives on land that her husband nationally known organic farmer eliot coleman purchased from the nearings vegetarianism was central to the nearings good life ethic abbie mcmillen an early mofga organizer and the newspaper s first editor told me the nearings played a significant role not only in shaping the young organization but in cultivating its vegetarian leanings they were notoriously hospitable with their monday night gatherings remembered mcmillen who lives a quarter mile from the nearings the

largely ceased to use dairy products and have allied ourselves with the vegans while they never became full vegans the nearings were friends with jay and freya dinshah the founders of the american vegan society with whom they collaborated to bring the world vegetarian congress to maine in 1975 the nearings criticized holding animals in bondage as they phrased it in living the good life and helen in particular offended some nonvegetarians with her blunt assessments of their meals advertisement in 1980 helen elaborated on the couple s evolving vegetarian diet in her heavily vegan cookbook simple food for the good life scott and i as vegetarians have lessened our dependence on animal products she wrote we drink no milk eat no eggs except what may come in dishes served away from home wear no animal skins or coats of leather and try to get nonleather shoes and belts we are not purists nor entirely consistent in our avoidance of harm to animals we both eat honey stolen from the bees during the couple s lifetimes and after the nearing homestead attracted thousands of visitors the vegetarian leanings of these good life pilgrims some of whom eventually settled in maine was documented by journalist jean hay bright in her 2003 memoir meanwhile next door to the good life the book chronicles bright s years living on a wooded lot she bought from the nearings in a neighborhood that included the colemans and other back to the landers bright quotes from a 1973 letter she wrote to her mother advising she warn visiting cousins about the crowd that the nearings draw long hair hippie types mostly vegetarians some into yoga weird clothes coleman and his first wife sue coleman were vegetarians in those days as was mofga s first executive director chaitanya york according to tim nason who began editing the organization s newspaper in 1973 and was himself a vegetarian for several years when rosey guest first connected with mofga in 1978 as an apprentice at horsepower farm in penobscot she was also a vegetarian for many years guest helped coordinate mofga s apprentice program today she and her husband run the solar powered bluebird hill farm in jefferson it was the decade of the first earth day guest said of the 1970s we learned about our meat coming from cafos concentrated animal feeding operations all of this new information was causing activism and turning us into vegetarians guest said vegetarianism was common among the people interested in organic farming not only during the 1970s but throughout the 1980s and 1990s too during those decades many of the applicants for spots in mofga s on farm apprenticeship program were vegetarian according to guest a fact that could make placements difficult on some animal based farms mofga s match materials for the apprenticeship program still reflects this reality the form each farm completes to create a profile of itself prompts farmers to discuss room and board arrangements such as whether they are a vegetarian household or can provide vegetarian meals guest said the high percentage of vegetarian applicants shifted after 2005 when farming became cool and popular and was no longer the sole domain of the black sheep of the family advertisement vegetable food in february 1972 susan ferriss was elected treasurer at mofga s first annual meeting but more people probably know her as the writer of organic cookery a column in mofga s early newspapers in the june 1972 newspaper ferriss tackles the subject of meat free cooking revealing my family has been vegetarians for about a year and sharing recipes for cottage cheese spinach casserole walnut balls turkish ratatouille golden cheese bake lentil roast and a cheesy pesto called green sauce her column set an early precedent that subsequent columnists continued highlighting vegetable centric vegetarian dishes the newspaper s food columnist from 1974 to 1982 was barbara mather who wrote under the title spoons and spiders mather s recipes were vegetable based and largely vegetarian although she wasn t a vegetarian herself this tradition of vegetarian friendly food columns continues with the newspaper s longest running column harvest kitchen by roberta bailey bailey is a seed farmer with her husband at seven tree farm in vassalboro in 1984 when she started the column bailey said she d recently learned that the macrobiotic diet is about eating locally and with the seasons and that really struck a chord with me bailey herself a vegetarian for a short time decided to emphasize eating seasonal vegetables including in the winter when root cellars freezers and these days high tunnels extend locally grown vegetables through the winter i gravitate more toward vegetarian meals and recipes because anybody can add meat or protein to any meal as a side bailey told me recently by phone as she picked peas in her garden but i think there is a huge creativity in and a lot of need for good vegetarian recipes and information advertisement in the summer 2021 mofga newspaper for instance bailey shared recipes for hummus tabouli blueberry smoothies and cream of broccoli soup all vegan each recipe originated at the all vegan better hummus and gardens booth she co ran at the common ground fair from 1981 87 vegetarian food booths have been part of the fair since its start in 1977 when portland vegetarian restaurant hungry hunza was among the vendors heirloom apple expert john bunker ran a sprout salad and green smoothie food booth at the fair from 1978 81 likewise the tradition of vegetarian food at mofga potlucks grew from early roots in 1972 mort and barbara mather who farm easter orchard farm in wells attended the first meeting of the york county chapter of mofga mort mather said the chapter meetings soon became potluck suppers where everyone would bring something made from their gardens the only time i remember it didn t work out so well was one august when most of the food that came was platters of tomatoes recalled mather a former mofga president all the chapter members grew organic vegetables mather said and had plenty to spare however those like him who were raising animals for meat had a limited supply nobody was going to buy meat for these things mather said reflecting a frugality that was a product of both the era and maine values as a result probably 90 percent of the dishes were vegetarian he said bailey had a similar experience at the early potlucks for the tri county mofga chapter washington aroostook and penobscot counties often held after on farm work parties or meetings to place the group fedco seed order most often the meals were vegetarian bailey said because some of the people were vegetarian so it was the simplest way so everybody could partake mcmillen also a vegetarian for a short time in the 1970s recalled that serving vegetable based dishes at early potlucks made it simpler to maintain food safety when there is a long travel time between cooking and eating and refrigeration may not be available she and others also found trying out new vegetarian recipes interesting and fun advertisement veganic farming expert will bonsall of industry writes in mofga s summer 2021 newspaper that the organization stands out from similar groups across the country because mofga is more of an alternative group than a traditional trade association in addition to the traction it gains from its alternative edge bonsall who directs the scatterseed project attributes mofga s growing influence to its collaborative approach and the general seeking of common ground for the past 50 years that common ground has translated into thrifty creative plant based meals when the mofga community meets around a table avery yale kamila is a food writer who lives in portland

remarks that management may make during today s call about american superconductor s future expectations including expectations regarding the second quarter of fiscal 2021 financial performance plans and prospects constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements as a result of various important factors including those set forth in the risk factors section of american superconductor s annual report on form 10 k for the year ended march 31 2021 which the company filed with the securities and exchange commission on june 2 2021 and the company s subsequent reports filed with the sec 10 stocks we like better

executive officer thanks john and good morning everyone i ll begin today by providing an update on our grid and wind business units john kosiba will then provide a detailed review of our financial results for the first fiscal quarter which ended june 30 2021 and provide guidance for the second fiscal quarter which will end september 30 2021 following our comments we ll open up the line to questions from our analysts at the top i just want to say i m very excited about the progress we ve been making on the reg installation in chicago both teams have been working very well together and i hope that we ll be able to update you soon we are growing and diversifying our business our grid segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 grew by more than 30 versus the year ago period and accounted for over 90 of amsc revenue in fact this was the largest grid quarter we have had ever since the start of this fiscal year we have been building momentum while further strengthening our backlog and extending our grid visibility well into fiscal 2021 and also a glimpse into fiscal 2022 this certainly is a very different and stronger business than it even was a few years ago our grid business was driven by strong new energy power system shipments as well as higher ship protection system revenues total revenue for the entire business grew by nearly 20 versus the year ago period in fact our first quarter revenue of approximately 25 million was our highest quarterly revenue in some time just so people understand the numbers a bit better and the impact of neeltran remember we said that we expected that neeltran would be accretive to earnings per share within 12 months from closing not right away neeltran delivered revenues of about 5 million during the first quarter this did come in line with our expectations the operating cash flow number came in line with how we would anticipate that the business would typically operate in revenues of about 20 million per quarter when john goes through the numbers he will highlight this and as you look at the guidance for next quarter please keep this in mind we have integrated nepsi nicely into the business we are working to do the same with neeltran we are starting to see leverage between the product lines as evidenced by the recent 21 million in orders that were just announced which was driven by the mining and semiconductor markets to give you some color on these orders nearly half of the orders come from mining and about a quarter come from semiconductor fabs we are getting leverage across the product line selling into mining we are presenting more content and getting orders from semiconductor in the middle of what is a challenging period for supply chains while we re seeing an increase in capital investment to build semiconductor capacities these are 2 markets mining and semiconductor that may continue to be tailwinds for the business as you ll see from our revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we are anticipating growth given our current momentum in existing backlog we certainly could surpass the 30 million quarterly revenue level as soon as this fiscal year now that we ve reached 25 million we have our sights set on 30 million our revenue backlog is more than 50 higher than this time a year ago and we ended the first quarter with much more than 60 million in cash in fiscal 2021 we expect year over year revenue growth again in our grid and in our overall business our new energy power systems backlog is very strong we are manufacturing ship protection systems for the first san antonio class ship platform lpd with our first delivery expected this year we are supporting inox with commissioning in the field and providing electrical control systems or ecs as they need and pay for it and our south korean wind partner has begun erecting offshore wind turbines utilizing amsc s 5 5 megawatt turbine design and ecs our new energy power systems business has been supported by a strong base of projects in the renewable and industrial segments our systems have gained notable momentum and we expect that they will drive growth and diversification for our company this fiscal year our new energy power systems include dynamic power correction platforms our static power correction line of capacitor banks and harmonic filter systems as well as our rectifiers and transformers our dynamic power correction platform consists of our voltage management solutions these solutions are focused on addressing renewable energy installations on the transmission grid and industrial installations like the semiconductor fab which would reside on the distribution grid we are presenting more content to customers as we leverage the strong combination of our new energy power systems solutions in may 2021 we acquired neeltran inc a connecticut based company that supplies rectifiers and transformers to the industrial market the acquisition of neeltran as well as it was with nepsi which we acquired last october directly in line with our strategic priorities to accelerate profitable growth independent of our wind business broaden our product offering and expand both market reach and content per sale we believe our new energy solutions will play an important role in accelerating us to being operating cash flow positive and position us hopefully for even more dramatic growth our growth through grid strategy is working our business development and manufacturing teams are driving very hard our supply chain so far has been able to respond to the increasing demand for our new energy products we work closely with the semiconductor industry on long lead items supply to date we have not felt impacts of the semiconductor shortage on shipments we continue to monitor our suppliers and try to work closely with them to make sure we don t miss a beat in production we are seeing lead times trending upwards but we believe that we have the time to react to this and have built that into our material flows when many manufacturers rely on lean production we believe for critical components you cannot run so lean i m very happy that we ve been running our business this way we are starting to see product costs on the rise specifically around commodity metals this impacts every product of ours from the cabinets that enclose them down to the materials used in the semiconductor wire we are proactively updating our prices where we can to include these additional costs we can t adjust much against the backlog already established but the good news is that in most cases we have either procured the material or have material contracts in place for a large portion of our existing backlog moving forward on new orders we are reviewing all our cost estimates and raising prices when appropriate the markets in general understand that prices for many commodities have been rising and we are adjusting accordingly we anticipate that new energy shipments should provide a strong base of grid revenues in the second quarter as well as the balance of this fiscal year this expectation is driven by the strong backlog that we have for new energy power systems as well as the overall grid business now turning to our ship protection systems or sps our ship protection system is the navy s baseline degaussing design for the san antonio class ship platform lpd in fiscal 2020 we announced two separate delivery contracts for our sps systems these two contracts represent our third and fourth ship protection system orders for deployment on lpd 31 and lpd 29 the sps is designed to reduce the magnetic signature of a ship which can interfere with undersea mines ability to detect and damage the ship amsc has worked with the u s navy to develop a lighter weight more power efficient high temperature superconductor version of this degaussing system the sps we are now manufacturing for the navy the navy s plan is to build 15 additional san antonio class ships starting with lpd 28 we are working very closely with the navy and our supply chain to ensure timely delivery of our sps orders our sps team is very busy and focused on delivering our first systems the san antonio class is our first design win with the u s navy other potential platforms include but are not limited to carriers frigates destroyers and littoral ships sps grew and contributed to our strong grid segment revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 moving on to wind doosan is now erecting their first series production of 5 5 megawatt offshore wind turbines utilizing amsc s design as well as amsc s ecs we believe southeast asia is a geography well suited for our 5 megawatt class wind turbine and for our partner doosan south korea intends to become one of the world s top five offshore wind power producers and we believe doosan is well positioned for a very high market share to date there are wind farms in the development pipeline which totaled nearly 9 gigawatts of wind capacity we understand doosan will supply wind turbines for the southwestern offshore wind project which is a 2 5 gigawatt development and the gunsan offshore wind farm a 1 gigawatt development our team is working very closely with doosan and we look forward to potentially penetrating the global offshore wind market with this partner regarding our onshore ecs business we stand ready to support our partner in india as they need support commissioning new turbines or need new stock of 2 megawatt ecs for now we are supporting inox with the commissioning of 2 megawatt turbines in the field and providing ecs products as they need and pay for it but let me note importantly today we expect to ship 2 megawatt ecs in the second quarter now i ll turn the call over to john kosiba to review our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and provide guidance for the second fiscal quarter of 2021 which will end september 30 2021 john john kosiba senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks daniel and good morning everyone amsc generated revenues of 25 4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to 21 2 million in the year ago quarter our grid business unit accounted for 92 of total revenues while our wind business unit accounted for 8 grid business unit revenues increased by nearly 33 in the first quarter versus the year ago quarter the year over year growth is due primarily to the revenues generated from both of our acquisitions nepsi and neeltran additionally we experienced growth within our sps product line wind business unit revenues decreased 45 in the first quarter versus the year ago quarter as a result of ecs shipments to doosan during the year ago period looking at the p l in more detail gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 13 compared to 24 in the year ago quarter the year over year decrease was due to an unfavorable product mix and additional costs related to purchase accounting adjustments associated with the neeltran acquisition i realized that with the two acquisitions being incorporated into our financial statements over the last nine months it may be difficult to get a sense of what normalized gross margins may look like after the full integration of both nepsi and neeltran to help you understand what a normalized consolidated gross margin could look like on this revenue profile i ve modeled amsc s consolidated gross margins assuming that neeltran and nepsi have gross margins consistent with similar product lines like d var in that scenario consolidated gross margins for the company would be between 20 and 25 depending on product specific mix as a reminder when we acquired neeltran we mentioned it would take up to a year from closing for neeltran to be accretive to earnings as we ship off existing neeltran backlog and replace it with new orders like the ones we announced on tuesday we expect to see neeltran s gross margins improved considerably over the next 12 months moving on to operating expenses r d and sg a expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were 10 2 million this was up from 8 1 million for the same period a year ago the year over year increase was primarily the result of absorbing the operating expenses for both our nepsi and neeltran acquisitions additionally in q1 of fy 2021 there were approximately 700 000 of acquisition related expenses to complete the neeltran acquisition approximately 13 of r d and sg a expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were non cash our non gaap net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 2 7 million or 0 10 per share compared with 2 4 million or 0 11 per share in the year ago quarter our net loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 5 4 million or 0 20 per share this compares with 3 4 million or 0 16 per share in the year ago quarter please see our press release issued last night for a reconciliation of gaap to non gaap results we ended the first quarter of fiscal 2021 with 63 1 million in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash this compares with 80 7 million on march 31 2021 approximately 12 7 million in cash was used to acquire neeltran in the quarter our operating cash burn in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 5 8 million i would like to take a moment to bridge the operating cash flow for this quarter if you recall when we announced the neeltran acquisition we stated that we anticipated neeltran would be additive to amsc s operating cash flow within 12 months from closing implied in that statement is that amc would absorb neeltran into the operations and it would take some quarters before we experience any meaningful cash contribution from this business to help normalize this quarter s cash flow if we back out neeltran s revenue in this quarter amsc s revenue is closer to 20 million in q1 of fy 21 on that revenue profile we would normally expect an operating cash flow of 3 million to 4 million with that said we re anticipating revenue growth in both our grid and wind businesses over the coming quarters as a result we are investing in working capital to support this growth this additional working capital investment is expected to continue into q2 then we expect levelized working capital in the second half of fiscal 2021 now turning to our financial guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we expect that our revenues will be in the range of 24 million to 27 million our net loss on that revenue is expected not to exceed 6 7 million or 0 25 per share our net loss guidance assumes no changes in contingent considerations not any purchase accounting adjustments associated with the neeltran acquisition our non gaap net loss is expected not to exceed 5 million or 0 18 per share the company expects an operating cash flow of 4 million to 6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we expect to end the second quarter with no less than 56 million in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash with that i ll turn the call back over to daniel dan daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer thanks john the emergence of covid 19 has created both operational challenges and macroeconomic concerns for all businesses and now just after it seems we re getting back to business as usual we see a surge in covid cases due to this new virus variant throughout the past 18 months of the pandemic amsc has demonstrated it can operate effectively through times of crisis we were early to implement physical separation at our manufacturing sites and did not miss a beat in production we instituted cleaning protocols for our offices to help keep everyone safe and healthy which is paramount we are focused on our people and the parts to make our products as well as on strong customer service and product quality our factories remain open and have been operational throughout the pandemic we have started fiscal 2021 on a very strong note grid represented over 90 of our revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and was our strongest grid quarter since we began reporting the grid segment our new energy power assistance business is very strong and we are beginning to see the initial benefits of our two recent acquisitions bookings are off to a strong start for the year we have ship protection system orders for deployment on lpd 28 lpd 29 lpd 30 and lpd 31 we are supporting doosan s efforts to penetrate the offshore wind market with our 5 5 megawatt turbine we are preparing for our onshore wind partner inox to transition to a larger 3 megawatt class wind turbine for deployment in india we are executing against our objectives and that is to the credit of our employees due to their hard work and dedication and i m very proud of all the amsc and comed employees that have worked very hard to make reg happen we have delivered the reg hardware to the site in chicago on time and we believe many utilities are interested in seeing the performance of our product in chicago i look forward to reporting back to you at the completion of our second fiscal quarter of 2021 sharon we ll now take questions from our analysts questions answers operator we ll now take our first question from eric stine from craig hallum your line is open please go ahead aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group analyst great this is aaron spychalla on for eric thanks for taking the questions daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer hey aaron good morning aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group analyst good morning maybe first on reg it sounds like we ll look for details there on the energization of that but can you just kind of talk about the impact when that happens on maybe phase 2 and you mentioned other utilities that are kind of interested in seeing how that performs can you just remind us of the opportunity there with other utilities as we look over the next couple of years daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think it s an important step for the product being in a permutative installation working with a world class utility like comed and exelon we know there are other opportunities within the city of chicago and within the broader exelon utility we know per our discussions with comed they really want to see this thing operate at least a year before they go forward and make additional decisions but the number of people that have been involved the level of training the level of deep conversations with such a broad group within the utility gives me strong comfort that this is really a product that s needed now for the grid and solves a lot of those problems we re seeing i ll say an uptick in demand and identification of specificity of products sorry of projects for the product in other cities that we ve talked about in the past i think the team has done a very good job canvassing the united states to look for potential opportunities to deploy reg but i do think it s now all gated by successful operation for at least a year in chicago aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group analyst great we ll stay tuned there and then second question with the infrastructure bill can you just kind of talk about thoughts on that and then how you might see that impact your business daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think they all represent tailwinds i think a lot of what we re doing is back in vogue it s the type of infrastructure that needs to be spent on but there seems to be funding being allocated for clean and renewable energies as well as the systems like the grid that support them so i think it s a very good time to be american superconductor aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group analyst all right thanks for taking the questions operator we will now take the next question from philip shen from roth capital partners your line is open please go ahead philip shen roth capital partners analyst hey everyone thanks for taking my questions just as a follow up on the reg project i think back in june daniel at our virtual london event you talked about made a comment in just a few weeks away and i was wondering if you could give a little bit of detail if you re seeing any bottlenecks or challenges as you guys kind of get to the final stages or is mostly everything kind of running smoothly and i know your original target was to get this done in the summer but i wanted to just check in to see if there s more detail you could share daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think that s still target s on track i see all green lights and i hope that we can report back to you guys soon with some news philip shen roth capital partners analyst ok and then i think in your prepared remarks you talked about mining and semiconductor end markets has been a nice source of steady demand ahead can you give us a little more color on what you might be seeing there are you seeing kind of more orders from the same customers you ve had in the past or do you see the diversity of customers increasing or possibly both and then would you say that these are key end markets to drive toward your target of 30 million per quarter run rate for grid thanks daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer yes everything you said and the answer is yes so we re seeing diversification of customers we re seeing repeat customers we re seeing expansion of content per sale given the acquisitions but just to kind of talk briefly when we think about doing semi there is a fit to add nepsi content to what we do traditionally with d var we are seeing an uptick in orders to do exactly that so that part of the acquisition certainly is working similarly in mining we see a lot of opportunities that have been coming through neeltran lot of opportunities coming through nepsi we re able to combine content on most of those opportunities which again translates to even more revenue growth we think that these acquisitions are a great fit to diversify our business we love what we do in renewables and in wind but we think we ve added a few more markets here that we can go penetrate and deliver additional growth philip shen roth capital partners analyst great and on that thread in fq1 i think i heard you said that neeltran did 5 million of revenue in the quarter i was wondering if you could give us a more specific split of what your core revenues were for grid and sorry if i missed it and then perhaps what it was for each of the other recent acquisitions daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer so we do break out wind we don t break out the details within the grid we did say that we added in neeltran as the 5 million and we did say that the ship protection systems grew and that s kind of the length of the color that i can give you philip shen roth capital partners analyst great well thanks very much and i ll pass it on daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer thanks phil operator we ll now take the next question from colin rusch from oppenheimer your line is open please go ahead colin rusch oppenheimer co inc analyst thanks so much guys in the grid business with these integrations can you speak to the cadence of the sales process are you seeing any shortening of the sales cycle and then also if you could give us an update on your conversion rate from pipeline into actual sales how that s trending daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer yes those are really good questions colin so i think what we re seeing is the cadence being kind of what we have thought typically we think about our existing products closing anywhere around six to nine months out we see kind of similar timetables for nepsi for some projects maybe a bit shorter we see similar timetables for nepsi but i d say usually a bit longer maybe as much as nine or 12 months out we do have some things that we re starting to book now that are 15 months out and more so i think what we re seeing is strengthening of the conversion and more clarity on what the year is going to look like and we re really comfortable to stand behind what we said about growth the conversion of the pipeline i think really where the team has done some really good work is strong identification of what truly is in that near term pipeline for things that we can close in the next 6 months and we ve seen i ll say an increase in the conversion rate or the win rate and i think that s again a testament to being able to deliver more content to the customer a lot of times in projects it s much more about the timing and the financing of the project than it is really losing to other parties but we see that with existing customers and new customers we re able to deliver quotes with more content and that s being well received colin rusch oppenheimer co inc analyst that s super helpful and then as you think about the medium term in that business now that you ve got a broader portfolio of solutions and i m sure looking at a little bit of longer term relationships with some of these customers is there a really meaningful opportunity to evolve the portfolio and design out some of the components and some of the costs or evolve the performance of those solutions to serve a different need daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer i think a little bit more of the latter i think in the longer term maybe some of the former we re trying to find what that sweet spot is particularly when we combine content from d var plus nepsi where we can buy content with neeltran plus nepsi are there ways to think about streamlining costs and supply chain but really we want to get the stickiness with the customer and to get the order size growing so that the effort per order should be roughly the same but the yield per order we re looking to grow or enhance so that s really the message that the team has colin rusch oppenheimer co inc analyst perfect thanks so much guys daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer thanks colin operator it appears that there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back to mr daniel mcgahn for any additional or closing remarks daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief executive officer thanks sharon i really just want to emphasize with people today we re really going for growth here we re starting to see the beginning of that in what we reported out for q1 you see in the guidance clearly that we re looking to grow as well in q2 you can hear in some of the remarks that we made john made about working capital and preparing for growth that we see growth coming on the horizon we re driving the team to become a much bigger business with these additional acquisitions we are acknowledging today that s going to take time and we said that on the outset when we bought these companies that it doesn t happen in a quarter to resolve it good news is we inherited some great backlog with great customers the challenge is how do we improve the financials on the orders going forward and i was very proud that the team was able to generate even more orders this quarter than last quarter i m very proud that the backlog is expanding and the backlog is getting better financially so we re really on the growth and a lot of what we ve talked about to put the company in position for the past few years you re going to see that to come to fruition here in 2021 and certainly 2022 and beyond happy with all the questions with reg really excited to hear about what s going on and we ll leave it at that and look forward to getting back to you guys with how we do with second quarter operations thank you everybody for your support and attention operator duration 41 minutes call participants john heilshorn investor relations daniel mcgahn chairman president and chief

trevor milton the founder and former chairperson at nikola corp has raised a sum of 77 million by selling his shares in the electric truck manufacturing firm barely days after he pleaded not guilty to charges of misleading investors in a bid to hype the stocks of his company transferred shares on july 23 the disposals were disclosed to the us securities and exchange commission through a filing on friday revealing how milton had sold the shares he indirectly owned through m m residual llc a company that he owns fully and also through his spouse the biz tycoon was charged with allegations of securities fraud and lying about the tech and business capacity at nikola on july 29th six days prior to that he and m m residual had transferred to his spouse 600 000 and 1 15 million shares respectively this move comes despite the fact that milton had previously said that he remains committed to his stakes in nikola where he continued to be the majority shareholder even after stepping down from his post as executive chairperson back in september false and misleading information on the legal front prosecutors have accused milton of having fed false and misleading information to nikola about its first semi truck prototype as well as hyping up a pickup truck that had briefly been on the roster for being marketed in collaboration with general motors he is out on a 100 million bail which was secured by a 2 700 acre ranch he owns in utah he has also agreed to limit his travel and not reach out to investors a negative impact on milton and co his resignation has had rather a negative effect on investor confidence in nikola even though the company went public barely three months before he stepped down as a result the electric car maker has had to bite back on many of its ambitions back in november last year general motors had given up on its plans to create a pickup truck for nikola and just this week the company has had to decrease its initial vehicle delivery projections warning of serious issues in the supply chain just recently it had come to news that milton had lost around 7 6 billion during the past 13 months thanks to a sharp decline in his company s shares all due to the allegations and the ensuing investigations back in june 2020 the businessperson s wealth stood at 8 7 billion which is down to just 1 1 billion as per estimates by forbes source the edge markets
township 4 range 14 after flying from central america this spring a small yellowish songbird called a mourning warbler homed in on a patch of forest northeast of moosehead lake and determined it was the right place to find a mate and raise a family this patch is no wildlife refuge five or so years ago loggers harvested most of the trees leaving a tangle of branches and trunks now waist high maples and alders raspberry bushes and ferns are emerging amid the slash it s the perfect habitat for this warbler a secretive bird that likes to nest near the ground eat insects and spiders and is more frequently heard than seen nearly 30 years ago a team of bird researchers came to this land to conduct the first large scale study of the impact of commercial forestry on bird populations in the united states at the time a big paper company was in the process of clearcutting 15 000 acres that s an area the size of manhattan the ragmuff clearcut named for a stream and road bearing the name was unsightly and disturbing to many humans but migrating songbirds such as the mourning warbler a species that has been declining in maine according to breeding bird surveys didn t seem to mind a systematic survey of bird populations across 1 million acres of working forest led researchers to what was then a surprising conclusion cutting down trees isn t necessarily bad for birds as long as the harvesting was taking place across a larger landscape where the types of tree and age class were constantly changing over time that concept came to be known as a shifting mosaic it highlighted the role of commercial forestry practices in conserving biodiversity because healthy bird populations are an indicator of a larger healthy environment for wildlife different songbirds thrive in different types of forests the observation that commercial forestry and breeding songbirds could coexist was important for maine roughly 10 million acres half the state s land mass was a contiguous working forest punctuated by sparse development that s still true in 2021 maine s north woods remains the largest uninterrupted tract of forest east of the mississippi river and as more land is developed in maine and elsewhere the ability of commercial forests to provide a welcoming summer home for songbirds will become even more vital for retaining biodiversity an aerial photo from 1993 below shows dramatic changes in a 15 000 acre tract of commercial woodland northeast of moosehead lake the ragmuff clearcut as it s known reflected forestry practices of the 1980s below the same area in 2021 today most of the land is reforested and in the early stages of being thinned by new landowners researchers are studying the impact of changing forestry practices on migrating songbirds in a nationally significant nesting area the clearcut paradox in 2019 a landmark study published in the journal science concluded that the number of birds in north america had fallen overall by nearly 30 percent since 1970 a decline of nearly 3 billion birds in 50 years today the national audubon society has identified 17 8 million acres of forest in western and northern maine as the largest important bird area in the contiguous united states as well as a top global priority for conservation and while not directly tied to bird habitat this extensive woodland acts like a giant sponge that helps soak up at least 60 percent of the state s annual carbon dioxide emissions a critical buffer against the impacts of climate change maine s climate action plan calls for creating incentives to increase carbon storage through forest management practices and a task force now is looking at that issue for small to midsize landowners against this backdrop the key researchers who carried out the 1992 work have come back to maine they ve begun a three year 300 000 study aimed at repeating the survey work they did three decades ago they call it the thirty year bird study changes in forest practices and bird populations in maine s commercial forest 1992 2022 the researchers want to see which bird populations have increased or declined and how those changes compare with regional and national trends in concert with landowners they also want to determine whether some of today s forest management practices could be fine tuned for the benefit of both birds and timber supply what we re trying to do is to put this commercial landscape into a national perspective said john hagan an ornithologist and senior adviser on the project hagan is the former president of manomet inc a nonprofit conservation and research organization with offices in brunswick and plymouth massachusetts he lives in georgetown and now focuses on climate change issues over a two day period in july hagan led a tour of commercial forestland harvesting operations and bird survey plots in an area located roughly between the northeast tip of moosehead lake and chesuncook lake this is a remote region bisected by logging roads and streams punctuated by ponds and wetlands here a full spectrum of how timber is managed in maine s spruce fir northern hardwood forest is on display including clearcuts hagan had to confront the paradox of clearcuts 30 years ago when a forester first took him into an adjacent logging operation in a policy paper he wrote in 1996 hagan called it an appalling sight that left him disoriented but when his field crew starting surveying the area in 1992 they found the scrubby area full of birds he wrote many of the species that used these habitats were species of conservation concern e g chestnut sided warbler common yellowthroat american kestrel lincoln s sparrow mourning warbler clearcuts were not the biological deserts i had thought my own data demanded that i confront my preconceptions in july hagan was still struck by the contrast when he compared an aerial photo of the ragmuff clearcut in 1993 with a drone shot he took this year twenty eight years later most of the 15 000 once denuded areas in the clearcut are covered with standing timber it has become one of the largest tracts of mid age forest in maine clearcuts grow back in maine hagan said loss change and opportunity a mix of factors have altered the condition of maine s commercial forests over the past 30 years and the bird habitats they provide for starters massive clearcuts are a thing of the past public outrage over photos such as the ragmuff operation triggered a hotly contested referendum to ban clearcuts in 1996 the measure was defeated but it put the industry on notice and led to stricter state regulations such as the maine forest practices act which limits clearcuts to 250 acres large clearcuts have been replaced by partial harvesting operations that has resulted in more acres being cut each year to feed lumber and paper mills driving the changes in silviculture the term for tree cultivation practices is a shift in who owns the maine woods maine s historic vertically integrated timber companies such as great northern paper and its successor bowater inc owned the ragmuff land those companies no longer exist nor do the paper mills they supplied in millinocket and east millinocket in their place came a fragmented ownership of timber investment management organizations and individuals with different goals and shorter financial time horizons they were more likely to cut on a 10 year cycle for example so trees didn t get large enough to support bird species that like to nest in mature forests with closed canopies at the same time the market transition gave conservation interests a once in a generation opportunity to buy and preserve large tracts of what had been working forest south of the township the appalachian mountain club purchased 70 000 acres in 2003 from international paper co for its maine woods initiative the group is raising money now to buy 27 000 additional acres from an investment fund some of this land is being sustainably harvested but other tracts will grow into ecologically important mature forest on the eastern shore of moosehead lake the state was able to buy 4 242 acres in 2002 that comprise big spencer mountain and mature hardwood stands that haven t been cut in more than a century today the parcel is part of the state s ecological reserve system paradise in the darkness these changes are evident today across the landscape northeast of moosehead lake as is the concept of a shifting mosaic of managed forestland in july foresters from landvest huber resources corp and weyerhaeuser co offered to explain their management practices on some of the land being surveyed by the bird researchers in one section of the old ragmuff clearcut a thicket of balsam fir is taking over foresters disparagingly call this a dog hair stand the trees are so close together that a person can barely squeeze through the branches it s nearly dark inside but songbirds that nest in this habitat such as golden crown kinglets and bay breasted warblers like the close quarters they have been observed by the project s field crew jonah levy a tufts university graduate student and kelsi anderson a biological researcher from colorado standing in the dense woods last month the researchers discussed how this stand provides the meals nesting birds count on such as spider eggs and moth cocoons levy found an inchworm on the forest floor and examined it there must be the right kind of food for them here he said the nesting season is so short they need to find the right food to raise their young levy and anderson have come to know this land well while birds were calling and looking for mates in may and june the duo conducted predawn bird surveys on a total of 120 sites expert birders don t need to see a bird to identify it they do most of their work by ear listening and recording data inside a set radius the results of these so called point counts can be compared with data from 1992 next year a bigger field crew will survey three times as many sites in the moosehead lake area to coincide with the work done three decades earlier with the point counts done the field crew was returning in july to the sites to conduct vegetation surveys documenting the types of tree on the land their age classes and canopy characteristics levy and anderson used a tape measure to define the plot boundaries they sighted through a hypsometer a forestry instrument that calculates height to determine how tall the trees were this information is transferred to coded maps although some birds may prefer nesting in a dog hair stand it s a challenging place for foresters said jim o malley northern maine regional forester for landvest landvest is managing this parcel for a company owned by peter buck co founder of the fast food chain subway buck a south portland native and bowdoin college graduate owns more than 1 2 million acres in maine and is the country s seventh largest private landowner according to the land report o malley has been attempting some thinning in the area but the thick stands make it hard this stand also is vulnerable to damaging insects notably the spruce budworm so he s considering options do we continue to thin or do we cut it hard and reset the clock o malley said higher perches for warblers the dog hair stand is very different from the one o malley went to next a few miles away off the golden road this is a mature softwood stand dominated by tall black spruce dappled sunlight penetrates the understory permitting small balsam fir and maple saplings to spring up blackburnian warblers known for their flaming orange throats and their long journeys from south america like this habitat they spend their time here high in the canopy o malley brought along an increment borer a forestry tool used to extract wood tissue from the core of a tree after screwing in the shaft he pulled it out and counted the rings this tree is 85 years old this is prime saw log and stud wood now he said on nearby land managed by huber and owned by buck s company a logging crew was clearcutting 13 acres of 40 year old spruce and fir the stand is in an area prone to wind damage so foresters decided to cut it now the harvest is a three person operation it started with a feller buncher a motorized vehicle with a large arm and rotary saw that cut trees and stacked them as it moved through the stand behind the feller buncher a processor instantly stripped the branches then a logger driving a forwarder sorted the pile with a grapple and carried the timber to a roadside pile the logs will end up at moose river lumber co in jackman and become two by fours this small clearcut is adjacent to mid age forest warblers and other birds that nest nearby may fatten up prior to fall migration on the raspberries and blueberries that will emerge huber manages 650 000 acres in maine most of its clients want their land harvested in a sustainable manner according to trevor london huber s director of operations the health of birds which eat vast quantities of insects including those that damage some trees are part of the management equation it s important for our clients to operate with the best research available london said the tour soon came onto a logging road north of kokadjo next to land that looks like a christmas tree farm it s a spruce and fir stand managed by weyerhaeuser the company owns 850 000 acres in maine half of it around moosehead lake sixteen years ago plum creek timber co announced plans to create house lots and a resort on 17 000 acres around the lake weyerhaeuser which acquired plum creek in 2015 has since abandoned those plans in a few years the company expects to conduct what s called pre commercial thinning here this method removes small growth to space out the stand so the remaining trees can get big enough to become lumber that will likely happen in 25 years or so foresters here also had set aside some big trees and wooded patches that can serve as perches for birds during the visit levy heard the calls of a song sparrow and lincoln s sparrow which forage for seeds and insects on the ground then the group spotted a sharp shinned hawk gliding overhead sparrows beware this small raptor is known to swoop down and catch songbirds in midair crunching data to protect birds as this year s field work winds down hagan and his team are taking stock of what they ve learned and gearing up for a major survey effort in 2022 they were able to raise 53 000 from sources including the cooperative forestry research unit at the university of maine they re currently soliciting funding from national foundations and conservation interests for next year the team has developed a matrix from this year s surveys that records birds per acre and per species in a variety of forest types the forest habitats range from clearcuts to mixed hardwood stands and mature softwood stands the status of each of roughly 60 species of bird is noted for each forest type i m pleased that the suite of birds is still here hagan said they are still using this landscape and they are as dense as they were 29 years ago but hagan is concerned about the impact that fewer mature hardwood stands may have on the birds that depend on them the results of partial cutting and a recent industry preference for more hardwood fiber the next step is to compare the data with what s happening nationally that will help show whether species populations that are declining in north america are also trending downward in maine s commercial forests and whether different silvicultural practices can help the good news hagan said is that maine s working forest has largely escaped development pressures after 30 years it remains a globally significant nesting place for migrating songbirds the question now is how to balance today s forestry practices with the needs of birds that have been migrating here for thousands of years and the new urgency to store more carbon related to climate change just letting the forest grow hagan said is probably not a solution send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
it s no secret that coinbase has played an instrumental role in bringing new users into the crypto space coinbase s friendly onboarding process and status as a publicly traded company allow it to appear as a more traditional investment platform to non crypto savvy investors leading to greater trust however it seems almost weekly that another article hits the internet about coinbase and its excessive fees for retail and professional traders and investors the gripe generally unfolds with a comparison of pricing between a couple of different exchanges with increased competition the pressure for coinbase and exchanges around the world to lower fees is mounting nevertheless the biggest pricing issue facing coinbase and other exchanges is far greater than simply fee structures commoditization and price commodities are goods that are fungible in other words the market treats goods in their various appearances as effectively equal when a good or service is commoditized there is no further differentiation between sellers and all negotiation is based exclusively on price discussion about trading fees is rooted in a belief that the price of cryptocurrencies is static across all exchanges a commodity if bitcoin btc were a true commodity trading fees would be the only issue at play and the discussion around coinbase s fee structure would be valid related crypto needs a decentralized daily reference rate however this view of bitcoin belies an underlying problem within the market the price of bitcoin is not a static number and can often vary across exchanges because of market fragmentation consumers are often over or underpaying without even knowing it fragmentation and true price market fragmentation occurs when contact and interaction between exchanges are poor this results in differences in pricing between exchanges and a dearth of liquidity in the market at large when these price variances are large they rapidly subsume any variance in fees between exchanges investors and traders have been trained to only see the price on a single exchange but this fragmentation means that the true price of any cryptocurrency is its price on a single exchange plus the fees on that exchange compared with the same calculation on another exchange related trust is still a must in the trustless world of cryptocurrency if the price of bitcoin is relatively low on one exchange it matters very little if that exchange has zero fees why if the price of bitcoin is 60 000 and the fee is 0 50 on one exchange one could pay for a bitcoin on another exchange at 60 120 with a 0 30 fee yes with hundreds of exchanges in the market the price gap can get this big at times this variance has led to a proliferation of arbitrage investing buying bitcoin on one exchange at a lower rate and then reselling the same coins after a transfer to another exchange for a higher price the biggest issue this causes however is that bitcoin is no longer a commodity with too many pricing variances bitcoin becomes nonfungible and the market stagnates this motion away from commoditization will eventually cause a potential market implosion but there is hope for change market stabilization this type of market chaos is not new nor isolated to the cryptocurrency market the same issues have occurred in bonds and equities markets but have been solved over time through regulation for example the united states securities and exchange commission has a policy called national best bid and offer or nbbo this regulation requires all brokers to execute trades at the best available ask price nationally when an investor wants to buy a security and the best available bid price nationally when an investor wants to sell in this way the regulation stabilizes the market and protects consumers from overpaying on any given exchange brokers are held in check and market forces work cooperatively rather than unilaterally the cryptocurrency market however because it remains in its infancy does not have this time of normalization in place exchanges function with relative autonomy and the market s current state of fragmentation means that retail and institutional investors often pay different prices based on these exchanges the problems with implementation of this system in the cryptocurrency market are manifold lack of communication restrictive regulatory compliance and dry liquidity pools holding back any meaningful change building a truly unified global crypto market the root cause of the issue in the market is a lack of communication or interoperability between exchanges resulting in a high degree of market fragmentation however the current digital infrastructure is substantial enough to support constant exchange interaction but for markets to scale globally this interoperability between exchanges must be seamless related trustless bridges may be the key to blockchain interoperability bitcoin is a global asset arguably even more so than apple or tesla stock so it s unfair that traders cannot get the best bid and offer at any given time as the nbbo provides for traditional equities more enterprise grade technologies and liquidity will also help mature digital asset trading all of this could eventually allow for one unified global trading market in a similar way that traditional stocks are traded on exchanges like the nasdaq or the nyse without these solutions to reduce fragmentation trading fee arguments and debates are misdirected and do not tell the complete story it s time to level the playing field of fairness with the right regulation and technology in place ultimately it s not a race for lower trading fees it s a race for something similar to the nbbo in crypto a truly global best bid and offer this article does not

a crash or steep correction would be the perfect opportunity to buy into these proven winners for many investors there are no scarier words than stock market crash but the data doesn t lie stock market crashes are commonplace and can arguably be considered the price of admission for taking part in one of the greatest wealth creators on the planet since the beginning of 1950 the widely

historically low lending rates for the time being all signs are pointing to higher bond yields and lending rates by 2023 or perhaps sooner in bofa s second quarter report the company notes that a 100 basis point parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would generate an estimated 8 billion in added net interest income nii virtually all of this nii is going straight to bofa s bottom line when interest rates and yields start rising bank of america s digital push deserves recognition too with more users than ever accessing bofa s services online and via mobile app the company has been able to consolidate some of its branches in order to reduce its noninterest expenses in other words bofa s days of supercharged growth look to be right around the corner alphabet finally the

there are lower risk energy stocks near the top of the list but this risk reward opportunity should not be ignored so far this year the energy sector has crushed it for investors the energy select spdr etf xle 0 18 is up 32 in total returns the best sector in the s p 500 index which is up 19 this year and as the global economy continues to recover from the coronavirus pandemic the prospects for the energy industry to continue delivering the best returns for investors remains good here s the thing i think some of the best energy investments over the next few years and especially in the decades to come aren t stocks that fall in the traditional energy sector bucket moreover i think the best energy investments you can make right now this month aren t traditional energy stocks one in particular is at the top of my list as the best energy stock to buy in august keep reading to learn more the contenders the energy sector is going through massive upheaval at the same time that demand for fossil fuels continues to rise as a result there is opportunity for investors both in the transition to renewables and in companies involved in hydrocarbons here are my top three contenders brookfield renewable businesses like brookfield renewable bep 0 64 bepc 0 30 are doing most of the disruption to oil and gas brookfield renewable owns develops and operates utility scale renewable energy facilities its plants produce electricity from hydroelectric wind and solar energy and it sells that clean power on long term contracts in other words it s more like a utility but brookfield renewable isn t disrupting utilities it s the fossil fuel industry that it s cutting out of the mix with the power it produces meaning less coal gas or crude oil needed to supply the world s growing energy needs as ceo connor teskey put it on the brookfield renewable second quarter earnings call the tailwinds for renewables continue to accelerate it should come as no surprise that there is both a growing investment opportunity as well as increasing amounts of capital being allocated toward the sector that s not just lip service on some future opportunity the company reported a 23 increase in funds from operations in q2 and signed 28 new contracts to provide 800 gigawatt hours of renewable energy to customers with a dividend yield above 3 at recent prices for the mlp units and a very long record of growing the payout brookfield renewable is a winner i think will continue winning for years to come tellurian closest to being a traditional energy company tellurian s tell 1 25 business or the one it plans to build is suppling natural gas from cheap plentiful north american gas fields to global markets the company s plan is to build a 27 billion lng export facility on the u s gulf coast during much of 2020 the company s prospects of survival were very much in question the collapse in global energy demand and oil prices played havoc with tellurian s schedule the company s business model is heavily reliant on global energy giants companies which count on oil for a substantial part of their profits to sign on as partners with tellurian these are the companies that would be buying and shipping the lng tellurian was producing but these potential partners had bigger issues on their priority list last year simply surviving the worst oil downturn in history than signing multibillion dollar lng supply agreements with tellurian fast forward to 2021 and the company has finally started making progress on july 29 tellurian announced a 10 year contract with royal dutch shell that would essentially fill up capacity on the first two planned lng plants it wants to build making the entire project economically feasible this was a massive step forward that makes it far more likely the company will be able to get the financing to move forward with building its driftwood facility and unlocking massive financial potential and shareholder returns tpi composites the least energy of the stocks featured here tpi composites manufactures blades for the largest wind turbine companies in the world over the years tpi has expanded the list of wind turbine giants who it counts as customers investing tens of millions of dollars to expand its manufacturing capacity as a result revenue is up almost 200 since 2016 approaching 2 billion annually good so far right well growth hit a speedbump with management backing off its guidance for the rest of 2021 and also warning that revenue growth might be stagnant through 2022 as a result shares are now down almost 50 from the high reached early in 2021 i think that gives investors looking at tpi composites as a likely long term winner in the years ahead a wonderful opportunity to buy wind will play a massive role in the future of energy and tpi composites is central to how many turbine makers will meet future demand my top august energy stock tellurian if you re looking for a lower risk investment the tellurian probably shouldn t be your top energy stock to buy with brookfield renewable the better choice but if you re willing to take on the risk that tellurian can t raise the money to build driftwood an outcome that would probably kill the company then keep reading here s the core argument tellurian s deal with shell essentially pushes driftwood across the threshold of economic viability barring this agreement or a similar deal with another buyer it was unlikely even charif souki tellurian s co founder who also founded cheniere energy lng 0 22 would be able to talk lenders and investors into providing the billions in capital it will take to get this project off the ground the calculus has now changed and i think the risk reward profile has shifted much farther into investor s favor five years from now investors who buy tellurian now could be sitting on an enormous multi bagger just be ready for a volatile ride and acknowledge that the risks are not insignificant and could result in very big losses
the discord servers and subreddits are a frenzy of graphs memes and speculation about the next bull market twitter ceo jack dorsey said he believes bitcoin can bring about world peace and the pro trump magacoin was launched for more than 1 000 early adopters whose personal information was quickly exposed online due to poor website security the organizers did not respond to a request for comment all in all it s been a normal couple of weeks in the world of cryptocurrency the value of digital currencies fluctuates wildly at the whim of erratic billionaires rumors and the machinations of unregulated online exchanges during the last year the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization has swung from 293 1 billion in july 2020 up to a record high of 2 5 trillion in may 2021 and then down to 1 5 trillion as of late july according to coinmarketcap a crypto data platform despite that volatility investors are increasingly buying into the currencies reliable numbers are hard to come by but industry surveys estimate that anywhere from 8 to 14 percent of americans own cryptocurrency and over the last year alone significantly more professional financial advisers say they are encouraging clients to invest in digital currencies according to an annual survey by the financial planning association but what are the drawbacks the markup interviewed behavioral economists industry analysts and investors many cautioned that crypto markets increasingly resemble rigged casinos but let s start with the basics what is cryptocurrency cryptocurrencies are byproducts of blockchain networks and vary widely in purpose and value bitcoin the most well known digital currency is illustrative of how the technology works a blockchain is a cryptographic system designed to record information in bitcoin s case financial transactions across a distributed network of computers in such a way that the information can t be faked censored or controlled by a central entity like a bank when you make a bitcoin transaction you sign it with the private cryptographic key associated with your bitcoin wallet and send it to the public address of the person you re paying then the vast network of computers set up to verify transactions gets to work to solve the necessary cryptographic problems to prove that the transaction is legitimate and if it is add it to the public blockchain which anybody can verify at any time in order for this system to work there has to be some incentive for the people known in this case as bitcoin miners who own the computers that hum day and night burning huge amounts of energy to solve the cryptographic problems and maintain the integrity of the blockchain that s where the coins come in when a miner s network successfully solves a cryptographic puzzle that miner is awarded a bitcoin the system is designed so that only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined and it becomes increasingly difficult to mine them the more there are in circulation which creates scarcity and in theory increased value about 18 8 million have been mined so far with the last expected to be mined around 2140 though there are many different cryptocurrencies other popular coins include ether dogecoin xrp and litecoin they all basically work the same way why does their value fluctuate so much none of that though explains why bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are valued as highly as they are a bitcoin was worth 37 968 as of the evening of july 27 or why those values are so volatile the first simple economic reason that cryptocurrencies are volatile is that they re new and nobody is entirely sure how to value them yet you can assign a value to stocks or bonds because they have cash flows like dividends and future interest payments that can be measured they re also associated with entities like companies and governments that are legally required to report certain key metrics said vivek singh a professor of finance at the university of michigan dearborn there is no cash flow associated with cryptocurrency he said it seems to be purely a behavioral phenomenon you buy thinking somebody else will value it more than you did but you have no idea why that lack of an inherent measure of value also means prices can change rapidly with major news like reports about pending government regulation even minor news such as elon musk s announcement that tesla would accept bitcoin in exchange for its vehicles which pushed bitcoin up 5 percent his subsequent announcement that tesla would stop accepting bitcoin the value dropped 14 percent in two hours and most recently his statement that tesla would most likely accept bitcoin again at some point in the future driving the price up more than 12 percent if they buy or sell at the right time speculative cryptocurrency traders can make significant profits if enough of them make the same trades it can trigger cascades that lead to huge bull or bear runs those runs can make or break fortunes crypto is probably the most volatile asset that any investor has ever owned said matt hougan chief investment officer for the index fund bitwise asset management but a small allocation one to 2 percent for most people of established currencies like bitcoin and ether in an otherwise diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds can be a good idea for the right investor the real risk comes when individuals stake more than they can afford to lose quickly and when they delve into newer coins and the world of unregulated exchanges what does a lack of regulation mean here s where the real risks come in on may 19 as cryptocurrencies began to fall rapidly in value binance the largest online exchange measured by transaction volume froze it locked users out of their accounts as prices slipped preventing them from selling stakes and resulting in life savings being wiped away in a matter of hours other exchanges also went offline amid the panic binance and similar exchanges are unregulated and while certain of their derivative offerings aren t allowed in the u s and some other jurisdictions it s easy for traders to get around those restrictions by using virtual private networks vpns binance also doesn t have a headquarters making it exceedingly difficult for the hundreds of victims currently trying to sue the company to find the proper court through which to attempt to recover their losses binance did not respond to the markup s request for comment a binance spokesperson previously told the wall street journal that the company took immediate steps to engage with users affected by the outage we remain happy to speak to anyone who reaches out to us with a concern about the outage the unregulated exchanges also pose quieter daily risks many exchanges for example have started offering complicated derivatives like leveraged buys an investor who believes the price of coin x is about to surge can put down a relatively small amount of money say 1 000 and purchase 10 000 or more of coin x on a 10 to 1 leverage the exchange lends the additional 9 000 on which it will likely charge interest if coin x increases in value say by 50 percent everything is great the account holder pays back the 9 000 they borrowed plus interest and a fee they keep their initial 1 000 investment and the additional 5 000 they made in profit far more than they could have gotten with an initial investment of only 1 000 but there are several ways things can go wrong most exchanges list the daily interest rates they charge on leveraged loans and the numbers can appear quite small at first for example an exchange may offer a leveraged loan on coin x with a daily interest rate of just 0 3 percent but if you annualize that a borrower will owe more than 100 percent in interest at the end of the year if coin x dips things get even worse the broker triggers a margin call a set price at which the investor must pay the lender back in full potentially leading to losses the investor can t afford a coin need only drop 10 percent in value to wipe out the principal investment on a 10 to 1 leveraged loan and some exchanges are offering leverages as high as 100 to 1 the danger of those leveraged trades is compounded by the fact that professional traders and exclusive pay to play groups have significant power to influence when values go up and down especially for the smaller coins that attract the most speculation trading volume data from binance for example shows that the highest rates of activity come during working hours monday through friday in the u s demonstrating that professionals dominate the platform said carol alexander a university of sussex finance professor who studies cryptocurrency markets you start off by buying some bitcoin then you look a bit further and it s a little bit like the door to the secret garden alexander said then as soon as you log on to an exchange like binance you re met with a pop up ad offering tutorials for trading special products that promise to bring even greater wealth for little money down they allow any type of training on types of products that don t exist in traditional financial markets and they make them up people think they understand when actually they don t then there are groups like blackdragon which act as venture firms arranging exclusive deals and insider information for wealthy individuals becoming a white dragon which grants you access to 60 percent of the group s deals costs 250 blackdragon tokens which currently go for about 10 40 each or 2 600 total gaining access to 100 percent of the deals as a black dragon currently costs about 104 000 those who can t afford blackdragon memberships are left to hope that the coin they just invested in isn t being manipulated behind the scenes i don t advise anybody to try to do their own day trading because they ll become bananas and what i mean by that is food for the gorillas alexander said so what s the safest way to invest in crypto in some specific ways investing in cryptocurrency is kind of like other forms of investment day trading and other attempts to play the market are risky but experts say there are safer ways to dip in research from the blockchain research lab in hamburg germany shows that the majority of active crypto traders who try to outsmart the market would be better off buying bitcoin and holding onto it even after the precipitous drops of the past few months a bitcoin is worth about 27 000 more today than it was a year ago when a single coin was going for just under 11 000 most professional investors believe this is currently a bear market and that bitcoin will continue its erratic climb in value for years david yermack a new york university business professor who teaches about cryptocurrency said investing a small amount in the digital coins may make sense for young people with significant disposable income but not necessarily those working in tech because an economic downturn in the industry could threaten both their jobs and their crypto investments the blockchain research lab study found that the vast majority of crypto investors were male 77 percent with an average age of 38 and that on average they invested 60 percent of their net monthly income in digital currencies in many ways the people who shouldn t be owning in the first place are most drawn to it yermack said a lot of it is risk loving people who are just drawn to it and excited by the sharp increases and declines nobody should be investing in things for excitement this article by

billion and debt of 4 56 billion perhaps the most remarkable thing about mid america apartment communities however is its commitment to redevelopment and adding value to units it already holds rather than selling off aging ones during 2021 the company renovated 6 360 apartments increasing the average rental rate of each unit by 12 2 not only are these practices a solid way to conserve a limited apartment supply but they are low cost methods to increase per unit value without constantly buying and selling real estate which can be a costly venture on its own after all the more spent the less

lgi homes is a mid sized and growing builder that focuses effort and marketing on first time homebuyers for the year ending march 31 2022 the average price of a home produced and sold by lgi was 305 000 that s a significant discount from the median existing home price of 391 000 reported by the national association of realtors in april 2022 pricing alone gives lgi a distinct advantage in its market but that s not the whole story behind the company at the end of march 2022 lgi held 2 3 billion in inventory and 53 3 million in cash with 1 171 million in liabilities it closed 1 599 homes during the first quarter of 2022 generating 546 1 million in revenues a 22 7 increase over the first quarter of 2021 this isn t just a fluke due to the hot housing market though from 2014 through 2021 lgi reported consistent increases in home closings average sales prices and net incomes gross margins have remained more or less the same in the mid 20 range management holds large stakes in the company with 12 42 of shares staying within the operation related investing topics the bottom line there are plenty of ways to invest in real estate besides owning physical real estate assets for many investors real estate stocks can make all the best parts of owning real estate much more accessible and far less expensive whether you re interested in investing in apartment reits or the builders who construct owner occupied neighborhoods there are lots of offerings on the table when evaluating real estate stocks remember that many of the same rules apply as for any kind of stock look for companies that have great offerings whether it s leasable real estate or purchasable housing stock make sure they aren t carrying a high level of debt that could become a serious liability in a downturn the better they are at managing their money the better off you ll be and if the management team happens to own a big chunk of the company that s pretty solid evidence they re invested in making their company succeed by tying their own futures to that success
greg barnes north carolina health news on a recent morning when a voluminous energy bill hit the n c house floor for a vote democrats remained confident that it would be defeated and then from their view at least everything unraveled by the evening of july 14 the house had voted 57 50 to approve the 49 page bill state law requires two votes and after democrats objected to holding those votes on one day house members hung around until the clock struck midnight then gave the bill its final approval by a vote of 59 47 apparently the speaker kings mountain republican rep tim moore applied his magic and twisted a lot of arms and flipped all the undecideds and got some of the no votes to walk and even got some no votes to flip said rep pricey harrison d greensboro so wednesday morning the votes weren t there to pass the bill they were there by the evening the vote flipping was just one of the many curious republican maneuvers for a bill that has the power to change the way duke energy delivers and charges for electricity in this state for decades to come whether that be good or bad for the environment and for duke s customers rep john szoka r fayetteville is a primary sponsor of house bill 951 szoka acknowledges that the bill is not perfect and is likely to face many challenges and changes as it moves into the senate but szoka who has become so versed with the bill that he can recite its complexities without notes is proud of what he helped create among the biggest rewards from the proposed legislation szoka said are that it would retire some of duke energy s coal burning power plants early and provide an abundance of solar power in the future amounting to a 64 reduction in north carolina s carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 democrats and environmental activists counter that the coal plants would have had to be retired early regardless of the bill they object among many other things to some of those coal plants being converted to natural gas either way they say the plants are on tap to continue burning carbon emitting fossil fuels when solar wind and other less polluting alternatives are possible researchers have amassed a large body of research showing the human health effects of air pollution from burning carbon ranging from diminished lung function and asthma rates to potentially contributing to the development of alzheimer s disease older data has linked air pollution to cardiovascular disease lung disease even low birth weight opponents of the bill also say it could lead to higher energy rates and take power away from the state s rate regulators they question the secrecy that some say has shrouded the bill making process as well as the urgency to get the legislation approved the reported secrecy issue peter ledford general counsel for the n c sustainable energy association said months of negotiations while drafting the bill happened behind closed doors with direct input from duke energy officials during the process ledford said that although he was able to attend those meetings environmental groups ratepayer activists and residential interests such as aarp were excluded he said he was prohibited from sharing any information from the meetings with anyone else so yes it was definitely done in secret he said szoka disagrees he said the secrecy issue was hyped by media outlets and is simply untrue in reality he said everyone was given ample time about three weeks to review the bill before it came up for the house votes so the secrecy thing i m not buying that he said regional greenhouse gas initiative amendment so why did so many republican lawmakers flip their votes the day the bill made it to the house floor ledford believes it had to do with a last minute amendment that would bar the government s executive branch from participating in the regional greenhouse gas initiative which places an increasingly lower cap on the amount of carbon dioxide coming from the energy sector north carolina is considering joining the initiative known as rggi and pronounced reggie a cooperative effort among 11 states from maine to virginia that will use it to cap and reduce carbon dioxide pollution from the power sector a study by the maine based arcadia center found that rggi reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 47 over 10 years other studies have found that it has helped save lives by reducing air pollution the day before the house voted on the energy bill the state s environmental management commission voted 9 3 to start the rulemaking process to join rggi an amendment to prohibit the governor from joining rggi appeared the next day ledford said moore the house speaker acknowledged in an interview that day with wral tv that the rggi amendment was key to getting the caucus aligned around the legislation the environmental management commission approved the rulemaking process for rggi after the southern environmental law center filed a petition on behalf of the environmental groups cleanaire nc formerly clean air carolina and the north carolina coastal federation under gov roy cooper s administration the state has set a goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector by 70 by 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 duke energy the state s leading energy company by far has its own goal to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by at least 50 by 2030 and to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration carbon dioxide trapped in the earth s atmosphere absorbs and radiates heat over time carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have tipped the earth s energy budget out of balance raising the earth s average temperature and contributing to an increase in sea levels and more intense storms and flooding last year north carolina broke almost every heat record what the legislation promises szoka provided nc health news with a list of talking points that he says the bill would achieve among them retire two marshall coal fired plants at lake norman eight years early from 2034 to 2026 and replace them with natural gas plants which emit much less carbon dioxide retire the allen coal fired plant in belmont in 2023 the plant is on schedule to be replaced with a 20 megawatt battery system and 70 megawatts of solar subsequent retirements from 2027 to 2029 are prescribed in the bill but the n c public utilities commission would hold hearings to determine the most cost effective and reliable replacement generation at that time the four unit roxboro coal fired plant is planned for retirement but if no replacement generation is available by 2027 the plant would continue to operate as is opponents of the bill say they like that it would provide a large amount of new solar power in a state that already ranks third nationally in generating electricity from the sun but they object strenuously to stipulating that natural gas power plants would replace the coal fired facilities and to other provisions contained in the bill the solar piece is good but i think there isn t another piece of that bill that s good harrison said adding that the coal burning plants would have to be retired early anyway if duke is to fulfill its pledge of becoming carbon free by 2050 mary maclean asbill a senior attorney for the southern environmental law center said the utilities commission should make the decisions on what source of power would replace the coal burning plants it shouldn t be set in statute she said ratepayer protection other provisions in the bill would allow duke to use multi year rate plans revenue decoupling and performance based ratemaking which would create incentives by linking the energy company s revenues with its performance the legislation would allow the utility to submit rate plans every three years instead of annually a provision szoka says will cut red tape and result in lower rates for customers ledford and other opponents of the bill say it could have the opposite effect the issue just boils down to ratepayer protection ledford said because you re setting rates several years in advance duke has the opportunity to over earn which is pretty problematic when the commission doesn t have the necessary oversight to really reel them in and make sure that they re earning an appropriate amount so it s really just kind of a consumer protection issue there what is this going to do to utility rates what s it going to do to low and moderate income folks what s that going to do to businesses that pay very large power bills a day after the house approved the energy bill the aarp released an article saying the organization is concerned that the bill could be a bad deal for the state s duke energy customers if passed duke energy will seek rate increases in three year blocks rather than year by year the bill takes authority away from state regulators to determine whether the company s spending and earning plans are in the best interest of all customers michael olender aarp s north carolina director said in the article two years ago lawmakers dismissed a similar multi year rate plan proposal from duke differences in rate projections szoka said the bill would add about a dollar a month to customers energy bills that 1 figure is based he said on computations by the utilities commission s public staff but that figure is also in dispute ledford said the public staff s analysis excluded the impact of multi year rate plans and did not consider energy transmission and distribution costs the wires investment yes they calculated it would only be 1 extra a month roughly but that s a generation plan that is currently being litigated before the north carolina utilities commission ledford said so it would only cost 1 more than duke s current plan which several parties including ncsea contend is too expensive to begin with there are cheaper ways of doing it another analysis performed for the carolina utility customers association a trade group for industrial and manufacturing ratepayers found that the proposed legislation would result in a 50 increase in electric bills over 10 years the associated press reported szoka called that analysis 100 inaccurate and reiterated that we rely on the public staff to do the math hedge fund wants duke split up harrison thinks the urgency to approve the bill stems from an external force in the name of elliott management corp one of the oldest and wealthiest hedge funds in the country elliott management which has acquired a large share of duke energy stock sent the company s board of directors a letter in may suggesting that an independent group evaluate whether duke should be broken up into three regionally traded public holding companies for the carolinas florida and the midwest four days after the house voted in favor of the energy bill elliott management sent another letter to duke s board saying it had received an outpouring of feedback from fellow investors top industry advisors current and former industry executives and others elliott observed that duke s poor track record has engendered deep skepticism regarding management s ability to create value for shareholders and deliver improved service for customers the letter said elliott also noted that duke lacks effective independent oversight at the board level and that the company s bigger is better strategy is not aligned with the best interests of its shareholders or its customers duke shot back with a statement of its own the same day the new elliott management letter to the board of directors is the latest attempt to push its short term agenda at the expense of long term shareholder value as well as the interests of duke energy s employees and the communities it serves the statement said in part duke was set to hold a call conference with shareholders friday that harrison believes could be the reason for the urgency to get the bill approved apparently that s what s driving the timeline because otherwise none of us could figure out why this big rush harrison said acknowledging that szoka did reach out to lawmakers to explain

billion of assets and a leverage ratio as defined by atax of 68 the partnership is current and in good standing with all of our lenders and leverage providers 10 stocks we like better than america first tax exempt investors when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and america first tax exempt investors wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 in terms of the partnership s investment portfolio we have received no request for forbearance on our multifamily mortgage revenue bonds and all multifamily mrbs are current on principal and interest payments our collections rate reported by properties that serve as collateral for our multifamily mrbs has averaged approximately 92 with 30 days of billing from january 2021 through june 2021 physical occupancy averaged 93 for the portfolio as of june 30 2021 our current vantage portfolio consists of 13 projects seven where construction is 100 complete and six others where construction or planning is still underway for the seven properties where construction is 100 complete we continue to see good leasing activity with four of the seven having achieved over 90 physical occupancy as of the end of july we continue to see no material supply chain or labor disruptions on the vantage projects still under construction as we have seen in the past the vantage group as the managing member of each project owning entity will position a property for sale upon stabilization our two owned student housing properties are now approaching the start of a new academic year which coincides with their standard lease term both are covering all of their obligations from project cash flow including operating expenses and in the case of the 50 50 at university of nebraska debt service both university of nebraska and san diego state have announced their intentions for the fall 2021 semester to be primarily in person on campus learning our two property managers are actively pre leasing units for the fall 2021 semester and as of today both are over 85 pre leased which is consistent with their leasing in years prior to the 2020 2021 covid 19 pandemic on our student housing mrb for the live 929 apartments at johns hopkins university we have seen a similar reversion to pre pandemic performance the property owner recently transitioned third party property manager at live 929 to the same management company that manages maryland economic development corporation s portfolio of student housing assets pre leasing currently stands at approximately 88 with additional lease applications still being processed the existing forbearance of principal amortization agreement with the borrower runs through the end of 2021 the need for forbearance into 2022 will be evaluated as part of the 2002 budgeting process once final leasing results are known like university of nebraska and san diego state johns hopkins university has announced that they expect a broad resumption of in person classes this fall the borrower on the provision proton therapy center mrb filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2020 and that case continues to work its way through the bankruptcy court process the debtor has retained houlihan lokey to evaluate their options with regard to the knoxville center and the two other centers that entered bankruptcy at the same time those options could be either an outright sale of the facilities or a restructuring of the existing bond debt or something else entirely based on those potential outcomes we felt it appropriate to make an additional credit loss impairment this quarter the second quarter of 2021 brought a modest improvement in the market for municipal bonds municipal bond mutual fund inflows have continued their strong performance since march of last year first half of 2021 saw inflows of approximately 57 billion according to refinitiv lipper data that is the highest level of muni bond flows for the first six months of the year since 1992 of that 57 billion almost 14 billion was directed to municipal high yield funds municipal market data s high grade muni bond scale reached all time low yields in mid august 2020 with a 10 year index at 0 59 and a 30 year index at 1 28 the recent rally in treasuries has had a positive impact on the muni market ten year mmd is currently at 0 82 and 30 year mmd is currently at 1 35 roughly 20 to 25 basis points lower in yield than last quarter this past week the bloomberg barclays index for unrated and non investment grade muni bonds hit its lowest level ever through 3 at 2 91 since we are still in a relatively low interest rate environment we continue to be mindful of the absolute level of rates where we can originate new fixed income investments we have continued our focus on shorter duration investments where match funding is more readily available and hedging is less costly in terms of our debt investment activity during the second quarter i had previously mentioned during may s call the early april closing on a longer term financing on an acquisition rehab lihtc project in mississippi in july we closed on our largest construction financing transaction to date 85 million for a new construction lihtc project in orlando we continue to see lending opportunities in both market segments in may 2021 the vantage at powdersville property located in powdersville south carolina was sold the partnership recognized 0 10 of net income and cad per buc in conjunction with the redemption of our membership interest as a result of the sale as i mentioned on last quarter s call in april 2021 we closed one new vantage equity investment for a project located in loveland colorado this is our first investment in the colorado front range market with vantage and continues our diversification of the vantage portfolio locations later on during the second quarter we closed on vantage at helotes another vantage project in the san antonio area which was followed by the acquisition of a second site in san antonio for the development of vantage at fair oaks we will continue to look to strategically work with our strongest sponsors on new investment opportunities where traditional sources of capital may not currently be available with that i will turn things over to jesse coury our cfo to discuss the financial data for the second quarter of 2021 jesse coury chief financial officer thank you ken for the second quarter of 2021 we reported total revenues of 16 4 million net income per beneficial unit certificate or buc basic and diluted of 0 13 and cash available for distribution or cad of 0 17 per buc on a year to date basis we reported total revenues of 30 8 million net income per buc basic and diluted of 0 22 per buc and cad of 0 28 per buc we reported 1 23 billion in total assets as of june 30 such assets make up our three main investment classes first being our net spread portfolio second our vantage investments and the third our mf properties in our net spread portfolio we currently hold 76 mortgage revenue bonds or mrbs across 14 states we hold a significant volume of mrbs related to properties in three states based on outstanding principal with texas representing 44 and california and south carolina each representing 17 as ken mentioned to date we have received no request for forbearance of principal and interest payments for mrbs with multi associated with multifamily properties in 2020 we granted forbearance for the live 929 apartments mrb associated with the student housing property in baltimore maryland forbearance consisted of the deferral of contractual principal payments through 2021 while the property recovers from the effects of the covid 19 pandemic as of mid july the property is 87 leased for the upcoming fall 2021 semester which is on pace with pre covid lease trends the borrower of our provision center mortgage revenue bond a proton therapy center treatment center located in knoxville tennessee filed a petition for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in december 2020 as ken mentioned the borrower is working through the bankruptcy process and we are assessing forbearance and restructuring options with other senior bondholders we recognized an additional impairment charge of 900 000 in the second quarter of 2021 based on our evaluation of the potential outcomes the debtor reorganization process as of june 30 we have investments in seven gils or governmental issuer loans totaling 130 million the gils are investments to finance the construction lease up and stabilization of affordable multifamily properties in four states and are functionally the equivalent to our mrbs and that they are non recourse obligations issued by governmental authorities secured by a mortgage on real and personal property of affordable multifamily properties we expect and believe the interest earned on gils is exempt from federal income tax in most instances we also commit to fund property loans in tandem with the gils that share our first mortgage lean and are typically funded after all gil funds have been advanced as of june 30 we had outstanding commitments to fund additional proceeds for gil investments totaling 71 million and related property loan commitments totaling 120 million such funding commitments will be advanced during the periods of construction not reflected in the amounts i just listed are the new gil and property loan commitments for the construction of a new affordable multifamily property new orlando florida that we closed in july 2021 our commitments for the gil and property loans are 60 and 25 5 million respectively and will be funded during construction also in july we entered into a new tob trust financing to leverage the gil and property loan investments and funds will be advanced as we fund our investment commitments moving to the vantage portfolio the vantage portfolio consists of 13 projects as of june 30 of which two investments are reported on a consolidated basis all investments are for the construction of market rate multifamily properties that represent in the aggregate over 3 700 rental units carrying value of our vantage investments totaled 92 million as of june 30 exclusive of the two investments reported on a consolidated basis of the 13 current projects nine are in texas two in nebraska and one each in tennessee and colorado seven projects are complete and in lease up and six are either under construction or in the planning phase two of the completed properties have achieved over 90 physical occupancy as of june 30 with two additional properties exceeding 90 occupancy by the end of july there have been no material delays or disruptions due to covid 19 for projects currently under construction as ken mentioned the vantage at powdersville property in south carolina was sold in may 2021 and our equity investment was redeemed upon redemption our initial 10 7 million investment of capital was returned and we realized 2 4 million of investment income and a 5 5 million gain upon sale this is our eighth vantage investment that has been redeemed which in the aggregate has generated approximately 35 million of gains on sales and contingent interest to date moving to our mf properties portfolio as of june 30 we owned two mf properties with a total of 859 student housing units and a net carrying value of approximately 56 million both properties provide college student housing which has been more significantly impacted by covid 19 than the general multifamily housing market the 50 50 mf property and the suit on paseo mf property primarily serve students of the university of nebraska and san diego state university respectively both universities have announced their attempt to resume on campus in person classes for the fall 2021 semester both mf properties are leasing for the fall 2021 semester and leasing velocity is relatively consistent with pre covid levels both properties continue to meet all operating and direct mortgage obligations with cash from operations moving to the liability side of our balance sheet we use our debt financing to leverage our investments in mrbs gils and property loans which totaled 742 million as of june 30 in the second quarter of 2021 we received gross proceeds of 31 million from various tob trust financings related to one new mrb investment and continued funding of our gil and property loan commitments of our 742 million of debt financing approximately 40 is fixed rate debt and 60 is variable rate of our 445 million of variable interest rate debt financing 132 million or roughly one third is secured by investments with variable interest rates such that they are at least partially hedged against rising interest rates without the need for separate hedging instruments such as interest rate caps or swaps in june 2021 we obtained a new secured line of credit facility with two financial institutions for up to 40 million subject to a borrowing base calculation the line of credit is secured by a first priority security interest in our vantage investments the suites on paseo mf property and the bank account proceeds will be used to purchase additional investments and to provide flexibility in meeting our general working capital and liquidity needs our unused capacity on the secured line of credit was 33 5 million as of june 30 greystone select holdings llc an affiliate of atax s general partner has provided the deficiency guarantee of atax s obligations under the facility greystone select holdings did not charge a fee in connection with the deficiency guarantee demonstrating greystone s continuing support for atax s operations we regularly monitor our exposure to potential increases in interest rates through our interest rate sensitivity analysis which we report quarterly and is included on page 72 of our most recent form 10 q the interest rate sensitivity table shows the impact to our net interest income given various scenarios of changes in market interest rates these scenarios assume that there is an immediate rise in interest rates and that we do nothing in response for 12 months the analysis based on those assumptions shows that an immediate 200 basis point increase in rates that is sustained for a 12 month period will result in a decrease of approximately 5 2 million in our net interest income and cad or approximately 0 085 per buc lastly we regularly provide our net book value per buc which as of june 30 was 5 67 which is up slightly from 5 63 as of march 31 our closing market price on the nasdaq on june 30 was 6 74 per buc which is a premium to our book value of approximately 19 with that ken and i are now happy to answer questions from the audience questions answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and from jonestrading we have jason stewart please go ahead jason stewart your line is open jason stewart jonestrading analyst yeah you got to unmute it all right my bad first question thank you sorry about that it s really more on the affordable side so first time i ve really we ve never heard anything about affordable from atax what do you think the strategy is there going forward ken rogozinski chief executive officer well i think jason in terms of affordability that really is the core focus of the mrb and the gil investments all of them in order to have the ability to have tax exempt debt issued for them have some level of affordability associated with it there are regulatory agreements that restrict in most cases both the tenant incomes and the rents that the underlying project owners can charge so you know that i think is something that we re going to continue to focus on from a debt perspective that s where we ve historically been an investor i think we have value that we can add to project sponsors around the country and so i think that will continue to be a focus from our perspective on the debt side on the vantage side though those are traditional market rate projects there is no regulatory agreement or rent or tenant income restrictions associated with those we ve been pleased with that strategy and results that the vantage team and we have been able to see from those investments so at least at this point in time i don t foresee any kind of change there from a market rate approach to an affordable approach jason stewart jonestrading analyst how does the new rating that you ve achieved help you accomplish that ken rogozinski chief executive officer i think from our perspective we were really pleased to see the announcement earlier this week of kbra s bb rating of the partnership s senior unsecured credit it s something that we worked hard with that team to educate them about our business educate them about the what we feel is the strong quality of our underlying investment base and so i think it was beneficial for us to be able to have that kind of dialogue with them and see the result that we saw with a rating that s just one notch below investment grade it s new news to the market it has only been out there for four days at this point in time but our goal is that by having that sort of public third party view of our credit that it will help us with our existing counterparties in terms of pricing for our credit and liquidity facilities it will help us with credit capacity with our existing lenders and will hopefully open the door for us to develop relationship with new lenders and counterparties who might not have necessarily focused on us absent this side of public view of our senior unsecured credit jason stewart jonestrading analyst ok got it and then pivoting to the overall balance sheet when you look at the exposure to plus or minus lean the number on interest rates like let s say we get a 1 and then 2 on two on 10 years what do you think the exposure is to atax i mean this has to it really seems like incredibly resilient to any sort of plus or minus move ken rogozinski chief executive officer a couple of things there jason to give you a little more detail i think the first is and jesse i d appreciate any color you want to add here as well the first is that a fair amount of that volatility that you see in that analysis is as a result of our undrawn proceeds on the mizuho secured note financing we ve got another nine months i think at this point in time left to be able to fully draw the balance of that facility if that is not drawn those notes will be redeemed and that will have a significant i think improvement in that analysis since we weren t sure at the time of closing of that transaction in august of last year we didn t put any sort of long term hedge on that cost of debt because we weren t sure how much of that we were going to be used and so i think if that redemption of those secured notes does happen we ll see a significant improvement in how that analysis works because that s right now a potential interest cost increase as a result of an increase in rates there is adding significantly to that analysis the other thing is that from an investment perspective we ve got probably roughly 80 million worth of mrbs that we have funded through one of our tender auction block counterparties we view that as warehouse financing that is not going to be our long term capital solution for how we re going to fund those positions we have them now in that form as we aggregate assets and fully get to a place we can do these virtual strategy like the tenant s trust that we ve done four other times previously so again i think that s more of a sort of once we decide what the long term funding deal bill is going to be for those assets we ll have a much tighter interest rate match funding to be useful at this point jason stewart jonestrading analyst ok last one for me and i ll jump out what s your best guess in terms of the core roe of mrb right now ken rogozinski chief executive officer that s a difficult question to answer jason because there are a lot of things that go into that part of it is what the tenure is of the vehicle whether it s a longer term 15 to 18 year mrb on a new construction lihtc deal that s being both construction and permanent financing from us versus the governmental issuer loans that we re doing which are roughly a 36 month facility it also depends a lot on where our funding vehicles are structured in terms of what the advance rates are from the counterparties and what and cost for credit liquidity are on those vehicles as well so everything is pretty much different for each transaction i can t really give you a firm level of what those levered roes are but i think the one blanket statement that i can make is that we are only doing additional transactions on both the mrb side and the gil side where based on our analysis they are accretive to the current dividend yield at the partnership level jason stewart jonestrading analyst appreciate it thank you operator looks like no further questions at the moment ken rogozinski chief executive officer ok well thank you again everyone for joining us and we ll look forward to speaking with you next quarter thank you operator duration 30 minutes call

this article is more than 2 years old afp via getty images many signs suggest there may be fewer china new lists at the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq for the foreseeable future china s review of cybersecurity rules for overseas listings has hit didi global among others the u s is temporarily holding up china listing approvals in connection with disclosure concerns what s a brave china investor to do one option buy shares in hong kong exchanges clearing or hkex which operates the hong kong stock exchange even before the recent crackdowns hong kong had already been expected to benefit from a growing number of listings by mainland technology companies and secondary listings by chinese companies whose shares trade as american depositary receipts or adrs in new york or on the nasdaq newer mainland regulatory rules may make the hong kong stock exchange more attractive some analysts say underscoring its pull the financial times reported today that bytedance the beijing headquartered owner of short video app tiktok has addressed regulators data security concerns in a bid to list by early next year and aims to trade in hong kong despite china s tech crackdown see related post here overall we believe the proposed revision of the rules by beijing should benefit hkex in the medium to long term china galaxy international said in a research report dated july 11 j p morgan a hkex shareholder in a report dated july 14 said hkex is a key capital raising and trading venue especially for large chinese companies the move of adrs to hkex and the shifting of primary listings should solidify hkex s position as an ipo venue even without geopolitics j p morgan has a hkex price target of hk 570 china galaxy s target is hk 557 40 that compares with its close of hk 529 50 in hong kong on friday the stock has gained 42 in the past year stock trading in hong kong goes back to the mid 19th century the first formal market the stockbrokers association of hong kong was set up in 1891 it merged with the hong kong stockbrokers association in 1947 and then with three others the far east exchange in 1969 the kam nan stock exchange in 1971 and kowloon stock exchange in 1980 creating the stock exchange of hong kong in 1980 that exchange later joined with the hong kong futures exchange and hong kong securities clearing co under one holding business that listed itself in 2000 by then reforms in china helped to pave the way for h share listings in the 1990s in the next decade even larger ipos by state owned enterprises and private sector mainland companies followed hong kong over time managed to find policy alignment with beijing to facilitate capital movements and listings hkex international advisory council members include joe tsai the billionaire vice chairman of alibaba and neil shen the billionaire founding partner of sequoia capital china hkex already benefitting from a wave of ipos in recent years has entered a new era in 2021 with the appointment of its first foreign ceo in may long time j p morgan executive nicolas aguzin aguzin hasn t done any media interviews since he wrote on the exchanges blog in june china s economic growth and steady financial liberalization have played a key role in hkex growth over the past 21 years and we remain poised to benefit from these and other macro trends in the years ahead aguzin added against a fractious macro backdrop our role as gateway is perhaps more relevant and more needed than ever before even before recent u s china tension hong kong was expected to play a bigger role for technology listings i think there will be a bigger role for hong kong to play jixun foo managing partner of global venture capital investment firm ggv capital and member for the 2021 forbes midas list said in an interview in june hong kong has actually come a long way ten years ago we wouldn t have thought of hong kong as a strong alternative for tech listings to u s exchanges he said today i think hk has become a stronger alternative foo said for their part fund managers will likely follow good chinese companies to the exchange where they list he said they are looking for returns and still have to find those returns for their stakeholders foo said 2018 bloomberg finance lp aguzin cited fundraising by new economy businesses as well as biotech firms as hkex opportunities i see great opportunity in funding the growth of the new economy including biotech he said these are the companies that will shape our markets in the decades to come since the launch of hkex s new listing rules in 2018 we have become the second largest market in the world for biotech capital raising and our pipeline looks strong covid has put global health in the spotlight and we are committed to supporting both corporates and investors in this sector making hong kong a true biotech hub welcoming participants not just from china but from around the world aguzin said healthcare and medicine related

back of stellar second quarter 2021 earnings amd could have plenty left in the tank in the years ahead but it isn t the only great chip stock benefiting from record demand for tech hardware three

stock rose about 1 200 since the start of 2010 but skyworks has been hard at work diversifying its business outside of smartphones what it calls broad markets about one third of total sales it s about to get a big boost in this department because it just acquired the automotive and infrastructure business of silicon labs slab 0 08 for 2 75 billion in cash this purchase helps the connectivity specialist enter new markets including electric and hybrid vehicle component design industrial equipment and wireless network infrastructure management says the deal will immediately add to the company s already robust profitability making this an even stronger chip designer as demand for advanced circuitry spreads across the economy and while skyworks integrates the takeover from silicon labs into its own operation the smartphone business is doing just fine thanks to the massive upgrade cycle kicked off by 5g mobile during the last quarter the three months ended july 2 2021 skyworks

scratching your head right now why would i recommend buying micron shares right after the stock finally reached a reasonable valuation the stock has gained a market beating 60 over the last 52 weeks surely these aren t the bargain priced stubs you were looking for fortunately micron s strong returns didn t spring from a vacuum the stock is on the rise for good reason and micron can now be treated as a stable value investment for the long haul in the recently reported third quarter of 2021 micron saw 36 year over year revenue growth while bottom line earnings more than doubled these results were achieved at a time when many semiconductor companies experienced and still suffer from a global shortage of chip manufacturing capacity micron runs its own memory chip foundries largely sidestepping the whole shortage situation therefore micron can capitalize on growing demand for advanced electronics more effectively than most of its sector peers from a technology focused perspective micron is on the cutting edge of nand and dram performance and features from a financial point of view times are so good that the company has launched a quarterly dividend program for the first time since the mid 1990s payouts are a modest 0 10 per share so far which works out to an annual yield of 0 5 at current stock prices but management has promised to boost the dividend budget over time in a shareholder friendly effort to put micron s excess cash profits to good use so we are looking at a solid growth stock here poised to keep on growing in the middle of a chip sector recession and the rising stock comes with a side of generous buybacks plus an interesting dividend policy it s the best of both worlds marrying the upside of high growth investments with the classic profile of an income generating value stock one of the cheapest ways to play the 2020s semi boom billy duberstein kulicke and soffa legend has it those that did the best during the 1850s california gold rush weren t the prospectors but rather the companies that sold them picks and shovels that s why one of my favorite ways to play the 2020s semiconductor boom is semiconductor equipment stocks those machines that produce today s highly advanced chips one of the cheapest stocks in that sector is kulicke and soffa k s is a leader in wire bonding equipment for advanced packaging the process that links different chips together with copper wires on printed circuit boards for different applications k s blew away earnings last week and the stock surged some 14 the following day revenue grew a massive 182 over the prior year and adjusted non gaap earnings per share of 1 87 beat analyst estimates by a whopping 0 51 and not only that but management guided to strong sequential growth next quarter as well and yet the stock is still cheap merely annualizing last quarter s eps would put the stock around eight times earnings also k s has a conservative balance sheet with about 10 in net cash around 16 of its market cap and remember management has also guided to strong sequential growth next quarter so why is the stock so cheap given the tailwinds in semiconductor production today mainly k s has a history of being extremely cyclical however given the multiple growth vectors in the industry from 5g to artificial intelligence to autonomous vehicles and factories there seems a good chance the semiconductor industry could become more of a stable growth industry this decade relative to its past on the conference call with analysts ceo fusen chen was optimistic about maintaining the current level of business saying we continue to be amid a period of dramatic capacity expansion throughout the semiconductor industry which is supported by durable and structurally sustainable end market trends in addition to a booming core business in wire bonding and other back end assembly equipment k s is also growing a new segment in equipment for advanced miniled displays although only garnering 60 million 80 million this year chen sees this revenue growing to 150 million by 2024 with growth beyond that so with a stable and growing core a new growth segment in miniled and a very cheap valuation kulicke and soffa still looks like a great long term buy even after its post earnings surge
my wife and i recently welcomed our first son into the world we named him rí ree which means king in irish he s doing great settling into home life with his big sister right now his only job is drinking bottles of milk and sleeping but one day he ll start asking grown up questions like what s the stock market and how do i invest when i was little nobody ever sat me down and taught me about stocks now that i have two kids i ve been thinking about what a dad should teach his children about money and investing i m not talking about specific tips or tactics or even what types of investments to buy but the truly big stuff the two or three money principles that really move the needle if i can ingrain these principles in my kids i ll know i ve done all i could to set them up for a wealthy life as i ll show you there is a big 3 nail the big 3 and everything else in your financial life slots into place teaching your kids the big 3 while you re still around will help them build on your achievements so if you have kids and grandkids please share this letter with them too step 1 save save save saving money is the foundation of wealth and a prerequisite to investing before you even think about investing you first have to save a lot if you don t put money aside you ll never be able to buy stocks this is hardly groundbreaking advice telling someone to save money is like a fitness guru advising you to eat healthy and exercise both sound obvious yet it s impossible to achieve success without them americans spent 37 billion on gym memberships in 2019 yet a recent harvard study estimated roughly 4 in 10 americans are obese what gives a study published in the american journal of clinical nutrition found exercising makes you feel like you did something healthy which leads folks to rationalize a post workout food binge eating pizza after sitting on the couch all day might bring guilt but scarfing junk food after running five miles feels justified the same happens in our financial lives spending more when say you get a raise is as tempting as eating junk food after exercise it feels earned but as my grandad used to say when your outgo exceeds your income your upkeep becomes your downfall for example imagine you could only choose one of these for your kid 1 they re a high earner but spend every penny 2 they get a decent salary and save a lot of money i d choose 2 every time how much you earn is important but it s not nearly as important as how much you save there s a big difference between making a lot of money and becoming wealthy the gap between what you earn and what you spend is what really matters this pile of cash is what allows you to invest in his recent book retirement expert charley ellis highlighted how important it is to start saving when you re young he found folks who began saving at 25 rather than 45 cut their required annual saving rate by two thirds in other words these folks can save 65 less than older savers each year and still build a dream retirement step 2 you gotta own stocks i ve told you before that starting a successful business is the single best way to get rich amazon founder jeff bezos who s now worth 203 billion is the perfect example of this but you don t need to build the next trillion dollar empire to get rich you can piggyback on great ceos by buying shares of their companies on the stock market the us stock market is the greatest money making vehicle in history you must own a piece of it in 2020 a study from arizona state university found investments in us stocks improved the wealth of shareholders by over 47 trillion dollars between 1926 and 2019 for over nine decades us stocks have handed shareholders 500 billion in profits each year on average that s enough to cut every american a 1 500 annual check for their entire lives i told you saving is the foundation of wealth creation this is the first step but it won t make you rich vanguard founder john bogle said i think whatever your view of the world is you have to invest you can t put the money in the mattress and in this day and age of low interest rates you can t put it in the money market fund or a bank cd so invest you must throwing money into a cd account was a good option when banks paid you 5 today the average one year cd rate is a measly 0 18 meanwhile the value of our hard earned savings is constantly eaten away by inflation the us government s own calculations show a dollar is worth 16 less than it was 10 years ago and nearly 90 less than it was 50 years ago these days owning a piece of a successful business aka owning stocks isn t a nice to have it s a must buying stocks is one of the best ways to beat inflation think of being a shareholder like having a lucrative second job without the hard work with this second job you earn money when you re sleeping when you re on vacation and when you re retired think about buying amazon shares for example every time the disruptor bulldozes through another industry and its stock soars you get a slice of the profits when it crushes earnings and jeff bezos s net worth surges it means you win too step 3 you gotta own the megawinners just owning stocks isn t enough you must own the right stocks the megawinners jpmorgan asset management recently published a great paper called agony ecstasy it s a deep dive into the performance of the us stock market over the past 40 years and it confirmed an important investing truth most stocks suck jpmorgan found almost half of stocks suffered a catastrophic loss from 1980 to 2020 meaning they plunged and never recovered another 26 of stocks produced returns lower than the overall market effectively all the market s returns came from just 10 of stocks which jpmorgan called megawinners lots of losers and a few big winners this is why picking individual stocks isn t for everyone in fact many folks are better off owning a broad basket of us stocks or buying indexes by simply owning the s p 500 etf spy you would have doubled your money over the past five years that s a good stress free option but investors who really want to accelerate their wealth creation must go on the hunt for these megawinner stocks you can build lasting wealth through owning great disruptive businesses in other words back companies that are changing the world and transforming huge industries businesses that achieve this regularly turn out to be megawinners that can hand you many times your money originally published by mauldin economics 7 26 21

ebitda tripled over the prior year as you see on slide 4 this momentum driven by the strength and quality innovation and customer focused product development combined with rising demand in our markets led to a significant order intake across all segments with backlog more than doubling to a record of 751 million providing visibility through 2021 and into 2022 the benefits of our strategy continue to be clear as we delivered our highest quarterly sales on record with revenues of 244 million resulting in income from continuing operations of 17 million and 0 44 per share please turn to slide 5 and i ll provide our business update let me start with an update on what we are experiencing with respect to the supply chain as i m sure this is top of mind for many of you during the back half of the second quarter we experienced industrywide supply constraints including chassis and other components which caused production challenges however as our results show we effectively manage through these challenges thanks to the hard work and determination of our entire team based on feedback from our oem and suppliers we expect these challenges to continue at some level and we will continue to add rigor to our internal processes to ensure we are able to minimize any potential impact jon will have more sorry jon will have additional comments later in the presentation turning to the business segments in fleet vehicles and services strong order flow continues as we have positioned ourselves with the right products that meet the needs of our customers and the industry in q2 we achieved a steady ramp in production of the new velocity vehicle with our daily output increasing significantly despite chassis and component constraints we expect to see continued acceleration as we enter the second half giving the positive feedback we are receiving on the velocity we are now working with other locations and channels and we are now seeing interest from the dealer market other highlights in the quarter include continued strong truck body order flow and we continue to make headway in our efforts to provide grocery customers with both upfit and delivery refrigeration solutions and walking vans truck bodies and cargo vans moving to specialty vehicle segment the strength of our innovative products and underlying markets has resulted in significant growth in sales and profitability even as our team has managed to pandemic related supply constraints our motor home market share during the quarter increased to 31 reflecting the demand of our product offerings in our brand among the motor homebuyers we are even more optimistic about the upcoming 22 motor launch which is happening this month we believe we ll reflect strong consumer demand amid low dealer inventory levels our service body business continues to execute on our strategy of geographically expanding our product offerings to drive additional growth in volume and new products our service body team achieved record revenue in the second quarter which includes the impact of the duramag acquisition we continue to leverage our flexible manufacturing capabilities by expanding in california and add in equipment upfit in mountains in charlotte michigan and west palm beach florida additionally our service body operations have been improved or shipped through by general motors in charlotte michigan which allows us to deliver mounted services sorry mountain service bodies to any dealer in the general motors distribution network across the united states let me provide an update and some additional context on shyft innovations which we announced in the second quarter shyft innovations is a dedicated mobility research and development team reporting directly to me which is initially focused on the introduction of the shyft electric vehicle chassis we re very excited by this opportunity to leverage our near half century of expertise in building chassis to a new product with great potential we have a strong track record of building alternative propulsion vehicles for more than 17 years which will bring to bear on this new effort we know the demand is there and many of our biggest customers in last month s delivery are searching for innovative and efficient ways to meet their commitments to stakeholders to improve efficiency and to reduce carbon emissions within their operations we continue to make good progress on the existing new initiative but let me outline some of how we will differentiate our offering from the growing competitor base the first phase of the project will focus on class three electric vehicle chassis our electric vehicle chassis will initially be available in two wheel bases two wheelbase options with a 5 000 pound payload offering a range of up to 175 miles we are very excited with the extremely talented team we are assembling to support our electric vehicle chassis development we have made considerable progress on electric vehicle chassis design and have finalized key design objectives and performance requirements on electric vehicle chassis proof of concept chassis sign has been completed and we start the assembly of the first electric vehicle chassis this month we assign lois with a number of key suppliers and we have also secured additional component suppliers to support prototypes and production we look forward to updating you on our continued progress with that i ll turn the call over to jon to discuss shyft s financial results for the second quarter in more detail as well as provide an update on our 2021 outlook beginning at slide 6 thank you darryl and good morning everyone please turn to slide 7 and i ll provide an overview of our financial results for the second quarter the shyft group continued to perform at a high level in the second quarter despite ongoing challenges in the broader supply chain we saw robust growth across all segments of the business and while the second quarter of 2020 was depressed due to the impacts of covid the underlying strength in demand for our products was clear in our results revenue for the second quarter was 244 million up 96 8 from the year ago quarter income from continuing operations with 17 million compared to a loss of 1 1 million diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 0 44 per share compared to a loss of 0 03 per share in the second quarter of 2020 on an adjusted basis ebitda from continuing operations more than tripled rising 206 to 28 6 million from 9 4 million last year as a percent of sales adjusted ebitda increased 420 basis points to 11 7 of sales from 7 5 of sales last year adjusted net income rose 316 to 19 million or 0 53 per share from 4 6 million or 0 13 per share in the prior year let me now take you through the results by operating segment beginning with fleet vehicles and services on slide 8 our fvs business posted an impressive quarter effectively managing through the supply chain and labor challenges to get vehicles in the hands of our customers while also seeing continued order strength the business delivered revenue of 168 3 million up 73 compared to 97 2 million a year ago the increase was broad based with strong double digit percentage growth across all product categories as well as a significant contribution from initial sales of the velocity product line fvs adjusted ebitda was up 107 to 28 3 million versus 13 7 million a year ago adjusted ebitda margin was 16 8 of sales compared to 14 in the second quarter of 2020 we continue to see the benefits of both our factory lean initiatives as well as our investment in automation which has helped us expand our output and partially offset supply chain challenges with impressive growth and new products led by velocity we saw significant order growth that resulted in an fvs backlog of 660 9 million the third consecutive quarter of record highs fvs backlog was up 12 sequentially and up a remarkable 130 compared to the prior year please turn to slide 9 for the specialty vehicle segment overview specialty vehicles momentum continued in the second quarter as the business delivered strong revenue growth across all categories with impressive growth in motor home chassis in particular sales were 75 7 million an increase of 49 million or 183 versus the prior year or luxury motor coach chassis business drew 191 year over year and while the prior year comp includes the impact of covid the increase in motor coach chassis sales was up over 40 when compared to the same quarter of 2019 clearly demonstrating the strength of our products in the market on an organic basis specialty vehicles grew 144 in the quarter as you can see on the left side of this chart fvs continued to see consistent sequential growth in sales since q2 of last year including 14 growth over the first quarter adjusted ebitda was 8 6 million or 11 4 of sales compared to 1 2 million or 4 6 of sales in the same period last year primarily driven by higher sales volumes as the backlog was up 79 to 90 5 million which included a 46 growth in motor home chassis backlog and a 191 increase in our service body backlog please turn to the liquidity and outlook update on slide 10 we remain focused on working capital and managing our overall liquidity but we typically see seasonally lower cash flow in the first half of the year we saw significant improvement this year as year to date cash flow from operating activities increased 15 million versus 2020 at the end of q2 we had total liquidity of 120 million including 4 million of cash on hand and 116 million in borrowing availability under our credit current credit agreements our leverage ratio stands at point four times adjusted ebitda and our strong balance sheet enables us to access capital as needed to fund our operations and to continue to invest in our growth strategy capex for the quarter was approximately 6 million and included investment in velocity production as well as fabrication equipment at a number of facilities which we are using to meet increased demand and drive margin expansion across the company year to date capex with 12 million tracking in line with our expected full year range of 20 to 25 million as previously disclosed overall we are pleased with our results and our team s ability to execute at a high level through the first half as we look forward we are optimistic about the demand for our products and are well positioned to have a strong year that said we are not immune to the ongoing challenges in the supply chain and labor markets and expect supply constraints and inflation to have some impact on us through at least the balance of the year we have taken several actions to mitigate these risks including instituting price increases across the business expanding the supply base to manage both material inflation as well as component shortages flexing production as needed and continuing to be innovative in our hiring process to address the labor shortages with our current visibility we are confident that our performance through the first half of the year as well as the strength of our backlog puts us in a position to exceed our previous guidance with this backdrop we are excited to raise our 2021 estimates as follows we expect revenue to be in the range of 900 million to 950 million adjusted ebitda of 100 million to 110 million and adjusted eps of 1 75 to 1 95 per share now i ll turn the call back to daryl for closing remarks thank you jon please turn to slide 11 our results for the second quarter highlight the successful execution of our strategy and the amazing efforts of the entire shyft team our commitment to quality execution innovation and investment in operating efficiencies are generating improved profitability the shyft innovations team and their efforts in developing our new electric vehicle chassis is a great example of our innovation dna unleashed to tackle a critical issue facing fleet operators around the nation bringing a new solution to the market that will limit carbon emission while enhancing the productivity and efficiency of fleets is a game changer in summary our momentum continued in the second quarter with each of our businesses performing well and positioned to support our full growth and profitability for the remainder of the year and probably this great team and can that continues to perform for our shareholders with that operator we re now ready for the q a portion of the call questions answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session the first question today is from steve dyer of craig hallum please go ahead steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst thanks good morning guys daryl adams president and chief executive officer good morning steve jon douyard chief financial officer good morning steve steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst you talked about price increases there are others in the industry that have talked about sort of the guidance raising guidance for the remainder of the year on the revenue side driven largely by price increases is that play into your guidance you know the revenue bump much jon douyard chief financial officer i think steve when you look at it you know our i think there s certainly an element of price in there but i think we really think about it as our comfort with the backlogs you know we ve seen significant order growth here over the last three quarters that has put us in a good position and really in a position where we need we just need to execute i think the you know as we look at chassis component availability as we ve worked through the second quarter i think at this point we feel comfortable with the portion of that backlog that we re able to execute and so that s really where the increase is coming from i think the price will certainly play an element in that but more on the demand side steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst and so your ability to raise them for the back half of the year i mean do you feel like the supply chain pinch the worst is behind you or do you think it will impact you more in q3 than q2 jon douyard chief financial officer i think there s i think you know it s tough to pinpoint that i think if you look at the oems in the chassis situation particularly in the second quarter there were certainly shutdowns throughout q2 which will have implications on us in q3 gm announced some of their pickup truck plants will be idled here in the third quarter and so there will be continued to be sort of ongoing issues from a chassis perspective you ve got the freight issues coming out of china you ve got just component challenges across the board but i think where we find comfort is that the visibility that we have both from an order perspective and really just our ability to execute on that steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst ok got it and you know you talk about the backlog you re out more than three quarters of revenue without taking any more orders do you have mechanisms in place to sort of protect margin then just kind of given the duration of that backlog and all of the uncertainty around supply chain commodities and things like that in the year 2022 do you the mechanism started to protect pricing protect margin there jon douyard chief financial officer yeah i think the there s a couple of things i would point to i think daryl talked about adding rigor to some of our processes we ve certainly done that in respect of the raw material changes and so we ve instituted that in quotes and new order activity i think when you look at our backlog in general particularly on the fleet side of the business we do have mechanisms in our standard terms and conditions where we re able to work with our customers if there are certain inflationary elements where we can go back for pricing as well daryl adams president and chief executive officer and steve i d add back in 2018 when the terrorist came in we ve put in our raw material purchasing strategy that is still in place and as we continue to move backlog out we are continuing to ensure we have an adequate supply of material and we understand the pricing to put into the pricing of the quotes that are out that far so we ve moved it forward we were running i think it was six months at the time that we ve moved that out so we re locking them further and that you know sometimes can be challenging with the suppliers but once we get comfortable with them and they get comfortable with us it s a good discussion and we re both comfortable with the pricing we lock in at steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst yeah that s what drove that question thanks for the color guys daryl adams president and chief executive officer thanks steve operator the next question is from matt koranda of roth capital please go ahead matt koranda roth capital partners analyst hey guys thanks just wanted to see if you could just start out by talking about the bookings environment in fleet vehicles it looks like the implied order flow is still very strong maybe ticked down just a touch quarter by quarter but maybe you could just talk about seasonality and bookings in fleet vehicles and then just traction with velocity and then sort of maybe mix of new orders that were velocity daryl adams president and chief executive officer yeah i ll take a little bit of that matt good morning by the way and then i ll let jon finish you know i think it shows the strength of our strategy and the strength of our operational team where as we continue to set records in revenue we are also continuing to take on the additional backlog so it s not like a delay in the production which i think is important to mention right we re accelerating on all fronts on production and the backlog is expected to grow so as i mentioned this is based on us having the right products at the time our customers need them and the design and innovation that you re looking for and if we continue to look at fvs the typical walking ramp plant is setting daily records on volume monthly records on volume same with velocity as it ramps up and we continue to get backlog so when you know we typically would say the delivery customers want their products right in october for halloween due to the delay in some of the chassis supply during q2 they are asking for them all the way up through q4 and right through the holiday so that s a little unique for this year and that s helping us with the typical q4 seasonality so we re excited about that and jon do you have anything you want to add jon douyard chief financial officer i think the only thing i d add is we saw really the last three quarters of significant order strength in the fvs business really puts us through now into early 2022 and so we expect that to continue from an order flow perspective it probably will slow down here in the second half of the year just as our customers really prepare for 2022 but you know we feel pretty confident with the pipeline that we have for next year as well as where we are from the current backlog perspective daryl adams president and chief executive officer and i think matt i ll just come back and add one more i think you know if you remember about a year ago there was some concern about how much of this online ordering e commerce was going to stick and i think if you look at our backlog and you continue to look at you know the overall macro and micro items in the last mile delivery the growth is still there for this year and next year and we re you know i think it s out for probably three to five years that we re looking at so we re excited about where this business is going to go and we re putting in capital and team members to make sure that we can handle the growth as it continues over the next few years matt koranda roth capital partners analyst great color thanks for that and then if i heard you right i guess fleet vehicles you know typically seasonally you see is kind of a weaker quarter in q4 as the fleet customers kind of hold off on deliveries during their busier periods but it sounds like you know the fleet vehicles revenues should sort of build from q2 and then hold flattish in the q4 is that the way to kind of think about the cadence of the revenue for fleet vehicles for the rest of the year and what s embedded in guidance jon douyard chief financial officer yeah well i think if you look at our guidance overall you know it s probably tough to parse out exactly we certainly didn t guide on q3 in particular but if you look at the sort of the q2 run rate through the balance of the year it s really our midpoint guidance and so between q3 and q4 there may be some pluses and minuses depending on you know component flow and chassis availability those types of things but we feel you know feel pretty comfortable essentially delivering q2 for the balance of the year matt koranda roth capital partners analyst ok got you and then you did mention that the supply chain got a little bit tougher in the back half of the second quarter and it sounds like probably more chassis than anything but wanted to give you the opportunity to kind of discuss anything else that got crimped in the quarter and how are you addressing some of that stuff daryl adams president and chief executive officer yeah i think matt it s i just tell you it s up and down the supply chain it s not just chassis i think you know we re not unique to have some labor issues i think when you look around talk to different people i think it s everybody s having it just do the expansion but we ve you know as we mentioned we re taking you know and jon mentioned it would take some alternative actions and having great new ideas on how to hire people to keep some limited turnover and the other thing is we mentioned that we re adding additional suppliers to ensure that we can have the capacity as we need it because we can see the backlog so we re looking at it and understanding the current supply constraints and adding on additional suppliers for the commodities that we need whether it s fasteners or fiberglass parts or plastic parts so the team is really doing a nice job to keep out in front of that and it s pretty neat to watch matt koranda roth capital partners analyst all right appreciate it guys i ll go back in the queue thank you daryl adams president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from mike shlisky of d a davidson please go ahead mike shlisky d a davidson analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking my question daryl adams president and chief executive officer good morning mike mike shlisky d a davidson analyst thanks i want to start off by asking about some other big news of the weekend in ev and that is the new commercial in ev that was announced by gm the other day i m not sure of the sizing of it and it didn t get much as far as the details but is your impression of that vehicle is that anywhere in the same size range as the class 3 that you re going to be putting out and to your knowledge will that be the same kind of vehicle as other vans out there that will need enough space from an outside provider such as you know such as shyft group jon douyard chief financial officer mike good question i think when we reclassified a whole lot of details our assumption is probably in the higher classes and more of a maybe even a dry van box so it could be the higher classes but we re trying to understand it as you are but again i think you know i have confidence in our team and what we re doing in class 3 which is is a niche space as we mentioned that s why we went into a cause we didn t want to compete against other oems in the class 2 space or even though the people up in that class you know five and six mike shlisky d a davidson analyst ok got it i also want to ask just a question about market share maybe so far this year you ve done a great job executing it up in your way and you get a sense that some of the smaller players and cargo events just aren t getting it done have you found a way to gain some share that others couldn t really fulfill daryl adams president and chief executive officer i think it s is probably more of you know as i mentioned the star quality ability to execute find labor and get the products in the customer s hands we ve seen backlog has seen a nice order flow from customers that we haven t built for typically some are from the grocery side some are on the delivery side so it s broad based and it s exciting to see right that what we ve been talking to teams about is being able to get the products out the door at high quality and customer service is paying off and it s the conquest businesses is very nice for us in the backlog as well as our new technology new products like the velocity in other products mike shlisky d a davidson analyst got it thanks so much daryl i ll leave it there daryl adams president and chief executive officer thanks mike operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to juris pagrabs for closing remarks juris pagrabs

having the right stocks in your portfolio can mean the difference between a joyful retirement or a stressful one if you want the most joyful and relaxing retirement available you need to have a portfolio of stocks that take the stress out of investing the right choices can make the difference between needing to work during your golden years or being able to live comfortably off the fruits of your investing labors certain equities can continue shining throughout your golden years but what are these magical stocks below three motley fool contributors show you why broadmark realty capital brmk apple aapl 0 60 and realty income o 0 25 are superstars for your retirement portfolio this superstar has no debt and a high yield chuck saletta broadmark reality most of the time when a company offers investors a high dividend yield there are substantial risks involved those risks often take the form of leverage substantial debt on the company s balance sheet the big worry there is that if the lending market gets too tight the business can go belly up because it can t access the capital market to roll over its debts even if its operations could otherwise remain intact with that background imagine a company with no debt of its own on its balance sheet that offers its investors a yield in the neighborhood of 8 paid monthly now imagine that the same company actually increased its per share dividend earlier this year does that sound like a business whose stock might reach superstar status for a potential retiree well imagine no more because such a company actually exists broadmark realty is a hard money construction focused lender that s structured as a real estate investment trust reit that prior sentence is a bit of a mouthful but it does a very good job of describing why the company offers a high payout and the market prices it with a fairly high yield as a reit broadmark realty must pay out at least 90 of its earnings in the form of dividends that pretty much assures that if it s profitable its shareholders will get a decent payout as a hard money construction focused lender its fortunes are strongly tied to the construction industry which is a notoriously cyclical part of the economy that helps explain the market s overall fear that is leading to its fairly high yield the cyclical risks are real but the company s debt free balance sheet gives it much more flexibility to ride out the downswings in that cycle than it would have if it carried debt of its own that balance of risks and rewards makes broadmark realty worth considering as part of a retiree s longer term portfolio a consumer products juggernaut with a dividend barbara eisner bayer apple when building a retirement portfolio it s risky to be 100 in fixed income because due to inflation your dollar will buy less as you grow older therefore it s important to have some allocation for growth in order to keep up with or beat inflation the superstar growth stock that also pays a dividend yay i recommend is the one and only apple apple thrived through the pandemic as people upgraded their computers and tablets when they were forced to work from home then in the fall of 2020 the company had a successful launch of the iphone 12 how successful within seven months it had sold 100 million units of the 5g model and the forthcoming iphone 13 release is expected to see high demand as well although we often see apple as primarily consumer focused its services business is growing like wildfire it now has 700 million paid subscriptions which is up four times since 2017 and in june services revenue was up 28 from what it was nine months before finally let s not forget that apple is more than just a company it s an empire in addition to the iphone consumers are lapping up apple macs airpods ipads and the amazing apple watch as of the company s first fiscal quarter of 2021 it boasted a worldwide installed base of more than 1 65 billion devices and apple users are fanatics to some degree and unlikely to switch to other ecosystems oh yes then there s the icing on the cake for retirement portfolios as of this writing apple pays a dividend of 0 88 a share which is a yield of 0 6 it may not be much but like with a cake the icing makes it that much more scrumptious apple is offering continued growth a bright future and a dividend for retirement investors if that isn t a superstar stock i don t know what is a superstar that pays out every month eric volkman realty income i have been bullish on retail focused reit realty income for many years and heartily recommend it for a retirement portfolio realty income advertises itself as the monthly dividend company and it does what it says on the label each month without fail it cuts its investors a check currently the reit s dividend yield is a shade over 4 which is a higher figure than a great many dividend stocks even in the relatively high yield reit universe of course the payout has that wonderful benefit of coming in monthly the company has a dividend reinvestment program which is a smart idea for those still saving for retirement plowing those 12 times a year distributions back into realty income stock to nab even more dividends can quickly snowball your investment realty income has been doling out its dividend on the regular since 1994 meaning it s managed to squeeze out a distribution through booms and busts not to mention the roller coaster that has been the coronavirus pandemic as a frequent raiser it is a dividend aristocrat one of the few s p 500 index component companies that has lifted its payout for at least 25 years in a row the reit is a premier operator in its field largely because its tenant base is so durable among its renters are some of the top names in american commerce companies with sprawling retail networks such as 7 eleven cvs health walmart and fedex even through retail apocalypses and global pandemics these businesses endure often because they re essential in person shopping outlets for millions of customers this pack of retail kings makes realty income a reit superstar considered the retail reit by more than a few analysts and pundits the company managed to grow its revenue by 11 to 464 million in its recently reported second quarter adjusted funds from operations arguably the most important profitability yardstick for reits rose at a similar rate landing at nearly 328 million realty income is a hardened veteran in its field and a consistent moneymaker with a rock solid business foundation it unquestionably deserves pride of place in any retirement portfolio
amd is still a top semiconductor investment but these three stocks look like better deals at the moment advanced micro devices amd 0 01 has been an incredible turnaround story under the guidance of ceo lisa su amd has made a comeback from chip industry underdog to technological leader the stock is up over 1 570 over the last five years capped off by a 17 run higher in the last month alone on the back of stellar second quarter 2021 earnings amd could have plenty left in the tank in the years ahead but it isn t the only great chip stock benefiting from record demand for tech hardware three cheaper stocks worth a look right now are skyworks solutions swks 0 11 micron technologies mu 0 70 and kulicke and soffa klic 0 84 a connectivity chip leader and now a whole lot more nicholas rossolillo skyworks solutions skyworks solutions is a leader in providing radio frequency and related circuitry that enables smartphones and other devices to connect to mobile networks and wi fi most notably skyworks has strong ties to apple aapl 0 60 with the iphone maker comprising some half of revenue given the mobility boom of the 2010s it was a fantastic market to be a supplier for skyworks stock rose about 1 200 since the start of 2010 but skyworks has been hard at work diversifying its business outside of smartphones what it calls broad markets about one third of total sales it s about to get a big boost in this department because it just acquired the automotive and infrastructure business of silicon labs slab 0 08 for 2 75 billion in cash this purchase helps the connectivity specialist enter new markets including electric and hybrid vehicle component design industrial equipment and wireless network infrastructure management says the deal will immediately add to the company s already robust profitability making this an even stronger chip designer as demand for advanced circuitry spreads across the economy and while skyworks integrates the takeover from silicon labs into its own operation the smartphone business is doing just fine thanks to the massive upgrade cycle kicked off by 5g mobile during the last quarter the three months ended july 2 2021 skyworks total revenue rose 51 year over year to 1 12 billion and adjusted net income was up 70 to 359 million after the latest quarterly update skyworks solutions shares trade for a reasonable 28 times trailing 12 month free cash flow less than half of what amd is trading for after the latter s sharp run higher in recent weeks full disclosure i have a stake in both semiconductor companies and think they have a bright future however skyworks looks like an especially good long term value right now as it rides the 5g wave and uses its highly profitable business to expand in new directions micron is the best of both worlds anders bylund micron technology memory chip specialist micron technology has a long history of trading at single digit price to earnings ratios and looking like a bargain bin value investment that started to change just before the coronavirus pandemic turned everything upside down and the low p e ratio also continued to rise during the health crisis i understand if you re scratching your head right now why would i recommend buying micron shares right after the stock finally reached a reasonable valuation the stock has gained a market beating 60 over the last 52 weeks surely these aren t the bargain priced stubs you were looking for fortunately micron s strong returns didn t spring from a vacuum the stock is on the rise for good reason and micron can now be treated as a stable value investment for the long haul in the recently reported third quarter of 2021 micron saw 36 year over year revenue growth while bottom line earnings more than doubled these results were achieved at a time when many semiconductor companies experienced and still suffer from a global shortage of chip manufacturing capacity micron runs its own memory chip foundries largely sidestepping the whole shortage situation therefore micron can capitalize on growing demand for advanced electronics more effectively than most of its sector peers from a technology focused perspective micron is on the cutting edge of nand and dram performance and features from a financial point of view times are so good that the company has launched a quarterly dividend program for the first time since the mid 1990s payouts are a modest 0 10 per share so far which works out to an annual yield of 0 5 at current stock prices but management has promised to boost the dividend budget over time in a shareholder friendly effort to put micron s excess cash profits to good use so we are looking at a solid growth stock here poised to keep on growing in the middle of a chip sector recession and the rising stock comes with a side of generous buybacks plus an interesting dividend policy it s the best of both worlds marrying the upside of high growth investments with the classic profile of an income generating value stock one of the cheapest ways to play the 2020s semi boom billy duberstein kulicke and soffa legend has it those that did the best during the 1850s california gold rush weren t the prospectors but rather the companies that sold them picks and shovels that s why one of my favorite ways to play the 2020s semiconductor boom is semiconductor equipment stocks those machines that produce today s highly advanced chips one of the cheapest stocks in that sector is kulicke and soffa k s is a leader in wire bonding equipment for advanced packaging the process that links different chips together with copper wires on printed circuit boards for different applications k s blew away earnings last week and the stock surged some 14 the following day revenue grew a massive 182 over the prior year and adjusted non gaap earnings per share of 1 87 beat analyst estimates by a whopping 0 51 and not only that but management guided to strong sequential growth next quarter as well and yet the stock is still cheap merely annualizing last quarter s eps would put the stock around eight times earnings also k s has a conservative balance sheet with about 10 in net cash around 16 of its market cap and remember management has also guided to strong sequential growth next quarter so why is the stock so cheap given the tailwinds in semiconductor production today mainly k s has a history of being extremely cyclical however given the multiple growth vectors in the industry from 5g to artificial intelligence to autonomous vehicles and factories there seems a good chance the semiconductor industry could become more of a stable growth industry this decade relative to its past on the conference call with analysts ceo fusen chen was optimistic about maintaining the current level of business saying we continue to be amid a period of dramatic capacity expansion throughout the semiconductor industry which is supported by durable and structurally sustainable end market trends in addition to a booming core business in wire bonding and other back end assembly equipment k s is also growing a new segment in equipment for advanced miniled displays although only garnering 60 million 80 million this year chen sees this revenue growing to 150 million by 2024 with growth beyond that so with a stable and growing core a new growth segment in miniled and a very cheap valuation kulicke and soffa still looks like a great long term buy even after its post earnings surge
the general assembly is meeting this week and possibly a few days next week to appropriate the federal covid relief fund made available through the american rescue plan act it is somewhat ironic that these funds are being appropriated at the same time there is a surge in infections mainly from the delta variant and almost totally among eligible persons who have refused to be vaccinated arpa made 9 0 billion in federal funds available to virginia and similar amounts to other states based on the guidelines that accompanied the monies although these are federal monies they must be appropriated by the general assembly in a budget bill passed by a majority in both houses and signed by the governor hb7001 as the budget bill is designated is available for review at lis virginia gov you should know in advance that it is some heavy going that might be best as bedside reading included in arpa are monies for state and local fiscal relief funds slfr that total 4 3 billion for virginia other federal funds that are provided for specific programs include child care development mental health and substance abuse block grants and federal unemployment benefits there are no state general funds that are included in this budget bill as the general assembly will meet again in five months at its regular session when surplus monies from state revenues will be appropriated the budget bill is a consensus document worked on over many weeks among legislators and staff and executive branch staff and is not likely to be amended highlights of the budget bill many of which have already been announced by the governor include 716 billion for broadband expansion the pandemic demonstrated conclusively that broadband is essential to everyone in commerce and in education when children have to learn at home schools will receive 250 million for ventilation improvements that became obvious during the pandemic public health initiatives total 120 million and programs of public safety to reduce community violence will receive 114 5 million mental health and substance abuse programs are proposed to receive 238 million the unemployment compensation program will be replenished with 862 million eliminating the need to raise unemployment fund tax rates among employers an additional 73 6 is being provided to the virginia employment commission to update their technology and increase their staff size as major deficiencies were identified and citizens were poorly served during the pandemic food access programs will receive 25 6 million to ensure that virginians do not go hungry during these challenging times small businesses including the tourism industry will be able to apply for relief from a fund totaling 76 5 million new data from the u s treasury shows that virginia leads all other states on the distribution of rent relief monies and that program will continue while these new monies from the federal government will provide relief to many citizens and to many programs that respond to community needs the ultimate in covid relief rests with the broader community i do not expect that the legislature will mandate vaccinations or the wearing of masks both however may be the best way to realize relief from the ravages of pandemic let s work in our community to ensure that all know the importance of getting vaccinated and wearing masks in crowds ken plum is a member of the virginia house of delegates

skip to comments who owns big pharma big media you ll never guess the defender joe mercola posted on by tired retired blackrock and the vanguard group the two largest asset management firms in the world combined own the new york times and other legacy media along with big pharma big pharma and mainstream media are largely owned by two asset management firms blackrock and vanguard drug companies are driving covid 19 responses all of which so far have endangered rather than optimized public health and mainstream media have been willing accomplices in spreading their propaganda a false official narrative that leads the public astray and fosters fear based on lies vanguard and blackrock are the top two owners of time warner comcast disney and news corp four of the six media companies that control more than 90 of the u s media landscape blackrock and vanguard form a secret monopoly that own just about everything else you can think of too in all they have ownership in 1 600 american firms which in 2015 had combined revenues of 9 1 trillion when you add in the third largest global owner state street their combined ownership encompasses nearly 90 of all s p 500 firms vanguard is the largest shareholder of blackrock vanguard itself on the other hand has a unique structure that makes its ownership more difficult to discern but many of the oldest richest families in the world can be linked to vanguard funds a bloomberg report states that both these companies in the year 2028 together will have investments in the amount of 20 trillion dollars that means that they will own almost everything interestingly vanguard is the largest shareholder of blackrock as of march 2021 vanguard itself on the other hand has a unique corporate structure that makes its ownership more difficult to discern excerpt read more at childrenshealthdefense org topics conspiracy keywords banking blackrock drugs finance investment media realty vanguard this is why dr joe mercola is under attack he followed the to the snake s head to tired retired per the article as reported in the featured video the elite who own vanguard apparently do not like being in the spotlight but of course they cannot hide from who is willing to dig reports from oxfam and bloomberg say that 1 of the world together owns more money than the other 99 even worse oxfam says that 82 of all earned money in 2017 went to this 1 in other words these two investment companies vanguard and blackrock hold a monopoly in all industries in the world and they in turn are owned by the richest families in the world some of whom are royalty and who have been very rich since before the industrial revolution while it would take time to sift through all of vanguard s funds to identify individual shareholders and therefore owners of vanguard a quick look see suggests rothschild investment corp and the edmond de rothschild holding are two such stakeholders keep the name rothschild in your mind as you read on as it will feature again later the video above also identifies the italian orsini family the american bush family the british royal family the du pont family the morgans vanderbilts and rockefellers as vanguard owners blackrock vanguard own big pharma according to simply wall street in february 2020 blackrock and vanguard were the two largest shareholders of glaxosmithkline at 7 and 3 5 of shares respectively at pfizer the ownership is reversed with vanguard being the top investor and blackrock the second largest stockholder top owners of pfizer inc keep in mind that stock ownership ratios can change at any time since companies buy and sell on a regular basis so don t get hung up on percentages the bottom line is that blackrock and vanguard individually and combined own enough shares at any given time that we can say they easily control both big pharma and the centralized legacy media and then some why does this matter it matters because drug companies are driving covid 19 responses all of which so far have endangered rather than optimized public health and mainstream media have been willing accomplices in spreading their propaganda a false official narrative that has and still is leading the public astray and fosters fear based on lies blackrock vanguard own the media when it comes to the new york times as of may 2021 blackrock is the second largest stockholder at 7 43 of total shares just after the vanguard group which owns the largest portion 8 11 in addition to the new york times vanguard and blackrock are also the top two owners of time warner comcast disney and news corp four of the six media companies that control more than 90 of the u s media landscape needless to say if you have control of this many news outlets you can control entire nations by way of carefully orchestrated and organized centralized propaganda disguised as journalism blackrock and vanguard own the media if your head is spinning already you re not alone it s difficult to describe circular and tightly interwoven relationships in a linear fashion the world of corporate ownership is labyrinthine where everyone seems to own everyone to some degree considering blackrock in 2018 announced that it has social expectations from the companies it invests in its potential role as a central hub in the great reset and the build back better plan cannot be overlooked that assertion will become even clearer once you realize that this duo s influence is not limited to big pharma and the media importantly blackrock also works closely with central banks around the world including the u s federal reserve which is a private entity not a federal one it lends money to the central bank acts as an adviser to it and develops the central bank s software blackrock vanguard also own shares of a long list of other companies including microsoft apple amazon facebook and alphabet inc as illustrated in the graphic of blackrock and vanguard s ownership network below featured in the 2017 article these three firms own corporate america in the conversation it would be near impossible to list them all in all blackrock and vanguard have ownership in some 1 600 american firms which in 2015 had combined revenues of 9 1 trillion when you add in the third largest global owner state street their combined ownership encompasses nearly 90 of all s p 500 firms blackrock and vanguard

get the investment dollars propping up their shares of stock they have to play by their rules that means playing by all the leftist globalist pc agenda driven bs that is destroying our nation without the trillions the fed is giving them to prop up the stock market the market would crash in a big way they are also investing in private real estate because they know they money won t be free for us to

commentary six chinese technology stocks lost 1 1 trillion worth of market value since they peaked in february more than a 40 percent drop according to the wall street journal u s institutional investors with more than 2 3 trillion in the country are rightly concerned many are slowly trying to unwind their positions without causing the market to drop too quickly by selling in a precipitous fashion they are watching for any sign of regulatory troubles in china such as a critical article in a state run journal or the initiation of an investigation which can wipe out billions more of their dollars overnight xi jinping s aggressive policies are the cause of the market rout in china investors unwisely ignored his threats of war against the united states and australia and actual territorial incursions including in air and maritime space against taiwan japan india bhutan and the philippines over the past decade now that xi s actions are against corporations and are wiping out more than a trillion dollars of market value virtually overnight investors are finally and rightly taking notice stock prices of alibaba group holding ltd baba sw top c drop on the hong kong stock exchange after its financial wing ant group s record breaking ipo was suspended the night before on nov 4 2020 anthony wallace afp via getty images this expensive lesson for investors is helping them realize that their econ 101 class and its knee jerk free trade liberalism ill prepared them for political risks at the extreme end of competition including hot wars trade wars tech wars and influence wars the perfect information rational preferences and independence assumptions of simple economic modeling that is naive to politics are simultaneously violated in this brave new world of economic predation that xi is ushering after allowing america to be half digested by the anaconda that china has become american and allied politicians are finally starting to wake up they are realizing that china is manipulating western corporations which seek to maximize shareholder value rather than patriotic values apple for example is still offshoring production from democratic countries and producers including from taiwanese companies most recently to china and its companies this american company apparently thinks it can use its political influence in washington to lobby for its special interests over the national interest of america and the democratic values for which americans stand china tries to exploit free market language to insert its predatory exports into unwary economies globally but china is anything but free as should be clear from its enslavement of uyghur labor and theft of up to 600 billion of u s intellectual property annually rational actors should no longer allow china to use these unnatural advantages to wipe out their indigenous corporations market share revenues research and development down that path lies yet more chinese economic power with which comes political power power tends to concentrate which should have all of us around the world particularly concerned if that power is concentrating in such an illiberal capital as beijing the rational response is to economically decouple from this madman xi and his chinese communist party ccp for the time being that means decoupling from china until the country can get its act together and cease its predatory behavior against neighbors and trading partners the country is so powerful already however that doing so will require unified and focused action by a coalition of the world s most powerful democracies along with friends and allies such as vietnam and saudi arabia that want to retain their independence and sovereignty from beijing in the long run the ccp s assault on rival power bases in and around china includes not only billionaires but religions and ethnicities such as the uyghurs and other turkic muslims tibetans falun gong and christians regions such as hong kong and countries such as taiwan japan the philippines and australia this aggression against others should be a warning to those large corporations around the world that are still independent even if they can continue to make money in china in the short run perhaps because the country is a massive ponzi scheme with poor securities and exchange commission reporting requirements and shell companies into which international investors pour their billions they are funding a totalitarian government that s threatening world peace and ultimately corporate market value in the ai enabled nuclear era in which countries have the capability to down each others electric grids through electromagnetic pulses emp send drone swarms against each others population centers and bypass missile defenses with hypersonic technologies achieving investment gains in china should pale in comparison to the systemic risk of enabling china s continued rise corporations with a long term vision of shareholder value should be working overtime to maintain the ascendancy of peaceful and democratic states in the international system that enables free trade markets and institutions to operate and mediate among allied democratic countries peace democracy institutions and trade thrive together because historically democracies support markets and the rule of law and almost never attack each other the rise of china threatens this benign triad and means that ethics and business survival not only can but must coincide the international system of free trade and free markets between democracies as we have known it since 1945 is under an existential and totalitarian threat the assured defense of our values and long term prosperity is now or never views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do

scott simon host farmers and ranchers can be trusted voices in their rural communities and because they work with animals they understand the science and value of vaccines that could position them to help convince some of their vaccine hesitant neighbors to roll up their sleeves christine herman at will in central illinois went to find out if farmers are taking on that challenge christine herman byline when the coronavirus vaccine first became available for him in illinois tom arnold says he didn t need any convincing he raises cattle hogs and chickens in elizabeth a small rural town in the northwest corner of the state tom arnold some friends they said well you know we don t trust the vaccine other people still weren t convinced that the vaccine was the way to go and i always felt that was a little cavalier i felt i had no problem being vaccinated myself herman after all who better to understand why herd immunity matters than a herdsman arnold being a livestock producer i m well aware of vaccinations and vaccines that s how we develop immunity in our animals we re always vaccinating the breeding stock to pass on immunity to the little ones herman the problem is that arnold s among the minority of people in his county who ve chosen to get the vaccine scientists warn under vaccinated parts of the country are at serious risk especially with the more contagious delta variant spreading arnold believes the vaccine saves lives but he doesn t think it s his job to convince neighbors or friends he says it s too politicized arnold i just i don t want to get into a discussion on right or wrong herman plus he gets it there s just so much information floating around he says it s hard to know what to believe and he doesn t think he personally could change anyone s mind larry lieb feels the same way he s 69 and lives in central illinois where he s got 92 acres of soybeans and timber and raises a few cows and pigs soundbite of whistle larry lieb come here pig soundbite of pig oinking lieb come on pig herman lieb says he was a little worried himself because the vaccine was developed so fast and he really only got it for one reason lieb my daughter is a respiratory therapist and she told me i was going to get it plain and simple herman unlike some of his relatives lieb says he does not buy into conspiracy theories about the vaccine but he avoids those conversations altogether lieb it s their own personal choice i mean you know on issues where they re set in their ways you know i mean it s futile to try herman lieb and arnold belong to the national farmers union which has been urging its members to speak up about the vaccine in their rural communities but it s not easy carrie cochran mcclain is with the national rural health association which is also hoping that more rural americans will get vaccinated if they hear from trusted neighbors like arnold carrie cochran mcclain one of the hardest things about the vaccination effort is that it really at this point is almost down to those one on one kind of conversations and message sharing and so he may not feel like his voice is much but we believe that it s very strong and important herman ryan goodman has heard the calls from the national level and he s giving it a try he s a cattle rancher in virginia and self described agriculture advocate on instagram and twitter he s known as the beef runner goodman has been using social media to engage with his followers about the vaccine he says he s not sure he s changed any minds but he s encouraged when skeptics who seem unconvinced return for more dialogue ryan goodman you know i m a fan of saying no one conversation changes someone s mind especially when you disagree on a topic that might be as hot or as political as vaccines and these vaccine programs herman goodman wants to see more farmers speaking up because in rural towns he says farmers are more likely to be believed than even health experts goodman you know everybody looks at joe down the road and thinks hey you know what might be his experiences on this topic or this issue or kind of listens to what he or she may say herman tom arnold also sees himself as trusted in his community he says he ll answer questions if people ask him but he s a pretty busy guy arnold i m already overworked and underpaid there are other people i feel that may be retired or have more free time that should be doing those things herman meanwhile only about 40 of his county is fully vaccinated he says he doesn t really get why people are acting like the pandemic

commentary welcome to the newest frontier in the struggle between the united states and china for geopolitical dominance the struggle for control of the strategic commodity of the future data the latest casualty in this battle is didi the chinese uber uber 2 8 percent lookalike with 377 million annual active users and 13 million annual active drivers its agony began soon after didi shares started trading publicly in new york following a 4 4 billion initial public offering little more than two weeks later chinese authorities sent state security and police officials into didi s offices the official story was that authorities worried the data didi users share with the company including cellphone numbers that in china are linked to their real names and identifications are insufficiently protected especially from the prying eyes of didi s foreign investors a related crackdown on a range of chinese companies doing business in the united states has sent chinese tech stocks reeling worldwide beijing s claim that it was only trying to protect the privacy and security of didi s users however is patently false the real issue is that the chinese communist party ccp worries that americans might be doing with chinese data what beijing is doing with american data i e using it to advance their intelligence goals a screen shows visitors being filmed by ai artificial intelligence security cameras with facial recognition technology at the 14th china international exhibition on public safety and security at the china international exhibition center in beijing on oct 24 2018 nicolas asfouri afp via getty images china s cooptation of public data by hook or by crook for strategic purposes is exactly why the trump administration contemplated banning the popular social media app tiktok a move i vociferously argued for in this column and why the trump administration was committed to winning the epic battle with chinese telecom equipment giant huawei over the future of 5g except this time it s the chinese authorities not their american counterparts who seem to be jittery about who might be collecting and analyzing data they d prefer to stay in chinese hands consider that fear a compliment and an unearned one our government including this current administration is still far behind china in realizing that data has become the new strategic commodity for global dominance it fuels our artificial intelligence and machine learning tools and our global markets and financial systems it determines the effectiveness of our health care system and medical advances including controlling covid it will control our future transport systems including driverless cars and it will determine how our governments make decisions and how we defend ourselves in short what coal and steel were to national power in the 19th century or oil and fossil fuels in the 20th century access and control of data will be in the 21st century the reason why data will determine the fate of nations is very simple ai it can take all that seemingly random and irrelevant data and extract patterns and relationships that become the grist for the intelligence mills the proliferation of open data from weather reports and social media to government and economic statistics plus the rapid growth of machine learning ml thanks to cloud access and improved specialized hardware for ml means that it s easier than ever to turn random data into meaningful information through pattern recognition and prediction modeling the bread and butter of ai the result is a coherent picture that can shape strategic and operational plans and give an antagonist an unseen advantage by sometimes knowing more about his or her opponent than they know themselves in the chinese case this capability becomes even more frightening it s well known that the ccp uses ai for social and political engineering by rewarding obedience and punishing dissent even before it happens beijing has also learned to export its social credit system to countries that see security in conformity and dissent as a threat with 5g the flow of data will become a flood these advanced wireless services will be moving data from upwards of 3 million connected devices per square mile compared to 10 000 per square mile for 4g including your smartphone and automobile photos and emails almost instantaneously no wonder china wants its catspaw huawei to take the lead in setting up 5g around the world and no wonder the united states and its more sensible allies want to stop that from happening attendees walk past a display for 5g services from chinese technology firm huawei at the pt expo in beijing chinese tech giant huawei says its 2019 sales rose 19 1 percent over a year earlier despite u s sanctions that hampered its smartphone and network equipment businesses mark schiefelbein ap photo giving china the license to collect and mining all that data will give them a strategic advantage for the rest of the century add in the possibilities of quantum computing as china s ai ml accelerator and we re looking at a decisive gain for the chinese communist regime that will be transformational not only for china but for humanity a brand new report by my hudson colleague patrick cronin on china s striving for total information dominance has stated in our advanced digital age data illuminates the pathway to economic supremacy and information power the united states and its allies must develop a strategy to win the data wars and maintain the image of the free flow of information as a hallmark of freedom not a building block for totalitarian control views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times

something went wrong please try again later invalid email something went wrong please try again later something went wrong please try again later as record store back rooms go diverse vinyl s is pretty much what you d expect surprisingly spacious given the modest size of the shop floor that greets you when you walk in on charles street newport we sit in a music lover s paradise gig posters and band memorabilia adorn the walls alphabetised lps are filed high above us on dusty shelves and typed stock lists are tacked up next to computer screens and of course there are the many piles of brown boxes filled with vinyl just inches from me daring me to take a peek inside read more leisure centre forced to close its swimming pool permanently after deeming it beyond viable repair for paul hawkins who has run diverse vinyl for 23 years it is the perfect space for the business to operate its mail order vinyl service where hundreds of records are unboxed packaged up and sent out to delighting customers around the uk each week when we moved in 1999 we decided we needed a bigger back room to do the mail order he explained image walesonline rob browne although it would be a decade before he actually owned the business himself paul s love affair with diverse began when he was a school boy i was about 15 it was 1988 and diverse music a new record shop opened in town he remembered my uncle asked mark at the counter what album everyone was buying that week it was fisherman s blues by the waterboys so i bought that i still have it at home i think a self confessed music fanatic paul said his teenage years saw him consume everything from adam and the ants to indie rock and american hip hop i was just getting into music i just used to buy whatever was in the charts whatever would annoy your parents that kind of thing he laughed i then got into the independent music scene the indie guitar sound bands like the smiths and the cure were huge i started getting into all sorts really but i was mainly an indie kid at that age striking up a friendship with diverse vinyl founder john richards and mark southall who worked in the shop paul would regularly visit after school to pick up the latest releases he described the shop at that time as a social hub even in the late eighties when times were tough it wasn t a really good time economically there was a recession looming people are really supportive of new things in newport and i guess a record shop was one of those things people came in to check out it was the sort of place you d listen to new music talk to people about it get influenced in your taste i got lots of recommendations and suggestions of what to listen to for a music fan it was a good place to hang out definitely newport was quite buzzing then there was a live music scene there were students everywhere artists were around there was an art college that was really busy so it was a good environment to be into music image walesonline rob browne paul now 48 later left newport to go to university in coventry but would always come back during holidays to add to his ever growing collection after being rebuffed on a few occasions when he offered his services paul eventually landed a job in diverse in the mid nineties i kept plugging away and eventually i caught them at the right time and they offered me a part time job he said several years later founder john richards wanted to move on and the opportunity to buy the business came up john felt as though as he was approaching 50 at the time he didn t feel he was down with the kids if you like as a record shop owner you speak to all kinds of people but by and large music was a young person s pursuit at the time and he felt a bit disconnected with what they were into and just thought it was time for a change i think ironically i m now two years off the same age he was when he sold the business and yet i ve kind of grown old with the clientele because the new kids coming through don t listen to music in the same way they re on youtube or streaming they re not coming to a place to listen to things in the way you had to in 80s or 90s paul took over the business in 1998 at a time when cd sales were dwarfing vinyl and online had not even really begun but the rise of napster and the onset of file sharing in the early 2000s presented an existential threat to the physical music industry like none ever seen before there was a lot of doom and gloom paul admitted off the wave of oasis and other britpop era bands selling millions of physical copies of things here we had a situation where the whole industry could be compromised by moving online where there s no physical product and there s no way to maintain control over that music but rather as he tells it grabbing an opportunity paul said the industry held onto the old ways of doing business for dear life image walesonline rob browne he said physical sales took a long time to get sorted before people began paying for music again when downloading began to thrive we definitely noticed a change our racks were all cds at the time and we could see sales reps filling its racks with cds nobody was really buying but it was also around then that the shop seized its major opportunity in a matter of happenstance that would end up keeping it alive during the uncertain years we d been mail ordering vinyl since the mid nineties anyway john was a vinyl man and he d bought a computer in the late nineties as part of a separate project which fell through back then computers were big clunky machines and he d spent a few thousands pounds on it so he thought i ll document all the records we have here instead and make a database that s when the mail order started all of a sudden we ve got a printable list of the stuff we ve got if someone orders something we thought put in a list of the other stuff we could get the next thing we ve got a decent mail order business if it all sounds a bit archaic now given how easy it is to find out about new releases at the click of a button back then running a mail order vinyl service was a golden ticket out of a rocky road created by the internet eventually we discovered that we were the only people really doing this paul explained other shops weren t buying the vinyl all the established artists whether it was paul weller neil young always put vinyl out because they knew the fans wanted to collect them all it soon became apparent that we were one of the few shops in the country bothering to sell vinyl most places had moved onto cd virgin megastores and the like were throwing away their vinyl racking in fact that racking we have in the shop now is from a virgin megastore paul said the shop was happy to fill the small market for vinyl for many years after the big retailers had ditched the platform while diverse stocked thousands of cds it began to do steady business from people ringing from out of town to order vinyl copies of new releases people would ring and say god i ve rung around 12 other shops for that paul weller album and we d have it suddenly we re like there s an idea here you know image walesonline rob browne by the turn of the millennium diverse boasted one of the biggest stocks of vinyl in the uk searching out imports from usa germany and japan to buy in whatever was being made we were shifting units that other shops wouldn t believe it was absolutely incredible if it was out on vinyl we had it in stock simple as that happily for diverse which celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2018 the re emergence of vinyl has surged 2020 marked the first year in a generation that vinyl sales rose above cd sales and the days where diverse had the space to stock every title have long gone people talk about the vinyl revival but we d been on it a decade before in the year 2000 there might ve been 2 3 000 titles on vinyl then so it was quite easy to keep them all fast forward to 2021 i could buy 2 000 jazz albums alone paul said i can t stock everything in the racks so we ve gone from being a one stop shop for vinyl to trying to rotate the stock putting out lists online saying what is available and telling people what we can get in but it took a long time to get to that point when i started we were scrambling trying to find enough stuff to go on the website remembers matt jarrett 44 who has worked in diverse for nearly 15 years now we put in about 20 of what we get sent because everything is out you ve got to pick and choose paul conceded there were moments of uncertainty during the years of upheaval for the industry there was a lot of people making a lot of money in the nineties label reps were doing very well lots of tickets available for things you kind of got the impression the industry was full of excess as the potential for physical items became less certain there were a few casualties a few labels relying on volume couldn t sustain themselves places like virgin and hmv couldn t justify the floor space for the turnover that was possible so they disappeared there were a few issues but from the independent point of view things just carried on we just had to focus on what we were good at and hope our clientele jumped on board with that it became quite obvious that there was more potential in vinyl long term as long as the pressing plants could keep it going many record shops have come and gone on newport s high street since diverse opened hitman our price roxscene records and hmv just to name a few image walesonline rob browne but today diverse stands alone despite the further double whammy of brexit and the coronavirus pandemic as far as coping with a pandemic which forced most businesses to close for months i suggest having a long running mail order service might have set the business up better than others we ve had a really good year i guess people are listening to more records i ve been listening to more records being at home matt said i work in here two days a week we ve tried to do it with minimal staffing before we d have three of us in but actually you get into a different way of working i find i m getting more done at home getting stuff into the system it s worked quite well for us people haven t stopped buying stuff we re still waiting for it to change maybe if people start going back to work or have less money but at the moment people seem more than happy to carry on buying vinyl and listening to it while they re working when john left he said he thought there were legs in the vinyl side of things rather than cd and it turned out to be right added paul the whole time you think oh the bubble s going to burst give it five years that was in 1998 i m 48 now and i m still waiting for it to drop off you ll have a couple of rubbish years things happen like companies shutting but everyone from tesco to urban outfitters is doing vinyl now more is getting made so we re busier with more releases but also there s more competition said matt if hmv weren t there the labels wouldn t press vinyl and we wouldn t have anything to sell so it s worth it being there for us what has also changed is the level of diversity pardon the pun in the shop s customer base two of my school friends have both got 15 year old daughters who buy records from us a lot of our customers online are older buying a lot of jazz audiophile pressings while the shop tends to be a younger crowd matt said people who used to come into the shop and ask if we could get something for them are ordering online and picking it up in store and paul said he felt the pandemic had changed many people s shopping habits for good you won t change that back now retail had 50 years and now it s probably had ten years taken off its life because of how quickly people have been forced into shopping online while the pair admitted they could theoretically dispense with having a physical shop matt said they d probably go nuts if they were stuck at home 24 7 while paul said he s happy they ve never chosen to go online only before we moved we thought should we just go mail order and i m glad we didn t because we d have driven ourselves mad he said we looked at a couple of units one of which was cheap but in the middle of nowhere then this place came up for the same price and we thought we could be on a trading estate or we could still have a presence on the high street and mainly be a mail order business but with the opportunity for people to walk through the door without it we wouldn t be part of record store day or anything like that i m so glad we did that our clientele are mainly slightly older than us and they don t trust companies that haven t got a physical presence amazon is something they re just not comfortable with where you can t really ring them up or email them image walesonline rob browne the shop has also had a number of famous visitors throughout the years including the likes of oasis van morrison and 60 ft dolls van morrison has been in twice i think one of our guys actually made him laugh i remember recalled paul flicking through the racks stocking everything from bob dylan to jazz hip hop metal independent releases from local artists and many more besides it s refreshing to see shop stay true to the name above the door all these years later the reason the shop is called diverse is because john didn t want to pigeon hole it and wanted to be a catch all said paul you can t be everything to everyone anymore but people can t walk in here and say we re a rock shop or a reggae shop we are still a bit of everything one of my customers said one of the great things about the shop is coming in to buy a specific record and walking out without it but with five other records you ve never heard of because they ve come up to the counter heard something they liked playing next thing they ve got three or four other suggestions and they walk out with the lot that s kind of the whole point of record stores it s not just to sell music it s to be part of the industry around the creation of new music if it wasn t for people behind counters like this getting excited about it then the whole industry would be pretty doomed really having celebrated 30 years open in 2018 diverse didn t have a 30th anniversary party but paul said they re hoping to have a 33 1 3 party to make up for it pandemic pending for a place which has been a home from home for so many vinyl lovers over the years it seems pretty fitting

machinery and employees failed to make it on the race simulator when johnson took a seat as he tried to learn the first new street course on the indycar schedule in a decade the real deal was so much better i have optimism and excitement for a bumpy circuit a tight circuit quirky corners he said i think that stuff makes for better racing johnson s optimism runs high for the bulk of his racing future from his steadfast belief that he can turn the corner in his rookie season for chip ganassi racing to a potential run next season in the indianapolis 500 i m probably going to be more careful in this decision than anything i ve done johnson said for all the fans and those in the industry who clamor to see johnson conquer the brickyard in an open wheel car the seven time nascar champion s calculated decision to race in may comes down to safety vs desire and he s still firmly on the fence it s not just the treacherous 200 mph speeds on ovals that force johnson s wife and two young daughters to pause as they consider giving him the green light and chase his indy dream johnson s longtime attorney allen miller had five drivers killed that he represented at one time in open wheel racing indycar hasn t had a driver killed since justin wilson in 2015 from injuries suffered when he was struck by debris at pocono indycar has since introduced an aeroscreen that covers the open air cockpit now it s like wow that can t happen johnson said it s helped us helped me way more than it helped her big picture yes she s trending the same way but she s never seen a car run at 200 johnson will get a taste of that speed today coming into turn 9 of the 2 17 mile track that weaves around the city he is perhaps the most famous face in the series and was stopped for an autograph and a photo this week by one fan who jumped out of a car in traffic to meet the driver johnson got caught up in the hoopla too and stretched his arm in front of the pace car and snapped a photo through the windshield of driver dario franchitti and a korean war veteran as they were about to take the ceremonial first lap through downtown nashville he s soaked in all sorts of new experiences in indycar he s even tutored sage karam who finished ninth in the indy 500 as a rookie and seventh this year as the driver attempts his first nascar race later this month in indianapolis he should know how it feels johnson spent the last year seeking advice from fellow indycar drivers like scott dixon to better make the adjustment from stock cars to open wheel it s interesting because clearly i m having my challenges in understanding and adapting to these cars he said johnson burst onto the nascar scene in 2002 with a fifth place finish in the standings was runner up twice then blazed his road toward the hall of fame with five consecutive championships from 2006 10 he won cup titles again in 2013 and 2016 before he raced the final three years of his career without a victory remaining stuck on 83 wins since june 2017 he s not against a spot start in nascar if a great opportunity came along i d definitely look hard at it and probably do it johnson said up first johnson will test later this month on the oval at homestead miami speedway as part of a path toward running in indy i m running around the back of the pack now on street and road courses and thinking man if i was on an oval where would i be johnson said that s the balance i m fighting with right now the risk versus reward during an oval race johnson worked the indy 500 as an analyst this year for nbc and got a first hand look at safety upgrades in the sport i m becoming much more comfortable with the ovals and with the crash dynamics that take place with softer walls the halo the aeroscreen the top of the car and i m at a point now where in a funny way i m willing to go hit a wall he said he s hit one figuratively in his indycar learning curve where fast cars and encouraging results have been scarce a rookie at 45 johnson hasn t finished better than 19th in his seven indycar races i thought that so much of this would be closer than it has been and i ve been more surprised than anyone johnson said i ve always been very fair and realistic and honest with myself about challenges i would take on but learning a new track and learning this car all at the same time is a lot to handle file in this may 14 2021

you ll often hear that retiring on social security alone isn t feasible those benefits will only replace about 40 of your wages if you re an average earner and most seniors need more like 70 to 80 of their income replaced to live comfortably that s where personal savings come in the money you sock away in a 401 k or ira could along with your social security benefits provide you with a nice income for your senior years there s just one problem a lot of people wait too long to start setting funds arise for retirement it s easy to see why this is in our 20s we re focused on paying off educational debt as we establish our careers in our 30s our spare money is often earmarked as a down payment on a home and in our 40s we re forced to start saving for our own kids college education so they don t wind up in debt like we did as such many people reach the later stages of their careers without a lot of money in retirement savings the good news is that workers 50 and older get the option to make catch up contributions in their retirement plans the bad news however is that only a small percentage of older workers actually take advantage of that option a lot of people are missing out catch up contributions are a great tool for making up for lost time on the retirement savings front but among retirement plans offering catch up contributions only 15 of participants aged 50 or older took advantage of them last year according to vanguard s how america saves 2021 report what can catch up contributions do for you let s say you re 57 years old and want to retire in a decade and you have 200 000 in your 401 k already let s also assume your 401 k is invested to deliver an average annual 7 return which is a bit below the stock market s average if you were to max out your 401 k for the next 10 years at 19 500 which is the highest allowable contribution for younger savers who can t make catch ups then you d grow your balance to about 663 000 but if you were to make catch up contributions of 6 500 which 401 k s allow for during that time on top of putting in 19 500 a year you d grow your balance to about 753 000 all told making catch up contributions in your 401 k could in this scenario leave you 90 000 richer in retirement that s not a small amount of money now to be fair the impact of catch up contributions in an ira is less significant since ira catch ups max out at 1 000 this isn t to say that you shouldn t still try to make them but they will have less of an effect on your total savings but if you have a 401 k then it really pays to push yourself to make those 6 500 catch ups especially if you feel you re behind on savings keep in mind too that catch up contribution limits can also change over time and if they increase you ll have even more opportunity to save if you re nearing the end of your career with a heaping pile of savings then you may not need to worry about catch up contributions but if your savings could use a boost then it pays to eke out that extra money doing so could spell the difference between grappling with financial stress in retirement or having a much easier time covering your expenses

the highest yielding s p 500 stock may need to cut its dividend next year but for a good reason earlier this year lumen technologies lumn 0 29 management indicated a strong interest in selling non core assets to reduce debt and get the company growing again last tuesday the high yield telecom giant announced its second major asset sale in as many weeks wall street and ordinary investors weren t impressed the dividend stock plunged 8 8 on wednesday lumen stock has now given back most of its gains from earlier this year the negative reaction may have something to do with lumen s status as a high yield stock between the divestitures and a plan to ramp up investments in fiber infrastructure lumen may need to cut its dividend yet lumen s long term upside makes the stock a great buy anyway two big asset sales set for 2022 on july 26 lumen announced an agreement to sell its latin american business to stonepeak an alternative investment firm for 2 7 billion approximately nine times the unit s 2020 adjusted ebitda lumen expects the sale to close in the first half of 2022 this divestiture surprised many investors as bloomberg had previously reported that lumen was negotiating the sale of part of its traditional u s copper wire telecom business to private equity firm apollo global that rumored deal came together earlier this week on tuesday lumen announced that affiliates of apollo had agreed to buy its incumbent local exchange carrier assets in 20 states mainly in the south and midwest for 7 5 billion including 1 4 billion of assumed debt lumen will retain its traditional telecom business in 16 states mainly in the western half of the u s with the notable exception of florida the ilec assets lumen is selling generated approximately 1 4 billion of adjusted ebitda on 2 5 billion of revenue in 2020 lumen expects to finalize this asset sale in the second half of 2022 free cash flow pressure could drive a dividend cut last year lumen generated about 1 billion of its 3 1 billion of free cash flow from the ilec operations it plans to sell the latin american business contributed another 100 million or so management will use much of the deal proceeds to pay down debt that will reduce interest expense but at best it might offset half of the lost free cash flow meanwhile taxable gains related to these asset sales will run through the rest of lumen s tax credits related to past taxable losses as a result lumen will pay higher cash taxes going forward further pressuring free cash flow finally lumen plans to ramp up capital spending on fiber upgrades for its remaining copper wire assets together these factors point to significantly lower free cash flow after the asset sales close which will increase lumen s free cash flow payout ratio for now lumen is maintaining its generous 0 25 per share quarterly dividend which costs about 1 1 billion annually but management isn t ruling out the possibility of a future dividend cut a good price for subpar assets this risk of a future dividend reduction may make lumen unattractive as a dividend stock per se nevertheless lumen s pending asset sales could pave the way for significant share price appreciation a few years down the road apollo is paying approximately 5 5 times ebitda for some of lumen s least attractive assets the fast declining voice other category accounts for about half of lumen s revenue in the states it is exiting mass market broadband service makes up most of the remainder and nearly all of that consists of slower dsl connections just 3 of the 7 million addressable locations in that footprint are fiber enabled today by contrast the ilec operations lumen will retain are over 11 fiber enabled today moreover the asset sales mean the company will get a higher percentage of its revenue from fiber based services like edge computing and high speed data transport in developed markets today lumen trades at around five times ebitda six times ebitda including its non debt liabilities lumen stock is significantly undervalued at that price given that apollo was willing to pay 5 5 times ebitda for some of the company s least attractive assets fiber investments will pay off in the long run as noted above lumen plans to spend heavily to accelerate fiber upgrades in its remaining ilec footprint management estimates that perhaps 15 million of its addressable locations would be suitable for fiber this will require many billions of dollars of incremental capex which will weigh heavily on near term free cash flow potentially forcing lumen to cut its dividend however fiber subscribers pay more for internet service particularly as they upgrade to higher speed tiers additionally they are stickier than dsl subscribers who are steadily migrating to faster alternatives as the fiber upgrade plan gains traction it should get lumen s mass markets segment growing again lumen shareholders may have a bumpy ride in the near term due to the potential for another dividend cut but selling lower quality assets and reinvesting in more promising markets should dramatically improve lumen s revenue trajectory rewarding patient investors with a much higher valuation a few years from now
lucy sherriff underscore when bureau of reclamation water managers decided not to perform a surface flush of the klamath river this year they knew there might be an explosion of a parasite that could all but wipe out salmon populations that s exactly what happened in northern california where the yurok tribe depends on fishing for income and food salmon are also an important part of their culture on the first friday in june an early summer day that would later be ingrained many yurok citizens memories barry mccovey director of the yurok tribe s fisheries department and his colleagues fished 361 dead juvenile chinook salmon out of a monitoring trap on the klamath river it was by far the single highest daily count of dead young salmon since the river s catastrophic fish kill began at the beginning of may a dieoff that will create economic shortfalls for years to come during drought years the bureau of reclamation releases tens of thousands of acre feet of water from the upper klamath lake the surface flush improves water quality and reduces parasites in the klamath river this year amidst calls by water users upstream to cancel the surface flush they didn t since may more than 70 of the juvenile salmon population in california s second largest river has been found dead the klamath river flows 257 miles from its headwaters in oregon to empty into the pacific ocean on california s coast the river provides a vital first food source for the yurok tribe thousands of klamath river chinook salmon a central part of both the culture and the economy of the tribe return to breed the tribe fishes around 11 000 salmon from the river annually essential nutrition for a community whose average income is around 14 000 our very existence depends on this healthy river mccovey said we re not getting our food salmon is one of the most healthy protein sources on the planet and we need it because what s the alternative people are struggling on the reservation there s not a lot of jobs and to be able to access the one of the highest quality food sources in the world right in your backyard is incredible the fish that died this year would be expected to return to the river and spawn in two to four years we anticipate very low returns mccovey said so this catastrophe will impact us for many years to come there are no grocery stores on the yurok reservation for those living on the eastern edge the nearest store is a three hour round trip we live in a food desert here mccovey continued so those alternative options aren t healthy it s a lot of carbohydrates hamburgers fried chicken things that aren t good for people for the past few years the tribe has been devastated by low salmon stocks leading to what its leaders have termed a crisis the yurok reservation borders the klamath river s final 44 miles before it gets there the river flows over state lines and through the lands of other tribal nations many of those upstream also have a stake in the water farmers upstream and the klamath tribes in oregon who want the water retained to protect habitat for endangered and culturally important suckerfish species had pressed the bureau of reclamation not to go through with the downstream flush it s a fraught issue that has been exacerbated by a worsening drought that shows no signs of subsiding in the coming years there is simply not enough water in the klamath basin to meet everyone s needs even after canceling the flush the bureau of reclamation closed an important irrigation canal leaving 400 000 acres of farmland without water each year gates are lifted to allow water to gush from the lake into a complex canal system which irrigates farmland a group of protesters have already set up camp by the gates saying they are ready to take the water needed to quench the land by force if necessary proposal to improve habitat some believe the planned removal of several dams along the klamath could create a regular flow of water that would improve quality and reduce disease and ease the claims on the water in the upper klamath lake the klamath dam removal is slated to be completed by 2024 but has not yet begun california water board experts believe removing the four dams will have significant benefits for wildlife including salmon populations water that is not flushed down the river to address fish disease and poor water quality is potentially more water left in upper klamath lake to be used for other purposes explains dave meurer community liaison for the klamath river renewal corporation a nonprofit overseeing the dam removal project the surface flush uses 50 000 acre feet of water not an insignificant percentage of the 400 000 acre feet amount used by farmers water in the west is often a source of conflict and litigation while krrc does not determine who gets water our project leads to better water quality reduced disease and more robust populations of fish meurer said of the dam removal project we believe that improved water quality and recovering fish species can potentially help alleviate regulatory pressure on agriculture while degraded water quality and fewer fish tends to increase regulatory burdens on farmers and ranchers farmers however are worried dam removal could come with stringent regulations further limiting their water rights there is a fear the irrigators in the klamath project the bureau of reclamation s name for its regional farming program could be required to take on costs of operation and maintenance of the two dams not being removed that are currently operated by pacificorp says paul simmons executive director klamath water users association the very outcome yurok tribe resource managers are hoping for improved habitat for salmon could have a negative outcome for farmers simmons said if salmon move into areas along the california oregon state line where farmers divert water there is a risk of new regulatory burdens he said water in the region has been mismanaged for decades say farmers and tribal nations alike but the irrigators are relying on water to which two tribal nations have a longstanding claim since the 1970s courts have directed the federal government to prioritize the rights of tribal nations and endangered species in 1973 the u s supreme court affirmed the yurok tribe s treaty rights to fish a ruling that was compounded by a landmark court ruling in 1974 which asserted tribes right to co manage their fisheries and reaffirmed their treaty rights to harvest fish the ruling followed a spate of arrests of indigenous fishermen for violating state regulations that didn t apply to tribal nations in 2021 yet another decision this time by an oregon court affirmed the klamath tribes water rights that ruling upheld an 1864 treaty between the klamath tribes and the u s that pledged to keep sufficient water in the tribes fisheries and other aquatic resources to protect indigenous cultural traditions and natural resources the klamath county circuit court judge issued an order asserting the klamath tribes senior water rights which extend to upper klamath lake irrigators contested the ruling and the case is still rumbling on in court prioritizing endangered fish more than 100 miles northeast of where mccovey discovered the salmon die off the klamath tribes are fighting to keep the bureau of reclamation from releasing water from the upper klamath lake the bureau releases water from the 91 000 acre lake in southern oregon to water crops and flush the klamath river improving water quality for the salmon far downstream the may decision to keep the irrigation canal closed is just the latest illustration of how far beyond their means water users in the basin have been living klamath tribal council chairman don gentry said in a news release the definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again and expect different results until this basin adapts to a drier future we will continue to find ourselves facing these conflicts the news release added that the lake plainly cannot support all the demands being put on it the mismanagement coupled with extreme drought in oregon in 2020 which may be replicated or exceeded this year echoes the summer of 2001 when drought caused the bureau of reclamation to cut off water to farmers in the area who then staged protests to get the water turned back on this year s drought is even worse the primary reason water is being held in the upper klamath lake is to preserve populations of c waam and koptu endangered suckerfish that live only in that region the c waam and koptu or lost river sucker and shortnose sucker respectively are first foods for the klamath tribes but are now so scarce that only two of each species are harvested every year for ceremonial purposes they re also protected by the endangered species act so resource managers must prioritize their needs over other claimants to the klamath basin s water the water levels in the lake are at a historic low and the fish need a certain amount of water to survive the bureau of reclamation s decision to close the irrigation canal and forgo the surface flush was an effort to protect the suckerfish the klamath situation is huge complex and complicated says oregon state university professor hannah gosnell who specializes in land and water conservation the drought this summer is the worst one in over 100 years and the fish in the upper klamath basin are teetering close to extinction gosnell says that although the crisis in the klamath is unique in its severity it s a conflict that will be replicated throughout the u s in years to come it is tragic that this situation is resulting in conflict between tribes gosnell says those in the lower basin are now at odds with tribes in the upper basin and these are tribes that usually do a lot of partnering and collaboration with each other it s also really sad for farmers because they were promised water and they re understandably upset that they re losing out to endangered species dry cropland many oregon farmers are furious about suddenly finding themselves without water for their crops and fearing they face financial disaster your average farmer has mortgage payments property taxes irrigation district assessments equipment payments and the most important need of all to house and take care of his or her family says ben duval a farmer and president of the klamath water users association no water means no crops no food no ability to take care of your family duval who farms in northern california with his wife and two daughters described the issue as a legal problem that needs to get straightened out we need access to about three percent of the total runoff in the klamath river watershed in order to irrigate all of the land he said this year we will receive essentially zero percent and 400 000 acre feet less than what we need farmers in the area grow grass and alfalfa hay potatoes grains and onions and there are a number of beef and dairy cattle producers duval says those producers have already been forced to liquidate some of their herds or fallow their fields to reduce costs as there is an inability to irrigate due to the closing of the canal and a lack of forage ground caused by low precipitation it s our culture although he says dam removal is a necessary step toward improving water quality in the klamath watershed meurer says it s not the only solution the next step really an ongoing effort is watershed restoration projects to improve water quality in the upper klamath lake and river basin which will improve water quality downstream he said there are many ways the klamath could be improved but dam removal is the foundational improvement on which everything else rests gosnell says one way to mitigate the catastrophe is strategic purchases by the government to buy out irrigators or pay them to idle their water rights there are simply too many people clamoring and fighting over too little water she said for farmers water is their livelihood for the yurok tribe known as the salmon people water is life it not only provides a food source but it is woven into their heritage it breaks people s hearts it breaks people s spirits to not be able to fish and provide for your family mccovey said removing the dams he said will absolutely help the fish kill situation as well as water quality however the issue of water management and quantity will remain mccovey s father taught him how to fish his grandfather taught him how to hang a net and use a boat it s not just the act of catching and eating the fish there s so much more that goes into it he said it s all the conversations you have with elders learning how to fish well it s our culture he said our identity is intertwined with fishing and catching salmon so innately that we believe that when there s no more salmon there s no more people we re really afraid of losing who we are

this study evaluates the use of virtual human interpreted field observations using google street view gsv to examine the presence of conditions that may be used to analyze green gentrification in the global south we propose that green gentrification is characterized by the introduction or improvement of green amenities such as parks as well as corresponding changes to the urban context such as facade materials while virtual field observations have been used to examine neighborhood context for other applications this method has not yet been applied to the study of green gentrification nor in the global south using one urban park located in talca chile and in three urban parks located in santiago chile we sought to address the following research questions 1 how do in situ and virtual field observations compare as methods of evaluating green amenities and urban context 2 what characteristics of green amenities and urban context must be addressed to investigate green gentrification in the global south 3 how do indicators of green amenities and urban context observed via virtual field observations indicate the potential for green gentrification in order to observe the streetside conditions of the neighborhoods surrounding established improved and new parks we utilize the ground level 360 imagery through gsv as an alternative to in situ studies which can be time consuming expensive and logistically challenging features related to the land use composition building materials used and the presence of aesthetic improvements and pedestrian amenities were noted as potential indicators of gentrification and the correspondence between the two methods of observation were evaluated results indicate that virtual field observations can provide a promising method that may facilitate the identification and investigation of the effects of green gentrification in the global south broadening the scope and application of this research this comparison offers insight into the use and comparison of virtual and in situ observations for identifying green gentrification in the global south and for the applicability of the virtual observation method in this heterogeneous urban landscape especially in cases with unreliable or unavailable data introduction urban greening has become priority for many cities around the world striving to become sustainable resilient and attractive places and many municipalities explicitly seek to redress longstanding urban environmental injustices through urban greening programs pearsall et al 2012 latin american cities are also prioritizing greening because they generally have less green space per capita compared to cities in the global north because of the rapid pace of urbanization and the decision making dynamics that exist between developers and public officials overseeing land use and zoning breen et al 2020 with increased greening efforts there is a need to acknowledge the burdens disinvestment and neglect that may span for decades prior to the new investment in a community previous studies provide substantial evidence of environmental gentrification in many urban neighborhoods with a few exceptions e g eckerd 2011 however these studies have often focused on single case studies of high profile greening initiatives e g new york city s high line in large cities in the global north e g chicago new york toronto further the methods used by these studies largely depend on the multi date comparison of official governmental statistics e g census data regarding education income and ethnicity or on a survey or focus group of a subset of the population while these studies reveal the limits of the green is good mantra connolly 2019 the relevance of such findings to different urban contexts both within and among cities has only recently been explored anguelovski et al 2018 additional research is needed to understand green gentrification in different contexts and to critically examine the theories methods and findings of research efforts based on studies in the global north many studies of green gentrification developed in the global north focus on how a new environmental amenity like a park or environmental remediation like brownfield redevelopment lead to gentrification because they increase the desirability of the neighborhood subsequently increasing property values e g toronto s don lands waterfront bunce 2009 seattle s public green space planning dooling 2009 gowanus canal miller 2016 yet two dilemmas complicate the diagnosis of such classic cases of green gentrification in different contexts first there is a question of directionality which came first greening or gentrification does greening actually cause gentrification or are green environments a reflection of the desires of gentrifiers the majority of green gentrification research draws on supply side market led theories of gentrification premised on the idea of an environmental rent gap bryson 2012 after smith 1979 or the idea that environmental disamenities e g pollution or the lack of environmental amenities depress property values which rebound once environmental conditions improve there is empirical support for this theory e g gamper rabindran and timmins 2013 however some studies have found that environmental improvements do not lead to gentrification e g eckerd 2011 or that demands for environmental quality are associated with the presence of gentrifiers e g mir and sanchez 2009 and their demands for more green amenities and improved environmental conditions additionally there are limits to the rent gap theory to fully explain gentrification processes particularly in the global south lópez morales 2015 globalization and policies of neoliberalism are intertwined with gentrification in the global south flourishing in the absence of the state presence in urban planning betancur 2014 janoschka and sequera 2016 in latin america neoliberal urban regimes promote public private partnerships ppp which are integral to gentrification with the maximum return on investment as a deciding factor to allocate funding for new projects in areas of cities that are suitable for redevelopment seeking out the best investment segregates the population according to wealth displaces residents in historic city centers and impacts both immigration and emigration between countries irazábal 2016 illustrates how ppp can be harmful using the city of talca chile inclusionary housing strategy which was implemented after the 2010 earthquake and ended up promoting gentrification not inclusion previous research on gentrification in latin american cities focuses on various causes of such phenomenon but not specifically on the implementation of a greening or sustainability plan notable examples include the presence of private educational institutions and universities in santiago chile borsdorf and hidalgo 2013 the actions of a specific investor in the historic center of mexico city s historic center delgadillo 2016 and the housing demand for a transnational middle class in panama city sigler and wachsmuth 2016 among numerous others the latter illustrates what sigler and wachsmuth identify as globalizing gentrification or transnational gentrification p 706 showing globalization at its peak force wherein gentrification is occurring because of an international not local demand for real estate development developments that may not be inhabited by a local population additionally the 2010 earthquake in talca was the motivation for letelier and irazábal 2018 to examine how the state the community and private actors were not able to avoid gentrification of the affected areas because of neoliberalism type of urbanism despite the existence of programs that heavily rely on participatory planning in the design of neighborhoods second there is a question of scale how local or global are patterns of green gentrification across a city this question is particularly pressing as much of the work on green gentrification has been site specific and focused on one neighborhood or one green space checker 2011 bryson 2012 curran and hamilton 2012 pearsall 2013 kern 2015 the handful of studies that have examined citywide trends highlight spatially variable patterns pearsall 2010 abel et al 2015 anguelovski et al 2018 immergluck and balan 2018 research on the beltline a large adaptive reuse project in atlanta georgia found statistically significant differences in cumulative appreciation in housing from 2011 to 2015 within a 1 2 mile of the beltline and housing beyond 1 2 mile immergluck and balan 2018 however changes in accumulation rates were not equal across the four neighborhoods rigolon et al 2018 identified characteristics of parks that led to gentrification in the surrounding neighborhoods in 10 cities in the united states and found that the location and function of the parks were predictors of gentrification outcomes these findings suggest that gentrification is not an inevitable result of greening or park development and that certain contextual factors may accelerate or mitigate green gentrification although there are few studies examining green gentrification in latin america there are multiple studies that have investigated access to urban parks in the region rigolon et al 2018 focusing on proximity quantity and quality there is evidence that higher income people live closer to urban parks than lower income people in cities such as santiago de chile krellenberg et al 2014 hermosillo mexico lara valencia and garcía pérez 2015 and bogotá colombia scopelliti et al 2016 moreover quantitative studies on the quantity of urban parks per capita show spatial inequality i e high income residents have higher quantities of green space than low income residents in cities such as mexico city mexico fernández álvarez 2017 and curitiba brazil macedo and haddad 2016 some studies suggest that best quality green spaces are in wealthier neighborhoods in santa cruz bolivia wright wendel et al 2012 and bueno aires argentina de mola et al 2017 these park related socio economic inequalities may serve as symptoms of green gentrification and warrant further investigation however how the influence of the park relates to the physical and green amenities present in the surrounding neighborhoods is not apparent through the comparison of secondary data and would instead rely on in situ observations or in the case of this study virtual observations it is well known that wealth inequality is rampant in latin america amarante et al 2016 reported that latin american countries have been known for their inequality for as long as reliable statistics on income data has been available the wealth inequality gives insight to how green gentrification may be evident in latin america and how it differs from the global north according to janoschka sequera and salinas the emerging discussions on gentrification in latin america seem to proffer enough mounting evidence to make the claim that there are several types of gentrification to be found in this region that do not necessarily resemble the sort of gentrification previously found in the global north lópez morales 2016 p 1110 green gentrification is just one of the several types to be further explored given increased attention to the aesthetic and health benefits of urban vegetation and its subsequent desirability in addition to exploring the contextual factors that may distinguish green gentrification in the global south researchers may also need to use different types of data and methods to detect gentrification gentrification research in latin american cities has relied primarily on property sales data governmental census data interviews and policy analysis see delgadillo 2016 gaffney 2016 inzulza contardo 2016 however in many cities there may be either inconsistent or incomplete socio economic data available hinojosa and hennermann 2012 haddad 2015 additionally census data and property sales data primarily capture changes in exchange value of land and may be inadequate for detecting changes in use value when comparing the global north and south researchers in the global north have better access to accurate and timely data musakwa and van niekerk 2015 arsanjani et al 2016 which allows more effective analysis of changes in urban areas cities that lack timely or complete data can greatly benefit from field observations but conducting these in situ can be costly in time and expenses and may not be possible due to logistics safety or restrictions google street view gsv a service available from google with panoramic imagery stitched into a continuous scene can be used as a proxy source of virtual field observations the imagery is collected by google s car mounted camera and concurrently captures the location and direction of each image allowing them to be browsed and queried as a comprehensive dataset gsv has documented images from more than 100 countries spanning every continent houser 2018 gsv has been applied to assessments of the built environment and natural amenities including the study of gentrification in neighborhoods in chicago hwang and sampson 2014 and ottawa ilic et al 2019 hwang and sampson 2014 emphasize that gsv is easily accessible and can provide visual indicators of gentrification such as the structural mix of an area visible beautification efforts and lack of disorder and decay p 732 733 moreover ilic et al 2019 discuss the benefits of using gsv to reveal potential areas undergoing gentrification especially because gsv updates its visual data approximately every 1 3 years depending on location more frequently than official census data which is often used to collect similar information as glaeser et al 2018 argue gsv has the potential to help evaluate income dynamics in developing countries where this data might not be as readily available even though gsv is not comprehensive in every possible locale there may be no data available within very low income neighborhoods where car access proves to be challenging still gsv can be an effective tool this study contributes to research methods on how to examine green gentrification in relation to park development by utilizing a gsv method applicable to most cities that face lack of official socio economic data collected on a routine basis this method provides potential for addressing the two green gentrification dilemmas described above because of the ubiquity and temporal scale of gsv imagery rather than using indicators from census data our approach incorporates more relevant indicators related to the built environment that can be derived from direct observation of the street view imagery of a particular location or neighborhood even through the virtual lens of gsv census data analysis provides a measure of demographic changes that reflect gentrification and the use of gsv imagery may detect investments and improvements in the housing stock ilic et al 2019 discuss how the visual expression of gentrification is an important yet under addressed aspect of the process yet it is also an important sign of gentrification hammel and wyly 1996 we test our approach to detecting property improvements using gsv imagery in a set of case studies from two different cities in chile talca and santiago talca offered an opportunity to examine urban context using both in situ and virtual field collection surrounding an established park santiago was selected because within chile santiago is the city that best depicts the effects of globalization and neoliberal policies in its territory and has both established and newly re developed parks across a spectrum of neighborhood contexts both cities are experiencing greening initiatives in response to new development and urban renewal efforts to address the goal of understanding green gentrification in the global south we sought to address the following research questions 1 how do in situ and virtual field observations compare as methods of evaluating green amenities and urban context 2 what characteristics of green amenities and urban context must be addressed to investigate green gentrification in the global south 3 how do indicators of green amenities and urban context observed via virtual field observations indicate the potential for green gentrification the study was conducted in two phases phase i included a systematic comparison of in situ and virtual observation using gsv in talca and an evaluation of the survey instrument for phase ii in the santiago province using virtual observation only we analyzed three buffer zones set around each of three parks with different socio economic conditions in order to identify patterns indicating green gentrification in the neighborhood surrounding each park and across the three neighborhood contexts our findings are twofold and inform future efforts to evaluate green gentrification in the global south 1 we demonstrated that variables that represent green gentrification in the global south differ from previous studies in the global north and 2 our analysis using gsv indicates that street level imagery provides a promising method that may facilitate the identification and investigation of the socio economic impacts of green amenities or green amenity investment in the global south materials and methods study area chile is a very urbanized country when compared to the world population it had 87 5 of its population living in urban areas in 2018 compared to 55 of the world population world bank 2021 its urbanization process was particularly affected by the neoliberalization that started with the military dictatorship 1973 1990 bringing segregation and inequality to the urban fabric of several chilean cities but most markedly santiago otero et al 2021 like most countries from the global south urban informality is part of chilean cities specifically for santiago inostroza 2017 quantified the new urban peripheries where most informality takes place and found that the spatial patterns of development were highly fragmented and corresponded to 32 6 of the total built up area having 13 of overall informality inostroza 2017 and to exacerbate this complex urbanization process the lack of planning in chilean cities is contributing to the formation of unsustainable built environments velázquez et al 2021 this study was conducted in two urban areas in chile phase i in the city of talca primarily addressing research question 1 and contributing to research question 2 while phase ii in the core of santiago province primarily addressing research questions 2 and 3 figure 1 displays the location of the areas in the country and their territory talca the largest city of the maule region had a population of 222 357 in 2017 the nation capital santiago is the core of the province divided into 32 comunas with a total population of 5 613 982 inhabitants in 2017 figure 1 figure 1 two study areas in chile city of talca and santiago province like many latin american cities talca does not have many urban parks for the analysis we chose a central park called cuatro norte a corridor that runs the length of 14 blocks west to east of talca figure 3a even though cuatro norte was established in 1742 in the original city plans the intent of phase i was to compare results from the in situ and virtual field observations and to identify variables in a typical urban context that may relate to green gentrification while the park is surrounded by stable neighborhoods that may not be experiencing gentrification cuatro norte offered the opportunity to evaluate different variations of the built environment especially related to the presence and visibility of green amenities on a block to block scale figure 2 shows the location of cuatro norte within talca displaying a proxy variable to measure quality of housing per census tract for 2017 from chilean national census low values mean that the area has very good quality housing stock and high values mean that the quality of the housing stock has deteriorated this indicates that the cuatro norte park had different levels of housing quality in its surroundings in 2017 figure 2 figure 2 percentage of housing units in talca with irrecoverable housing materials an indicator of housing quality 2017 talca has been the study area for a gentrification study though not in relation to greening inzulza contardo 2016 conducted a study in four historic neighborhoods in talca examining the reconstruction process following the 2010 earthquake using cuatro norte as a study area boundary their findings indicated the presence of gentrification caused by housing subsidies allowing urban plots and increasing land value rather than the protection of owner conditions and or affordability for residents to keep living in the inner city inzulza contardo 2016 p 2025 for the santiago province we focused on three new or newly renovated parks andre jarlán bicentenario and quinta normal these parks are located in three comunas with different socio economic characteristics as shown in figure 4 andre jarlán with an area of 320 thousand square meters is located in the southern pedro aquirre cerda comuna and is a historic park that was remodeled and reopened in 1997 figure 3c bicentenario with an area of 314 thousand square meters is located in the northeast vitacura comuna and is the newest park out of the three we chose figure 3d it was built in 2007 with anticipation that it would attract 75 000 new residents to the area lopez morales 2011 most parks are in theory designed to serve the public yet with the rise of novel high profile parks such as promenade plantée in paris or the high line park in new york city city officials around the world are inspired to build similar world class green spaces to generate economic development and attract global attention bicentenario is an example for this category but in the global south quinta normal with an area of 355 thousand square meters is located in a western quinta normal comuna and is also a historic park that was also remodeled with new additions and more acres were added in 2008 figure 3b figure 3 figure 3 photos of quinta normal b andre jarlán c and bicentenario d and cuatro norte a sources b wikimedia commons c fahneu d tripadvisor a mapio these are indeed very different comunas as otero et al 2021 described in their cluster analysis pedro aquirre cerda was classified as lower middle class areas vitacura was classified as affluent area and quinta normal was classified as urban crime area rental housing affordability varies greatly between the three comunas as the study of vergara perucich and aguirre nuñez 2020 using 2017 data indicates pedro aquirre cerda and quinta normal are more affordable when compared to vitacura which has the highest rental housing price within the greater santiago region this illustrates what macedo and haddad 2016 describes as the process of ground rent accumulation on the part of private largest scale real estate firms and he argues that if this process remains untouched segregation will not stop furthermore even the spatial distribution of the bicycling network in greater santiago and its use by residents demonstrate how segregated the capital is with most travels being generated at the east part where vitacura comuna is located mora and moran 2020 from an urban ecosystems services perspective dobbs et al 2018 conducted a spatial analysis 1986 2014 and found that santiago showed a socioeconomic effect where social inequalities matched environmental inequalities represented by lower provision of ecosystem services p 1077 based on their study pedro aquirre cerda and quinta normal would have experienced degraded ecosystem services during the period of study and vitacura a more affluent comuna would showed improved ecosystem services even though the city is implementing smart city strategies with the goal to diminish this segregation among others jirón et al 2020 found that some of these strategies are intended to have a placebo effect p 615 i e they will not change the problem but alleviate the perception for residents will connect santiago with the world class city concept table 1 depicts characteristics of the three comunas with different population density varying from 3 104 to 14 041 one can observe vitacura had the largest amount of authorized square meters of new construction during 2015 2020 contrasting with pedro aguirre cerda that had the smallest area of 33 366 m2 these contrasting development levels may be related to the age of the neighborhoods located in these comunas vitacura has new neighborhoods on the edge of the province and the other two are traditional established comunas with older neighborhoods table 1 table 1 characteristics of the three comunas where santiago parks are located figure 4 shows location of the three urban parks and the percentage of population below the poverty line for all of the comunas in santiago province for 2017 the western part of the province was poorer than the eastern direction to where the region is growing the three parks are located in different gradients of poverty being bicentenario in lower poverty quinta normal in medium poverty and andre jarlán in higher poverty when comparing the three this figure illustrates lópez morales 2018 statement about gentrification in santiago the wealth distinction between comunas generates material and symbolic exclusion of the less affluent data collection in this study we utilized gsv to virtually observe locations and collect data based on human observation in talca and santiago chile to investigate whether this technology can be effective in evaluating key characteristics of the built environment in diverse urban contexts we aimed to determine whether gsv technology can serve as a reliable and cost effective method of analysis compared to direct observation rundle et al 2011 kelly et al 2013 he et al 2017 we also aimed to determine if gsv is a viable and reliable method to investigate indicators of green gentrification for in situ and virtual data collection we designed a survey questionnaire questions about some notable features which may represent green gentrification in the chilean urban context were included such as land use composition materials used in the façades the presence of aesthetic improvements and pedestrian amenities this survey was used in all four parks one for in situ observation in talca and four for virtual observations one in talca and three in santiago the design of the survey was a continuous process that was finalized after four rounds of testing the instrument by checking it with the in situ and virtual built environment as described in the data analysis section when designing the questions we considered the differences in the built environments between latin american and north american cities for example we created a question in the survey about the type of façade material because in latin america buildings and homes use different materials depending on the socio economic level of residents for example the presence of marble or glass as a building façade could indicate a higher socio economic level there were also questions about security features such as metal bars on windows and graffiti because this is a common occurrence in many neighborhoods in latin america that indicates higher socioeconomic and lower socioeconomic levels respectively figure 4 figure 4 percentage of population below the poverty line per comuna in santiago province 2017 the survey instrument used in both talca and santiago included 11 questions regarding neighborhood conditions and amenities table 2 each question response varied on a scale including boolean likert none 0 25 25 50 50 75 over 75 or a choice of relevant options visibility questions utilized this scale to indicate the proportion of the feature that was seen and questions of prevalence applied the same scale to the coverage of the block surrounding the location under observation the question regarding the condition of the street applied the likert scale of prevalence to indicate the proportion of the roadway affected by features such as potholes cracks construction or a continuous curb possible answers to questions had features that could be present in higher socio economic areas such as continuous curb along streets or in lower socio economic areas such as presence of potholes both for conditions of street table 2 table 2 topics of questions included in the survey for talca we defined 37 locations in a regular grid of navigable streets surrounding cuatro norte using a stratified sample from the park extending four blocks north and south and along the park at two block intervals figure 5 shows cuatro norte with the sampling locations the 37 red points were used for the virtual observation and the 18 blue circles represent the locations used for the in situ observation and comparison identical surveys were used in both the virtual and in situ observation for in situ observations looking ahead a block to the north south west and east of the exact standing location we recorded the precise longitude and latitude of the virtual observation using a smartphone we recorded responses to the survey questions for the 18 locations independently we conducted virtual observations of 37 locations with complete overlap with the in situ observation all imagery observed in talca was collected by google in 2013 and 2015 figure 5 figure 5 sampling locations surrounding cuatro norte talca in santiago the boundaries of each park were delimited from official shapefiles and buffers of 500 1 000 and 1 500 m were calculated using arcgis 10 6 1 areas for which sampling was impractical or infeasible e g due to coverage of military bases conservation zone golf course a vacant lot and museums were excluded from the buffer zones ten target locations for observations were randomly calculated within each buffer with a minimum distance of 100 m between each point for a total of 30 points surrounding each of the three parks figure 6 the yellowish areas show places where gentrification is not possible to occur i e development not possible including areas of parks golf courses military bases conservation zones and museums geographic coordinates were extracted from each point and converted into location specific links to target each point in google street view for virtual observation all imagery observed in santiago was collected by google in 2014 and 2015 except for 5 locations observed in 2012 figure 6 figure 6 map of study area in santiago with buffers and observation points data analysis responses from the talca in situ and virtual surveys data were compiled and summarized to address research question 1 establishing correspondence between the in situ and virtual observations in the case of ordinal variables along a scale results from each collection type were compared using direct agreement responses identical and adjacent agreement responses varied one step on a scale the direct agreement and the adjacent agreement were summed to yield a metric of total agreement between the in situ and virtual field observations to illustrate if the security feature metal fence in location x was 0 25 visible in both in situ and virtual observation it was considered direct agreement if the security feature metal fence in location x was 0 25 visible in in situ and 25 50 visible in virtual observation it was considered adjacent agreement next we evaluated the response of each variable from talca for potential inclusion in the resulting analysis in locations of complete presence or absence results were tabulated but not further examined as they offered no metrics of comparison for locations in which the responses differed substantially the differences were noted and discussed in terms of varying conditions timing of observation or the feasibility of consistent observation between the two methods research question 2 addressed the response of variables that may indicate green gentrification and how they varied across three park contexts and over distance from each park using the three buffers 500 1 000 1 500 we conducted the gsv virtual observation in the neighborhoods surrounding three santiago parks responses were summarized to presence vs absence when possible to clearly demarcate the patterns across the three distance based buffer zones variables for which the response was not static i e unchanged in magnitude among the three buffers were selected for increased examination for example the presence of single family dwellings diminished in frequency over the three buffer zones surrounding one park but increased in frequency over the buffers for the other two parks similarly the presence of security window bars diminished with distance from one park decreased with distance from another park and were constant i e consistently not present surrounding a third park in summarizing the santiago virtual observation responses to address research question 3 the proportion of presence of each variable was compared in summary across all parks and across the buffers between parks these results were summarized in table 3 and sparkline graphs were generated to illustrate the direction of the trend among buffers for each park and the proportion of variable response among all parks per buffer and in total figure 6 line graphs among per park buffers indicate whether the presence of each characteristic rose fell or remained constant with distance from the park for example the presence of smooth sidewalks is a feature of higher socio economic areas if the line graph starts with high presence close to the park 500 buffer and decreases presence in 1 000 buffer and even more so in 1 500 buffer then a trend for green gentrification could be observed bar charts across all parks indicate whether a characteristic was more less prevalent per park at each respective buffer or among all observations to illustrate the presence of decorative pavers is a feature of higher socio economic areas if the bar chart starts with high presence close to the park 500 buffer and does not change its presence in 1 000 buffer nor in 1 500 buffer then no trend could be observed table 3 table 3 agreement of survey responses between in situ and virtual field observations results findings from rq 1 agreement between in situ and virtual observations in response to research question 1 the correspondence between the in situ and virtual observations in talca was very high among all survey questions table 3 for the visibility of the park all attributes were consistent via direct agreement streetside elements like billboards graffiti green amenities and litter were observed with 100 total agreement though direct agreement ranges from 56 3 to 87 5 supplemented by adjacent agreement of 12 5 43 8 likely due to the differing timing affecting the abundance of the element but not its prevalence similarly the abundance of land use types was improved by the use of adjacent agreement which accounted for 11 1 38 9 of the observations achieving 100 total agreement except in the case of multi family homes at 95 this pattern of near complete correspondence between the in situ and virtual observations continued for all observed variables findings from rq 2 characteristics of green gentrification parsimony of observations aids in the detection of green gentrification in the global south while the same survey questions used in talca were also used in the virtual only observations of santiago a subset is reported here to reduce redundancy and highlight findings the visibility of the park and park features did not necessarily serve as a reliable indicator of the presence of green amenities due to the varying uses and compositions of surrounding blocks and also the lack of visibility from locations that were not adjacent or orthogonal to the park similarly many variables served as an indicator by a choice in that a building may not be made of more than one facade material so the use of a single choice served as an indicator that other types may or may not also be present based on its proportion in santiago the brick façade was more universally common than any other type so its absence indicated some other type in use some variables were not mutually exclusive such as the potential presence of single or multi family dwellings and businesses within a single block or the different types of security features hence the full suite of questions used in the survey was reduced to include nine variables that may serve as indicators of green gentrification in this study the presence of green amenities the different types of land uses the presence of security features and the condition and composition of the facade and sidewalk materials the comparative examination of the presence of these variables can enable cross site comparison of green gentrification across a city and the change of each variable over distance from a single park can give an indicator of the influence of the introduction or improvement of the park findings from rq 3 evidence of green gentrification near parks in santiago for santiago parks results from the survey question responses of the 9 location characteristics with 10 observations for each of 3 distance buffers at each of the 3 parks are summarized in table 4 each of the nine variables illustrates an increasing decreasing or stable trend across the per park buffers and this trend gives insight into the characteristics of the urban context that may be indicative of green gentrification additionally one can visualize the trend pattern of each of the variables with a linear sparkline table 4 table 4 prevalence of selected characteristics surrounding each park in total and by 500 1 000 and 1 500 m buffers for andre jarlán and quinta normal there was a positive increasing slope with increasing distance from the park for green amenities but bicentenario exhibited an inverse relationship with the prevalence decreasing with distance from the park residential buildings single family or multi family also exhibited differing trends among the parks with an increase in single family dwellings with increased distance in the neighborhood surrounding both bicentenario and quinta normal but a decrease in single family dwellings with increased distance from andre jarlán multi family trends were more variable in response with slightly v n shaped curves in all cases indicating differing neighborhood composition with increased distance it may be harder to see the effect of green gentrification surrounding an established park like andre jarlán and quinta normal because of the lag in improvements in an established neighborhood because of the neighborhood improvements following the introduction of bicentenario many distance effects are more pronounced but also share similarities with the other two parks for example the increased prevalence of multi family dwellings closer to bicentenario may be reflective of increased land values closer to the park thereby indicating green gentrification resulting from this introduction of this park security window bars and security metal fencing such as a shop or garage door also exhibited differing trends with distance with window bars more common adjacent to the park in the neighborhood surrounding andre jarlán and increasing with distance from quinta normal the security metal fencing exhibited the opposite pattern brick façades smooth sidewalks and decorative pavers offered another line of discrimination among the park characteristics with differing trends for each of the parks summarizing the buffers across all parks yields insight into the characteristics that may be most commonly recognized as influenced by proximity to the park green amenities and multi family dwellings along with security metal fences brick façades and decorative pavers were most associated with the newly established bicentenario park by contrast single family dwellings businesses and both types of security features were emblematic of the neighborhood surrounding andre jarlán smooth sidewalks were present in both of the neighborhoods surrounding andre jarlán and quinta normal though this characteristic did not vary dramatically with distance at the furthest buffer from the park the neighborhood composition has shifted with green amenities most associated with andre jarlán single family dwellings with quinta normal and multi family dwellings with bicentenario across all observations the neighborhood surrounding bicentenario is most rich with green amenities decorative pavers brick façades and multi family dwellings whereas businesses were most prevalent surrounding quinta normal and single family dwellings and security features most associated with andre jarlán the responses to these variables helped to interpret evidence of green gentrification based on their patterns the santiago analysis showed that virtual field observations can indicate green gentrification based on the spatial patterns seen from buffer to buffer there was variation in the types of characteristics indicating gentrification among bicentenario and ardre jarlán bicentenario s strongest indicators of green gentrification were green amenities and a security fence andre jarlan s strongest indicators were single family homes businesses and security window bars quinta normal arguably did not demonstrate any strong spatial patterns of green gentrification across any indicators potentially because it is difficult to attribute that change of the built environment to the parks if they have been there for many years discussion one of the goals of this study was to assess how well gsv fared in surveying the built environment and to understand how this compared with an in situ study based on the comparison to an in situ observation we learned that gsv has the ability to effectively capture conditions of the built environment and it may be a valuable tool to measure green gentrification it is an interesting and potentially exciting approach to study green gentrification and our findings support similar research on in situ and virtual gsv studies on gentrification in the global north hwang and sampson 2014 ilic et al 2019 this finding supports the use of gsv to complement and extend methodology previously used which largely rely on comprehensive secondary governmental or commercial data sources in this way gsv based observations mirror the insights from in situ by offering precise locational information regarding a range of factors uncommonly captured by aggregated data further gsv offers an advantage of being nearly comprehensive in coverage with increasing potential for multiple observations over time however our results suggest that this approach must be used with caution because there are potential challenges from the talca phase two issues should be kept in mind as the methods presented here should be utilized in other studies day of in situ visits and year of the street level imagery both issues are related to some features that were either not seen or did not appear in the virtual observation in comparison to the in situ and vice versa first the day of week chosen for in situ observations made a difference in what one could observe the talca in situ took place on different days one day was sunday when most stores and businesses were closed making it easier to observe the streets and more was seen in comparison to the other in situ visits not on sunday second if gsv images are older then during virtual observations some features that were added to the built environment after the images were taken will be present in the in situ but not in the virtual observations which may mislead the results concerning the survey questionnaire there were questions such as the building façade that did not show a lot of variability on the other hand the survey question about multi family and single family homes gave us more variability leading to meaningful information based on what was already known about the socio economic background of that park the results highlighted what key questions or variables should be used to address green gentrification in the global south for future survey questionnaires additional topics that could be included to bring more insights about green gentrification follow the level of maintenance of the buildings the presence and level of maintenance of landscape projects in the buildings surroundings and the presence and conditions of electric poles in the sidewalks our study highlights the importance of understanding the local context to develop relevant indicators based on street level characteristics local knowledge about neighborhoods needs to be incorporated into the interpretation of indicators engaging local experts to guide the decisions about greening is essential for well informed decision making processes the results of this study suggest that there is a complex relationship between park investments and property upgrades such that gentrification isn t an inevitable consequence of creating new parks or renovating existing ones the data analysis showed some indicators of property upgrades in close proximity to the parks but the indicators showing gentrification related trends varied across all three parks and multiple indicators did not show evidence of upgrades these results complicate the park gentrification relationship similar to several recent citywide studies of green gentrification that show that gentrification isn t an inevitable outcome of park investments rigolon and németh 2020 study of ten cities in the united states found that park function and location were stronger predictors of gentrification than park size similarly pearsall and eller 2020 found that parks likely anchored gentrification in certain neighborhoods but was not a driver of gentrification in others finally kim and wu s 2021 study of parks in new york city revealed that park characteristics had an impact on gentrification outcomes over the medium and long term while these three studies are all based on north american cities our study contributes an additional line of evidence of the complexity of park related gentrification based on a study in latin america further our study is one of the first that focuses on property upgrades rather than demographic change which provides a new perspective on neighborhood redevelopment linked to park investments given that our study did not show strong or consistent evidence of gentrification in proximity to the three parks these parks might be an example of just green enough park development this concept suggests that neighborhoods can be greened or improved but not to the point that they attract substantial additional investment to become gentrified we suggest that there is need for further research on neighborhood dynamics surrounding the three parks to understand if these park investments represent a just green enough example or if other local or city processes are driving neighborhood investments

there are lower risk energy stocks near the top of the list but this risk reward opportunity should not be ignored so far this year the energy sector has crushed it for investors the energy select spdr etf xle 0 18 is up 32 in total returns the best sector in the s p 500 index which is up 19 this year and as the global economy continues to recover from the coronavirus pandemic the prospects for the energy industry to continue delivering the best returns for investors remains good here s the thing i think some of the best energy investments over the next few years and especially in the decades to come aren t stocks that fall in the traditional energy sector bucket moreover i think the best energy investments you can make right now this month aren t traditional energy stocks one in particular is at the top of my list as the best energy stock to buy in august keep reading to learn more the contenders the energy sector is going through massive upheaval at the same time that demand for fossil fuels continues to rise as a result there is opportunity for investors both in the transition to renewables and in companies involved in hydrocarbons here are my top three contenders brookfield renewable businesses like brookfield renewable bep 0 64 bepc 0 30 are doing most of the disruption to oil and gas brookfield renewable owns develops and operates utility scale renewable energy facilities its plants produce electricity from hydroelectric wind and solar energy and it sells that clean power on long term contracts in other words it s more like a utility but brookfield renewable isn t disrupting utilities it s the fossil fuel industry that it s cutting out of the mix with the power it produces meaning less coal gas or crude oil needed to supply the world s growing energy needs as ceo connor teskey put it on the brookfield renewable second quarter earnings call the tailwinds for renewables continue to accelerate it should come as no surprise that there is both a growing investment opportunity as well as increasing amounts of capital being allocated toward the sector that s not just lip service on some future opportunity the company reported a 23 increase in funds from operations in q2 and signed 28 new contracts to provide 800 gigawatt hours of renewable energy to customers with a dividend yield above 3 at recent prices for the mlp units and a very long record of growing the payout brookfield renewable is a winner i think will continue winning for years to come tellurian closest to being a traditional energy company tellurian s tell 1 25 business or the one it plans to build is suppling natural gas from cheap plentiful north american gas fields to global markets the company s plan is to build a 27 billion lng export facility on the u s gulf coast during much of 2020 the company s prospects of survival were very much in question the collapse in global energy demand and oil prices played havoc with tellurian s schedule the company s business model is heavily reliant on global energy giants companies which count on oil for a substantial part of their profits to sign on as partners with tellurian these are the companies that would be buying and shipping the lng tellurian was producing but these potential partners had bigger issues on their priority list last year simply surviving the worst oil downturn in history than signing multibillion dollar lng supply agreements with tellurian fast forward to 2021 and the company has finally started making progress on july 29 tellurian announced a 10 year contract with royal dutch shell that would essentially fill up capacity on the first two planned lng plants it wants to build making the entire project economically feasible this was a massive step forward that makes it far more likely the company will be able to get the financing to move forward with building its driftwood facility and unlocking massive financial potential and shareholder returns tpi composites the least energy of the stocks featured here tpi composites manufactures blades for the largest wind turbine companies in the world over the years tpi has expanded the list of wind turbine giants who it counts as customers investing tens of millions of dollars to expand its manufacturing capacity as a result revenue is up almost 200 since 2016 approaching 2 billion annually good so far right well growth hit a speedbump with management backing off its guidance for the rest of 2021 and also warning that revenue growth might be stagnant through 2022 as a result shares are now down almost 50 from the high reached early in 2021 i think that gives investors looking at tpi composites as a likely long term winner in the years ahead a wonderful opportunity to buy wind will play a massive role in the future of energy and tpi composites is central to how many turbine makers will meet future demand my top august energy stock tellurian if you re looking for a lower risk investment the tellurian probably shouldn t be your top energy stock to buy with brookfield renewable the better choice but if you re willing to take on the risk that tellurian can t raise the money to build driftwood an outcome that would probably kill the company then keep reading here s the core argument tellurian s deal with shell essentially pushes driftwood across the threshold of economic viability barring this agreement or a similar deal with another buyer it was unlikely even charif souki tellurian s co founder who also founded cheniere energy lng 0 22 would be able to talk lenders and investors into providing the billions in capital it will take to get this project off the ground the calculus has now changed and i think the risk reward profile has shifted much farther into investor s favor five years from now investors who buy tellurian now could be sitting on an enormous multi bagger just be ready for a volatile ride and acknowledge that the risks are not insignificant and could result in very big losses
a drawing from 1913 by famous engineer dam builder j c boyle that shows the naturally formed 31 foot tall lava dam barring fish migration and holding back the klamath river creating clammittee lake which was present when construction on copco 1 dam began famous engineer and dam builder j c boyle whose stock and trade was based on accuracy made a drawing of the natural lava dam and lake clammittee when he arrived in 1911 to build copco 1 dam the department of interior narrative about copco 1 dam and the natural 130 foot tall lava dam that created a natural lake called clammittee lake that existed for millennia where a myriad of life forms evolved in its unique habitat firefighters drew over 1 million gallons of water from iron gate lake one of the lakes behind the klamath river dams to fight the 38 000 acre klamathon fire that threatened ashland oregon and the cascade siskiyou national monument photo william e si baby western pond turtles are just one of many threatened and endangered species at copco and iron gate lakes on the klamath river these lakes provide critical habitat for numerous threatened and endangered species in and around the lakes photo laurie dana california governor newsom to charge taxpayers hundreds of millions to drain 45 billion gallons of water from lakes as wells across california are going dry yreka california united states august 8 2021 einpresswire com california oregon and other western states are now enduring one of the most intense droughts in recent history and coupled with the mega drought are catastrophic wildfires which are further damaging riparian areas and decimating the alpine forests that are needed to hold precipitation in the form of snow pack without the shade provided by alpine forests winter snow pack is subjected to direct sunlight and rapid warming which causes premature runoff into the sea resulting in much lower stream and river flows in spring and summer months and climate change experts are saying that we are likely entering a period of worsening drought and with that increasing catastrophic wildfire and toxic smoke western states are now in what is being called a water crisis by ap news and the water that people desperately need just to survive in domestic settings and for fighting the growing wildfire crisis is quickly becoming a rare commodity due to mismanagement of forests and water storage and conservation clearly the intelligent path to surviving this growing water and wildfire crisis is to start by preserving existing dams and resulting lakes that store excess water during winter months western states need more water storage dams so destroying any water storage dams during a water crisis is just crazy the klamath river dams that form copco and iron gates and provide 45 billion gallons of reserve water stores are of paramount importance for human survival anyone promoting the removal of structurally sound water storage dams during the growing water crisis and drought in california oregon and other the western states is totally disconnected from the reality that is being faced by american taxpayers in western states by retaining existing dams and building more dams we save excess winter precipitation that did not make it into aquifers without the dams to catch and hold excess water that water would simply run off into the sea it s important to note that during winter rains there is more than enough water for all wildlife and fishes in large rivers and streams like the klamath river allowing excess winter precipitation to run into the sea during a growing water crises will guarantee that americans will have less available water as the mega drought deepens over the summers of each successive year based upon his actions california governor gavin newsom seems to be talking out both sides of his face as outlined below gavin newsom also shows a serious deficit in vision and his memory seems lacking as we read in an article titled californiaâ s wasted winter rains by the wall street journal in 2017 the wall street journal article states reservoirs and rivers are overflowing as storms have pounded california this winter and after years of drought that should be good news the problem is that misguided environmentalism is wasting the water windfall and failing to store it for a non rainy day hydrologic records indicate that this year could be the wettest on record in california statewide snowpack measures 160 of average precipitation in palm springs exceeds the historic norm by more than 50 lo the desert is actually blooming most of the major reservoirs in the north are full and some are releasing hundreds of billions of gallons of water to prevent flooding and make room for the melting snowpack this spring while farmers and communities downstream can capture some of the discharges millions of acre feet will invariably flow into the ocean due to lack of storage capacity and rules to protect endangered fish species one problem is that while the state population has increased 70 since 1979 storage hasnâ t expanded water districts in southern california have developed small local reservoirs and groundwater basins but whatâ s most needed is storage in the north where most of the rain and snow falls in what many people and organizations are calling the most obtuse move ever california governor gavin newsom has joined with a non profit shell corporation called the klamath river renewal corporation krrc with plans on spending up to 1 billion tax dollars to destroy perfectly sound water storage dams on the upper klamath river and in that process draining 45 billion gallons of fresh water reserves from copco and iron gate lakes on the upper klamath river in addition this billion dollar debacle losing copco and iron gate lakes means losing critical habitat for over 150 species of flora and fauna some of which are endangered threatened or of special interest and in what seems to be even more insanity ca governor gavin newsom is wanting to tax californians billions more to allegedly get this build and raise dams in addition to lost value of 45 billion gallons of stored water in copco and iron gate lakes the replacement costs for the two perfectly sound dams copco and iron gate dams that newsom wants to charge taxpayers to destroy is about 843 million dollars talk about runaway waste more here it seems that californians have a governor in gavin newsom who is disconnected from reality so it s no wonder that half of all californians are calling for him to be recalled and removed from office and it seems in this case with very good reason how can anyone who is thinking straight and seeing the extreme drought water crisis and growing catastrophic wildfire in the west even begin to consider destroying structurally sound dams and draining 45 billion gallons of water reserves into the sea every year including years of extreme drought iron gate and copco lakes are full of water stored behind their respective dams full of water is it just unvarnished insanity or is it the lust for money recently presented science and engineering documents prove that the key premise that has been vigorously almost militantly promoted through propaganda distributed by the klamath river renewal corporation â krrcâ and their support base of fishing zealots is fake and has been soundly debunked by common sense indisputable geologic records and engineering documents any unbiased and fully informed review of krrc s proposed dam removal project renders their dam removal proposal a complete non starter lets examine why that is the case first of all profiting the wealthy privately owned pacificcorp via their relationship through krrc by way of getting california and oregon taxpayers to pay the lion s share for krrc s dam removal proposal and at the same time depriving americans of their water property rights wildlife tax dollars and devastating nature in the process is not acceptable under any circumstances pacifcorp financials can be found at yahoo finance as the mega drought and wildfires intensify in western states these elitists and their fishing zealot surrogates seem to prefer that average tax paying americans go without water so they can benefit these people are also willing to destroy an amazing natural wonder for the sake of more profits and their personal hobby interests this video shows nature s wonders that will be destroyed if these people aren t stopped now secondly nature not man barred salmon migration on the upper klamath river past ward canyon site of present day copco 1 dam and copco lake indisputable geologic and engineering records prove that nature had blocked fish migration via a series of several natural lava dams over the course of millions of years and one of these lava dams which was 31 feet tall continued to restrict salmon migration past ward canyon on the upper klamath river right up until copco 1 dam was completed see image drawing by j c boyle another of the several volcanic lava dams that blocked fish migration the upper klamath river for thousands of years barring fish migration past ward canyon was 130 feet tall which held back clammittee lake which at one time was 5 miles long and 1 mile wide that ancient dam and lake were virtually the same size as the present day copco lake the uneroded sides of that natural 130 foot high dam which stood for thousands of years can still be seen today at the site of copco 1 dam and was thoroughly detailed in the records related to the engineering plans for copco 1 dam by j c boyle see image 130 foot lava dam in 1911 mr boyle detailed what he witnessed when he arrived at ward canyon to build copco 1 dam boyle made a drawing of the natural 31 foot tall lava dam and described that natural dam and the natural lake behind that lava dam called â clammittee lakeâ the clammittee lake that boyle saw was smaller in size than the lake formed by the older 130 foot tall lava dam that held back the larger version of the same lake today clammittee lake is within the footprint of the present day copco lake over millennia a myriad of lifeforms evolved in and around this natural lake and the unique critical habitat that it provided see images and video so itâ s an indisputable geologic fact that these high lava dams which stood for tens of thousands of years made it impossible for any known fish let alone salmon that can only jump a maximum distance of 12 feet high under ideal conditions to migrate past the area of ward canyon and the present day copco 1 dam this recently presented evidence dismisses the false premise related to a mythical salmon migration that was the excuse for destroying the priceless wildlife and their habitat and for draining 45 billion gallons of fresh water stored in the lakes behind the dams of ward canyon on the klamath river the klamath river basin compact act the act is controlling federal law with regard to the 45 billion gallons of reserve water impounded by the upper klamath river dams and copco and iron gate lakes more about that act here legislators and other elected officials who have now been informed of these facts as well as those herein below must immediately act to halt the reckless rush to remove these vitally important dams based on a false premise and at great cost to the public and nature as well as other very concerning issues related to orderly nepa compliance and other equally serious issues 1 failing to obtain congressional approval for draining the 45 billion gallons of reserve fresh water contained in the klamath river lakes behind the dams that is provided by the klamath river basin compact act federal law for the beneficial uses of the public and 2 krrc s proposed dam removal budget of 450 m is grossly inadequate given that is was calculated half a decade ago and not been properly adjusted for inflation over that period nor has it been adjusted for covid economic impacts that have been experienced by the construction industry over the past year where said costs related to this unsound dam removal project have doubled in many areas related to labor fuel equipment insurance and materials that are used during any dam removal project and 3 the project places the health safety and welfare of millions of americans at risk via the potential illegal taking of the 45 billion gallons of reserve fresh water that is impounded behind the upper klamath river dams aside from generating clean non polluting hydroelectric energy for about 80 000 homes and businesses in jackson county oregon and siskiyou county california these dams also provide unrestricted amounts of easily accessed water from fire suppression for scoop aircraft and helicopters as well as for fire engines and tankers more about the importance of lakes for firefighting and scoop aircraft here the upper klamath dams also provide some important flood control features that help protect the bridges homes and towns down river from catastrophic flooding as is experienced on the klamath river every 50 years or so 4 in the process of this ill conceived and reckless dam removal enterprise willfully ignorant people propose to burden california and oregon taxpayers to the tune of 1 billion dollars in up front costs to remove the dams added to the initial bill for project costs will be the untold costs for liability that krrc is trying to shoulder upon taxpayers this cost is related to liabilities stemming from krrc s proposal could easily mount into the billions of dollars such liabilities would include but not be limited to a damage to local economies property values reduced or lost water well production and b individual and or class action litigation for air and noise pollution resulting from extreme construction and trucking activities related to dam removal over years and c litigation by environmental groups for the devastation of the local flora and fauna in the area around ward canyon and the lakes as well as for the collapse of the klamath river ecosystem that will result form 20 million cubic yards of polluted sediments being intentionally sent down the klamath river by krrc s project which will result in the silting in the spawning grounds for existing salmon and trout down the length of the klamath river 5 the destruction of the klamath river dams and the lakes behind them will also destroy the critical habitat for the myriad of life forms that have evolved around clammittee lake over the millennia today the eleven miles of the klamath river canyon around copco and iron gate lakes contain an amazing diversity of wildlife including 89 species of birds dozens of reptiles and amphibians several species of fish and 71 species of plants including trees grasses and forbs some species of this localized flora and fauna are threatened or endangered there are also numerous species of resident and migratory birds that are strictly protected by california law ab 454 against any incidental taking more about that law here 6 the improper transfer of the operating license for the klamath river dams that is in conflict with settled nepa law 7 krrc s klamath dams removal proposal was originally being funded with private money that was collected from pacificcorp s electric consumers in oregon and california however very recently it has morphed into what is now a public project due to the use of hundreds of millions of tax dollars from california and oregon which now arguably requires legislative oversight by both california and oregon legislatures siskiyou county california through its legal advocates have filed a legal brief and request for a rehearing with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc copco and iron gate lakes together hold 45 billion gallons of precious life giving water copco lake alone holds a reserve of 25 billion gallons of water

1m is no longer the standard nest egg here s how much most americans think you actually need to retire a common financial rule of thumb is that you should have 1 million saved for retirement but this piece of advice may now be outdated you may actually need roughly double that at least that s what most 401 k plan participants believe a recent survey conducted by schwab retirement plan services found that on average 2021 plan participants think they need to save 1 9 million for retirement but how accurate is this number read jaw dropping stats about the state of retirement in america see here s exactly how much savings you need to retire in your state 1 9 million is a good estimate for how much you will need in retirement nathan voris director of business strategy at schwab workplace financial services thinks that the survey participants have a pretty accurate idea of how much they will need in retirement advertisement advertisement i think for a survey like this that s a pretty good number he said that s a ballpark range for a wide range of folks obviously retirement is not one size fits all but that s sort of the middle of the range for a lot of people as voris notes there are numerous factors that will affect how much someone will actually need in retirement so some may need more and others may need less there s so much written about that but i boil it down into just a couple of things one is when do you want to retire voris said if you re going to retire at 50 you need to plan for 45 years of living expenses if it s 67 you need to plan for 30 years that has a huge factor in what your plan should be learn the downsides of retirement that nobody talks about find out how long 500k will last in retirement in each state advertisement advertisement one of the other levers is what lifestyle are you going to have in retirement he continued where are you going to live are you going to live in california or wyoming think about the state tax perspective are you going to have an active lifestyle or are you living close to grandkids where you re going to be pretty local there s a lot of factors in what level of lifestyle you want to live in retirement finally how much you need to have saved for retirement will depend on your other sources of income in retirement this includes social security pensions assets and inheritance those kinds of things can be a factor in what the retirement future looks like voris said why 1 million is no longer enough there are a number of factors that may require retirees to have a larger nest egg saved up but one of the main ones is that people are living longer in retirement advertisement advertisement retirement could be a long time voris said that idea of 20 years in retirement that was maybe tied to that 1 million number that s sort of not a realistic expectation anymore that 4 rule that 80 000 income bogey is still out there but you could be retired for 25 30 35 years check out 14 key signs you will run out of money in retirement discover 27 most lucrative side hustles for people over 50 how to save 1 9 million for retirement if you tell someone they need to save 1 9 million that can be daunting on the surface but there s a way in which you do that through planning and decision making processes that makes it attainable voris said advertisement advertisement the first step is simply making the choice to be an active participant in your financial planning be your own advocate be engaged start early take it seriously have a plan voris said the attitude towards finances in retirement when you have a plan versus not is night and day if you re just starting out be sure you re not leaving any free money on the table make sure that you re getting every penny that your employer offers whether that s a 401 k match or that s a stock purchase plan discount or hsa contribution match all of those assets that are free don t leave any of them on the table voris said approach open enrollment in that mindset and make sure that you re leveraging the most from your employer advertisement advertisement see states where your retirement will cost less than 45 000 a year read 17 tips to live comfortably off just a social security check voris said to also be mindful of debt which can derail your retirement savings plans be mindful of credit card debt be mindful of healthcare debt and have a debt plan if you have multiple cards or you have a car loan he said noting that your plan should be focused on paying down high interest debt first you should also have an emergency savings fund so that you do not have to take on more debt or tap into your retirement savings in case the unexpected strikes advertisement advertisement practically speaking for someone who is on the edge of being financially secure a life event can be disastrous voris said if the car breaks down or you accrue some medical debt or you get behind on rent those kinds of things can really throw a wrench in things having three to six months worth of living expenses saved can keep you on track with your retirement savings plans even if something were to happen learn the standard emergency savings advice was wrong how much do you really need find out should you put money into retirement or your savings here s how to know next voris said to ask for help coming up with a plan to meet your retirement goals the schwab survey found that only 40 of 401 k plan participants felt very confident in investment decisions made on their own versus 56 who felt very confident in investment decisions made with professional help advertisement advertisement take the advice that s offered voris said most 401 k record keepers have advice and financial wellness accounts and those things will help a person build a plan have an engagement partner have a sounding board increasing your confidence increases your ability to be successful from a savings and investment perspective lastly keep in mind that 1 9 million is a long term goal it s not a lump sum you re expected to save up overnight if you think about someone who is 24 or 25 that s a 35 to 40 year work savings career voris said it seems daunting that s a big number but the ability to get there if you have a plan and if you re saving over a 30 35 40 year period it s attainable that 1 9 million should empower you to make small steps and right decisions

tracy conrad special to the desert sun while no longer the tallest arguably the most recognizable skyscraper in the world is the empire state building that the iconic building exists at all is truly remarkable and is due to a quintessential new yorker john jacob raskob raskob was a figure of impressive organizational skills and was considered a financial wizard serving simultaneously as vice president of finance for both dupont de nemours and company and general motors in the latter capacity raskob created the innovative and groundbreaking general motors acceptance corporation the pioneer in automotive credit that for the first time allowed customers the opportunity to buy cars on installment directly from dealers raskob s time at general motors came to an end in 1928 when he was offered the national chairmanship of the democratic party by his old friend and democratic nominee for president alfred e smith when raskob s boss at general motors the very republican alfred p sloan heard of the offer he demanded that raskob make a choice either general motors or the democrats raskob chose the latter serving as dnc chairman from 1928 to 1932 as one of the nation s wealthiest men raskob had the means to build the world s tallest skyscraper the roaring 20s made everything seem possible and then the stock market crash of 1929 threw the economy and the country into chaos just two months before the crash raskob opined for ladies home journal in a piece entitled everybody ought to be rich he suggested every american could become wealthy by investing 15 per month in common stocks at a time when average american s weekly salary was between 17 to 22 suppose a man marries at the age of twenty three and begins a regular savings of fifteen dollars a month and almost anyone who is employed can do that if he tries if he invests in good common stocks and allows the dividends and rights to accumulate he will at the end of twenty years have at least eighty thousand dollars i am firm in my belief than anyone not only can be rich but ought to be rich the ensuing stock market crash caused raskob and the particularly ironic title of the article to be ridiculed and reviled yet his concept is fully embraced today raskob so believed in the empire state building that despite the crash he invested his immense fortune into its construction the mammoth project teetered on the very edge of financial disaster and threatened to take raskob down with it against staggering odds raskob called in every favor he had and managed to bring the unprecedented project to completion according to time magazine the building required 3 439 workers and only one year and 45 days to build the feat is even more impressive when compared to how long building projects take today the building opened in the spring of 1931 with raskob s dear friend al smith in attendance alongside then governor franklin roosevelt whom raskob would come to detest the country was slipping deeper into the depression and the building would languish for the next decade being referred to as the empty state building but after the herculean task of completing the project raskob deserved a holiday from the time of his first visit to palm springs raskob fell under the spell of the desert he had come originally to visit his friend and fellow new yorker samuel untermyer at his home the willows soon he began returning regularly whenever his business allowed generally traveling via his plush private rail car the skipaway the relaxing atmosphere of palm springs had a visible effect on the normally shy raskob to such a degree he began making news not by huge corporate or political dealings but by his heretofore unknown skill at dancing contests at the el mirador hotel the hotel s tower was the tallest most iconic building in the desert for many years and naturally appealed to raskob understanding the allure of the west raskob invested in precious metal mining in nevada and new mexico ranching pesticides the aeronautical industry and in a vast tract of desert land the desert sun took note it is reported that the old well at the new desert springs development across the desert north of palm springs has been cleaned out by workmen and found to contain a goodly amount of water it is also reported that workmen are at this time starting to put down another well on the property the property adjoins the 2500 acres owned by john j raskob north of garnet and u s highway 99 raskob s extensive holdings of hot water bearing lands would eventually become desert hot springs road crews are grading streets and a well is being drilled on the upper end of a 2500 acre tract north of garnet which was purchased last year by john j raskob general motors executive and former national democratic committee chairman this newspaper was unable to contact mr raskob yesterday who is a guest at el mirador hotel in palm springs it is reported he is planning to develop his land into one of the finest and most exclusive residential districts on the desert with all utilities underground so that there will be no poles to mar the landscape it is also said there will be architectural restrictions and only large estates so that residents may have privacy tony burke publicity man at the el mirador and aspiring realtor brokered the huge purchase and was forever grateful to raskob whom he described as a diminutive gentleman physically but a giant of industry burke thought raskob charming and visionary he initiated plans for large estates linked by paved roads lined with lampposts with utilities underground this was a revolutionary concept for any locale outside a big city provide elegant desert hones on spacious estates for the wintertime use of big corporation executives from the east regrettably the plan was dropped when his arch political enemy mr roosevelt was elected president raskob vowed he would not advance any project while that man is in the white house raskob continued to visit the village of palm springs the newspaper is littered with mentions of his whereabouts and activities john raskob briskest of village walkers quick striding along the street and very natty sartorially in a brown outfit as most new yorkers seem to rush about the description was fitting of the most quintessential of new yorkers and builder of the most iconic of new york skyscrapers tracy conrad is president of the palm springs historical society the thanks for the memories column appears sundays in the desert sun write to her at pshstracy gmail com
a drawing from 1913 by famous engineer dam builder j c boyle that shows the naturally formed 31 foot tall lava dam barring fish migration and holding back the klamath river creating clammittee lake which was present when construction on copco 1 dam began famous engineer and dam builder j c boyle whose stock and trade was based on accuracy made a drawing of the natural lava dam and lake clammittee when he arrived in 1911 to build copco 1 dam the department of interior narrative about copco 1 dam and the natural 130 foot tall lava dam that created a natural lake called clammittee lake that existed for millennia where a myriad of life forms evolved in its unique habitat firefighters drew over 1 million gallons of water from iron gate lake one of the lakes behind the klamath river dams to fight the 38 000 acre klamathon fire that threatened ashland oregon and the cascade siskiyou national monument photo william e si baby western pond turtles are just one of many threatened and endangered species at copco and iron gate lakes on the klamath river these lakes provide critical habitat for numerous threatened and endangered species in and around the lakes photo laurie dana california governor newsom to charge taxpayers hundreds of millions to drain 45 billion gallons of water from lakes as wells across california are going dry yreka california united states august 8 2021 einpresswire com california oregon and other western states are now enduring one of the most intense droughts in recent history and coupled with the mega drought are catastrophic wildfires which are further damaging riparian areas and decimating the alpine forests that are needed to hold precipitation in the form of snow pack without the shade provided by alpine forests winter snow pack is subjected to direct sunlight and rapid warming which causes premature runoff into the sea resulting in much lower stream and river flows in spring and summer months and climate change experts are saying that we are likely entering a period of worsening drought and with that increasing catastrophic wildfire and toxic smoke western states are now in what is being called a water crisis by ap news and the water that people desperately need just to survive in domestic settings and for fighting the growing wildfire crisis is quickly becoming a rare commodity due to mismanagement of forests and water storage and conservation clearly the intelligent path to surviving this growing water and wildfire crisis is to start by preserving existing dams and resulting lakes that store excess water during winter months western states need more water storage dams so destroying any water storage dams during a water crisis is just crazy the klamath river dams that form copco and iron gates and provide 45 billion gallons of reserve water stores are of paramount importance for human survival anyone promoting the removal of structurally sound water storage dams during the growing water crisis and drought in california oregon and other the western states is totally disconnected from the reality that is being faced by american taxpayers in western states by retaining existing dams and building more dams we save excess winter precipitation that did not make it into aquifers without the dams to catch and hold excess water that water would simply run off into the sea it s important to note that during winter rains there is more than enough water for all wildlife and fishes in large rivers and streams like the klamath river allowing excess winter precipitation to run into the sea during a growing water crises will guarantee that americans will have less available water as the mega drought deepens over the summers of each successive year based upon his actions california governor gavin newsom seems to be talking out both sides of his face as outlined below gavin newsom also shows a serious deficit in vision and his memory seems lacking as we read in an article titled californiaâ s wasted winter rains by the wall street journal in 2017 the wall street journal article states reservoirs and rivers are overflowing as storms have pounded california this winter and after years of drought that should be good news the problem is that misguided environmentalism is wasting the water windfall and failing to store it for a non rainy day hydrologic records indicate that this year could be the wettest on record in california statewide snowpack measures 160 of average precipitation in palm springs exceeds the historic norm by more than 50 lo the desert is actually blooming most of the major reservoirs in the north are full and some are releasing hundreds of billions of gallons of water to prevent flooding and make room for the melting snowpack this spring while farmers and communities downstream can capture some of the discharges millions of acre feet will invariably flow into the ocean due to lack of storage capacity and rules to protect endangered fish species one problem is that while the state population has increased 70 since 1979 storage hasnâ t expanded water districts in southern california have developed small local reservoirs and groundwater basins but whatâ s most needed is storage in the north where most of the rain and snow falls in what many people and organizations are calling the most obtuse move ever california governor gavin newsom has joined with a non profit shell corporation called the klamath river renewal corporation krrc with plans on spending up to 1 billion tax dollars to destroy perfectly sound water storage dams on the upper klamath river and in that process draining 45 billion gallons of fresh water reserves from copco and iron gate lakes on the upper klamath river in addition this billion dollar debacle losing copco and iron gate lakes means losing critical habitat for over 150 species of flora and fauna some of which are endangered threatened or of special interest and in what seems to be even more insanity ca governor gavin newsom is wanting to tax californians billions more to allegedly get this build and raise dams in addition to lost value of 45 billion gallons of stored water in copco and iron gate lakes the replacement costs for the two perfectly sound dams copco and iron gate dams that newsom wants to charge taxpayers to destroy is about 843 million dollars talk about runaway waste more here it seems that californians have a governor in gavin newsom who is disconnected from reality so it s no wonder that half of all californians are calling for him to be recalled and removed from office and it seems in this case with very good reason how can anyone who is thinking straight and seeing the extreme drought water crisis and growing catastrophic wildfire in the west even begin to consider destroying structurally sound dams and draining 45 billion gallons of water reserves into the sea every year including years of extreme drought iron gate and copco lakes are full of water stored behind their respective dams full of water is it just unvarnished insanity or is it the lust for money recently presented science and engineering documents prove that the key premise that has been vigorously almost militantly promoted through propaganda distributed by the klamath river renewal corporation â krrcâ and their support base of fishing zealots is fake and has been soundly debunked by common sense indisputable geologic records and engineering documents any unbiased and fully informed review of krrc s proposed dam removal project renders their dam removal proposal a complete non starter lets examine why that is the case first of all profiting the wealthy privately owned pacificcorp via their relationship through krrc by way of getting california and oregon taxpayers to pay the lion s share for krrc s dam removal proposal and at the same time depriving americans of their water property rights wildlife tax dollars and devastating nature in the process is not acceptable under any circumstances pacifcorp financials can be found at yahoo finance as the mega drought and wildfires intensify in western states these elitists and their fishing zealot surrogates seem to prefer that average tax paying americans go without water so they can benefit these people are also willing to destroy an amazing natural wonder for the sake of more profits and their personal hobby interests this video shows nature s wonders that will be destroyed if these people aren t stopped now secondly nature not man barred salmon migration on the upper klamath river past ward canyon site of present day copco 1 dam and copco lake indisputable geologic and engineering records prove that nature had blocked fish migration via a series of several natural lava dams over the course of millions of years and one of these lava dams which was 31 feet tall continued to restrict salmon migration past ward canyon on the upper klamath river right up until copco 1 dam was completed see image drawing by j c boyle another of the several volcanic lava dams that blocked fish migration the upper klamath river for thousands of years barring fish migration past ward canyon was 130 feet tall which held back clammittee lake which at one time was 5 miles long and 1 mile wide that ancient dam and lake were virtually the same size as the present day copco lake the uneroded sides of that natural 130 foot high dam which stood for thousands of years can still be seen today at the site of copco 1 dam and was thoroughly detailed in the records related to the engineering plans for copco 1 dam by j c boyle see image 130 foot lava dam in 1911 mr boyle detailed what he witnessed when he arrived at ward canyon to build copco 1 dam boyle made a drawing of the natural 31 foot tall lava dam and described that natural dam and the natural lake behind that lava dam called â clammittee lakeâ the clammittee lake that boyle saw was smaller in size than the lake formed by the older 130 foot tall lava dam that held back the larger version of the same lake today clammittee lake is within the footprint of the present day copco lake over millennia a myriad of lifeforms evolved in and around this natural lake and the unique critical habitat that it provided see images and video so itâ s an indisputable geologic fact that these high lava dams which stood for tens of thousands of years made it impossible for any known fish let alone salmon that can only jump a maximum distance of 12 feet high under ideal conditions to migrate past the area of ward canyon and the present day copco 1 dam this recently presented evidence dismisses the false premise related to a mythical salmon migration that was the excuse for destroying the priceless wildlife and their habitat and for draining 45 billion gallons of fresh water stored in the lakes behind the dams of ward canyon on the klamath river the klamath river basin compact act the act is controlling federal law with regard to the 45 billion gallons of reserve water impounded by the upper klamath river dams and copco and iron gate lakes more about that act here legislators and other elected officials who have now been informed of these facts as well as those herein below must immediately act to halt the reckless rush to remove these vitally important dams based on a false premise and at great cost to the public and nature as well as other very concerning issues related to orderly nepa compliance and other equally serious issues 1 failing to obtain congressional approval for draining the 45 billion gallons of reserve fresh water contained in the klamath river lakes behind the dams that is provided by the klamath river basin compact act federal law for the beneficial uses of the public and 2 krrc s proposed dam removal budget of 450 m is grossly inadequate given that is was calculated half a decade ago and not been properly adjusted for inflation over that period nor has it been adjusted for covid economic impacts that have been experienced by the construction industry over the past year where said costs related to this unsound dam removal project have doubled in many areas related to labor fuel equipment insurance and materials that are used during any dam removal project and 3 the project places the health safety and welfare of millions of americans at risk via the potential illegal taking of the 45 billion gallons of reserve fresh water that is impounded behind the upper klamath river dams aside from generating clean non polluting hydroelectric energy for about 80 000 homes and businesses in jackson county oregon and siskiyou county california these dams also provide unrestricted amounts of easily accessed water from fire suppression for scoop aircraft and helicopters as well as for fire engines and tankers more about the importance of lakes for firefighting and scoop aircraft here the upper klamath dams also provide some important flood control features that help protect the bridges homes and towns down river from catastrophic flooding as is experienced on the klamath river every 50 years or so 4 in the process of this ill conceived and reckless dam removal enterprise willfully ignorant people propose to burden california and oregon taxpayers to the tune of 1 billion dollars in up front costs to remove the dams added to the initial bill for project costs will be the untold costs for liability that krrc is trying to shoulder upon taxpayers this cost is related to liabilities stemming from krrc s proposal could easily mount into the billions of dollars such liabilities would include but not be limited to a damage to local economies property values reduced or lost water well production and b individual and or class action litigation for air and noise pollution resulting from extreme construction and trucking activities related to dam removal over years and c litigation by environmental groups for the devastation of the local flora and fauna in the area around ward canyon and the lakes as well as for the collapse of the klamath river ecosystem that will result form 20 million cubic yards of polluted sediments being intentionally sent down the klamath river by krrc s project which will result in the silting in the spawning grounds for existing salmon and trout down the length of the klamath river 5 the destruction of the klamath river dams and the lakes behind them will also destroy the critical habitat for the myriad of life forms that have evolved around clammittee lake over the millennia today the eleven miles of the klamath river canyon around copco and iron gate lakes contain an amazing diversity of wildlife including 89 species of birds dozens of reptiles and amphibians several species of fish and 71 species of plants including trees grasses and forbs some species of this localized flora and fauna are threatened or endangered there are also numerous species of resident and migratory birds that are strictly protected by california law ab 454 against any incidental taking more about that law here 6 the improper transfer of the operating license for the klamath river dams that is in conflict with settled nepa law 7 krrc s klamath dams removal proposal was originally being funded with private money that was collected from pacificcorp s electric consumers in oregon and california however very recently it has morphed into what is now a public project due to the use of hundreds of millions of tax dollars from california and oregon which now arguably requires legislative oversight by both california and oregon legislatures siskiyou county california through its legal advocates have filed a legal brief and request for a rehearing with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc copco and iron gate lakes together hold 45 billion gallons of precious life giving water copco lake alone holds a reserve of 25 billion gallons of water

the lithium miner significantly raised its full year 2021 guidance for both revenue and a key profitability metric livent lthm surged 8 6 on friday following the lithium producer s release after the market close on thursday of a strong second quarter 2021 earnings report the largest u s based lithium pure play based in philadelphia easily beat the wall street consensus estimates for revenue and earnings but what probably most electrified investors was management s raising of full year 2021 guidance for revenue and a key profitability metric through aug 6 livent stock has gained 222 over the one year period compared with the s p 500 s 34 5 return most lithium mining stocks have performed well over the past year largely thanks to investor optimism stemming from the biden administration s support of electric vehicles lithium is a key component in the lithium ion batteries that power evs and improving conditions for end markets of lithium many customers delayed their purchases of lithium during the early stages of the covid 19 pandemic because of supply chain disruptions livent s key numbers metric q2 2021 q2 2020 change revenue 102 2 million 64 9 million 57 gaap operating income 4 0 million 2 2 million n a gaap net income 6 5 million 0 2 million n a adjusted net income 7 8 million 0 1 million n a gaap earnings per share eps 0 03 0 00 n a adjusted eps 0 04 0 00 n a revenue increased 11 from the first quarter which the company attributed to a combination of higher volumes sold and higher prices across its key lithium products wall street was looking for adjusted eps of 0 02 on revenue of 88 8 million so livent exceeded both expectations with the revenue beat a big one livent had easy comparables because its business was hurt by the early stages of the pandemic in q2 2020 its revenue plunged 43 year over year its q2 2021 revenue is still lower than it was two years ago q2 2019 but just by 10 in q2 2020 its gaap eps of breakeven was down from 0 11 in q2 2019 and adjusted eps of breakeven was down from 0 12 in q2 2019 livent s cash flow situation is in better shape than a year ago in the first six months of 2021 the company generated cash of 30 6 million running its operations compared with using cash of 0 3 million in the year ago period it ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 216 6 million up from 17 2 million in the year ago period it had 239 7 million in long term debt at the end of q2 an improvement from 274 6 million in the year ago period capacity expansion projects resumed in the u s and argentina in early may when livent announced its first quarter results it said it had resumed its capacity expansion plans in the united states and argentina which are backed by the execution of recent long term supply agreements these projects were paused in march 2020 soon after the pandemic began in that release livent said it expects its bessemer city north carolina project which adds 5 000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide capacity to reach commercial production by q3 2022 and it projects that phase 1 of its argentina expansion which adds 10 000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity will reach commercial production by q1 2023 what management had to say here s part of what ceo paul graves had to say in the earnings release we were pleased to complete the equity issuance and are focused on executing on our capacity expansion projects which are progressing on schedule increasing production capacity and building upon our low cost and sustainable operations will strengthen our commercial footprint and enhance our position as a partner of choice to leading auto oems and battery producers graves is referring to livent s public stock offering in june which raised about 262 million 2021 guidance increased the company said the guidance increases stem largely from higher lithium pricing as there are limited additional volumes available full year revenue is expected to range from 370 million to 390 million up from the prior outlook of 335 million to 365 million the new outlook represents annual growth of 28 to 35 full year adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization is now expected to range from 55 million to 70 million up from 40 million to 60 million the new outlook represents annual growth of 147 to 214 graves commented on the lithium market and the company s outlook for the market lithium market conditions remain very positive in 2021 and we see the trends continuing into 2022 pricing conditions have significantly improved

one year period compared with the s p 500 s 34 5 return most lithium mining stocks have performed well over the past year largely thanks to investor optimism stemming from the biden administration s

revenue increased 11 from the first quarter which the company attributed to a combination of higher volumes sold and higher prices across its key lithium products wall street was looking for adjusted eps of 0 02 on revenue of 88 8 million so livent exceeded both expectations with the revenue beat a big one livent had easy comparables because its business was hurt by the early stages of the

lithium hydroxide capacity to reach commercial production by q3 2022 and it projects that phase 1 of its argentina expansion which adds 10 000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity will reach commercial production by q1 2023 what management had to say here s part of what ceo paul graves had to say in the earnings release we were pleased to complete the equity issuance and are focused on

footprint and enhance our position as a partner of choice to leading auto oems and battery producers graves is referring to livent s public stock offering in june which raised about 262 million 2021 guidance increased the company said the guidance increases stem largely from higher lithium pricing as there are limited additional volumes available full year revenue is expected to range from 370

disney bashes scarlett johansson s orchestrated pr campaign with black widow lawsuit disney has finally hit back against johansson s black widow lawsuit with a statement of their own the production company released a statement highlighting the alleged pr stunt scarlett johansson dished out on them through her black widow lawsuit according to report by the independent it read to maximise these receipts and thereby protect her financial interests ms johansson extracted a promise from marvel that the release of the picture would be a theatrical release as ms johansson disney marvel and most everyone else in hollywood knows a theatrical release is a release that is exclusive to movie theatres disney was well aware of this promise but nonetheless directed marvel to violate its pledge and instead release the picture on the disney streaming service the very same day it was released in movie theatres disney intentionally induced marvel s breach of the agreement without justification in order to prevent ms johansson from realising the full benefit of her bargain with marvel it s no secret that disney is releasing films like black widow directly onto disney to increase subscribers and thereby boost the company s stock price and that it s hiding behind covid 19 as a pretext to do so but ignoring the contracts of the artists responsible for the success of its films in furtherance of this short sighted strategy violates their rights and we look forward to proving as much in court this will surely not be the last case where hollywood talent stands up to disney and makes it clear that whatever the company may pretend it has a legal obligation to honor its contracts the statement concluding by saying it is obvious that this is a highly orchestrated pr campaign to achieve an outcome that is not obtainable in the lawsuit no amount of public pressure can change or obscure the explicit contractual commitments the written contract is clear as a bell
