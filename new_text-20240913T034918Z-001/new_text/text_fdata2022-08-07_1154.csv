washington u s senate democrats on saturday were set to push ahead on a bill that would address key elements of president joe biden s agenda tackling climate change lowering the cost of energy and elderly people s medications and forcing some corporations and wealthy americans to pay more taxes the senate parliamentarian determined that the lion s share of the healthcare provisions in the 430 billion bill could be passed with only a simple majority bypassing a filibuster rule requiring 60 votes in the 100 seat chamber to advance most legislation and enabling democrats to pass it over republican objections majority leader chuck schumer said in a statement the senate began its rare weekend session at around noon saturday will kick off an arduous process that could extend into early next week with senators offering amendment after amendment in a time consuming vote a rama democrats hope that the legislation will give a boost to their candidates in the nov 8 midterm elections in which biden s party is in an uphill battle to retain its narrow control of the senate and house of representatives the democrats cast the legislation as a vehicle to combat inflation a prime concern of u s voters this year democrats have received extremely good news schumer said in the statement medicare will finally be allowed to negotiate drug prices this is a major victory for the american people advertisement medicare is the government health insurance program for the elderly and certain americans with disabilities there are three main parts to the tax provisions in the bill a 15 minimum tax on corporations and the closing of loopholes that the wealthy can use to avoid paying taxes tougher irs enforcement and a new excise tax on stock buybacks the legislation has 430 billion in new spending along with raising more than 740 billion in new revenues beside billions of dollars to encourage the production and purchase of more electric vehicles and foster clean energy the bill would set 4 billion in new federal drought relief funds the latter is a move that could help the re election campaigns of democratic senators catherine cortez masto in nevada and mark kelly in arizona senator tom carper the chairman of the senate committee on the environment and public works said climate provisions including the methane emissions reduction program were approved by the senate parliamentarian republicans have promised to do everything they can to stall or block the bill with senator lindsey graham on friday calling the democratic backed legislation this jihad they re on to tax and spend democrats aim to push the bill through the senate using an arcane and complicated reconciliation procedure allowing passage without any republican support in the chamber divided 50 50 between the parties with the democrats in control because vice president kamala harris can cast a tie breaking vote one provision cut from the bill would have forced drug companies to refund money to both government and private health plans if drug prices rise more quickly than inflation the parliamentarian ruled that measure could not apply to private industry advertisement senators on the left such as bernie sanders are likely to try to expand the scope of the bill to include new programs such as federal subsidies for childcare or home healthcare for the elderly republicans have signaled that they will offer plenty of amendments touching on another issue immigrants coming across the u s border with mexico several democratic senators said they would vote against all amendments fearing that these could make a delicately negotiated deal unravel i will vote no on all amendments even for stuff i like democratic senator brian schatz wrote on twitter i can think of lots of ways to strengthen it but i won t derail this bill by supporting changes reporting by richard cowan and makini brice additional reporting by valerie volcovici editing by will dunham and scott malone more nation world coverage

everyone for joining the call today on this call we will begin with an overview of our performance for the quarter ended june 30 2022 provide updates on key financial performance metrics and discuss the progress we have made against our strategy at the end of the call we will open the line for q a turning to a review of our performance during the second quarter we made meaningful progress towards executing our long term strategic plan and remain encouraged by the demand for our products across all business segments consolidated sales for the quarter increased 11 to 195 million gross profit increased 4 to 59 2 million representing 30 4 of sales reported operating income increased 28 to 35 3 million in our distilling solutions segment we continue to experience strong demand for new distillate and aged whiskey this momentum continues to contribute favorably to top line growth with a 29 increase in brown goods sales for the quarter versus the prior year quarter as for our branded spirits segment consumer demand for our premium plus brands which includes premium super premium and ultra premium spirits brands such as yellowstone remus and el mayor also remained strong and continues to drive gross margin expansion our ingredient solutions segment continues to execute at a high level and during the quarter achieved record results further optimization of the segment product mix to align with consumer demand trends resulted in a 21 increase to segment sales compared to the prior year period looking at each segment in greater detail we posted another strong quarter in our distilling solutions segment with sales increasing 19 to 107 1 million gross profit for the quarter decreased to 29 8 million or 27 8 of segment sales the decline in gross profit can be attributed primarily to the impact of increased commodity and natural gas costs and additional supply entering the markets for our industrial alcohol and white goods offerings these factors were consistent with our expectations for the quarter we continue to benefit from strong demand in each of our customer categories for brown goods our diverse aged whiskey library coupled with the seasoned sales and customer service team and the team s high level of execution continues to support the segment s growth trajectory and has enabled us to maintain strong pricing and margins sales of new distillate also posted strong growth during the second quarter this growth was attributed to an increase in demand compared to the prior year quarter our significant market share and scale advantage continues to position us well to support ongoing growth in the american whiskey category as discussed during our call last quarter demand for aged whiskey continues to be very strong we will continue to be strategic with our aged whiskey sales to enable us to meet expected customer needs for the balance of this year as well as position us to meet anticipated customer needs in the coming years turning to white goods sales decreased 4 versus the prior year quarter the decline was primarily due to lower volumes for our white goods premium beverage products similar to last quarter our industrial alcohol product sales decreased 13 the decline in industrial sales was in part attributed to reduced third party sales volume of industrial alcohol produced by icp our former joint venture partner consistent with last quarter we expect margins for both industrial alcohol and white goods products to remain at levels in the low single digits and in some cases to incur negative gross margins this is a result of additional supply entering the market and its anticipated impact on profitability as well as increased input costs primarily corn and natural gas costs we continue to focus on migrating away from industrial alcohol and toward our white goods premium beverage products whose customers historically are longer term in nature and pricing is less susceptible to wide swings turning to branded spirits sales totaled 58 6 million for the quarter a decline of 3 versus the prior year quarter while our premium plus brands performed well we experienced a decline in sales driven by lower volumes in the mid and value price points categories even with a slight decline in sales versus the prior year quarter gross profit increased to 21 million or 35 8 of segment sales the increase in gross margin can be attributed to the favorable performance of our higher margin brands and to a required non recurring accounting step up in the prior year period the branded spirits segment remains focused on improving our portfolio profitability by optimizing margin through expansion and innovation in the premium plus price categories we remain committed to successfully executing our premiumization strategy and we ll continue to invest in marketing support to achieve sustainable and profitable growth for our brands in this category evidence of our commitment can be seen on larger media buys resulting in television commercials increased social media presences and the use of key influencers to drive brand awareness for our premium plus brands our strategy is simple grow profitability through leveraging the expansion of our premium plus brand portfolio with particular focus on tequila and american whiskey both which continue to expand around the globe turning to ingredient solutions sales for the quarter increased 21 to a record 29 3 million similar to last quarter the increase in sales was primarily due to higher average selling prices of specialty wheat starches and proteins we are pleased with the progress we have achieved in this segment to date we are confident that our extensive project pipeline for these products along with further optimization of the segment product mix to meet our customers needs will drive long term growth for this segment an example of this will be seen in the second half of this year as we launch our proterra brand into a new channel of distribution selling to colleges and universities for their use in their venues as a plant based meat alternative before i turn the call over to brandon i want to reiterate how encouraged we are by our diverse customer base and our product offerings continuing to align with consumer trends our robust gross margins and ability to execute against our long term strategy continue to provide us with the momentum required to achieve our fiscal 2022 goals this concludes my initial remarks let me now turn things over to brandon gall for a review of the key metrics and numbers brandon brandon gall thanks dave for the second quarter 2022 consolidated sales increased 11 to 195 million as a result of sales growth in the distilling solutions and ingredient solutions segments gross profit increased 4 to 59 2 million gross margin decreased 30 4 as dave mentioned earlier we remained committed to making investments in marketing as part of our premiumization strategy as such our advertising and promotion expenses for the second quarter of 2022 increased 2 7 million to 6 1 million as compared to the second quarter 2021 primarily driven by incremental investment in the ultra premium super premium and premium price here in our branded spirits segment corporate selling general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2022 decreased 7 9 million to 17 9 million as compared to the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to the onetime acquisition costs in 2021 related to the luxco acquisition that did not recur in 2022 operating income for the second quarter increased 28 to 35 3 million primarily due to the increase in sales and gross profits and as previously discussed the reduction in sg a adjusted operating income decreased 4 from 36 9 million due to the increased investment in advertising and promotion in support of our brand spirits segment our corporate effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was 22 4 compared with 24 2 from the year ago period resulting from favorable tax benefits concerning our capital spend and foreign operations net income for the second quarter increased 26 to 25 4 million basic and diluted earnings per share increased to 1 15 per share from 0 91 per share basic and diluted adjusted eps decreased to 1 15 per share from 1 27 per share adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 40 1 million a 5 decrease from the year ago period driven primarily by increased advertising and promotion expenses for our premium plus tier spirits brands as well as increased combined costs specific to industrial and white goods alcohol and the price elasticity resulting from the additional supply that has entered these markets additionally relative to the prior year quarter our input cost for corn increased 54 wheat flour increased 23 and natural gas increased 74 although the average selling price for industrial alcohol and white goods increased for the quarter it was not enough to offset the higher input costs previously we expected to see an approximate 700 basis point decline in year over year gross margin percent for our white goods and industrial alcohol products on a combined basis in 2022 given these recent market dynamics we now believe this decline could approach 1 100 basis points for the full year that said we remain committed to pricing through these increases where possible and our full year consolidated guidance contemplates these inflationary headwinds year to date cash flow from operations totaled 43 million reflecting the consistent and strong cash generating capability of our business strong free cash flows further highlight the value and execution of our long term strategy providing mgp with adequate support for m a and our expansionary projects mgp s balance sheet also remains strong allowing us to continue to invest to grow we remain well capitalized with debt totaling 232 million and a strong cash position of 37 4 million during the quarter our investment in inventory of aging whiskey increased by 4 9 million to 184 9 million at cost this net increase was driven by increased put away during the quarter matching whiskey put away with growing future distilling solutions and branded spirits segment sales is one of our priorities and long term strategies we announced last quarter that we expect approximately 47 2 million in capital expenditures during 2022 which represents an approximate 10 million increase above the forecast we provided during the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call we continue to prioritize investments that enhance our operational capabilities and have identified opportunities to accelerate ongoing projects these opportunities include the construction of the textured protein facility in atchison kansas as well as new opportunities that will strengthen our competitive position in the markets we serve each of these projects remains on track the board authorized a quarterly dividend in the amount of 0 12 per share which is payable on september 2 to stockholders of record as of august 19 the board continues to view dividends as an important way to show the success of the company with shareholders we continue to believe our capital allocation strategy focused on organic and acquisitive growth aligns well with our long term strategy leveraging this approach we are able to better position the business to benefit from underlying consumer trends we will continue to pursue m a and conduct expansionary projects to accelerate growth and increase our capabilities and product offerings and now let me turn things back over to dave for concluding remarks david colo thanks brandon we are very pleased with the strong results delivered year to date despite the increased commodity and energy costs demand for our products remain strong and we believe our business continues to be well positioned to mitigate these challenges through the balance of the year while we anticipate volatility in the broader economy to persist in the near term we remain encouraged by our diverse customer base and product offerings and believe they continue to align with consumer trends we believe our team s capabilities strong market position robust gross margins and ability to execute against our long term strategy will provide us with momentum to achieve our fiscal 2022 goals we will be deliberate in all actions we take in navigating the balance of the year including continuing to further realign our production and sales mix with focus on increasing our highest margin products supported with increased investment in advertising and promotion to support continued growth in our premium plus tier spirits brands for these reasons as well as our strong first half performance we are increasing our financial outlook for the fiscal year ended december 31 2022 our revised outlook for the full fiscal 2022 year assumes the following sales projected to be in the range of 745 million to 765 million compared to our previous range of 690 million to 715 million adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 156 million to 163 million compared to our previous range of 150 million to 157 million and basic adjusted earnings per common share in the range of 4 41 to 4 65 compared to our previous range of 4 15 to 4 35 we are confident that each of our business segments remains well positioned against strong macro consumer trends and we continue to believe that our strategy will drive long term sustainable growth as we progress our esg initiative we recently disclosed our environmental and sustainability policy statement and our waste information for the first quarter as well as our energy management and greenhouse gas disclosures for the first half of the year these disclosures can be found on our company website under the social responsibility section we remain on track to disclose the company s wider usage information through the third quarter and to release our environmental sustainability report for calendar year 2022 in early 2023 we are also working with a third party to a holistic assessment of the company s esg program to ensure we have an effective and optimized approach to our es journey going forward we are committed to refining the effectiveness of our tactical execution and we will continue to leverage the strong foundation we have established over the years with the objective to deliver sustainable long term value for our shareholders that concludes our prepared remarks operator we are ready to begin the question and answer portion of the call question and answer session operator our first question today comes from sean mcgowan from roth capital partners sean mcgowan general question about consumer behavior do you think in the face of general inflation particularly in certain categories that consumers are likely to be trading up in their alcohol choices or kind of being more conservative your performance in the quarter suggests no slowdown in that premiumization but i was just wondering what your outlook says david colo thanks sean i think your read right through the second quarter of this year actually if you look at what we call our premium plus price tier brands they actually grew close to 12 in revenue for the quarter so we really haven t seen to date any trade down by consumers in their spirits choices i think if inflation continues to stay high like it has in the 8 to 10 range longer term that may change but everything we ve seen to date and even the research that is published in our industry suggests that consumers are maintaining their position of kind of being dedicated to the brands they consume in the premium plus price tiers sean mcgowan can you update us on what your expected effective tax rate would be for the year brandon gall we expect that to be in the 24 range for the remainder of the year operator and our next question comes from vivien azer from cowen vivien azer my first question is on brown spirits within distillery products i was wondering if you could give any incremental color on the shape of the quarter from an ordering perspective i mean there s just been so much volatility in terms of consumer inflation i m wondering how your customers are responding to that intra quarter david colo vivien we continue to see very strong demand in our brown goods both aged whiskey and new distillate and i think we published our results for brown goods were up 29 in revenue for the quarter so still very strong demand and we re really in a position where we re kind of having to govern or moderate our aged whiskey sales in particular for the balance of the year to make sure that we have adequate inventories to support future years growth but we ve seen really no letup in demand for both aged and new distillate through the quarter vivien azer but just a follow up on that was there incremental demand in june because that s when gas prices started to roll over david colo yes i mean in the brown goods business what we tend to do is we look at it on a full year basis and really don t get too hung up on month to month changes in sales but we ve really seen no pullback in demand related to what s going on with the current inflationary environment vivien azer and then my unrelated follow up please just on margin so obviously the midpoint of your adjusted ebitda margin comes down you ve explained the incremental gross margin headwind going from 700 to 1 100 basis points brandon anything else to call out in there brandon gall just a couple of things there vivien it s about an incremental 5 million above what we thought was going to happen at the beginning of the year and a lot of that pressure at this point we re seeing all those can take place throughout the course of the year probably a little bit more loaded into q2 and q3 relative to q1 and q4 so that s some additional context for you vivien operator and our next question comes from mitch pinheiro from sturdivant mitch pinheiro want to follow up when it comes to sort of when you look at price mix in the quarter for the premium beverage alcohol being down i guess 5 how does that sort of what which is that just a mix of new and aged distillate or is there anything else is list pricing down at all brandon gall so premium beverage alcohol for the quarter just to be clear was actually up 19 within that is white goods and brown goods brown goods were actually at 29 as dave already mentioned and white goods was off about 4 just due to lower volumes in the quarter so overall from a premium beverage alcohol standpoint and especially from a brown good standpoint we are still seeing continued strength in demand throughout the quarter mitch pinheiro i saw price mix being down 5 in the q maybe i misread that so i apologize brandon gall the volume was down 5 price mix was actually up 24 mitch pinheiro i had that backwards in my notes and then have you guys seen any i mean out of stocks affect in the branded spirits segment out of stocks have any impact on your sales david colo not really mitch i mean we have benefited a little bit in some of our value brands because some of our competitors have had out of stock issues in some of their products and we ve been able to go in and fill some of those gaps but our team has done a really good job managing the supply chain issues and some of the constraints that you re probably well aware of in the industry and we ve had no really material impact on our business related to shortages operator our next question comes from will chappell from truist securities william chappell i ll just start on the guidance certainly appreciate the beat and the raise but kind of looking at the math it kind of calls for 35 40 of your earnings to come in the back half of the year which traditionally the business is more equal weighted and if not anything more fourth quarter weighted just with timing of orders for and new distillates so is there something different in your business where that would be the case or are we just kind of looking at general conservatism until the orders come in brandon gall and you hit it on the head by bringing up brown goods and order patterns because as we ve always said and you said just now the visibility as to the timing quarter to quarter is not always great but look at us in the whole year q1 for brown goods was an exceptionally strong quarter from a sales perspective and that s really kind of as we look at the full year it s going to be naturally weighted a little bit more toward that and that s how we see the rest of the year playing out william chappell and then a couple on white goods i mean do you feel like we re at a stable area from that i understand there s still supply in industrial but in terms of do you feel like the market is fairly stable and you have some visibility going forward or could it get worse just trying to understand how that plays out david colo i think at this point brandon read off i think corn is up 54 versus the prior year quarter natural gas is up 74 as you probably well know commodity prices have started to come off a bit corn so much natural gas but we feel like in the revised guidance we ve provided that we ve taken into account the best of our ability anyway how those impact the profitability of white goods for the balance of the year so we think we ve got that baked into the guidance william chappell and then turning to lux before you bought the business or acquired the brands it was i think growing low single digits flattish to low single digits obviously ticked up pretty nicely to high single to double digits over the past few quarters and now dropped to kind of negative 3 this quarter i know you re not going to give us a segment guidance but i mean what s the general range do you think we re kind of going back to that low single digit overall business with the value brands kind of bringing down some of the premium brands could it be better could it be worse just trying to understand how i should be looking at that going forward brandon gall so in november at our investor day we shared that we expect this segment to grow in line with total distilled spirits and which is in that 1 to 3 in total historically and that s how we continue to view it and given our portfolio is very well balanced and pretty well representative of overall total distilled spirits however that being said our focus is not necessarily in the top line but more on the gross margin line and the brand contribution line so that s why we re focusing our efforts on the premium plus price tiers and the 11 8 growth that those 3 tiers collectively contributed in the second quarter we thought was a great sign for the portfolio david colo the only other thing i d add is we did in q2 cycle over some channel reload if you will and q2 last year associated with the on premise kind of reboot so i don t know that i overread the quarter from that just because of the channel reload if you will from the prior year quarter william chappell i think you touched on a little bit in the past couple of quarters but talking about continuous improvement program and what itâ s done for the ingredient business i mean itâ s a pretty obviously meaningful margin improvement but maybe you could talk a little bit more about where we are in that program and then what you think you can do for the distilled spirits business particularly in indiana if you apply the same kind of practices that would be great thanks david colo weâ ve made tremendous progress with our continuous efforts improvement efforts in the ingredients business itâ s a big reason that you see one the ability to increase capacity and throughput in that facility to support the strong sales growth that weâ re seeing but also itâ s helped our cost structure which has also helped drive gross margin improvement and weâ re taking those same concepts and starting to roll them out to our distillery locations with actually lawrenceburg indiana distillery being the next focus because we need to improve the throughput of that distillery to support our demand growth but in general youâ ll see us to be very pragmatic in how we roll that out our plans are to roll it out across all of our different sites and as you well know bill that pays dividends it helps us increase our gross margin percentages over time and we then have optionality on how to reinvest those additional gross profit dollars either let it drop to the bottom line or reinvest in the brands as an example so weâ re committed to that process weâ ve recently promoted an individual that was instrumental in helping us with the ingredients continuous improvement efforts put them into a company wide role to lead continuous improvement so it will continue to pay dividends for us inâ the long run operator and our next question comes from ben klieve from lake street capital markets ben klieve first one regarding the branded spirits segment some really solid year over year numbers but i m trying to get a better sense of the kind of sequential trends here from the first to the second quarter as you noted that the premium plus categories had a very good year over year performance but it looks like they declined a bit sequentially to partially offset growth in other categories i m just wondering if you can talk about kind of what you ve seen in this segment here year to date and both from a volume perspective and a margin perspective as it looks like the q1 gross margins in that segment were very very strong and saw a bit of a decline here in the second quarter david colo we spoke about this on the last call q1 in branded spirits we had a very very strong quarter on american whiskey shipments primarily related to our yellowstone brand which is growing very very nicely and what happened is the wholesalers underestimated the demand that we experienced in q4 of last year so their inventories were pretty much depleted so we replenished wholesaler inventories in q1 and that s what really drove that high gross margin you saw in the branded spirits segment for the quarter and that explains the increase and then the sequential decline in gross margin coming from q1 to q2 it s primarily related to that strong pipeline refill if you will on yellowstone we continue to see though good performance in our american whiskey and super premium tequila brands so everything is pretty much on track with what we expected through the first 2 quarters ben klieve and then a follow up question on moving over to the ingredient segment the proterra launch that you talked about in the university category wondering if you can just kind of provide a bit of context on this is this a wonton kind of a trial basis has it already been tried launch is going to be more widespread and what regions are going to be targeted for the initial launch any additional color there would be really helpful david colo the proterra product were if you will the kind of the channel we re focusing on initially is colleges and universities we ve sold it into a number of universities across the u s so it s not specific to any particular geographic region and it s been well received and we should start seeing shipments by late end of q3 into q4 and it s a pilot in the sense that we re targeting a specific channel to learn from the receptivity of the product line and if there s any additional tweaks we need to make to the product but what i can tell you is the reception to this product within the colleges and the universities at this point has been very strong so i think it s going to be a great learning experience for us and if it s successful as we believe it will be we think there s going to be additional opportunities to obviously be in food service beyond just colleges and universities ben klieve we ll stay tuned for updates there next quarter congratulations on a good quarter operator i d like to turn the floor back over to dave colo for any closing remarks david colo thank you for your interest in our company and for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call we look forward to talking with you again after the third quarter operator ladies and gentleman with that weâ ll conclude todayâ s conference call and presentation thank you for joining you may now disconnect your lines

mining giant rio tinto hit by legal battle over sacred apache site at oak flat in arizona oak flat is at the centre of a dispute between the apache tribe and rio tinto the project is now expected to be at the centre of a supreme court ruling locals also say the waste from the project will imperil the state s resources the serene oak flat upland lies in the heart of arizona with its beautiful peaks and forest it is a beloved spot for campers hikers and rock climbers above all it is the centre of the san carlos apache tribe s religion a place of devotion where their gods dwell and they still perform traditional ceremonies but it is now at the centre of a dispute between the tribe and ftse 100 giant rio tinto it is also shaping up to be an acid test of the mining group s claims that it is determined to respect sacred sites wendsler nosie sr of the apache stronghold a coalition of apaches and non apache supporters that is bringing the case describes it as the most sacred site where we connect with our creator our faith our families and our land he says it is a place of healing that has been sacred to us since long before europeans arrived on this continent members of the tribe which was famously guided by geronimo in the 19th century have referred to it as their equivalent to mount sinai and describe rock paintings and carvings as the footprints and spirit of their ancestors in 1955 president eisenhower signed an order declaring oak flat which is in the tonto national forest 60 miles from state capital phoenix off limits for mining but since 2004 there has been a bitter struggle by rio tinto and fellow mining group bhp through their resolution copper joint venture to access the metal lying under oak flat in opposition to locals the project is now set to be at the centre of a supreme court battle that threatens to tarnish rio s already damaged reputation the company was the target of global outrage after it blew up two 46 000 year old sacred aboriginal caves in western australia two years ago to expand a lucrative iron ore mine despite knowing their archaeological and religious value the destruction resulted in an australian parliamentary inquiry a re evaluation of heritage laws and a boardroom clearout which included then chief executive jean sebastien jacques paying tribute the apache tribe was guided by geronimo in the 19th century chairman simon thompson promised that the company would never again destroy sacred sites and new boss jakob stausholm has made a point of investigating toxic culture and practices but the plight of the apache tribe seems in direct contradiction to these aims resolution copper by its own admission says the type of mining it plans to use could result in an almost two mile wide crater in oak flat destroying the land roger featherstone director of campaign group the arizona mining reform coalition says one cannot forget rio tinto and bhp both promised the world they would never again allow the destruction of an indigenous sacred place after rio tinto blew up sacred rock shelters in australia for a mine expansion the resolution copper mining plan would do exactly that locals also insist the huge amount of waste created and water required for the project could imperil the state s resources featherstone adds with arizona in the middle of the worst drought we ve faced in 1 200 years there is not enough water for this project unless farmers communities our public lands and other industry give up water to allow it resolution copper s attempt to get hold of the land has involved a complicated legal process hinging on a land swap with the national forestry service that was waived through in january 2021 under the trump administration the apache tribe immediately filed an injunction to halt the project altogether on the grounds that it would harm their religious freedom in june a federal court rejected this injunction in a 2 1 ruling with the dissenting judge marsha berzon calling the conclusion absurd however the controversial land swap is on pause and still the subject of a federal investigation meanwhile the supreme court appeal expected to be lodged next month will again make the case that the apaches religious freedom will be crushed by the mining plans the case is between the apache stronghold and the us government but rio could be called in as a witness luke goodrich vice president and senior counsel at the apaches legal group becket law said in law principle and common sense this is one of the most straightforward cases i ve ever worked on legally for the apaches themselves this is a matter of life and death it is about whether their tribe as a people could continue to exist for centuries a rio spokesman said the company has already scaled back its plans and

section of our website i ll now turn the call over to eddie edward lehner thank you jorge and thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter 2022 results as the second quarter of 2022 gave us yet another strange brew of challenges to surmount i want to express my heartfelt thanks to our 4 000 plus strong ryerson team for their hard work and dedicated effort in delivering a safe and profitable quarter characterized by many important actions and accomplishments toward an always improving ryerson although we always prefer the up cycle to the counter cycle we found the signs and signals of a counter cycle by the middle of the second quarter that continued into july the market environment we experienced in the second quarter was characterized by declines in metals commodity prices and decelerating demand during this time we noted from customers continuing to experience supply side and labor constraints we noted another subset of customers tempering spot materials purchases amidst falling metals prices and another set of customers that saw order rates decline during the quarter due to broader inflationary pressures and shifting consumer spending priorities for a triple whammy of countercyclical activity these occurrences presented some resistance to our demand estimates for the quarter despite these challenges ryerson managed well through these volatile economic and industry inflections by delivering diluted earnings of 5 10 per share and adjusted diluted earnings of 5 31 per share both all time records for the company this second quarter represents an important milestone in our company s history and our capital structure s composition and strength during the second quarter and as noted in our subsequent event disclosure we retired the remainder of our high yield notes reduced net debt lowered cash interest cost completed our share buyback amended and extended our asset based credit facility increased liquidity increased the dividend announced a new and larger share repurchase authorization increased net book value and made important growth investments across our service center network in new plants equipment and systems to further our company s potential and enhance the customer experience now that s a list of accomplishments of which we can all be proud that are worth repeating over the past decade we have used these counter cycles to good effect as higher cash flow generation through such countercyclical periods has enabled ryerson to meaningfully improve its operating model only now we have much preferred uses for that free cash flow as seen through increased investments in modernization and growth as well as increased returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases ryerson s continued execution of its strategy to drive long term profitable growth amidst positive secular drivers supporting such growth opportunities can be seen through increases in planned infrastructure and decarbonization investments underpinned by supply chain onshoring and increased demand for recyclable and sustainable industrial metals with that i ll now turn the call over to mike to further discuss the pricing and demand environment michael burbach thank you eddie and good morning everyone now turning to the pricing and demand environment metals commodity markets experienced volatility in the second quarter of 2022 and at a global macro level we are seeing carbon stainless and aluminum trend lower this has been driven by international factors including decreasing demand from china s covid related shutdowns russia s invasion of ukraine continuing pandemic knock on effects as well as domestic deceleration of demand due to rising interest rates as well as a slowdown in industrial purchasing activity over the past three months we saw a faster than anticipated reversion in nickel prices the sharp decrease in prices impacted ryerson s stainless steel volumes where our customers pivoted from building inventory in the first quarter to just in time buying later in the second quarter the increase of nickel prices on the london metal exchange or lme in march along with increases in stainless scrap chrome and other alloys led to a 10 sequential increase in average sell prices or asp of our stainless steel product mix in the second quarter of 2022 the increase in stainless steel asp was offset by an 11 sequential decline in sales volumes due to the previously mentioned factors as well as an increase in stainless steel imports in the quarter which were additive to competitively priced inventory carbon steels represent half of ryerson s sales mix and experienced a revenue decline of 3 sequentially as an approximately 1 higher quarter over quarter sales volume growth was offset by a 4 lower asp our aluminum franchise delivered another solid result with 2 higher volumes sold sequentially and asp gaining 10 quarter over quarter in the second quarter of 2022 ryerson reported net sales of 1 74 billion which came in slightly lower than guidance benefiting from sequentially higher asp per ton but impacted by weaker than forecasted stainless steel volumes ryerson s higher asp per ton sequentially gaining 0 5 to 3 327 in the second quarter was driven by favorable pricing in aluminum and stainless steel and partially offset by a decline in the price of hot rolled coil quarter over quarter the benefit in pricing was offset by lower volumes declining 0 8 quarter over quarter driven by weaker than expected stainless steel volumes with respect to ryerson s end markets at a macro level key industry indicators are showing a slowdown in growth in the second quarter of 2022 while u s industrial production has reported a 4 2 year over year increase in june the year over year increases have been slowing over the past 3 months at the same time global metals commodity prices have trended lower in the second quarter on increased material availability shorter lead times and slowing demand additionally the u s purchasing managers index or pmi while still above the growth threshold of 50 reported continued slowing growth in factory activity in july north american industry shipments as measured by the metals service center institute or msci grew at a moderate 0 3 quarter over quarter compared to a 0 7 decline for ryerson s north american volumes however in the first half of 2022 ryerson s north american business performed better than the msci defined north american service center industry with ryerson s volumes declining 2 7 compared to an industry decline of 4 4 ryerson s sequential volume shipment performance was led by an approximate 7 increase in oil and gas a 4 increase in commercial ground transportation and a 2 increase in metal fabrication and machine shops most other end markets experienced declines in volumes the outlook for north american manufacturing for the second half of 2022 remains cautiously optimistic however we expect headwinds of rising interest rates continuation of supply chain issues as well as a slowing in demand our discussions with customers led us to believe that supply chain issues such as component shortages and tight labor continue and while some backlogs remain healthy there is evidence of customer destocking moderating quoting activity and smaller size spot transactional purchases from a pricing side three months ago we had expected stainless and aluminum pricing to remain favorable into the second half of 2022 reflecting an improved secular demand outlook however the federal reserve s inflation fighting actions plus weaker than expected china economic data have contributed to a sharp reversal in many commodity markets through the end of july although we note a recent stabilization in lme aluminum and nickel prices amidst historically low exchange inventories with that i ll turn the call over to jim for our third quarter outlook james claussen thanks mike good morning everyone eddie s comments summarized how the second quarter was an important milestone in our capital structure transformation the reconstitution of our balance sheet paves the way for us to reinvest in the business as well as providing capital returns to shareholders looking forward we acknowledge that the outlook for both volume and pricing has moderated into the second half as such we expect third quarter revenues to be in range of 1 45 billion to 1 55 billion with asp down 5 to 8 and sales volumes expected to be down 4 to 6 sequentially as customers assess the impact of the federal reserve tightening cycle and the typical summer seasonality kicks in while global metals related commodity prices have corrected they remain above 10 year averages and based on the most recent forward curves we now forecast lifo income at 35 million in the third quarter of 2022 adjusted ebitda for the third quarter of 2022 excluding lifo is expected to be in the range of 110 million to 120 million and earnings are expected to be in the range of 2 40 to 2 60 per diluted share now turning to the company s cash flow and balance sheet the company s cash conversion cycle increased slightly to 78 days in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 77 days in the first quarter accounts payables and receivables were favorable by a cumulative 61 million but offset by 174 million inventory build or a net working capital use of 113 million in the second quarter we expect this to be the high mark as lower commodity prices imply a working capital release going forward overall ryerson generated 85 5 million of operating cash in the second quarter and ended the period with 534 million of total debt and 492 million of net debt a decrease in net debt of 14 5 million compared to the first quarter ryerson s leverage ratio remained flat quarter over quarter at 0 5x a record low since our ipo in 2014 the company s available global liquidity increased to 894 million as of june 30 2022 from 760 million as of march 31 2022 due to the successful increase of our revolving credit facility from 1 billion to 1 3 billion during the quarter while the sequential net debt reduction was 14 5 million compared to the 67 7 million of free cash flow it is important to note that 52 4 million was returned to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends during the second quarter of 2022 additionally during the second quarter the company incurred 14 5 million in losses on retirement of debt related to the early high yield bond redemption which are nonrecurrent capital expenditures were 24 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 18 8 million in the first quarter we reaffirm our anticipated capital expenditures excluding acquisitions of up to approximately 100 million for 2022 this amount comprises both maintenance and growth projects related to digitalization initiatives and our service center modernizations in centralia washington and university park illinois during the second quarter and concurrent with our controlling shareholder secondary offering ryerson repurchased 1 6 million shares of our common stock these repurchases exhausted our previous 50 million repurchase authorization 14 months ahead of expiration the board has approved a new 2 year 75 million share repurchase authorization which we expect to deploy opportunistically during the second quarter and through july through a combination of open market purchases a tender offer and the exercise of a special redemption rate in july we retired the entirety of our 237 million gaining outstanding 8 5 senior secured notes the retirement of our high yield debt is expected to save ryerson over 20 million in annualized pretax interest finally on august 3 ryerson s board of directors declared a third quarter cash dividend of 0 15 per share of common stock a sequential increase of 20 from the second quarter dividend of 0 125 per share with this i ll turn the call over to molly to provide further detail on our second quarter financial results molly kannan thank you jim and good morning everyone ryerson generated revenue of 1 74 billion in the second quarter of 2022 and gross margin expanded by 320 basis points to 26 7 up from 23 5 in the first quarter of 2022 as cost of goods sold reflected lower cost of carbon steel material included in gross margin is lifo income of 73 8 million a reversal from the 2 2 million lifo expense booked in the first quarter of 2022 excluding the lifo impact second quarter gross margin contracted by 110 basis points from the first quarter of 2022 to 22 5 in the first quarter of 2022 we discussed our election to recognize the interim effects of the lifo inventory valuation method by projecting expected year end inventory levels and lifo cost and pro rata allocating that projection to interim quarters we believe this change is preferable as it results in a better estimate of lifo for the full year and typically creates less volatility in earnings on an interim basis however the second quarter is sharper and sooner than expected commodity price corrections resulted in a higher than forecast lifo income of 73 8 million versus our prior guidance of 0 net income attributable to ryerson for the second quarter of 2022 was 196 4 million or 5 10 per diluted share compared to 163 6 million or 4 17 per diluted share in the previous quarter the second quarter includes a charge on the retirement of debt of 14 5 million and a 3 8 million gain on the sale of assets excluding these onetime items and the associated income taxes adjusted net income attributable to ryerson was 204 4 million or 5 31 per diluted share compared to 167 5 million or 4 27 per diluted share for the first quarter in closing ryerson achieved adjusted ebitda excluding lifo of 224 2 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to first quarter of 2022 adjusted ebitda excluding lifo of 250 6 million and with this i ll turn the call back to eddie edward lehner thank you molly at ryerson our mission is to create great experiences for our customers employees shareholders suppliers and communities our ongoing development of and investment in an intelligent network of value added industrial metals service centers delivering industrial metal solutions with joy speed scale and consistency is the backbone of these efforts the world of today and tomorrow that provides for a better quality of life and broader based prosperity will be largely created and built with recyclable and sustainable industrial metals that is why metal matters as you ll experience when visiting us at ryerson com and why the build now movement at msci org are so vital and imperative let s keep advancing together and with that let s take your questions operator question and answer session operator and our first question today comes from alan weber with robotti alan weber first question is when you talk when you look at through when you think about the second half of the year how much cash do you expect will be generated out of the work added changes in working capital edward lehner yes we expect there to be certainly working capital release in the second half of the year i wouldn t give you a number i would only tell you that past is prologue if you go back and you look at what the working capital release has typically been and then you apply a ratio to how our overall working capital balances have changed in this cycle versus prior ones you can get a pretty good idea of what the cash release is going to be but we expect to have working capital release through the balance of the year alan weber okay and then eddie a general question a few years ago in these kind of presentations you talked about you gave like a i want to say a longer term target you talked about 350 million to 400 million of ebitda you gave an ebitda margin projection can you talk about given the improvement in the balance sheet today where things stand how you think about the company say 5 years out i m not asking for a projection just the thought process in terms of again because even the target back from only a few years ago you were targeting 2x leverage and obviously that s not the case today so just curious how you think about the business the competition and like that because everybody i assume has improved balance sheets also edward lehner sure sure so look first of all i like the sound of that but going back to and i remember we had an investor meeting several years back in new york and we put down next stage targets of gross margins which we pegged at 20 of that time market share gains of getting up to 6 of the market we did give somewhat of a bracketed next cycle ebitda i think of 350 million if memory serves that was in our presentation materials and i would say that we surpassed those metrics those kpis over the last say 5 to 6 quarters but when we look at mid cycle when we look at through the cycle going forward i would say that we ve positioned ourselves very well in terms of being able to assess what i would say next stage targets are going to be from here we ve got an investor day coming up in november which i really hope i see you at and at that time at that investor day i think we ll be in a much better position to share what those next stage targets are going to be but so far mission accomplished alan weber okay and could you just talk about as you think about besides the recycling of metals how you think about the industry the improvement and how you expect to think about market share over the next few years excluding any acquisitions edward lehner yes i think that first of all i m very on a secular medium term to longer term basis i mean we always have these cycles and counter cycles and the world is certainly a very interesting place at present but i will tell you the long term future of industrial metals we re very optimistic and bullish about that future when you look at now i ve said this before alan people can make all kinds of decisions in the short term they can defer spending they can go without do without but i think what s been demonstrated if you look at well how do you how do you solve for the productivity riddle a big part of that s got to be fixed asset investment to automate modernize and engender higher productivity rates so you ve got the productivity side of it that is going to include industrial metals certainly because of their sustainability and recyclability attributes if you talk about transition metals and how do you build structures and how do you build electrification infrastructure how do you improve public health you come back to industrial metals to make those investments and to get those kind of outcomes so very bullish where that s concerned in terms of the m a environment and consolidation there ll be more consolidation in our industry i mean we hear from more owners through our m a work and through our business development pipeline we hear from more owners that they d like to do more business development if not retire and that they really don t want to handle the i d say the back office functions that can really be done at scale as part of a bigger enterprise so as we move through this counter cycle very optimistic and very bullish about our industry and the products that we distribute and that we add value to operator and we ll hear next from phil gibbs with keybanc capital markets philip gibbs a question on just general inflation within the business obviously metals prices are what they are but just trying to think about the conversion cost side of things and whether things like people packaging energy transportation whether you re starting to see that level out i don t think you were last quarter but curious what you re seeing just in terms of those pressures edward lehner sure so where i would say i d say between the second half of 2020 through i d say the first half of 2021 as you know phil the prices of metals really i would say went higher and went ahead of i d say broad based inflationary pressures and general economic inflationary pressures i would say now we re seeing the tail end of those pressures come into our p l in various line items of our general ledger i m going to let other members of the team give you a little more illumination around that but certainly we re seeing what i would say is i feel like it s that last third of kind of that inflationary whiplash where you re going to see folks continue to price higher because they have some pricing power and maybe they got off to a slower start trying to push those price increases to the market on the opex side certainly we know that there s been pressures on the labor side but it feels like we re 2 3 of the way through it and i think we re in that last 1 3 of where you start to see cost increases but they start to level off they peak and then we ll see some of those costs peel off and i do think there s a higher embedded level of cost i mean throughout whether it s in materials whether it s going to be in the opex ledger there s a higher embedded level of cost but certainly the rate of change and the rate of increase on those expenses will start to come down i feel like kind of we re in the last third of this inflationary period but let me i m going to have john orth our evp of operations talk to you about what he s seen on the opex side of the business john orth there has definitely been inflation on the opex side of the business and it s moved into our operating expenses however we ve managed to maintain expense leverage on a percentage basis and the areas where we see the highest impact of inflation are in delivery primarily driven by fuel costs and surcharges along to a smaller extent contract resets and as you mentioned packaging supplies those have inflated quite a bit from q1 however we are seeing that rate of increase begin to slow down substantially at the end of the day the key for us is using the tools in our toolbox the ryerson production system to identify the best practices and share those across the network to make sure that we are reusing and reducing and being as safe and productive as possible philip gibbs and then eddie just on the pricing viewpoint for the third quarter what are the biggest what s influencing that the most is it the nonferrous side and the ferrous side is a little bit more stable or is it a little bit of everything because i know you have some contracts in there too edward lehner yes absolutely and i m going to ask mike to give you some more color on that in just a minute but as an overview we saw significant net downs in nonferrous probably from let s say early may through mid july but now we ve seen some stabilization around nickel prices i mean the direction is down but we ve seen some stabilization in aluminum in stainless after some pretty significant drops and you and i have been talking for a decade now if not more so we know what that invites we know that starts to feel and look like a counter cycle we don t know what the duration is or what the intensity is going to be but we ve used counter cycles to really good effect in the past so i think in stainless and aluminum it looks like it s trying to consolidate around a base now with maybe some fluctuation in other elements like chrome certainly in nickel but it looks like it s starting to congeal around maybe a range and then carbon carbon right now the futures indexes are showing for the remainder of the year not far off now could it drop a little bit more with some capacity introductions as we move through the balance of the year yes it could but i also think that there s just that higher embedded level of cost in those material cost curves i mean if you look at aluminum just going back on that a second you ve got a lot of aluminum smelters that are claiming that they re really into their cash curves at this point not their gaap accounting curves but in their cash curves but going back to carbon we ll see some capacity coming to the marketplace but i also don t think we re going to see a return to the 10 year averages that were in place before the pandemic but i ll have mike comment on prices and even mike can have a little bit more say about what the supply chain is doing michael burbach phil this is mike burbach so i think eddie hit it pretty good with his comments and thoughts about where we are today i don t have a lot to add to that other than trying to predict what s going to happen on commodities has proven to be a foolish exercise at times 90 days ago when we were talking the outlook was considerably different than it is today we ve seen a significant roller coaster on virtually everything we sell from late march into the early q2 that gave us a headache thinking things might be heading one way and then quickly reverted back to where we are today and so what we see in here is exactly what eddie just described the futures curves what we re hearing from our suppliers and what we think is the activity levels are going to be i think we re settling into something that s a little more stable but it was a rather interesting path to get here from early q2 until now and mike i don t know if you have any extra comments edward lehner yes we ve got mike hamilton with us he s our vp of supply chain and he s really in touch with all of our suppliers on a really regular basis so mike maybe you got some comments michael hamilton sure thanks eddie i think the only addition i would make is that the additional capacity in carbon is a layer this year phenomenon we ve started to see some of that and we ll see how that plays out with the price on nonferrous capacity additions are a 2023 and beyond scenario here in north america so it s far too early to predict what that influence is going to be when we look at where prices are edward lehner and so i would say it feels like two or three quarters to really see average cost kind of meet up with replacement costs again and we ll get a good margin reset and that will be a really good time to take a look at where we go from there but i do think where we re going to bottom out is going to be above where the 10 year averages were before the pandemic philip gibbs yes all that makes sense eddie in terms of the pricing commentary as just the company as ryerson enterprise how are you thinking about this countercyclical period differently than you were the last couple of times and certainly you can breathe a heck of a lot easier this time materially easier so but just as a company this time around what are the big differences in mentality edward lehner yes i mean i ll say i m not heartbroken about not having to go into the high yield markets again so certainly i m not despondent about that i mean we re obviously in a much better position now when we look at we certainly have to include our results in the last couple of years into our ebitda generation over the last 10 years but looking at the investments that we ve made in the company in systems and equipment even in new facilities like in centralia and university park we ve got some more plans on the board where that s concerned when we look at our ability now to take that free cash flow repurpose that to shareholder returns but also to repurpose it to growth and i mean smart allocation of capital sometimes you can get ahead of yourself when you do that because you ve got to match up that capital allocation to growth to your organization s ability to deploy that capital at the desired rate of return but we ve got a good m a pipeline we ve got a really good business development function our pmo office is really working through some projects that we really think are going to improve the customer experience and give us better expense leverage as we start to prepare for the next up cycle so obviously it s a much different mindset if you don t have to go back into the high yield markets you don t have to roll over debt you re not paying for the past you re not paying creditors the lion s share of your free cash flow so it s certainly a different counter cycle for us and i thought that we managed through the prior counter cycles extraordinarily well but certainly now we have a much better opportunity to invest in the future of ryerson which i think is going to pay a lot of dividends figuratively and literally edward lehner looks like the queue has cleared out so we thank you for your continued support bob and interest in ryerson stay safe and well and we look forward to being with you all again in november when we review our third quarter results take care operator and this does conclude today s conference thank you all for your participation you may now disconnect

this video the estimated 740 billion package heads next to the house where lawmakers are poised to deliver on biden s priorities a stunning turnaround of what had seemed a lost and doomed effort that suddenly roared back to political life cheers broke out as senate democrats held united 51 50 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote after an all night session today senate democrats sided with american families over special interests president joe biden said in a statement from rehoboth beach delaware i ran for president promising to make government work for working families again and that is what this bill does period biden who had his share of long nights during his three decades as a senator called into the senate cloakroom during the vote on speakerphone to personally thank the staff for their hard work the president urged the house to pass the bill as soon as possible speaker nancy pelosi said her chamber would move swiftly to send this bill to the president s desk house votes are expected friday it s been a long tough and winding road but at last at last we have arrived said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y ahead of final votes the senate is making history i am confident the inflation reduction act will endure as one of the defining legislative feats of the 21st century he said senators engaged in a round the clock marathon of voting that began saturday and stretched late into sunday afternoon democrats swatted down some three dozen republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation confronting unanimous gop opposition democratic unity in the 50 50 chamber held keeping the party on track for a morale boosting victory three months from elections when congressional control is at stake the bill ran into trouble midday over objections to the new 15 corporate minimum tax that private equity firms and other industries disliked forcing last minute changes despite the momentary setback the inflation reduction act gives democrats a campaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest ever federal effort on climate change close to 400 billion caps out of pocket drug costs for seniors on medicare to 2 000 a year and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance by raising corporate taxes and reaping savings from the long sought goal of allowing the government to negotiate drug prices for medicare the whole package is paid for with some 300 billion extra revenue for deficit reduction barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion build back better initiative the new package abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded child care aid that plan collapsed after conservative sen joe manchin d w va opposed it saying it was too costly and would fuel inflation nonpartisan analysts have said the 755 page inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices republicans said the new measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation s worst inflation since the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky argued in an ordeal imposed on most budget bills like this one the senate had to endure an overnight vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together the compromise bill negotiated by schumer progressives manchin and the inscrutable centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz progressive sen bernie sanders i vt criticized the bill s shortcomings and offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits but those efforts were defeated republicans forced their own votes designed to make democrats look soft on u s mexico border security and gasoline and energy costs and like bullies for wanting to strengthen irs tax law enforcement before debate began the bill s prescription drug price curbs were diluted by the senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian who said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under special procedures that will let democrats pass their bill by simple majority without the usual 60 vote margin its provisions must be focused more on dollar and cents budget numbers than policy changes but the thrust of democrats pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients penalizing manufacturers for exceeding inflation for pharmaceuticals sold to medicare and limiting beneficiaries out of pocket drug costs to 2 000 annually the bill also caps medicare patients costs for insulin the expensive diabetes medication at 35 monthly democrats wanted to extend the 35 cap to private insurers but it ran afoul of senate rules most republicans voted to strip it from the package though in

faced with limited treatment options and the prognosis is poor3 4 immunotherapy plays an increasingly important role in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and there is huge unmet need with the launch of new immunosuppressants they ve been applied to more patients and become essential for the treatment of cervical cancer akt inhibitor a serine threonine specific protein kinase is considered a potential new target for cancer treatment as results of multiple preclinical studies showed that inhibition of akt could restore the sensitivity of cancer cells to anti tumor therapies we look forward to the progress of the clinical trial and hope it will bring new breakthroughs to the later line treatment of cervical cancer in china professor lin shen principal investigator of the study director of the department of gastrointestinal oncology of from beijing cancer hospital stated innovation never stops in oncology as we are always looking for new ways to treat cancer patients based on results from the preclinical and clinical studies the combination of an immune checkpoint inhibitor an akt inhibitor and taxanes shows potential to be a new treatment option for patients who were resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors5 6 7 8 the trial conducted by laekna and innovent aims to explore this innovative combination therapy and validate this new promising solution there is a significant clinical need for patients with digestive system and gynecologic solid tumors in china we hope to see that akt targeting therapy will prove to be an effective strategy to overcome drug resistance dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent stated with the increasing prescription of immune checkpoint inhibitors ici in first line settings in various tumor types many patients developed ici resistance or have poor response rates in clinical practice it is of great clinical value to explore potential treatments for this huge unmet medical need sintilimab is the first pd 1 inhibitor in china with first line indications for 5 major types of cancers innovent hopes to continue to develop the potential of high quality drugs in this case by combination therapy with laekna s innovative akt inhibitor we look forward to the results of clinical trial to bring clinical benefits to patients with specific solid tumors dr yong yue chief medical officer of laekna said it took

washington the senate voted saturday to advance a sweeping climate and economic bill with the support of all 50 democrats bringing long stalled elements of president joe biden s agenda one step closer to reality the procedural vote on the filibuster proof package was 51 50 with all republicans opposing the motion to begin debate and vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote if that support holds it is enough to pass the bill through the senate and send it to the house in the coming days the legislation called the inflation reduction act includes major spending to combat climate change and extend health care coverage paid for with savings on prescription drugs and taxes on corporations it puts hundreds of billions of dollars toward deficit reduction this is one of the most comprehensive and impactful bills congress has seen in decades senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y said on the floor before the vote it s going to mean a lot for the families and the people of our country harris told nbc news as she arrived to break the 50 50 tie the procedural vote during a rare weekend session kicks off several hours of debate followed by a vote a rama a process in which senators can offer virtually unlimited amendments that require a simple majority of votes to adopt the legislation isn t subject to the filibuster it is being pursued through a special process called reconciliation which allows democrats to pass it on their own but the process includes limits policies included in the bill must be related to spending and taxes and the legislation has to comply with a strict set of budget rules it s the same process democrats used to pass the american rescue plan in 2021 and republicans used to pass the trump tax cuts of 2017 before saturday s vote the senate parliamentarian ruled that key democratic provisions on clean energy and allowing medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices passed muster and could be included in the inflation package democratic leaders said while there was one unfortunate ruling in that the inflation rebate is more limited in scope schumer said the overall program remains intact and we are one step closer to finally taking on big pharma and lowering rx drug prices for millions of americans the democrats only package which includes several pieces of biden s build back better agenda was long thought to be dead after sen joe manchin d w va rejected a larger bill in december he cut a deal last week with schumer pleasantly surprising many of his democratic colleagues and has since been on a media blitz to sell it it s a red white and blue bill manchin said recently on msnbc calling it one of the greatest pieces of legislation and the bill that we need to fight inflation to have more energy on thursday sen kyrsten sinema d ariz following a week of silence signed off on the bill after securing some changes to it sinema forced democrats to remove a provision that would have limited the carried interest tax break which enables wealthy hedge fund and investment managers to pay a lower tax rate we had no choice schumer told reporters instead it was replaced by a new 1 excise tax on stock buybacks that is expected to bring in 74 billion five times as much as the carried interest provision schumer said sinema also secured 4 billion in funding for drought prevention in arizona and other western states before her changes the nonpartisan congressional budget office found that the bill would reduce the deficit by about 100 billion over a decade with additional potential for 200 billion in revenue as a result of beefing up irs resources for enforcement senate minority whip john thune r s d promised hard votes for the democrats in the vote a rama the question is at the end are those amendments going to be amendments actually that might change the bill could make it better might make it harder to pass in the house who knows thune said friday some democrats are worried about republicans proposing poison pill amendments on contentious issues such as immigration and crime that could win a majority of votes in the senate picking off some moderates and vulnerable senators facing re election this fall but alienate other democrats and disrupt the fragile deal i certainly cannot support it if extraneous provisions get adopted particularly pejorative immigration provisions that have nothing to do with the health welfare and security of the american people sen bob menendez d n j said this week on msnbc on saturday a handful of senate democrats took to twitter to urge their colleagues to hold the line and vote down amendments that could jeopardize the package i ll vote no on all amendments even those i agree with tweeted sen tina smith d minn this bill makes historic progress on climate action and lowering prescription drug costs it has 50 votes and we need to stick together to keep it that way sen cory booker d n j agreed with that strategy there are a number of us who have already tweeted that we re going to be voting no on amendments that we like and we don t like he told reporters saturday there is such a moral urgency to get a bill across the line that s going to deal with the existential threat of climate change i think that s motivating and i m seeing even more unity than normal sen lindsey graham r s c said friday the amendment process would be unpleasant what will vote a rama be like it ll be like hell he said

republicans kentucky democratic party chair colmon elridge elridge took aim at 2023 s crowded republican primary field for governor which already includes contenders like attorney general daniel cameron and could add potential competitors like kelly craft the former u s ambassador to the united nations now i want to be clear because we ve got the attorney general here and he s not used to practicing law so when i say beat i don t mean in the physical sense elrdige said saturday i mean beat like when gov andy beshear beat matt bevin i mean beat like when andy beshear beats whatever republican makes it off the gilligan s island of the gop primary unless kelly craft gets off her yacht to buy the island first u s senate candidate charles booker beshear took most of the knocks for

apologize to you because he can t be here to tell you how much he wants to screw kentucky in fact he s in washington right now trying to screw you as we speak booker said but folks that s not the only

using air quotes as she referenced hood to the holler the nonprofit advocacy group booker founded in 2020 after he narrowly lost that summer s democratic primary for sen mitch mcconnell s seat you know what i have a good idea for him maybe he should rename it from the hood to the dollar paul told the fancy farm crowd a financial disclosure booker filed last year as a senate candidate said he did earn a 150 000 salary from hood to the holler inc that disclosure also said he was responsible for the overall strategy and management of the organization as its founder and president kentucky

format to a press conference ball said in a swipe at beshear s stream of press conferences which included appearances multiple times a week and for a while daily during the first 16 months of the covid 19 pandemic ball threw out another zinger during her speech but aimed this one at president joe biden saying i actually have a joe biden inflation joke but it s just not worth anything anymore secretary of state michael adams adams who s running for reelection next year welcomed democrats back to fancy farm this summer and gave elridge the kentucky democratic party s chairman a quippy shoutout saying mr chairman thank you for being with us today and may i say the titanic could not have a better captain attorney general daniel cameron cameron who s running for governor in 2023

updated august 6 2022 at 7 40 pm et after weeks of negotiations to revive the core of their election year agenda senate democrats appear to be on the brink of passing a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion opening the senate floor for a rare saturday session majority leader chuck schumer d n y said no matter how long it takes the senate is going to stay in session to finish this bill the senate voted along party lines to begin formal debate on the floor saturday evening after debate concludes senators can introduce an unlimited number of amendments in what s known as a vote a rama also allowed during vote a rama is a call to have the entire text of the bill which is roughly 700 pages read aloud the process is expected to stretch into sunday before a vote on final passage three weeks ago the bill was all but dead when sen joe manchin d w va withheld his support citing concerns about adding to historically high inflation but just last week he and senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y announced an agreement much to the surprise of others in the senate manchin s concerns about inflation were placated by among others former treasury secretary larry summers a democrat who has previously been a critic of how his party has handled inflation summers and other economists have argued the bill will tamp down inflation but the congressional budget office estimates that it will have negligible impact on prices in the near term the legislation is a significant step forward for president biden s domestic agenda this bill is a gamechanger for working families and our economy biden said at an event at the white house friday i look forward to the senate taking up this legislation and passing it as soon as possible republicans are united against the bill arguing that the spending in it will make inflation worse and that the health provisions will hamper pharmaceutical innovation democrats have decided their first economic disaster justifies a second economic disaster the working people of this country feel very differently senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said on saturday but there is little his conference can do to stop the legislation the bill is getting passed through budget reconciliation which allows democrats to pass the bill with a simple majority in the evenly divided chamber and avoid the threat of a republican filibuster that applies to most legislation it also means each section of the bill needs to be reviewed by the senate parliamentarian to make sure it is actually legislation that will primarily impact the budget this review process is often referred to as the byrd bath named after the late west virginia sen robert byrd democrats said on saturday that the parliamentarian approved key elements of the bill on prescription drug pricing and clean energy one element that would compel drug companies to offer rebates if prescription prices outpaced inflation was limited in the process so that it would apply to patients on medicare but not private insurance still schumer said the bill remains mostly intact and can win the support of all 50 democrats democrats appear to have all 50 votes in their conference after sinema agreement late thursday night arizona sen kyrsten sinema said she would move forward with the legislation she was the last holdout on the bill and her support essentially means the senate has all 50 democratic votes needed to pass the bill to get on board sinema wanted the section of the bill that narrowed the carried interest tax loopholeto be removed the measure impacts how private equity is taxed and democrats say it would have brought in 14 billion what sinema wanted to add though brings in more revenue it s a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks schumer said friday he and progressive democrats were excited about that aspect of the bill which he says brings in roughly 74 billion what we added excites me and i think it excites all democrats and particularly progressives schumer said at a press conference friday i hate stock buybacks i think they re one of the most self serving things that corporate america does also added in is about 4 billion in drought resiliency put forward by senators catherine cortez masto d nev mark kelly d ariz and michael bennet d colo sinema had also called for this addition in the bill there is still criticism of the bill coming from sen bernie sanders i vt who has argued the legislation doesn t do enough for working class americans by not increasing the minimum wage making child care more affordable or tackling the student debt crisis he took to the senate floor wednesday and called it the so called inflation reduction act as currently written this is an extremely modest piece of legislation that does virtually nothing to address the enormous crises that working families all across this country are facing today he said he added that he plans to bring up his concerns during the amendment process on the floor over the weekend but a scenario in which sanders concerns prevent him from voting for the bill altogether is highly unlikely what could be another hurdle for the bill is opposition from progressives in the house which is set to return to consider the legislation late next week it caps off a busy and successful stretch for biden s domestic agenda in the past few weeks the senate has voted on a bill to expand health services for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits a semiconductor bill and a measure to allow finland and sweden into nato and all of those votes have been bipartisan schumer though has made it clear that senate democrats will also go it alone if they have to which is what they re

alan fram associated press washington democrats started pushing their election year economic bill through the senate on saturday starting the sprawling collection of president joe biden s priorities on climate energy health and taxes on a pathway through congress that the party hopes will end in victory by the end of this week in a preview of the sharply partisan votes that are expected on a mountain of amendments the evenly divided senate voted to begin debate on the legislation 51 50 with vice president kamala harris breaking the tie and overcoming unanimous republican opposition the package a dwindled version of earlier multitrillion dollar measures that democrats failed to advance has become a partisan battleground over inflation gasoline prices and other issues that polls show are driving voters the house where democrats have a slender majority could give the legislation final approval next friday when that chamber plans to briefly return to washington from summer recess the time is now to move forward with a big bold package for the american people said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y this historic bill will reduce inflation lower costs fight climate change it s time to move this nation forward republicans said the measure would damage the economy and make it harder for people to cope with sky high inflation they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices upward and urged voters to remember that in november the best way to stop this tax and spend inflationary madness is to fire some of the 50 so they can t keep doing this to your family said south carolina sen lindsey graham top republican on the senate budget committee nonpartisan analysts have said the legislation which democrats have named the inflation reduction act would have a minor impact on the nation s worst inflation bout in four decades even so it would take aim at issues the party has longed to address for years including global warming pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations earlier saturday the senate parliamentarian gave a thumbs up to most of democrats revised 755 page bill but elizabeth macdonough the chamber s nonpartisan rules arbiter said democrats had to drop a significant part of their plan for curbing drug prices macdonough said democrats violated senate budget rules with language imposing hefty penalties on pharmaceutical companies that boost prices beyond inflation for drugs sold in the private insurance market those were the bill s chief drug pricing protections for the roughly 180 million people whose health coverage comes from private insurance either through work or bought on their own other pharmaceutical provisions were left intact including giving medicare the power to negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients a longtime democratic aspiration penalties on manufacturers for exceeding inflation would apply to drugs sold to medicare and there is a 2 000 annual out of pocket cap on drug costs and free vaccines for medicare beneficiaries before approving the legislation democrats will have to fight off a vote a rama of nonstop amendments most will be designed by republicans to upend the bill or at least force vulnerable democrats facing reelection and party moderates into tough votes on issues like inflation taxes and immigration saturday s vote capped a startling 10 day period that saw democrats resurrect top components of biden s agenda that had seemed dead in rapid fire deals with democrats two most unpredictable senators first conservative joe manchin of west virginia then arizona centrist kyrsten sinema schumer pieced together a package that would give the party an achievement against the backdrop of this fall s congressional elections the measure is a shadow of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion proposal which funded a rainbow of progressive dreams including paid family leave universal preschool child care and bigger tax breaks for families with children the current bill barely over one tenth that size became much narrower as democratic leaders sought to win the votes of the centrists manchin and sinema yet it has unified a party eager to declare victory and show voters they are addressing their problems the bill offers spending and tax incentives favored by progressives for buying electric vehicles and making buildings more energy efficient but in a bow to manchin whose state is a leading fossil fuel producer there is also money to reduce coal plant carbon emissions and language requiring the government to open more federal land and waters to oil drilling expiring subsidies that help millions of people afford private insurance premiums would be extended for three years and there is 4 billion to help western states combat drought a new provision would create a 35 monthly cap for insulin the expensive diabetes medication for medicare and private insurance patients starting next year it seemed possible that language could be weakened or removed during debate reflecting democrats calls for tax equity there would be a new 15 minimum tax on some corporations with annual profits exceeding 1 billion but that pay well below the 21 corporate tax companies buying back their own stock would be taxed 1 for those transactions swapped in after sinema refused to support higher taxes on hedge fund managers the irs budget would be pumped up to strengthen its tax collections while the bill s final costs were still being determined it would spend close to 400 billion over 10 years to slow climate change which analysts say would be the country s largest investment in that effort and billions more on health care it would raise more than 700 billion in taxes and from government drug cost savings leaving about 300 billion for deficit reduction over the coming decade a blip compared to that period s projected 16 trillion in budget shortfalls democrats are using special procedures that would let them pass the measure without having to reach the 60 vote majority that legislation often needs in the senate the parliamentarian decides whether parts of legislation must be dropped for violating those rules which include a requirement that provisions be chiefly aimed at affecting the federal budget not imposing new policy associated press writer matthew daly contributed to this

bloomberg the senate voted to open debate on a landmark tax climate change and drug price bill during a rare saturday session that is expected to continue late into the night most read from bloomberg the 437 billion 755 page bill a slimmed down version of president joe biden s multitrillion dollar domestic agenda is on track for passage after a year of wrangling with two holdout democrats senators joe manchin and kyrsten sinema over the contents of the package this is one of the most consequential and impactful bills congress has seen in decades senate majority leader chuck schumer said as the debate and a marathon slog through scores of proposed amendments got underway the vote was 51 50 with vice president kamala harris breaking the tie vermont democratic senator patrick leahy arrived via wheelchair to cast the vote after being absent for weeks due to hip surgery senate democrats release final tax climate bill text document the legislation would allow medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time starting with 10 high priced drugs by the middle of this decade and expanding from there it would cap out of pocket drug costs for seniors enrolled in part d at 2 000 per year and their spending on insulin at 35 per month savings from these lower drug prices is used to pay for three years of subsidized obamacare premiums without an extension discounted premiums made available during the covid 19 pandemic are set to expire in january the bill would also provide roughly 374 billion in climate and energy spending including on expanded tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and to fund renewable energy projects funding for this comes from the establishment of a 15 corporate minimum tax on large firms a 1 excise tax on the value of stock buybacks and revenue gained from an 80 billion boost to the internal revenue service budget for tax enforcement manchin of west virginia agreed to the outline of the deal last month in a surprise deal he negotiated in secret with senate majority leader chuck schumer and after he secured funding for coal related projects requirements that public lands be opened to fossil fuel projects when opened for renewable projects and a promise to pass a separate bill easing environmental reviews of energy projects story continues arizona senator sinema endorsed it this week after a proposal to narrow a the carried interest loophole was dropped and an exception to the minimum corporate tax was made for accelerated depreciation tax deductions used by many manufacturers she also helped win a 4 billion boost to the bureau of reclamation to address a severe drought in the colorado river basin democrats are using a fast track budget process to bypass republicans who are united in opposition to the bill and who say its tax increases and spending could worsen inflation and a looming recession hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes during a recession will kill jobs senate gop leader mitch mcconnell said saturday on the senate floor the american people don t want hundreds of billions of dollars in green new deal waste democrats responded with their own studies which show small inflation decreases over time due to the bill the fast track process was activated when democrats last august adopted a fiscal 2022 budget resolution with the goal of quickly enacting a 3 5 trillion measure with major changes to the social safety net and increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy months of negotiations with manchin collapsed in december when he walked away from a 2 trillion version of biden s agenda which would have provided paid family leave expanded child tax credits expanded medicaid coverage childcare subsidies and medicare hearing coverage the budget process comes with certain procedural quirks including giving republicans the chance to offer unlimited amendments in what s known as a vote a rama the gop has promised to make the process of passing the bill this weekend hell and democrats expect to stay in session overnight to tire out the opposition and discourage further amendment votes democrats said they are hoping that republicans will not use all 10 hours of debate they are entitled to on saturday and refrain from other procedural delays gop tactics will determine whether final vote occurs late saturday on sunday or later sunday is seen as the most likely passage of the bill would be a major victory for biden even though he played a more limited role in the final talks than he did last year when trying to secure passage of a much larger version of the bill it would also be a coup for schumer after the biden agenda appeared entirely stalled by party infighting this spring schumer cited a series of recent legislative victories including passage of a new gun law veterans health benefits and a bill boosting us semiconductor manufacturing most read from bloomberg businessweek 2022 bloomberg l p
updated august 6 2022 at 7 40 pm et after weeks of negotiations to revive the core of their election year agenda senate democrats appear to be on the brink of passing a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion opening the senate floor for a rare saturday session majority leader chuck schumer d n y said no matter how long it takes the senate is going to stay in session to finish this bill the senate voted along party lines to begin formal debate on the floor saturday evening after debate concludes senators can introduce an unlimited number of amendments in what s known as a vote a rama also allowed during vote a rama is a call to have the entire text of the bill which is roughly 700 pages read aloud the process is expected to stretch into sunday before a vote on final passage three weeks ago the bill was all but dead when sen joe manchin d w va withheld his support citing concerns about adding to historically high inflation but just last week he and senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y announced an agreement much to the surprise of others in the senate manchin s concerns about inflation were placated by among others former treasury secretary larry summers a democrat who has previously been a critic of how his party has handled inflation summers and other economists have argued the bill will tamp down inflation but the congressional budget office estimates that it will have negligible impact on prices in the near term the legislation is a significant step forward for president biden s domestic agenda this bill is a gamechanger for working families and our economy biden said at an event at the white house friday i look forward to the senate taking up this legislation and passing it as soon as possible republicans are united against the bill arguing that the spending in it will make inflation worse and that the health provisions will hamper pharmaceutical innovation democrats have decided their first economic disaster justifies a second economic disaster the working people of this country feel very differently senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said on saturday but there is little his conference can do to stop the legislation the bill is getting passed through budget reconciliation which allows democrats to pass the bill with a simple majority in the evenly divided chamber and avoid the threat of a republican filibuster that applies to most legislation it also means each section of the bill needs to be reviewed by the senate parliamentarian to make sure it is actually legislation that will primarily impact the budget this review process is often referred to as the byrd bath named after the late west virginia sen robert byrd democrats said on saturday that the parliamentarian approved key elements of the bill on prescription drug pricing and clean energy one element that would compel drug companies to offer rebates if prescription prices outpaced inflation was limited in the process so that it would apply to patients on medicare but not private insurance still schumer said the bill remains mostly intact and can win the support of all 50 democrats democrats appear to have all 50 votes in their conference after sinema agreement late thursday night arizona sen kyrsten sinema said she would move forward with the legislation she was the last holdout on the bill and her support essentially means the senate has all 50 democratic votes needed to pass the bill to get on board sinema wanted the section of the bill that narrowed the carried interest tax loopholeto be removed the measure impacts how private equity is taxed and democrats say it would have brought in 14 billion what sinema wanted to add though brings in more revenue it s a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks schumer said friday he and progressive democrats were excited about that aspect of the bill which he says brings in roughly 74 billion what we added excites me and i think it excites all democrats and particularly progressives schumer said at a press conference friday i hate stock buybacks i think they re one of the most self serving things that corporate america does also added in is about 4 billion in drought resiliency put forward by senators catherine cortez masto d nev mark kelly d ariz and michael bennet d colo sinema had also called for this addition in the bill there is still criticism of the bill coming from sen bernie sanders i vt who has argued the legislation doesn t do enough for working class americans by not increasing the minimum wage making child care more affordable or tackling the student debt crisis he took to the senate floor wednesday and called it the so called inflation reduction act as currently written this is an extremely modest piece of legislation that does virtually nothing to address the enormous crises that working families all across this country are facing today he said he added that he plans to bring up his concerns during the amendment process on the floor over the weekend but a scenario in which sanders concerns prevent him from voting for the bill altogether is highly unlikely what could be another hurdle for the bill is opposition from progressives in the house which is set to return to consider the legislation late next week it caps off a busy and successful stretch for biden s domestic agenda in the past few weeks the senate has voted on a bill to expand health services for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits a semiconductor bill and a measure to allow finland and sweden into nato and all of those votes have been bipartisan schumer though has made it clear that senate democrats will also go it alone if they have to which is what they re doing with this bill no republican will vote for the legislation but with a tie breaking vote from vice president harris democrats can still cinch a victory it caps off a busy week on capitol hill and also sets up a busy week for the president who already has a slew of bills to sign into law next week copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
u s senator bernie sanders said biden s inflation reduction act of 2022 will not bring down rampant inflation and would only have a minimal impact after vice president kamala harris broke a tie in the senate to push the reconciliation bill through the initial hurdle in a 51 50 vote lawmakers began debating the bill with sanders offering a realistic outlook over the measure i want to take a moment to say a few words about the so called inflation reduction act that we are debating this evening sanders of vermont said on the senate floor and i say so called by the way because according to the cbo and other economic organizations that study this bill it will in fact have a minimal impact on inflation the package a dwindled version of earlier multi trillion dollar measures that democrats failed to advance has become a partisan battleground over inflation gasoline prices and other issues that polls show are driving voters it lists a sprawling collection of president joe biden s priorities on climate energy health and taxes but sanders said it would do little for the average american dealing with the highest levels of inflation in 41 years u s senator bernie sanders slammed biden s inflation reduction act of 2022 saying it will do little to rein in rampant inflation the senate voted 51 50 to debate democrats bill on climate energy health and taxes with vice president kamala harris pictured presenting the tie breaking vote sanders criticisms comes as inflation hit a 41 year record high of 9 1 percent in june although initially one of the biggest proponents for biden s reconciliation bill when it was known as build back better the nearly 3 trillion measure was slashed when sen joe manchin refused to back it for its overly ambitious social spendings in his criticisms of the now trimmed bill sanders said it does not address childhood poverty growing income inequality nor does it tackle flaws in the american healthcare system the american people are tired they are hurting and they are begging their elected officials to respond to their needs sanders said as he slammed democrats and republicans alike for failing to come together on the bill that passed its first hurdle along partisan lines the wages for the average american worker are lower today than they were 49 years ago and clearly the inflation of today is pushing the average person even further behind in a preview of votes expected on a mountain of amendments united democrats pushed the legislation through the evenly divided chamber with harris breaking the tie and overcoming unanimous republican opposition the house where democrats have a slender majority could give it final approval next friday when lawmakers plan to return to washington the vote came after the senate parliamentarian gave a

by david morgan washington reuters the 430 billion climate change healthcare and tax bill passed by the u s senate on saturday delivers a major win for democrats and will help reduce the carbon emissions that drive climate change while also cutting costs for the elderly democrats hope the bill which they pushed through the senate over united republican opposition will boost their chances in the nov 8 midterm elections when republicans are favored to recapture the majority in at least one chamber of congress the package called the inflation reduction act is a dramatically scaled back version of a prior bill backed by democratic president joe biden that was blocked by maverick senate democrats joe manchin and kyrsten sinema as too expensive it s what the american people want senate majority leader chuck schumer told reporters we re prioritizing the middle class working families those struggling to get to the middle class instead of what republicans do prioritize those at the very top the senate s partisan 51 50 vote with the tiebreaking vote coming from vice president kamala harris sends the legislation on to the democratic controlled house of representatives which is expected to pass it on friday after which biden could sign it into law republicans blasted the bill as a spending wish list that they argued would hurt an economy weighed down by inflation saying it would kill jobs raise energy costs and undermine growth at a time when the economy is facing a potential recession senate democrats are misreading the american people s outrage as a mandate for yet another reckless taxing and spending spree top senate republican mitch mcconnell said on saturday democrats want to ram through hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes and hundreds of billions of dollars in reckless spending and for what about half of americans some 49 support the bill including 69 of democrats and 34 of republicans according to a reuters ipsos poll conducted aug 3 and 4 the most popular element of the bill is giving medicare the power to negotiate drug prices which 71 of respondents support including 68 of republicans economists who say the legislation could help the federal reserve combat inflation do not expect a sizeable impact on the economy in coming months climate focus with 370 billion in climate focused spending it would become the most consequential climate change bill ever passed by congress the bill offers businesses and families billions in incentives to encourage purchases of electric vehicles and energy efficient appliances as well as to spur new investments in wind and solar power that would double the amount of new clean electricity generating capacity coming online in the united states by 2024 according to modeling by the repeat project at princeton university that would help put the u s on course to meet its pledge to slash its greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 below 2005 levels made at last year s glasgow climate summit while environmental groups largely embraced the bill they noted that compromises secured by manchin who represents coal producing west virginia would prolong u s use of fossil fuels those provisions include rules that would only allow the federal government to authorize new wind and solar energy developments on federal land when it is also auctioning rights to drill for oil and natural gas drug costs the legislation would lower drug costs for the government employers and patients said juliette cubanski deputy director of the medicare program at the kaiser family foundation perhaps the biggest effect would be for people with prescription drug coverage through medicare she said a key change is the provision allowing the federal medicare health plan for older and disabled americans to negotiate lower prescription drug prices the pharmaceutical industry says price negotiation would stifle innovation negotiated prices for 10 of the costliest drugs for medicare would apply starting in 2026 with that number rising until it caps at 20 a year in 2029 the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates medicare would save 101 8 billion over 10 years by negotiating drug prices the provision also introduces a 2 000 annual cap on out of pocket costs for the elderly through the medicare program tax provisions the bill also imposes a new excise tax on stock buybacks a late change after sinema raised objections over another provision that would have imposed new levies on carried interest currently a tax loophole for hedge fund and private equity financiers the provision was dropped the excise tax is expected to raise an additional 70 billion in tax revenue per year lawmakers said that is more than the carried interest provision had been forecast to raise a report by the nonpartisan congressional budget office released prior to that last change estimated the measure would reduce the federal deficit by a net 101 5 billion over the next decade that was about one third of the 300 billion in deficit reduction predicted by senate democrats but excluded a projected 204 billion revenue gain from increased internal revenue service enforcement reporting by

on a recent morning in downtown portland a woman named vitoria was waiting at a bus stop on congress street vitoria is an asylum seeker from angola who arrived in maine just a few weeks ago with her husband and two young children on this day she was trying to find her way to one of portland s african food markets speaking in portuguese she said that being able to buy african groceries means she wouldn t have to miss the food she used to eat in her home country the only problem this was her first time taking the bus in portland and she didn t how to get to the store that s where a woman named bertille bouasa came in bouasa is a volunteer with the bus ambassador program at the bus stop bouasa spoke to vitoria in french one of their shared languages and explained the different routes that serve this particular stop to get to the market she said vitoria needed to take bus number 9b ari snider bus ambassador volunteer mijou nlemvo nkongo rides the portland metro with vitoria an asylum seeker from angola who recently arrived in maine nkongo is from the democratic republic of the congo and says she too was confused by the transit system when she first arrived in maine the bus ambassador program is a collaborative effort between the greater portland council of governments and transit authorities in portland and south portland it began last year as an on call service pairing new immigrants with multilingual volunteers to help them navigate the public transportation system it s the brainchild of guy mpoyi who on a sunny morning last month was hopping onto a shuttle bus in yarmouth along with a couple dozen asylum seekers most from angola and the democratic republic of the congo who live at a nearby motel this bus is part of a new route that launched in may to help asylum seeking families access social services in portland ari snider a group of asylum seekers primarily from angola and the democratic republic of the congo wait to board a bus on the side of route 1 in yarmouth the new bus route connects the families to portland where they can access social services african grocery stores and medical facilities mpoyi himself immigrated to the us in 2013 from the democratic republic of the congo he landed first in seattle and said he was so intimidated by the transit system that he tried to avoid it as much as possible and relied on rides from friends who had cars when i arrived he said it was really hard for me to understand how transportation works now mpoyi is the one fielding calls from new immigrants who need help getting around in southern maine ari snider bus ambassador founder guy mpoyi stands next to a bus stop on congress st in portland mpoyi who is originally from the democratic republic of the congo said he came up with the idea because he understands how challenging it can be for new immigrants to navigate an unfamiliar transit system especially if they don t speak english and he gets a lot of calls many newly arrived asylum seekers in southern maine rely on public transit to get to medical appointments the grocery store and social service agencies but for most mpoyi said it s not an easy task most of them they have a language barrier he said and then sometimes when you don t know where to go it s crazy it s just complicated chelsea hoskins the refugee resettlement coordinator with the city of portland said the bus ambassador program has proven helpful in ironing out some of those complications you might get off at a stop and you re not really sure are you going left or right to get to the hospital is it an inbound or outbound stop that i m looking at here she said hoskins said bus ambassador volunteers have also served as a bridge between local governments and recently arrived immigrants this spring when cumberland county launched the new shuttle bus from downtown portland to the hotels in freeport and yarmouth hoskins said bus ambassadors were on hand to help they were there from day one breaking down trip planning helping to translate those different schedules and trips she said ari snider bus ambassador founder guy mpoyi holds a sheet of paper explaining in portuguese the schedule and route of a new shuttle bus service that connects three hotels in freeport and yarmouth to downtown portland cumberland county launched the bus service in may to help asylum seeking families access social services in portland but the program has by no means eliminated all the challenges that new immigrants face when trying to navigate their new home for example vitoria the woman from angola did make it to the african food market accompanied by a bus ambassador volunteer but it turned out her general assistance grocery voucher was actually for a different african food store on the other side

washington ap a divided senate voted saturday to start debating democrats election year economic bill boosting the sprawling collection of president joe biden s priorities on climate energy health and taxes past its initial test as it starts moving through congress in a preview of votes expected on a mountain of amendments united democrats pushed the legislation through the evenly divided chamber by 51 50 with vice president kamala harris breaking the tie and overcoming unanimous republican opposition the package a dwindled version of earlier multitrillion dollar measures that democrats failed to advance has become a partisan battleground over inflation gasoline prices and other issues that polls show are driving voters the house where democrats have a slender majority could give it final approval next friday when lawmakers plan to return to washington the vote came after the senate parliamentarian gave a thumbs up to most of democrats revised 755 page bill but elizabeth macdonough the chamber s nonpartisan rules arbiter said democrats had to drop a significant part of their plan for curbing drug prices read more senate parliamentarian approves most drug price controls in democrats economic package macdonough said democrats violated senate budget rules with language imposing hefty penalties on drug makers who boost their prices beyond inflation in the private insurance market those were the bill s chief pricing protections for the roughly 180 million people whose health coverage comes from private insurance either through work or bought on their own other pharmaceutical provisions were left intact including giving medicare the power to negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients a longtime democratic aspiration penalties on manufacturers for exceeding inflation would apply to drugs sold to medicare and there is a 2 000 annual out of pocket cap on drug costs and free vaccines for medicare beneficiaries the time is now to move forward with a big bold package for the american people said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y this historic bill will reduce inflation lower costs fight climate change it s time to move this nation forward senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said democrats are misreading the american people s outrage as a mandate for yet another reckless taxing and spending spree he said democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families yet a second time saturday s vote capped a startling 10 day period that saw democrats resurrect top components of biden s agenda that had seemed dead in rapid fire deals with democrats two most unpredictable senators first conservative joe manchin of west virginia then arizona centrist kyrsten sinema schumer pieced together a package that would give the party an achievement against the backdrop of this fall s congressional elections a white house statement said the legislation would help tackle today s most pressing economic challenges make our economy stronger for decades to come and position the united states to be the world s leader in clean energy assuming democrats fight off a nonstop vote a rama of amendments many designed by republicans to derail the measure they should be able to muscle the measure through the senate what will vote a rama be like it will be like hell sen lindsey graham of south carolina the top republican on the senate budget committee said of the approaching gop amendments he said that in supporting the democratic bill manchin and sinema are empowering legislation that will make the average person s life more difficult by forcing up energy costs with tax increases and making it harder for companies to hire workers the bill offers spending and tax incentives favored by progressives for buying electric vehicles and making buildings more energy efficient but in a bow to manchin whose state is a leading fossil fuel producer there is also money to reduce coal plant carbon emissions and language requiring the government to open more federal land and waters to oil drilling expiring subsidies that help millions of people afford private insurance premiums would be extended for three years and there is 4 billion to help western states combat drought a new provision would create a 35 monthly cap for insulin the expensive diabetes medication for medicare and private insurance patients starting next year it seemed possible that language could be weakened or removed during debate reflecting democrats calls for tax equity there would be a new 15 minimum tax on some corporations that earn over 1 billion annually but pay far less than the current 21 corporate tax companies buying back their own stock would be taxed 1 for those transactions swapped in after sinema refused to support higher taxes on private equity firm executives and hedge fund managers the irs budget would be pumped up to strengthen its tax collections while the bill s final costs are still being determined it overall would spend close to 400 billion over 10 years to slow climate change which analysts say would be the country s largest investment in that effort and billions more on health care it would raise more than 700 billion in taxes and from government drug cost savings leaving about 300 billion for deficit reduction over the coming decade a blip compared to that period s projected 16 trillion in budget shortfalls democrats are using special procedures that would let them pass the measure without having to reach the 60 vote majority that legislation often needs in the senate the parliamentarian decides whether parts of legislation must be dropped for violating those rules which include a requirement that provisions be chiefly aimed at affecting the federal budget not imposing new policy ___ associated press writer matthew daly contributed to this report
updated august 6 2022 at 7 40 pm et after weeks of negotiations to revive the core of their election year agenda senate democrats appear to be on the brink of passing a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion opening the senate floor for a rare saturday session majority leader chuck schumer d n y said no matter how long it takes the senate is going to stay in session to finish this bill the senate voted along party lines to begin formal debate on the floor saturday evening after debate concludes senators can introduce an unlimited number of amendments in what s known as a vote a rama also allowed during vote a rama is a call to have the entire text of the bill which is roughly 700 pages read aloud the process is expected to stretch into sunday before a vote on final passage three weeks ago the bill was all but dead when sen joe manchin d w va withheld his support citing concerns about adding to historically high inflation but just last week he and senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y announced an agreement much to the surprise of others in the senate manchin s concerns about inflation were placated by among others former treasury secretary larry summers a democrat who has previously been a critic of how his party has handled inflation summers and other economists have argued the bill will tamp down inflation but the congressional budget office estimates that it will have negligible impact on prices in the near term the legislation is a significant step forward for president biden s domestic agenda this bill is a gamechanger for working families and our economy biden said at an event at the white house friday i look forward to the senate taking up this legislation and passing it as soon as possible republicans are united against the bill arguing that the spending in it will make inflation worse and that the health provisions will hamper pharmaceutical innovation democrats have decided their first economic disaster justifies a second economic disaster the working people of this country feel very differently senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said on saturday but there is little his conference can do to stop the legislation the bill is getting passed through budget reconciliation which allows democrats to pass the bill with a simple majority in the evenly divided chamber and avoid the threat of a republican filibuster that applies to most legislation it also means each section of the bill needs to be reviewed by the senate parliamentarian to make sure it is actually legislation that will primarily impact the budget this review process is often referred to as the byrd bath named after the late west virginia sen robert byrd democrats said on saturday that the parliamentarian approved key elements of the bill on prescription drug pricing and clean energy one element that would compel drug companies to offer rebates if prescription prices outpaced inflation was limited in the process so that it would apply to patients on medicare but not private insurance still schumer said the bill remains mostly intact and can win the support of all 50 democrats democrats appear to have all 50 votes in their conference after sinema agreement late thursday night arizona sen kyrsten sinema said she would move forward with the legislation she was the last holdout on the bill and her support essentially means the senate has all 50 democratic votes needed to pass the bill to get on board sinema wanted the section of the bill that narrowed the carried interest tax loopholeto be removed the measure impacts how private equity is taxed and democrats say it would have brought in 14 billion what sinema wanted to add though brings in more revenue it s a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks schumer said friday he and progressive democrats were excited about that aspect of the bill which he says brings in roughly 74 billion what we added excites me and i think it excites all democrats and particularly progressives schumer said at a press conference friday i hate stock buybacks i think they re one of the most self serving things that corporate america does also added in is about 4 billion in drought resiliency put forward by senators catherine cortez masto d nev mark kelly d ariz and michael bennet d colo sinema had also called for this addition in the bill there is still criticism of the bill coming from sen bernie sanders i vt who has argued the legislation doesn t do enough for working class americans by not increasing the minimum wage making child care more affordable or tackling the student debt crisis he took to the senate floor wednesday and called it the so called inflation reduction act as currently written this is an extremely modest piece of legislation that does virtually nothing to address the enormous crises that working families all across this country are facing today he said he added that he plans to bring up his concerns during the amendment process on the floor over the weekend but a scenario in which sanders concerns prevent him from voting for the bill altogether is highly unlikely what could be another hurdle for the bill is opposition from progressives in the house which is set to return to consider the legislation late next week it caps off a busy and successful stretch for biden s domestic agenda in the past few weeks the senate has voted on a bill to expand health services for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits a semiconductor bill and a measure to allow finland and sweden into nato and all of those votes have been bipartisan schumer though has made it clear that senate democrats will also go it alone if they have to which is what they re doing with this bill no republican will vote for the legislation but with a tie breaking vote from vice president harris democrats can still cinch a victory it caps off a busy week on capitol hill and also sets up a busy week for the president who already has a slew of bills to sign into law next week copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

by david morgan washington reuters the 430 billion climate change healthcare and tax bill passed by the u s senate on saturday delivers a major win for democrats and will help reduce the carbon emissions that drive climate change while also cutting costs for the elderly democrats hope the bill which they pushed through the senate over united republican opposition will boost their chances in the nov 8 midterm elections when republicans are favored to recapture the majority in at least one chamber of congress the package called the inflation reduction act is a dramatically scaled back version of a prior bill backed by democratic president joe biden that was blocked by maverick senate democrats joe manchin and kyrsten sinema as too expensive it s what the american people want senate majority leader chuck schumer told reporters we re prioritizing the middle class working families those struggling to get to the middle class instead of what republicans do prioritize those at the very top the senate s partisan 51 50 vote with the tiebreaking vote coming from vice president kamala harris sends the legislation on to the democratic controlled house of representatives which is expected to pass it on friday after which biden could sign it into law republicans blasted the bill as a spending wish list that they argued would hurt an economy weighed down by inflation saying it would kill jobs raise energy costs and undermine growth at a time when the economy is facing a potential recession senate democrats are misreading the american people s outrage as a mandate for yet another reckless taxing and spending spree top senate republican mitch mcconnell said on saturday democrats want to ram through hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes and hundreds of billions of

federal reserve combat inflation do not expect a sizeable impact on the economy in coming months climate focus with 370 billion in climate focused spending it would become the most consequential climate change bill ever passed by congress the bill offers businesses and families billions in incentives to encourage purchases of electric vehicles and energy efficient appliances as well as to

provisions include rules that would only allow the federal government to authorize new wind and solar energy developments on federal land when it is also auctioning rights to drill for oil and natural gas drug costs the legislation would lower drug costs for the government employers and patients said juliette cubanski deputy director of the medicare program at the kaiser family foundation perhaps

new york city new york a new york federal reserve report released this week indicated that americans are struggling to keep pace with the high cost of living and are acquiring higher credit card debt according to the new york federal reserve u s household debt surpassed 16 trillion for the first time ever during the second quarter of this year and despite surging borrowing costs credit card balances increased by 46 billion last quarter over the past year credit card debt has jumped 13 percent by 100 billion the largest increase in more than 20 years the credit card binge partly reflects the fact that prices are rising at the fastest pace in more than four decades the new york fed said noting the impacts of inflation are apparent in high volumes of borrowing high inflation is also making credit card debt more expensive because the federal reserve which raised its benchmark interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point last week for the second consecutive month is aggressively raising borrowing costs it added last week the bureau of labor statistics said that high inflation is also forcing consumers to dip into their savings with personal savings rates falling in june to 5 1 percent the lowest since august 2009 but despite rising debt levels the new york fed said consumer balance sheets appear to be in a strong position overall stating although debt balances are growing rapidly households in general have weathered the pandemic remarkably well however more and more lower income and subprime borrowers appear to be currently struggling to keep up with their bills with the supportive policies of the pandemic mostly in the past there are pockets of borrowers who are beginning to show some distress on their debt the report said however credit reports indicate the number of new foreclosures increased by 11 000 during the second quarter potentially signaling the beginning of a return to more typical levels the ny fed added

updated august 6 2022 at 7 40 pm et after weeks of negotiations to revive the core of their election year agenda senate democrats appear to be on the brink of passing a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion opening the senate floor for a rare saturday session majority leader chuck schumer d n y said no matter how long it takes the senate is going to stay in session to finish this bill the senate voted along party lines to begin formal debate on the floor saturday evening after debate concludes senators can introduce an unlimited number of amendments in what s known as a vote a rama also allowed during vote a rama is a call to have the entire text of the bill which is roughly 700 pages read aloud the process is expected to stretch into sunday before a vote on final passage three weeks ago the bill was all but dead when sen joe manchin d w va withheld his support citing concerns about adding to historically high inflation but just last week he and senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y announced an agreement much to the surprise of others in the senate manchin s concerns about inflation were placated by among others former treasury secretary larry summers a democrat who has previously been a critic of how his party has handled inflation summers and other economists have argued the bill will tamp down inflation but the congressional budget office estimates that it will have negligible impact on prices in the near term the legislation is a significant step forward for president biden s domestic agenda this bill is a gamechanger for working families and our economy biden said at an event at the white house friday i look forward to the senate taking up this legislation and passing it as soon as possible republicans are united against the bill arguing that the spending in it will make inflation worse and that the health provisions will hamper pharmaceutical innovation democrats have decided their first economic disaster justifies a second economic disaster the working people of this country feel very differently senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said on saturday but there is little his conference can do to stop the legislation the bill is getting passed through budget reconciliation which allows democrats to pass the bill with a simple majority in the evenly divided chamber and avoid the threat of a republican filibuster that applies to most legislation it also means each section of the bill needs to be reviewed by the senate parliamentarian to make sure it is actually legislation that will primarily impact the budget this review process is often referred to as the byrd bath named after the late west virginia sen robert byrd democrats said on saturday that the parliamentarian approved key elements of the bill on prescription drug pricing and clean energy one element that would compel drug companies to offer rebates if prescription prices outpaced inflation was limited in the process so that it would apply to patients on medicare but not private insurance still schumer said the bill remains mostly intact and can win the support of all 50 democrats democrats appear to have all 50 votes in their conference after sinema agreement late thursday night arizona sen kyrsten sinema said she would move forward with the legislation she was the last holdout on the bill and her support essentially means the senate has all 50 democratic votes needed to pass the bill to get on board sinema wanted the section of the bill that narrowed the carried interest tax loopholeto be removed the measure impacts how private equity is taxed and democrats say it would have brought in 14 billion what sinema wanted to add though brings in more revenue it s a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks schumer said friday he and progressive democrats were excited about that aspect of the bill which he says brings in roughly 74 billion what we added excites me and i think it excites all democrats and particularly progressives schumer said at a press conference friday i hate stock buybacks i think they re one of the most self serving things that corporate america does also added in is about 4 billion in drought resiliency put forward by senators catherine cortez masto d nev mark kelly d ariz and michael bennet d colo sinema had also called for this addition in the bill there is still criticism of the bill coming from sen bernie sanders i vt who has argued the legislation doesn t do enough for working class americans by not increasing the minimum wage making child care more affordable or tackling the student debt crisis he took to the senate floor wednesday and called it the so called inflation reduction act as currently written this is an extremely modest piece of legislation that does virtually nothing to address the enormous crises that working families all across this country are facing today he said he added that he plans to bring up his concerns during the amendment process on the floor over the weekend but a scenario in which sanders concerns prevent him from voting for the bill altogether is highly unlikely what could be another hurdle for the bill is opposition from progressives in the house which is set to return to consider the legislation late next week it caps off a busy and successful stretch for biden s domestic agenda in the past few weeks the senate has voted on a bill to expand health services for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits a semiconductor bill and a measure to allow finland and sweden into nato and all of those votes have been bipartisan schumer though has made it clear that senate democrats will also go it alone if they have to which is what they re doing with this bill no republican will vote for the legislation but with a tie breaking vote from vice president harris democrats can still cinch a victory it caps off a busy week on capitol hill and also sets up a busy week for the president who already has a slew of bills to sign into law next week copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
democrats pushed their election year economic package to senate passage sunday a hard fought compromise less ambitious than president joe biden s original domestic vision but one that still meets deep rooted party goals of slowing global warming moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations the estimated 740 billion package heads next to the house where lawmakers are poised to deliver on biden s priorities a stunning turnaround of what had seemed a lost and doomed effort that suddenly roared back to political life democrats held united 51 50 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote today senate democrats sided with american families over special interests president joe biden said in a statement from rehoboth beach delaware i ran for president promising to make government work for working families again and that is what this bill does period biden who had his share of long nights during his three decades as a senator called into the senate cloakroom during the vote on speakerphone to personally thank the staff for their hard work the president urged the house to pass the bill as soon as possible the house seemed likely to provide final congressional approval when it returns briefly from summer recess on friday it s been a long tough and winding road but at last at last we have arrived said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y ahead of final votes related democrats economic package what remains in and what s out the senate is making history i am confident the inflation reduction act will endure as one of the defining

democrats swatted down some three dozen republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation confronting unanimous gop opposition democratic unity in the 50 50 chamber held keeping the party on

inflation reduction act gives democrats a campaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest ever federal effort on climate change close to 400 billion caps out of pocket drug costs for seniors on medicare to 2 000 a year and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance by raising corporate taxes the whole package is paid for with some 300 billion extra revenue for deficit reduction barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion rainbow of progressive aspirations in his build back better initiative the new package abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded child care aid that plan collapsed after conservative sen joe manchin d w va opposed it saying it was too costly and would fuel inflation nonpartisan analysts have said the inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices republicans said the measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation s worst inflation since the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky argued he said spending and tax increases in the legislation would eliminate jobs while having insignificant impact on inflation and climate change related kamala harris announces 1 billion to us states for flooding extreme heat in an ordeal imposed on all budget bills like this one the senate had to endure an overnight vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together a compromise negotiated by schumer progressives manchin and the inscrutable centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz progressive sen bernie sanders i vt offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits and those efforts were defeated most votes were forced by republicans and many were designed to make democrats look soft on u s mexico border security and gasoline and energy costs and like bullies for wanting to strengthen irs tax law enforcement before debate began saturday the bill s prescription drug price curbs were diluted by the senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian elizabeth macdonough who referees questions about the chamber s procedures said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under special procedures that will let democrats pass their bill by simple majority without the usual 60 vote margin its provisions must be focused more on dollar and cents budget numbers than policy changes related mark cuban backed online pharmacy promises to slash prescription drug prices but the thrust of their pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients penalizing manufacturers for exceeding inflation for pharmaceuticals sold to medicare and limiting beneficiaries out of pocket drug costs to 2 000 annually the bill also caps medicare patients costs for insulin the expensive diabetes medication at 35 monthly democrats wanted to extend the 35 cap to private insurers but it ran afoul of senate rules most republicans voted to strip it from the package though in a sign of the political potency of health costs seven gop senators joined democrats trying to preserve it the measure s final costs were being recalculated to reflect late changes but overall it would raise more than 700 billion over a decade the money would come from a 15 minimum tax on a handful of corporations with yearly profits above 1 billion a 1 tax on companies that repurchase their own stock bolstered irs tax collections and government savings from lower drug costs sinema forced democrats to drop a plan to prevent wealthy hedge fund managers from paying less than individual income tax rates for their earnings she also joined with other western senators to win 4 billion to combat the region s drought several democratic senators joined the gop led effort to exclude some firms from the new corporate minimum tax the package keeps to biden s pledge not to raise taxes on those earning less than 400 000

advance has become a partisan battleground over inflation gasoline prices and other issues that polls show are driving voters the house where democrats have a slender majority could give it final approval next friday when lawmakers plan to return to washington the vote came after the senate parliamentarian gave a thumbs up to most of democrats revised 755 page bill but elizabeth macdonough the chamber s nonpartisan rules arbiter said democrats had to drop a significant part of their plan for curbing drug prices macdonough said democrats violated senate budget rules with language imposing hefty penalties on drug makers who boost their prices beyond inflation in the private insurance market those were the bill s chief pricing protections for the roughly 180 million people whose health coverage comes from private insurance either through work or bought on their own other pharmaceutical provisions were left intact including giving medicare the power to negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients a longtime democratic aspiration penalties on manufacturers for exceeding inflation would apply to drugs sold to medicare and there is a 2 000 annual out of pocket cap on drug costs and free vaccines for medicare beneficiaries the time is now to move forward with a big bold package for the american people said senate majority leader chuck schumer this historic bill will reduce inflation lower costs fight climate change it s time to move this nation forward senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said democrats are misreading the american people s outrage as a mandate for yet another reckless taxing and spending spree he said democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families yet a second time saturday s vote capped a startling 10 day period that saw democrats resurrect top components of president biden s agenda that had seemed dead in rapid fire deals with democrats two most unpredictable senators first conservative joe manchin of west virginia then arizona centrist kyrsten sinema schumer pieced together a package that would give the party an achievement against the backdrop of this fall s congressional elections a white house statement said the legislation would help tackle today s most pressing economic challenges make our economy stronger for decades to come and position the united states to be the world s leader in clean energy assuming democrats fight off a nonstop vote a rama of amendments many designed by republicans to derail the measure they should be able to muscle the measure through the senate what will vote a rama be like it will be like hell sen lindsey graham of south carolina the top republican on the senate budget committee said of the approaching gop amendments he said that in supporting the democratic bill manchin and sinema are empowering legislation that will make the average person s life more difficult by forcing up energy costs with tax increases and making it harder for companies to hire workers the bill offers spending and tax incentives favored by progressives for buying electric vehicles and making buildings more energy efficient but in a bow to manchin whose state is a leading fossil fuel producer there is also money to reduce coal plant carbon emissions and language requiring the government to open more federal land and waters to oil drilling expiring subsidies that help millions of people afford private insurance premiums would be extended for three years and there is 4 billion to help western states combat drought a new provision would create a 35 monthly cap for insulin the expensive diabetes medication for medicare and private insurance patients starting next year it seemed possible that language could be weakened or removed during debate reflecting democrats calls for tax equity there would be a new 15 minimum tax on some corporations that earn over 1 billion annually but pay far less than the current 21 corporate tax companies buying back their own stock would be taxed 1 for those transactions swapped in after sinema refused to support higher taxes on private equity firm executives and hedge fund managers the irs budget would be pumped up to strengthen its tax collections while the bill s final costs are still being determined it overall would spend close to 400 billion over 10 years to slow climate change which analysts say would be the country s largest investment in that effort and billions more on health care it would raise more than 700 billion in taxes and from government drug cost savings leaving about 300 billion for deficit reduction over the coming decade a blip compared to that period s projected 16 trillion in budget shortfalls democrats are using special procedures that would let them pass the measure without having to reach the 60 vote majority that legislation often needs in the senate the parliamentarian decides whether parts of legislation must be dropped for violating those rules which include a requirement that provisions be chiefly aimed at affecting the federal budget not imposing new policy additional reporting by the associated press
tesla tsla announced on aug 4 that shareholders agreed to a 3 1 stock split for the company s shares even though the stock split was expected tesla s stock valued at 933 during yesterday s opening bell opened with a nearly 2 6 drop the following morning for the most part shareholders love the idea of stock splits it s nice to have at least the perception of getting something for nothing but a stock split doesn t necessarily mean that anybody s getting anything of additional value with their money tesla shareholders approve 3 1 stock split tesla shareholders approved the new stock split at the annual shareholder meeting in austin texas the company first announced the proposed split several months ago via a march 28 tweet tsla stock has been on an upswing since last month posting its biggest gains since october 2021 and the announcement of the stock split does not take effect immediately the texas headquartered company hasn t specified the actual date of the stock split this will also be the electric vehicle maker s second stock split in less than two years the company s last split a 5 1 split was in august 2020 following that split tesla s stock price surged 60 from the day of the announcement until its execution the company in its 2022 proxy statement dated june 6 says we believe the stock split would help reset the market price of our common stock so that our employees will have more flexibility in managing their equity all of which in our view may help maximize stockholder value in addition as retail investors have expressed a high level of interest in investing in our stock we believe the stock split will also make our common stock more accessible to our retail shareholders while stock splits don t influence a company s value it makes it more affordable to retail investors stock splits increase the number of outstanding shares while simultaneously decreasing the cost of each share when a company s stock splits each existing share gets divided into the corresponding number of split shares when tesla s stock split goes into effect each shareholder who currently owns one share will own three in the 300 range other notable stock splits include amazon s 20 1 stock split in june and alphabet s googl stock split in july in the case of amazon amzn before the stock split one amazon share was worth more than 2 400 following the split the adjusted share price fell to around 124 per share a comparable share price to other dow jones industrial average djia companies why tesla is splitting its shares many experts assume the tesla split will make the company s stock more affordable to retail investors but even after approving the 3 1 proposal tesla s stock is still down more than 28 year to date this is roughly in line with the broader market and the nasdaq composite index which tesla is on is down 20 year to date the 3 1 split comes on the heels of even more good news for tesla shareholders with sen joe manchin d w va onboard with the u s senate s inflation reduction act of 2022 the significant tax credits could be available to tesla car buyers the existing credit was phased out after a carmaker sold 200 000 electric vehicles but this bill would make the credit available to qualifying tesla and general motors gm vehicles tesla s split should make it more affordable with its stock price approaching 1 000 per share tesla has had a hefty price tag for most retail investors for quite some time the 3 1 stock split should change all that and it could spur more retail investment in the company regarding institutional ownership the stock is currently held by a wide range of different funds at the time of this writing vanguard owned more than 65 million shares and blackrock owned over 55 million to name a couple of large institutional holders in fact more than 3 000 institutions own shares in tesla this kind of ownership is good for the company s existing shareholders but doesn t help new investors get a slice of the tesla pie a 3 1 stock split could ensure more mom and pop investors can own a piece of the electric vehicle giant more from forbes advisor
the incidents proves it is the us to be the biggest saboteur and destabiliser of peace in the taiwan strait and the biggest troublemaker to regional stability the embassy said in a statement posted on saturday night loading it is the us that should be condemned china is the victim of political provocation from the us instead of expressing sympathy and support to the victim the australian side has condemned the victim along with the perpetrators this is completely putting the cart before the horse and reversing the right from the wrong hastie said it was important for australia to talk to all sides including china and taiwan but he emphasised the need for a stronger military to prepare for what he called a very bleak outlook in an important statement on bipartisan foreign policy hastie endorsed the one china policy that underpins the australian stance on taiwan s future but added that there were ways for australia to support the island including on trade loading asked about the strategic ambiguity that australia and its allies express when asked how they would respond to an attack on taiwan he said the stance allowed some flexibility in the response when there was a high risk of miscalculation allowing a little bit of space for both parties or all parties involved to give each other the benefit of the doubt is really really important he said hastie made no criticism of pelosi for visiting taiwan saying the trip was a matter for the us but said her visit was no different from earlier ones by similar us political representatives asked if he would visit taiwan hastie said he was open minded about whether to go in the same way he had tried to visit china several years ago before the chinese government denied his visa along with the visa of his liberal colleague victorian senator james paterson with defence minister richard marles seeking a new review of defence to report by march next year hastie said australia could not afford any cuts to its capabilities and had to do everything possible to hasten the delivery of nuclear propelled submarines under the aukus alliance with the united states and united kingdom whether we re engaged in a high intensity war or whether we re at the periphery of one there are certain things we absolutely need he said we need more fuel stocks i think that s clear we need more ammo stocks ukraine has proven that we need to continue to invest in our cyber resilience he cited the 10 billion investment in the australian signals directorate in the federal budget in may of course we need to be able to hold an adversary at risk at distance which is why we struck aukus which is why we need those nuclear submarines which is why we need missiles that can reach out and touch an adversary among other capabilities asked if that meant the government should allow the us to base missiles in australia hastie said the goal was to partner with the us to develop sovereign missiles that were australian owned and australian delivered if required loading while hastie acknowledged the challenges in delivering the nuclear submarines before 2040 he said it was not impossible and cited the tactics used by then prime minister malcolm fraser in 1970 over the supply of fighter aircraft from the us frustrated over the terms of agreement to buy the f 111 jets fraser threatened to air concerns in senate hearings in the us congress when he and australian officials were visiting washington dc a move that led us officials to agree to better terms for australia in the contract
updated august 6 2022 at 7 40 pm et after weeks of negotiations to revive the core of their election year agenda senate democrats appear to be on the brink of passing a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion opening the senate floor for a rare saturday session majority leader chuck schumer d n y said no matter how long it takes the senate is going to stay in session to finish this bill the senate voted along party lines to begin formal debate on the floor saturday evening after debate concludes senators can introduce an unlimited number of amendments in what s known as a vote a rama also allowed during vote a rama is a call to have the entire text of the bill which is roughly 700 pages read aloud the process is expected to stretch into sunday before a vote on final passage three weeks ago the bill was all but dead when sen joe manchin d w va withheld his support citing concerns about adding to historically high inflation but just last week he and senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y announced an agreement much to the surprise of others in the senate manchin s concerns about inflation were placated by among others former treasury secretary larry summers a democrat who has previously been a critic of how his party has handled inflation summers and other economists have argued the bill will tamp down inflation but the congressional budget office estimates that it will have negligible impact on prices in the near term the legislation is a significant step forward for president biden s domestic agenda this bill is a gamechanger for working families and our economy biden said at an event at the white house friday i look forward to the senate taking up this legislation and passing it as soon as possible republicans are united against the bill arguing that the spending in it will make inflation worse and that the health provisions will hamper pharmaceutical innovation democrats have decided their first economic disaster justifies a second economic disaster the working people of this country feel very differently senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said on saturday but there is little his conference can do to stop the legislation the bill is getting passed through budget reconciliation which allows democrats to pass the bill with a simple majority in the evenly divided chamber and avoid the threat of a republican filibuster that applies to most legislation it also means each section of the bill needs to be reviewed by the senate parliamentarian to make sure it is actually legislation that will primarily impact the budget this review process is often referred to as the byrd bath named after the late west virginia sen robert byrd democrats said on saturday that the parliamentarian approved key elements of the bill on prescription drug pricing and clean energy one element that would compel drug companies to offer rebates if prescription prices outpaced inflation was limited in the process so that it would apply to patients on medicare but not private insurance still schumer said the bill remains mostly intact and can win the support of all 50 democrats democrats appear to have all 50 votes in their conference after sinema agreement late thursday night arizona sen kyrsten sinema said she would move forward with the legislation she was the last holdout on the bill and her support essentially means the senate has all 50 democratic votes needed to pass the bill to get on board sinema wanted the section of the bill that narrowed the carried interest tax loopholeto be removed the measure impacts how private equity is taxed and democrats say it would have brought in 14 billion what sinema wanted to add though brings in more revenue it s a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks schumer said friday he and progressive democrats were excited about that aspect of the bill which he says brings in roughly 74 billion what we added excites me and i think it excites all democrats and particularly progressives schumer said at a press conference friday i hate stock buybacks i think they re one of the most self serving things that corporate america does also added in is about 4 billion in drought resiliency put forward by senators catherine cortez masto d nev mark kelly d ariz and michael bennet d colo sinema had also called for this addition in the bill there is still criticism of the bill coming from sen bernie sanders i vt who has argued the legislation doesn t do enough for working class americans by not increasing the minimum wage making child care more affordable or tackling the student debt crisis he took to the senate floor wednesday and called it the so called inflation reduction act as currently written this is an extremely modest piece of legislation that does virtually nothing to address the enormous crises that working families all across this country are facing today he said he added that he plans to bring up his concerns during the amendment process on the floor over the weekend but a scenario in which sanders concerns prevent him from voting for the bill altogether is highly unlikely what could be another hurdle for the bill is opposition from progressives in the house which is set to return to consider the legislation late next week it caps off a busy and successful stretch for biden s domestic agenda in the past few weeks the senate has voted on a bill to expand health services for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits a semiconductor bill and a measure to allow finland and sweden into nato and all of those votes have been bipartisan schumer though has made it clear that senate democrats will also go it alone if they have to which is what they re doing with this bill no republican will vote for the legislation but with a tie breaking vote from vice president harris democrats can still cinch a victory it caps off a busy week on capitol hill and also sets up a busy week for the president who already has a slew of bills to sign into law next week copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
democrats pushed their election year economic package to senate passage sunday a hard fought compromise less ambitious than president joe biden s original domestic vision but one that still meets deep rooted party goals of slowing global warming moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations the estimated 740 billion package heads next to the house where lawmakers are poised to deliver on biden s priorities a stunning turnaround of what had seemed a lost and doomed effort that suddenly roared back to political life democrats held united 51 50 with vice president kamala

costly and would fuel inflation nonpartisan analysts have said the inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices republicans said the measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with

senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian elizabeth macdonough who referees questions about the chamber s procedures said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under special procedures that will let democrats pass their bill by simple majority without the usual 60 vote margin its provisions must be focused more on dollar and cents budget numbers than policy changes related mark cuban backed online pharmacy promises to slash prescription drug prices but the thrust of their pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate

to 2 000 annually the bill also caps medicare patients costs for insulin the expensive diabetes medication at 35 monthly democrats wanted to extend the 35 cap to private insurers but it ran afoul of senate rules most republicans voted to strip it from the package though in a sign of the political potency of health costs seven gop senators joined democrats trying to preserve it the measure s final

greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer thank you paulina good morning everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call please turn to slide 3 at quarter end book value was 5 10 per share representing a negative 4 7 total economic quarterly return following the historic bond market repricing in the first quarter elevated market volatility continued through the second quarter inflation continued to exceed expectations leading the federal reserve to accelerate the pace of monetary tightening and in turn raising the possibility of a recession the risk off sentiments across many asset classes including mortgages gathered steam during the quarter and as a result mortgage performance in the first half of 2022 ranked among the worst in decades entering the year with mortgage spreads standing near record tight levels we added significantly to our msr portfolio while reducing rmbs balances and overall leverage to help protect against spread widening while those actions significantly reduced losses during the last two quarters we now find ourselves in the exact opposite situation with mortgages currently standing at historically wide levels despite plenty of uncertainty surrounding the economy the future path of interest rates and monetary policy we believe there are significant opportunities in both rmbs and msr and we have repositioned our portfolio again to take advantage of the market environment by increasing our rmbs exposure and leverage we have also positioned ourselves to further capitalize on our msr assets we are very excited to announce that we have agreed to acquire roundpoint mortgage servicing corporation from freedom mortgage corporation this transaction will mark a strategic shift for us as we transition to an in house servicing model with the growth we have experienced in the msr portfolio bringing the servicing operations in house will not only increase efficiencies and returns on our msr asset but enable us to better manage recapture and portfolio defense strategies grow a third party subservicing business and position us to capitalize on other opportunities within the mortgage finance space please turn to slide 4 for an overview of the transaction we will purchase roundpoint for a preliminary purchase price which is comprised of roundpoint s tangible net book value plus a premium of 10 5 million subject to certain post closing purchase price adjustments not included in the transaction will be an msr servicing exchange called rpx and a retail origination platform each of which roundpoint will divest of prior to closing founded in 2007 roundpoint is led by a veteran team with decades of industry experience by combining their established practices and experience with the size of the two harbors portfolio we believe we will be able to efficiently make this transition from our subservicing model although the transaction is expected to close in 2023 we plan to begin transitioning loans to roundpoint as a subservicer later this year as we bring roundpoint to scale we expect to achieve incremental annual pre tax earnings of approximately 20 million however beyond the increased efficiency of servicing msr this acquisition will open the door to additional and diversified revenue streams with roundpoint being an experienced subservicer we plan to look for opportunities to expand that business to further capitalize on the economies of scale and servicing operations beyond that we believe this will enable us to more closely work with our msr flow sellers and develop deeper partnerships within the industry overall we are very excited for the integration of roundpoint and the enhancement to our msr strategy please turn to slide 5 during the quarter inflation continued to trend higher as shown in figure 1 the may and june cpi readings at 8 6 and 9 1 respectively marked the strongest annual inflation rate since 1981 as seen in the light gray lines inflation expectations have consistently underestimated reality which in turn has caused the fed to increase the pace of monetary tightening indeed the fed has raised its benchmark rate by 225 basis points so far this year including 275 basis point hikes one in june and one last wednesday which were the largest single meeting hike since 1994 chairman powell have expressed his strong commitment to contain inflation and the market is pricing in 100 basis points in additional increases which would bring in the implied fed funds rate close to three and a half percent by the end of the year as seen in figure 2 current pricing in the front end of the yield curve implies the end of the hiking cycle later this year with a cut being possible by mid 2023 with the aggressive measures being taken to bring price growth under control many market participants believe that a hard landing for the economy is increasingly possible the consequent lack of clarity around the path of rates pushed bond market volatility in the second quarter to multi decade highs as examples the two year treasury rate began the quarter at 2 34 rose 109 basis points to peak at 3 43 before falling 47 basis points to finish the quarter at 2 96 longer term rates were equally volatile and the 10 year treasury rate followed a similar path figure 3 shows the rolling three month realized volatility for current coupon mortgage rates as you can see realized volatility continued to accelerate higher in the second quarter as the market adjusted to incoming economic data in the last 20 years only the great recession and the pandemic periods have had as much rate volatility as we saw last quarter please turn to slide 6 in a quarter marked with so much volatility and uncertainty mortgage performance unsurprisingly struggled figure 1 shows a histogram of quarterly excess returns of the bloomberg u s mbs index the index which is heavily weighted to lower coupons and represents an unlevered hedged portfolio of rmbs had negative 97 basis points of excess return for the second quarter which was the fourth worst quarter in the last 20 years in combination with the first quarter excess returns of negative 74 basis points the first half of 2022 is the fourth worst six month period in the last 20 years as well given the underperformance of mortgages over the last six months we now see a lot of upside to owning rmbs at these levels as you can see in figure 2 current coupon zv spreads have moved from around 50 basis points at the start of the year to 125 basis points at the end of june and as of the end of the july had tightened somewhat while the zv spreads approximately 50 basis points over the average of periods when the fed is not conducting quantitative easing nominal spreads are very high and have rarely stayed at levels this elevated for long much of the reason for wide nominal spreads is due to the market pricing and a continuation of the volatility we have seen in q2 however as you can see in the chart even option adjusted spreads were 14 basis points above average non qe periods as of the end of june one way to read this chart is that even if the high interest rate volatility in the second quarter continues mortgages are still cheap and should produce above average positive returns absent further spread widening another important and interesting current market feature is that the range of tradable rmbs coupons has expanded greatly creating significant relative value investing opportunities with a range of 2 to 5 5 there has rarely been such a large number of liquid tradable coupons in figure 3 we show the oas and zv spreads as a function of mortgage duration along the x axis one very interesting characteristics that you can see in this chart is that the coupon labels all shifted right as we move from 331 to 630 as interest rates rose and mortgage durations extended we think it s more relevant to compare spreads of bonds of similar durations rather than keeping the coupon fixed it s also worth noting the relative flatness of the oas curve compared to the steep zv curve low coupons such as fannie 2s were roughly 300 basis points out of the money and an 86 price as of 6 30 have very little convexity and therefore very little option cost meaning that the oas and zv spreads are reasonably close to each other the higher recurrent coupons have higher convexity and higher option costs and so there is larger differences between oas and zv indeed at the end of june the zv of fannie 2s was 64 basis points and the oas was 41 basis points for a spread of 23 basis points while fannie 4 5 for example had zv and oass of 132 basis points and 35 basis points respectively for a spread of 97 basis points the lower coupons with their lower convexities are easier to hedge though their deep discount prices make them more exposed to prepayment risk and their long spread duration makes their prices more sensitive to changes in spreads the higher coupons have shorter spread duration impoverished dollar prices making them less sensitive to prepayment speeds and spread changes but the higher convexity means frequent rebalancing is required to hedge importantly the fact that the oass were similar to the low coupons as of the end of june anyway meaning that the projected high coupon returns shouldn t be worse even if volatility stays elevated and if you happen to think that volatility will eventually decline like we do then there is significant upside for the higher coupons to tighten and spread for some investors earning a lower return with less convexity is interesting but we think the higher coupons offer more value in this environment as low coupons tightened significantly in july we feel they now offer a low spread with limited potential for further spread compression as a result we see the relative value offered by higher coupons to be considerable and similar to what it was in march in both zv and oas terms now i ll turn it over to mary to discuss our financial results in more detail mary riskey chief financial officer thank you bill and good morning everyone please turn to slide 7 for the second quarter the company reported a comprehensive loss of 90 4 million representing an annualized return on average common equity of minus 19 1 our book value was 5 10 per share compared to 5 53 at march 31st including the 0 17 common dividend results in a quarterly economic return of minus 4 7 the results primarily reflect the mortgage spread widening bill discussed earlier and to a lesser degree higher hedging costs as a result of the elevated volatility we saw during the quarter moving on to slide 8 earnings available for distribution was 0 22 per share compared to 0 18 per share for the first quarter interest income increased by 12 2 million as we grew the rmbs portfolio and rotated into higher coupon securities interest income also benefited from lower amortization as prepayment speeds declined interest expense rose by 14 8 million to 37 1 million due to the combination of growth in msr borrowing balances as well as an overall rise in rates tba dollar roll income increased to 57 7 million on a higher average notional position and a shift to higher coupon tba which benefited from roll specialness as we noted earlier in the year we expected roll specialness to fade in the second half as supply catches up to demand in the production coupons and currently we aren t seeing tba persistently special in any coupon finally our u s treasury futures income was also lower reflecting a larger short position which was used to hedge lengthening mortgage duration turning to msr net servicing revenue grew by roughly 6 7 million to approximately 76 1 million in conjunction with the larger average msr portfolio turning to page 9 the portfolio yield increased 94 basis points to 4 39 driven by our investment in higher coupon rmbs and higher yields on a larger average msr portfolio our realized net spread in the quarter was 3 26 compared to 2 75 in the prior quarter as the higher portfolio yield more than offset an increase in the cost of funds net spread as of june 30th is estimated at 3 18 as noted on the bottom of the slide beginning with the second quarter we have incorporated the implied asset yield and financing of tbas first quarter comparative data has been updated to reflect the change please turn to slide 10 funding in the repo market remains liquid and well supported similar to the first quarter funding costs for agency rmbs rose on an absolute basis however as shown in the chart in the upper right the spread to sofr remains low currently right around 10 basis points to 13 basis points for both three month and six month maturities we maintained access to diverse funding sources for msr our unfunded and committed msr asset finance capacity stood at 218 8 million at quarter end with additional capacity available on an uncommitted basis please turn to slide 11 as i mentioned earlier we grew our mortgage exposure during the second quarter deploying capital into rmbs and adding tba which brought our portfolio leverage to what we would consider to be a neutral position at 6 4 times average economic debt to equity in the second quarter was 5 6 times compared to the first quarter average of 4 8 times i will now turn the call back to bill for our portfolio update bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer thank you mary with the large repricing and mortgage spreads since the beginning of the year we felt that the historically cheap valuations currently available in the mortgage market no longer justify the underweight we had been carrying even despite continued market uncertainties overall our specified pool and tba positions both grew by 1 7 billion respectively as we increased portfolio leverage we aggressively moved our position up in coupon where we saw the best value with zv spreads in the 125 basis point to 150 basis point area during the quarter we increased our total spec pool and tba position in four and a half and five coupons by over 7 billion while decreasing our position in three through four coupons by over 4 billion furthermore after the material widening of lower coupons within the quarter we increased our position in two and halves by nearly 0 5 billion with roll specialness largely a thing of the past we have added specified pools when we find ones that meet our criteria within specified pools we have focused our purchases within a higher loan balance 200k to 250k max pools investor properties and florida geographies we view florida geography as a particularly compelling story as it trades to a sizable discount to loan balance collateral but with similar prepayment profile overall we view these stories as providing cheap prepayment options with low absolute payups and traded spreads that are wider than tba please turn to slide 12 while all mortgages widened during the quarter lower coupon suffered the most as 10 year rates rose toward three and a half percent and mortgage rates approach 6 a marketwide rotation from lower coupons to current coupons caused that part of the stack to underperform 30 to 60 ticks in contrast the three and a half through five coupons where our portfolio was positioned for the majority of the quarter fared much better using between five and 25 ticks lastly prepayment speeds shown in figure 3 dropped as expected and commensurate with the rate move with most mortgage backed securities now trading at a discount it is important to remember that faster speeds are actually a cash flow advantage as more principal is returned at par more quickly in contrast slower speeds are cash flow disadvantage for the opposite reason in furtherance of this fact prepay speeds on tba collateral are now below five cpr in most cases as those coupons reflect newly originated loans whose borrowers are just settling in and are very unlikely to prepay as tba those slow paying bonds are the cheapest to deliver we have constructed our portfolio such that many of our specified pools have seasoning and other borrower characteristics which results in faster speeds than the tba please turn to slide 13 activity in the msr market remained very robust with approximately 144 billion of upb offered during the second quarter and another 56 billion coming through in july as seen in figure 1 our msr portfolio declined by 3 billion upb to 229 billion reflecting net portfolio runoff our msr price multiple expanded marginally to 5 4 times as a result of higher interest rates and wider mortgage spreads during the quarter we entered into agreements to sell roughly 21 billion upb in the third quarter and intend to deploy the proceeds into historically attractive rmbs our 60 day delinquency rate continued to fall toward pre covid levels ending the quarter at 0 8 in figure 2 we show the trend of our settled upb for our flow and bulk channels over the last four quarters flow volumes continued to decline in conjunction with lower refinancing activity in figure 3 we compare our servicing prepayment speeds versus tba overall prepayment speeds on our msr portfolio declined by 30 from 14 2 to 10 cpr a moment ago i told you about how fast your speeds are a benefit for mortgage backed securities and slower speeds are a detriment but that is only true for principal bearing securities for interest only instruments like msr slower speeds are always better than faster speeds although our msr prepayment speeds are faster than newly originated tba collateral that is just a consequence of having acquired our portfolio over time the slow tba speeds as i mentioned reflect newly originated loans and there just hasn t been enough time at these new rate levels to generate msr off of those loans in any real size over time as those loans move up the so called seasoning ramp those speeds should increase as well also over time we will be able to purchase that newer at the money msr which will also increase our weighted average coupon however we view 10 cpr as already quite slow and we expect it to move slower still we project our portfolio speeds to decline another 20 plus percent to 6 9 cpr and expect further slowing throughout the third quarter please turn to slide 14 through a combination of our rmbs activity and the effect of the large sell off in rates on our msr our exposure to mortgage spreads has increased significantly from where it stood both last quarter and at the beginning of the year as seen in the lower right panel a 25 basis point widening in rmbs spreads would have an impact of negative 7 6 up in magnitude from negative 2 8 in q1 and negative 0 8 at the beginning of the year with note rates on the msr portfolio being so low our portfolio coupon is 3 2 while primary mortgage rates are around 5 any change in mortgage rates has little effect on our prepay speeds or current cash flows importantly when rmbs spreads are at normal or tight levels the offsetting risk of at the money msr is a huge advantage by reducing volatility with a high yielding asset in this unique period with rmbs spreads so wide we see the low sensitivity of the msr asset as an advantage we capture the upside if mortgage spreads tighten while the msr maintains a steady cash flow with low prepays over time as we add new current coupon msr the duration and hedging effect of the msr will return to normal please turn to slide 15 where we show our interest rate and yield curve exposures interest rate sensitivity of the portfolio was a little changed from the prior quarter and is very low with the msr almost fully extended it has very little duration and so the duration gap between our rmbs and repo must be hedged primarily with interest rate products a 25 basis point parallel shock up would have an effect of plus 1 1 on book value attributed to the msr asset as seen in figure 1 the rmbs position on the other hand had its sensitivity increased to minus 9 5 and so the rate hedge offset of 8 5 brings the total rate exposure in an up 25 basis point parallel move to a net positive 0 1 in today s environment with the fed in motion we have been particularly focused on the very front end of the curve and we have been very careful to keep exposure in that part of the yield curve as low as possible i often like to say that we are mortgage investors and not fed interest rate guessers in figure 3 we show that our sensitivity to changes in short term rates is calculated to be 0 impact to book value in an up 25 basis point bare flattening shock finally i d like to discuss our outlook for two harbors and our return expectations for new investments on slide 16 static return expectations are as interesting as they have been in a very long time lower coupon pools and tba offer high single digit returns with relatively low convexity risk projected returns on current coupon pools and tba are in the mid teens having very wide spreads and stand to benefit the most if and when rate volatility subsides the msr paired strategy also continues to have low to mid teens returns and lower rmbs spread risk all of these pairings currently offer very attractive returns with different risk profiles despite the uncertainty and near term drag from volatility seen during the quarter the longer term outlook for two harbors is very positive historically wide mortgage spreads present an excellent opportunity for investment while the variety of tradable coupons within the space allows us to take advantage of relative value opportunities we expect interest rate volatility to eventually subside and both the msr and rmbs should benefit when that occurs additionally we re very excited for the evolution of our msr strategy with the acquisition of roundpoint the increased operational efficiencies and the revenue opportunities it presents will add value for shareholders while deepening our involvement in the industry thank you very much for joining us today and we ll now be happy to take any questions you might have questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of doug harter with credit suisse please proceed with your question doug harter credit suisse analyst thanks bill since the fed meeting your mortgage spreads have tightened quite nicely i guess just one can you talk about what that has done to book value quarter to date and two how that has impacted returns and whether that changes any of the attractiveness of freezing assets today bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yeah thanks for the question doug good morning nice to have you the interest rate volatility and the spread volatility of mortgages has continued through the fed meeting price performance throughout july has been moving up and down mortgage spreads as you note have been they can be quarter point half a point wider one day and the same tighter the next day so in terms of performance our performance has also moved around commensurately with that i hesitate to give one number because it s been both higher than this and lower than this but as of the end of july we were up around one and a half percent in book value doug harter credit suisse analyst and then so i guess based on that do you still see the return environment as relatively consistent with kind of what that outlook slide has bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yes generally given within the bounds of the volatility that we see on a daily basis i do i still see well in certain ways i think the higher coupons are certainly still consistent with what we show both on the zv and oas graph earlier in the presentation as well as the returns that are on page 16 the low coupons have tightened a lot as you ve probably noticed and they look closer to what they did at the end of march i d say doug harter credit suisse analyst great that make sense thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of arren cyganovich with citi please proceed with your question arren cyganovich citi analyst thanks guys i wanted to dig into the acquisition a little bit more can you talk about the rationale is it more of a cost savings or a revenue opportunity that you see there and maybe dig into some of the benefits of having your own servicer versus using a subservicer bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yeah sure as i think there are there s many benefits here which is one of the reasons why we re so excited about it actually over time as our portfolio has grown we really just reached a scale where it makes sense for us to bring it in house the cost savings that we can achieve from bringing in house i mean not paying subservicers is significant it gives us more control over the servicing of the portfolio and it allows us to enter into the ancillary businesses as i mentioned such as subservicing and other ways to partner with our existing seller network and other counterparties in more meaningful ways as well so we think it has lots of benefits across our activities in the servicing and mortgage finance space but really one of the maybe the main issue is the extra revenue and cost savings that we re going to generate arren cyganovich citi analyst and you had mentioned that it was a 10 5 million premium to tangible book do you are you able to provide what the total sale prices and will you have to raise any equity capital associated with the acquisition mary riskey chief financial officer hi arren this is mary so we can t disclose their book value they re not a public company however we are acquiring the servicing platform which is a capital light business we re not acquiring any msr and they re divesting of certain businesses that would have capital so we don t expect the book value to be a material number arren cyganovich citi analyst ok thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of trevor cranston with jmp securities please proceed with your questions trevor cranston jmp securities analyst great thanks good morning you mentioned the benefit of msr being less rate sensitive and spread sensitive in the prepared remarks in terms of increasing your portfolios spread exposure i guess where you stand today does it make would it make sense potentially to sell more of the msr portfolio in order to reallocate capital to mbs or given the lower sensitivities that s not going to be as meaningful of a benefit where we are today bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yes thanks for the question that s an ongoing relative value decision that we make all the time rmbs is attractive here but msr having very little spread exposure and interest rate exposure and cash flowing as much it does is also attracted in a different way with a different risk profile as i mentioned prepayment speeds have fallen quite a bit already as i said in my prepared remarks we expect speeds on our servicing portfolio to be around seven cpr for july we expect them to go slower still in august my own view obviously everyone can have their own views but my view is that there s probably more possibility of speed surprising to the slow side than to the fast side here so we like having a bunch of servicing with low coupons and deep discounts and exposed to turnover speeds here so it s a combination of or the analysis is one of relative value and risk profiles and we may sell more and we may buy more it depends on the prices in the market trevor cranston jmp securities analyst ok got it and then on leverage i think the current leverage level was characterized as a neutral position in the opening remarks can you talk about how high you d be willing to take leverage if you were to get more aggressive and maybe kind of more outright positive on the market bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yeah thanks so when we talk about overall portfolio leverage it s important to incorporate the amount of msr that we have in our portfolio at any given time right so more msr because the leverage in that asset is lower than the leverage in the mbs asset will generally generate a lower overall portfolio leverage right and we have more msr today than we ve had in the past if you compare our portfolio to what it was pre covid but i would say as i said neutral is right around here mid high sixes i would say full overweight is probably in the high sevens low eights kind of area but that would be like max overweight kind of thing which that s why i say if you say that s one and a half to two turns higher go back one and a half to two turns lower that s what we were when we thought we were maximum underweight right so that s why we say we re sort of in the midpoint here trevor cranston jmp securities analyst ok that make sense thank you bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer with today s portfolio of course right operator thank you our next questions come from the line of bose george with kbw please proceed with your questions bose george kbw analyst actually going back to roundpoint now that you ll have the servicer they will be i guess recapture will be a growing part of the mix etc or at least part of the mix does it will you potentially look at origination capacity as well as another way to sort of obtain msr bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer yes so it s not particularly our intention to compete in the origination space with retail participants or wholesale participants as you point out we are interested in recapturing other portfolio defense strategies right and other ways in which to partner in a complementary way with our existing servicing seller network and other counterparties and so we will be doing some things along that lines but we don t intend at this time to really compete in any meaningful way in the retail or wholesale origination space bose george kbw analyst and then actually just in terms of servicing technology is there a decision to be made in terms of that is roundpoint on msp is there any sort of cost saves that could be done from a servicing technology standpoint bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer that s something we re always going to be looking at over time as this thing unfolds and as it develops bose george kbw analyst ok great thanks bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of rick shane with j p morgan please proceed with your question rick shane j p morgan analyst so a couple of things on the acquisition there was a question trying to dimensionalize the size of the acquisition and it sounds like de minimis book value plus the 10 5 million are we should we assume that consideration here is going to be 100 cash and then when we think about things on an eps basis you talked about 20 million of net income accretion i m assuming that you see this is eps accretive as well mary riskey chief financial officer sure good morning rick thanks for joining so on an eps basis we did disclose we expect incremental pre tax income to be approximately 20 million once our portfolio has fully transferred which on a per share after tax basis would be 0 45 accretive and i m sorry what was the first part of your question rick shane j p morgan analyst consideration and again the eps accretion makes a lot of sense so it sounds like the book value is de minimis so it s a relatively small acquisition price for 20 million of pre tax mary riskey chief financial officer yes you can expect that will be a cash cash bridges rick shane j p morgan analyst got it and then when we think about the p l on a go forward basis a servicing platform certainly brings on some additional operating expenses so is there anything we need to consider there in terms of how much of an impact it will have on your opex side mary riskey chief financial officer so i actually think we will have let s see we will have some integration savings over time so we would expect our operating expense ratio to improve as we integrate common functions and obviously servicing expense will is what it is but on the opex side we would expect some integration savings rick shane j p morgan analyst got it and then look historically the plus and minus of being a servicer is that it is a business that doesn t scale particularly well but it is a business that at the same time has a very predictable stream of revenues and as a business that has historically relied upon outside servicing you ve been able to bulk up very quickly opportunistically do you lose that by taking on the scalability issues of owning your own servicing platform bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer well i mean yes and no i mean i would phrase it this way servicing is an integral core part of our strategy it s going to continue to be so and having made that decision then the best way to extract the most value from the assets and the platform is we decided is to have our own servicer right and so you re not going to see us and our experience has been our history has been not that we have moved our capital or moved our msr balances up and down 50 over any periods of time it s been steady or growing we expect that to continue and as long as that s going to be continuing then own your own servicer is going to be more efficient and more able for us to extract the value of the platform the borrower i mean all the ancillary opportunities that we see rick shane j p morgan analyst got it and then last question and this is for mary is there any reason so you use fair value accounting for your msr many of the servicers use lower cost or market is there any reason if you internalize your servicing that you need to change that accounting i just don t remember all the rules associated with this mary riskey chief financial officer no we will not change our accounting methodology for msr it will continue to be valued at or accounted at fair value rick shane j p morgan analyst ok thank you guys bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer thanks rick operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to bill greenberg for any closing comments bill greenberg president chief executive officer and chief investment officer i d just like to thank everyone for joining us

updated august 6 2022 at 7 40 pm et after weeks of negotiations to revive the core of their election year agenda senate democrats appear to be on the brink of passing a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion opening the senate floor for a rare saturday session majority leader chuck schumer d n y said no matter how long it takes the senate is going to stay in session to finish this bill the senate voted along party lines to begin formal debate on the floor saturday evening after debate concludes senators can introduce an unlimited number of amendments in what s known as a vote a rama also allowed during vote a rama is a call to have the entire text of the bill which is roughly 700 pages read aloud the process is expected to stretch into sunday before a vote on final passage three weeks ago the bill was all but dead when sen joe manchin d w va withheld his support citing concerns about adding to historically high inflation but just last week he and senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y announced an agreement much to the surprise of others in the senate manchin s concerns about inflation were placated by among others former treasury secretary larry summers a democrat who has previously been a critic of how his party has handled inflation summers and other economists have argued the bill will tamp down inflation but the congressional budget office estimates that it will have negligible impact on prices in the near term the legislation is a significant step forward for president biden s domestic agenda this bill is a gamechanger for working families and our economy biden said at an event at the white house friday i look forward to the senate taking up this legislation and passing it as soon as possible republicans are united against the bill arguing that the spending in it will make inflation worse and that the health provisions will hamper pharmaceutical innovation democrats have decided their first economic disaster justifies a second economic disaster the working people of this country feel very differently senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said on saturday but there is little his conference can do to stop the legislation the bill is getting passed through budget reconciliation which allows democrats to pass the bill with a simple majority in the evenly divided chamber and avoid the threat of a republican filibuster that applies to most legislation it also means each section of the bill needs to be reviewed by the senate parliamentarian to make sure it is actually legislation that will primarily impact the budget this review process is often referred to as the byrd bath named after the late west virginia sen robert byrd democrats said on saturday that the parliamentarian approved key elements of the bill on prescription drug pricing and clean energy one element that would compel drug companies to offer rebates if prescription prices outpaced inflation was limited in the process so that it would apply to patients on medicare but not private insurance still schumer said the bill remains mostly intact and can win the support of all 50 democrats democrats appear to have all 50 votes in their conference after sinema agreement late thursday night arizona sen kyrsten sinema said she would move forward with the legislation she was the last holdout on the bill and her support essentially means the senate has all 50 democratic votes needed to pass the bill to get on board sinema wanted the section of the bill that narrowed the carried interest tax loopholeto be removed the measure impacts how private equity is taxed and democrats say it would have brought in 14 billion what sinema wanted to add though brings in more revenue it s a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks schumer said friday he and progressive democrats were excited about that aspect of the bill which he says brings in roughly 74 billion what we added excites me and i think it excites all democrats and particularly progressives schumer said at a press conference friday i hate stock buybacks i think they re one of the most self serving things that corporate america does also added in is about 4 billion in drought resiliency put forward by senators catherine cortez masto d nev mark kelly d ariz and michael bennet d colo

jobs haven t slowed at all in response to federal reserve tightening this is a double edged sword added michael gapen chief us economist at bank of america noting that while the chance of a near term recession is lower the risk of a hard landing is rising david mericle chief us economist at goldman sachs said the report cleared up some ambiguity over the strength of wage growth in the us economy suggesting it was not easing as much as the fed might hope the overall message is that wage growth is going sideways at a rate that is probably a couple of percentage points stronger than what would be compatible with achieving 2 per cent inflation which is the fed s long held inflation target he said the fed has even further to go than we thought before today fed chairman jay powell is expected to lay out his latest thinking on the path of us interest rates and the central bank s strategy to bring down inflation at the annual jackson hole wyoming conference set for this month during his last press conference in july mr powell said another unusually large increase in interest rates in september could be appropriate but that decision had not been made it s one that we ll make based on the data we see and we re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting he said advertisement financial market moves may also be a factor in the fed s next step traders began pricing in expectations of higher interest rate increases after the jobs data predicting that rates will peak in march at 3 64 per cent compared with the 3 46 per cent expected before the report fed fund futures show the chances of a 0 75 percentage point increase in september have risen to 67 per cent versus 33 per cent on thursday although the strong jobs number increases pressure on the fed it was welcomed by the biden administration since it means a sharp economic downturn is less likely ahead of the november midterm elections it comes as congress is preparing to vote on a us700 billion 1 trillion package of measures designed to curb inflation by raising taxes on large corporations reducing the cost of prescription drugs and bringing down the budget deficit even though it would also boost spending on clean energy incentives in order to fight climate change this bill is a game changer for working families and our economy i look forward to the senate taking up this legislation and passing it as soon as possible biden said on friday financial times

sen ron wyden d ore speaks with reporters on capitol hill in washington saturday aug 6 2022 ap photo patrick semansky washington ap the senate parliamentarian on saturday dealt a blow to democrats plan for curbing drug prices but left the rest of their sprawling economic bill largely intact as party leaders prepared for first votes on a package containing many of president joe biden s top domestic goals elizabeth macdonough the chamber s nonpartisan rules arbiter said lawmakers must remove language imposing hefty penalties on drugmakers that boost their prices beyond inflation in the private insurance market those were the bill s chief pricing protections for the roughly 180 million people whose health coverage comes from private insurance either through work or bought on their own other major provisions were left intact including giving medicare the power to negotiate what it pays for pharmaceuticals for its 64 million elderly recipients a longtime goal for democrats penalties on manufacturers for exceeding inflation would apply to drugs sold to medicare and there is a 2 000 annual out of pocket cap on drug costs and free vaccines for medicare beneficiaries her rulings came as democrats planned to begin senate votes saturday on their wide ranging package addressing climate change energy health care costs taxes and even deficit reduction party leaders have said they believe they have the unity they will need to move the legislation through the 50 50 senate with vice president kamala harris tiebreaking vote and over solid republican opposition this is a major win for the american people senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y said of the bill which both parties are using in their election year campaigns to assign blame for the worst period of inflation in four decades and a sad commentary on the republican party as they actively fight provisions that lower costs for the american family in response senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said democrats are misreading the american people s outrage as a mandate for yet another reckless taxing and spending spree he said democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families yet a second time dropping penalties on drugmakers reduces incentives on pharmaceutical companies to restrain what they charge increasing costs for patients erasing that language will cut the 288 billion in 10 year savings that the democrats overall drug curbs were estimated to generate a reduction of perhaps tens of billions of dollars analysts have said schumer said macdonough s decision about the price cap for private insurance was one unfortunate ruling but he said the surviving drug pricing language represented a major victory for the american people and that the overall bill remains largely intact the ruling followed a 10 day period that saw democrats resurrect top components of biden s agenda that had seemed dead in rapid fire deals with democrats two most unpredictable senators first conservative joe manchin of west virginia then arizona centrist kyrsten sinema schumer pieced together a broad package that while a fraction of earlier larger versions that manchin derailed would give the party an achievement against the backdrop of this fall s congressional elections the parliamentarian also signed off on a fee on excess emissions of methane a powerful greenhouse gas contributor from oil and gas drilling she also let stand environmental grants to minority communities and other initiatives for reducing carbon emissions said senate environment and public works committee chairman thomas carper d del she approved a provision requiring union scale wages to be paid if energy efficiency projects are to qualify for tax credits and another that would limit electric vehicle tax credits to those cars and trucks assembled in the united states the overall measure faces unanimous republican opposition but assuming democrats fight off a nonstop vote a rama of amendments many designed by republicans to derail the measure they should be able to muscle the measure through the senate house passage could come when that chamber returns briefly from recess on friday what will vote a rama be like it will be like hell sen lindsey graham of south carolina the top republican on the senate budget committee said friday of the approaching gop amendments he said that in supporting the democratic bill manchin and sinema are empowering legislation that will make the average person s life more difficult by forcing up energy costs with tax increases and making it harder for companies to hire workers the bill offers spending and tax incentives for moving toward cleaner fuels and supporting coal with assistance for reducing carbon emissions expiring subsidies that help millions of people afford private insurance premiums would be extended for three years and there is 4 billion to help western states combat drought there would be a new 15 minimum tax on some corporations that earn over 1 billion annually but pay far less than the current 21 corporate tax there would also be a 1 tax on companies that buy back their own stock swapped in after sinema refused to support higher taxes on private equity firm executives and hedge fund managers the irs budget would be pumped up to strengthen its tax collections while the bill s final costs are still being determined it overall would spend more than 300 billion over 10 years to slow climate change which analysts say would be the country s largest investment in that effort and billions more on health care it would raise more than 700 billion in taxes and from government drug cost savings leaving about 300 billion for deficit reduction a modest bite out of projected 10 year shortfalls of many trillions of dollars democrats are using special procedures that would let them pass the measure without having to reach the 60 vote majority that legislation often needs in the senate it is the parliamentarian s job to decide whether parts of legislation must be dropped for violating those rules which include a requirement that provisions be

the russian sanctions appear to have had a significant impact on europe these severe consequences include inflation which is now at 8 after briefly reaching 10 humanitarian catastrophe global economic crisis implications of russian sanctions following russia s military operation in ukraine major western countries and blocs such as japan european union canada the united states the united kingdom and canada imposed various sanctions on russia these included restricting secondary trade in russian government bonds prohibiting interaction with russian banks barring exports of critical technology to russia freezing assets and prohibiting travel for elite russians these measures undoubtedly have global political and economic implications economic and financial sanctions imposed on russia will alter the international economic system with long term implications for how the global economy operates the russian economy is modest but the current sanctions could greatly impact the global economy it exports some of the world s most important commodities the negative effects of economic sanctions have been seen in various parts of the world posing new challenges the world is divided on how modern sanctions should be conceptualized and implemented the g7 has fully supported the us and eu sanctions against russia will the g7 leaders succeed in isolating russia and many western alliances and partner countries have joined the sanctions regime whereas several countries including china argentina south africa mexico indonesia turkey and serbia have stated that they do not presume such sanctions are necessary and will not participate in them many others have taken a neutral stance and have not joined the sanctions despite no official statement to the contrary the russia ukraine crisis and subsequent sanctions imposed by western countries pose a risk of disrupting commodity trade particularly exports of oil and gas commodities to europe as a significant risk there is an increase in the prices of key commodities which could lead to even higher global inflation and weaker global growth moreover global oil and natural gas prices rose sharply particularly in europe the united states and asia pacific in addition essential mineral and food commodity prices rose including nickel palladium neon wheat and corn these increases to some extent mirrored risk rather than existing sanctioning furthermore elevated commodity prices can dampen economic growth and if prolonged or aggravated will almost certainly result in accelerated high inflation in many countries particularly in europe sanctions such as those imposed on russia cause severe dysfunction by causing acute supply side disruptions in free markets besides that these sanctions encourage actors to abandon the common regulatory frameworks and payment systems that support global free markets notably in energy markets the united states the united kingdom and the european union s decisions to ban phase out or significantly reduce russian oil and gas imports have raised energy prices and have a significant impact on global price stability forcing central banks to maintain restrictive monetary policies and delaying the recovery of a global economy still floundering from the ramifications of the pandemic the russian sanctions appear to have had a significant impact on europe these severe consequences include inflation which is now at 8 after briefly reaching 10 food price increases and energy price increases sanctions caused inflation which can be devastating for ordinary people effectively punishing them for the actions of their leaders significantly due to globalization and interconnectedness these sanctions are also likely to have significant ramifications for global welfare affecting not only the livelihoods of ordinary russians but also those of several of the world s most vulnerable people at least 5 5 million foreigners live in russia most from central asia and eastern europe these workers send billions back to their home countries moreover remittances from russia account for up to a third of the gdp of the central asian countries therefore the ruble s depreciation and the subsequent recession will almost certainly result in a humanitarian catastrophe for these groups the sanctions ripple effects particularly for the global south and the developing world have increased calls for a path forward that allows for a diplomatic solution and the cessation of sanctions while there are still several geopolitical uncertainties the negative fallout from economic sanctions and countersanctions signifies some trends that are likely to reshape the geo economic landscape the global economy will suffer long term consequences as tight energy markets become more strained supply upheavals to food commodities exacerbate food insecurity in the developing world globalized trade reduces and inflation rises in addition the devastation caused by eu sanctions on various sectors of the global economy and security is becoming increasingly clear most importantly given russia s significant role as a commodities exporter the inflationary effects of imposed sanctions extend beyond the target country to the global economy and the billions of people whose well being is dependent on the smooth operation of free markets if not carefully crafted economic hostility against russia could harm underprivileged people worldwide and cause long term damage to the global economy hence western policymakers must ensure the integrity and stability of the global economy sanctions against russia should not undermine the foundations of global prosperity or jeopardize the livelihoods of vulnerable people worldwide noema luthra butler kalish 2022

failed and more than 200 of starbucks 9 000 u s stores have unionized a lot of it is concentrated amongst young workers sometimes college educated young workers often working in sort of low paying service sector jobs overworked underpaid overeducated workers logan said he said their level of enthusiasm is causing a rush of panic elsewhere in the corporate world the ceos of all of these big companies are horrified by what happened at starbucks and they re thinking this is what we want to avoid at all costs logan said cnbc talked to workers inside the unions forming at starbucks and apple about why the movements are gaining traction now it has to do with the pandemic said laura garza a barista who helped organize her new york city based starbucks location which voted to unionize in april it made a lot of workers that continued to work during the pandemic reevaluate what is most important to them and honestly it has to go to better pay livable wage for everybody in addition to the pandemic conditions numerous other factors have collided to create what labor experts call a perfect storm for organizing the u s has seen four decades of stagnant wages companies that already had healthy profits before the pandemic made even more money after lockdowns and there are lots of jobs available without enough applicants to fill them what s more the biden administration is pro union barbara haddock taylor baltimore sun tribune news service via getty images in may garza and organizers from amazon and other companies were invited to the white house to discuss their efforts with vice president kamala harris and secretary of labor marty walsh they heard some of our stories of fierce anti union busting not only from starbucks but from amazon garza said of her visit to the white house secretary walsh said in particular that starbucks should just come to the table with its partners and work together to collaborate starbucks criticized the visit and requested its own white house meeting which hasn t happened slower organizing at apple and google the union movement at apple stores is progressing at a slower pace the first union win among apple s 270 plus u s stores happened on june 18 when workers in towson maryland voted 65 to 33 to join the international association of machinists and aerospace workers no other stores have held a vote being part of a tech company this big it s very easy to be intimidated and come off as ungrateful which is something that we want to make known that we are not ungrateful said tyra reeder a technical specialist at the towson apple store we re doing this because we love our jobs we re doing this because we see longevity at apple three other stores have taken steps to unionize although one in atlanta withdrew its election petition in may that same month a memo was leaked showing apple s anti union talking points instructing store managers to tell workers they could lose benefits and career opportunities if they organized unfortunately these union busting campaigns do have an impact and they can scare people said sara steffens secretary treasurer of communications workers of america which has about 700 000 members and so in atlanta the apple workers decided not to try to go for an election right at this moment cwa helped organize the atlanta apple store as well as workers at google in march google fiber contractors in kansas city held an nlrb election becoming the first to officially unionize under what s known as the alphabet workers union nearly 1 000 other google workers have also signed cards to join the awu but because the employees haven t officially held an nlrb election their group is known as a minority union george frey reuters there s a lot of research that shows that most americans want unions steffens said they just don t want to go through this scary union busting process about two thirds of americans now say they support unions the highest approval rating since 1965 yet actual participation remains at a multi decade low hovering at 10 3 of the workforce in 2021 down from 10 8 in 2020 and 20 in 1983 according to the bureau of labor statistics at its peak in 1954 union membership was close to 35 although it s too soon to know official figures for 2022 the first three quarters of the fiscal year october 1 2021 through june 30 saw a 58 increase in official attempts to unionize and exceeded the total number of election petitions from the year before in the months that typically pass between when workers file for an election and when they actually vote big employers often spend millions of dollars on campaigns to dampen support for the union amazon for example spent 4 26 million on labor consultants in 2021 both apple and starbucks have retained littler mendelson the largest employer side labor law firm in the country that means they have similar talking points often referring to the union as a third party hungry for dues many people think well i don t want to be paying 100 a month to a union said diana furchtgott roth former chief economist for the u s department of labor that s why union representation has steadily declined here s 2 please shut up in may apple raised the starting pay for retail workers from 20 to 22 an hour a 45 jump from 2018 unionized workers are asking for 26 to 28 an hour i definitely think this was a tactic to kind of say hey guys here s 2 please shut up reeder said also in may apple s head of retail and human relations deirdre o brien put out a video to retail workers discouraging unionizing she also visited the towson store after it filed for a union election reeder said she viewed o brien s appearance as a union busting tactic or a scare tactic that s not something that i ve heard happening at our store ever reeder said somebody of that much stature unannounced walking through our store after we do something like unionize apple declined to comment on the allegations and told cnbc in a statement that it offers very strong compensation and benefits for full time and part time employees including health care tuition reimbursement new parental leave paid family leave annual stock grants and many other benefits at starbucks former ceo howard schultz came back to run the coffee chain in april and brought with him a history of union opposition he spent his early weeks visiting multiple stores for collaborative sessions with baristas starbucks has said it plans to bargain in good faith a month after schultz s return workers united filed more than 250 unfair labor practice charges claiming starbucks engaged in surveillance fired workers and closed a store in ithaca new york in retaliation for voting to unionize then in june a federal judge in arizona ruled in favor of starbucks after three pro union workers claimed they were wrongfully dismissed starbucks a starbucks spokesperson told cnbc via email claims of anti union activity are categorically false we respect our partners rights to organize and are following nlrb rules to ensure all partners are informed about the process garza said in june that more than two months after her starbucks reserve location voted to unionize that the mood was still very tense and a lot of partners still do not feel safe from being terminated and that goes for myself starbucks is known for providing extensive health care benefits to part time baristas including coverage for some expensive treatments like in vitro fertilization that are often not covered at service jobs in may starbucks announced wage raises and increased training but only for stores that haven t unionized logan the labor professor said starbucks reputation for being a progressive employer has helped fuel the union movement they attract particular kinds of employees who share those progressive values and often their customers share those progressive values he said so in a sense starbucks has hired exactly the type of employee that s making the union drive so successful and so dynamic garza called the company s behavior puzzling it s very surprising that starbucks is fighting this because the reason that we all joined starbucks is because of its image as a progressive company she said google has also been accused of fighting back the nlrb found that the company arguably violated labor law when it fired employees for speaking up the google fiber contractors faced additional anti union messaging in a letter from the contractor which said everyone will be stuck with the union and forced to pay dues google told cnbc in a statement that employees are treated the same regardless of whether they re in a union our employees have protected labor rights that we support and we ve long had contracts with both union and non union vendors the company said what unionized workers want workers in unions make on average 16 6 more than nonunion workers amounting to almost 200 per week if unions weren t effective for workers companies wouldn t fight them so hard said steffans of cwa they know that workers will make more money first and foremost when they organize and choose to join a union however there are better ways to get more money according to furchtgott roth the former labor department economist there are so many new jobs out there furchtgott roth said my message is there are people who would hire you on a different schedule and probably at a higher rate of pay she also said the union model isn t great for retail because the high turnover rates mean that people who never voted to organize are going to be having the dues taken out of their paychecks but workers are looking at how well their employers are performing and wondering why they re not getting rewarded equally for example google parent alphabet recorded its fastest revenue growth rate since 2007 last year apple s margin has been steadily rising and the company closed 2021 with its biggest quarter ever for sales at almost 124 billion i don t think people realize how much money that is reeder said i mean for the amount of training we do and the amount of help that we provide and services that we provide customers our current pay is not cutting it in addition to higher pay apple store workers are asking for more time to spend with each customer and better opportunities for career advancement like moving into corporate jobs my job is not just being a technical specialist reeder said i m a marriage counselor i m a therapist i m a punching bag sometimes we are the line of defense for apple and even being technically retail we re very skilled workers we go through a lot of training sometimes you just don t feel as valued as we should at starbucks unionized baristas want a boost to the current starting salary of 15 per hour more staffing where it s needed and more say over their schedules they also want better benefits we re going to be asking for more comprehensive mental health benefits as well because working during a pandemic has been enormously stressful garza said whether the organizing momentum spreads more widely across the economy may depend on how vocal and successful workers are at starbucks apple and elsewhere i hope that we can be a resource and then motivation for these other stores to unionize reeder said stand your ground make your voice heard whether they want to listen or not now they have to

senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian elizabeth macdonough who referees questions about the chamber s procedures said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under special procedures that will let democrats pass their bill by simple majority without the usual 60 vote margin its provisions must be focused more on dollar and cents budget numbers than policy changes related mark cuban backed online pharmacy promises to slash prescription drug prices but the thrust of their pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients penalizing manufacturers for exceeding inflation for pharmaceuticals sold to medicare and limiting beneficiaries out of pocket drug costs to 2 000 annually the bill also caps medicare patients costs for insulin the expensive diabetes medication at 35 monthly democrats wanted to extend the 35 cap to private insurers but it ran afoul of senate rules most republicans voted to strip it from the package though in a sign of the political potency of health costs seven gop senators joined democrats trying to preserve it the measure s final costs were being recalculated to reflect late changes but overall it would raise more than 700 billion over a decade the money would come from a 15 minimum tax on a handful of corporations with yearly

by richard cowan and makini brice washington the u s senate on saturday began debating a democratic bill to address key elements of president joe biden s agenda tackling climate change lowering the costs of medication for the elderly and energy while forcing corporations and the wealthy to pay more taxes the debate began after the senate voted 51 50 to move ahead with the legislation vice president kamala harris broke a tie vote with all 50 republicans in opposition the senate was set to debate the bill for up to 20 hours before diving into an arduous time consuming amendment process called a vote a rama democrats and republicans were poised to reject each other s amendments as senate majority leader chuck schumer maneuvered to keep a his 50 member caucus united behind a bill that was negotiated over several months if even one democrat were to peel off the entire effort would be doomed in the evenly split 50 50 senate earlier in the day the senate parliamentarian determined that the lion s share of the healthcare provisions in the 430 billion bill could be passed with only a simple majority bypassing a filibuster rule requiring 60 votes in the 100 seat chamber to advance most legislation and enabling democrats to pass it over republican objections democrats hope that the legislation will give a boost to their candidates in the nov 8 midterm elections in which biden s party is in an uphill battle to retain its narrow control of the senate and house of representatives the democrats cast the legislation as a vehicle to combat inflation a prime concern of u s voters this year the bill when passed will meet all of our goals fighting climate change lowering healthcare costs closing tax loopholes abused by the wealthy and reducing the deficit schumer said in a senate speech there are three main parts to the bill s tax provisions a 15 minimum tax on corporations and the closing of loopholes that the wealthy can use to avoid paying taxes tougher irs enforcement and a new excise tax on stock buybacks the legislation has 430 billion in new spending along with raising more than 740 billion in new revenues democrats have said the legislation by 2030 would result in a 40 reduction in u s carbon emissions blamed for climate change price fixing the measure also would allow the medicare government health insurance program for the elderly to begin negotiating in 2026 with the pharmaceutical industry over prices on a limited number of prescription drug prices as a way of reducing costs it also would place a 2 000 per year cap on out of pocket medication costs under a medicare drug program senate republican leader mitch mcconnell attacked the provision involving negotiating drug prices comparing it to past price fixing attempts by countries such as cuba venezuela and the former soviet union their policy would bring about a world where many fewer new drugs and treatments get invented in the first place as companies cut back on r d mcconnell said in a floor speech referring to research and development while senators debated the policies embedded in the bill its political ramifications also were on display in a speech at the conservative political action conference cpac on saturday former president donald trump predicted fallout for kyrsten sinema and joe manchin two key democratic senators if this deal passes they are both going to lose their next elections but manchin and sinema are not up for re election until 2024 and many of the provisions of the bill are popular with voters the legislation is a scaled down version of a far broader more expensive measure that many democrats on the party s left had hoped to approve last year that measure stalled when manchin a centrist balked complaining that it would exacerbate inflationary pressures the bill calls for billions of dollars to encourage the production of more electric vehicles and foster clean energy though automakers say sourcing rules will sharply limit how many electric vehicles qualify for tax credits it also would set 4 billion in new federal drought relief funds a provision that could help the re election campaigns of democratic senators catherine cortez masto in nevada and mark kelly in arizona one provision cut from the bill would have forced drug companies to refund money to both government and private health plans if drug prices rise more quickly than inflation independent senator bernie sanders a leading progressive has criticized the bill for failing to go far enough and said he planned to offer amendments that would revive a series of social programs he pushed last year including broadening the number of prescription drugs medicare could negotiate prices on and providing government subsidized dental vision and hearing aid his amendments were expected to fail republicans have signaled that they will offer amendments touching on other issues including controlling immigrants coming across the u s border with mexico

washington ap a divided senate voted saturday to start debating democrats election year economic bill boosting the sprawling collection of president joe biden s priorities on climate energy health and taxes past its initial test as it starts moving through congress in a preview of votes expected on a mountain of amendments united democrats pushed the legislation through the evenly divided chamber by 51 50 with vice president kamala harris breaking the tie and overcoming unanimous republican opposition the package a dwindled version of earlier multitrillion dollar measures that democrats failed to advance has become a partisan battleground over inflation gasoline prices and other issues that polls show are driving voters the house where democrats have a slender majority could give it final approval next friday when lawmakers plan to return to washington the vote came after the senate parliamentarian gave a thumbs up to most of democrats revised 755 page bill but elizabeth macdonough the chamber s nonpartisan rules arbiter said democrats had to drop a significant part of their plan for curbing drug prices macdonough said democrats violated senate budget rules with language imposing hefty penalties on drug makers who boost their prices beyond inflation in the private insurance market those were the bill s chief pricing protections for the roughly 180 million people whose health coverage comes from private insurance either through work or bought on their own other pharmaceutical provisions were left intact including giving medicare the power to negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients a longtime democratic aspiration penalties on manufacturers for exceeding inflation would apply to drugs sold to medicare and there is a 2 000 annual out of pocket cap on drug costs and free vaccines for medicare beneficiaries the time is now to move forward with a big bold package for the american people said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y this historic bill will reduce inflation lower costs fight climate change it s time to move this nation forward senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said democrats are misreading the american people s outrage as a mandate for yet another reckless taxing and spending spree he said democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families yet a second time saturday s vote capped a startling 10 day period that saw democrats resurrect top components of biden s agenda that had seemed dead in rapid fire deals with democrats two most unpredictable senators first conservative joe manchin of west virginia then arizona centrist kyrsten sinema schumer pieced together a package that would give the party an achievement against the backdrop of this fall s congressional elections a white house statement said the legislation would help tackle today s most pressing economic challenges make our economy stronger for decades to come and position the united states to be the world s leader in clean energy assuming democrats fight off a nonstop vote a rama of amendments many designed by republicans to derail the measure they should be able to muscle the measure through the senate what will vote a rama be like it will be like hell sen lindsey graham of south carolina the top republican on the senate budget committee said of the approaching gop amendments he said that in supporting the democratic bill manchin and sinema are empowering legislation that will make the average person s life more difficult by forcing up energy costs with tax increases and making it harder for companies to hire workers the bill offers spending and tax incentives favored by progressives for buying electric vehicles and making buildings more energy efficient but in a bow to manchin whose state is a leading fossil fuel producer there is also money to reduce coal plant carbon emissions and language requiring the government to open more federal land and waters to oil drilling expiring subsidies that help millions of people afford private insurance premiums would be extended for three years and there is 4 billion to help western states combat drought a new provision would create a 35 monthly cap for insulin the expensive diabetes medication for medicare and private insurance patients starting next year it seemed possible that language could be weakened or removed during debate reflecting democrats calls for tax equity there would be a new 15 minimum tax on some corporations that earn over 1 billion annually but pay far less than the current 21 corporate tax companies buying back their own stock would be taxed 1 for those transactions swapped in after sinema refused to support higher taxes on private equity firm executives and hedge fund managers the irs budget would be pumped up to strengthen its tax collections while the bill s final costs are still being determined it overall would spend close to 400 billion over 10 years to slow climate change which analysts say would be the country s largest investment in that effort and billions more on health care it would raise more than 700 billion in taxes and from government drug cost savings leaving about 300 billion for deficit reduction over the coming decade a blip compared to that period s projected 16 trillion in budget shortfalls democrats are using special procedures that would let them pass the measure without having to reach the 60 vote majority that legislation often needs in the senate the parliamentarian decides whether parts of legislation must be dropped for violating those rules which include a requirement that provisions be chiefly aimed at affecting the federal budget not imposing new policy ___ associated press writer matthew daly contributed to this report

washington u s senate democrats on saturday were set to push ahead on a bill that would address key elements of president joe biden s agenda tackling climate change lowering the cost of energy and elderly people s medications and forcing some corporations and wealthy americans to pay more taxes the senate parliamentarian determined that the lion s share of the healthcare provisions in the 430 billion bill could be passed with only a simple majority bypassing a filibuster rule requiring 60 votes in the 100 seat chamber to advance most legislation and enabling democrats to pass it over republican objections majority leader chuck schumer said in a statement the senate began its rare weekend session at around noon saturday will kick off an arduous process that could extend into early next week with senators offering amendment after amendment in a time consuming vote a rama democrats hope that the legislation will give a boost to their candidates in the nov 8 midterm elections in which biden s party is in an uphill battle to retain its narrow control of the senate and house of representatives the democrats cast the legislation as a vehicle to combat inflation a prime concern of u s voters this year democrats have received extremely good news schumer said in the statement medicare will finally be allowed to negotiate drug prices this is a major victory for the american people advertisement medicare is the government health insurance program for the elderly and certain americans with disabilities there are three main parts to the tax provisions in the bill a 15 minimum tax on corporations and the closing of loopholes that the wealthy can use to avoid paying taxes tougher irs enforcement and a new excise tax on stock buybacks the legislation has 430 billion in new spending along with raising more than 740 billion in new revenues beside billions of dollars to encourage the production and purchase of more electric vehicles and foster clean energy the bill would set 4 billion in new federal drought relief funds the latter is a move that could help the re election campaigns of democratic senators catherine cortez masto in nevada and mark kelly in arizona senator tom carper the chairman of the senate committee on the environment and public works said climate provisions including the methane emissions reduction program were approved by the senate parliamentarian republicans have promised to do everything they can to stall or block the bill with senator lindsey graham on friday calling the democratic backed legislation this jihad they re on to tax and spend democrats aim to push the bill through the senate using an arcane and complicated reconciliation procedure allowing passage without any republican support in the chamber divided 50 50 between the parties with the democrats in control because vice president kamala harris can cast a tie breaking vote one provision cut from the bill would have forced drug companies to refund money to both government and private health plans if drug prices rise more quickly than inflation the parliamentarian ruled that measure could not apply to private industry advertisement senators on the left such as bernie sanders are likely to try to expand the scope of the bill to include new programs such as federal subsidies for childcare or home healthcare for the elderly republicans have signaled that they will offer plenty of amendments touching on another issue immigrants coming across the u s border with mexico several democratic senators said they would vote against all amendments fearing that these could make a delicately negotiated deal unravel i will vote no on all amendments even for stuff i like democratic senator brian schatz wrote on twitter i can think of lots of ways to strengthen it but i won t derail this bill by supporting changes reporting by richard cowan and makini brice additional reporting by valerie volcovici editing by will dunham and scott malone more nation world coverage
washington ap a divided senate voted saturday to start debating democrats election year economic bill boosting the sprawling collection of president joe biden s priorities on climate energy health and taxes past its initial test as it starts moving through congress in a preview of votes expected on a mountain of amendments united democrats pushed the legislation through the evenly divided chamber by 51 50 with vice president kamala harris breaking the tie and overcoming unanimous republican opposition the package a dwindled version of earlier multitrillion dollar measures that democrats failed to advance has become a partisan battleground over inflation gasoline prices and other issues that polls show are driving voters the house where democrats have a slender majority could give it final approval next friday when lawmakers plan to return to washington the vote came after the senate parliamentarian gave a thumbs up to most of democrats revised 755 page bill but elizabeth macdonough the chamber s nonpartisan rules arbiter said democrats had to drop a significant part of their plan for curbing drug prices macdonough said democrats violated senate budget rules with language imposing hefty penalties on drug makers who boost their prices beyond inflation in the private insurance market those were the bill s chief pricing protections for the roughly 180 million people whose health coverage comes from private insurance either through work or bought on their own other pharmaceutical provisions were left intact including giving medicare the power to negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients a longtime democratic aspiration penalties on manufacturers for exceeding inflation would apply to drugs sold to medicare and there is a 2 000 annual out of pocket cap on drug costs and free vaccines for medicare beneficiaries the time is now to move forward with a big bold package for the american people said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y this historic bill will reduce inflation lower costs fight climate change it s time to move this nation forward senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said democrats are misreading the american people s outrage as a mandate for yet another reckless taxing and spending spree he said democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families yet a second time saturday s vote capped a startling 10 day period that saw democrats resurrect top components of biden s agenda that had seemed dead in rapid fire deals with democrats two most unpredictable senators first conservative joe manchin of west virginia then arizona centrist kyrsten sinema schumer pieced together a package that would give the party an achievement against the backdrop of this fall s congressional elections a white house statement said the legislation would help tackle today s most pressing economic challenges make our economy stronger for decades to come and position the united states to be the world s leader in clean energy assuming democrats fight off a nonstop vote a rama of amendments many designed by republicans to derail the measure they should be able to muscle the measure through the senate what will vote a rama be like it will be like hell sen lindsey graham of south carolina the top republican on the senate budget committee said of the approaching gop amendments he said that in supporting the democratic bill manchin and sinema are empowering legislation that will make the average person s life more difficult by forcing up energy costs with tax increases and making it harder for companies to hire workers the bill offers spending and tax incentives favored by progressives for buying electric vehicles and making buildings more energy efficient but in a bow to manchin whose state is a leading fossil fuel producer there is also money to reduce coal plant carbon emissions and language requiring the government to open more federal land and waters to oil drilling expiring subsidies that help millions of people afford private insurance premiums would be extended for three years and there is 4 billion to help western states combat drought a new provision would create a 35 monthly cap for insulin the expensive diabetes medication for medicare and private insurance patients starting next year it seemed possible that language could be weakened or removed during debate reflecting democrats calls for tax equity there would be a new 15 minimum tax on some corporations that earn over 1 billion annually but pay far less than the current 21 corporate tax companies buying back their own stock would be taxed 1 for those transactions swapped in after sinema refused to support higher taxes on private equity firm executives and hedge fund managers the irs budget would be pumped up to strengthen its tax collections while the bill s final costs are still being determined it overall would spend close to 400 billion over 10 years to slow climate change which analysts say would be the country s largest investment in that effort and billions more on health care it would raise more than 700 billion in taxes and from government drug cost savings leaving about 300 billion for deficit reduction over the coming decade a blip compared to that period s projected 16 trillion in budget shortfalls democrats are using special procedures that would let them pass the measure without having to reach the 60 vote majority that legislation often needs in the senate the parliamentarian decides whether parts of legislation must be dropped for violating those rules which include a requirement that provisions be chiefly aimed at affecting the federal budget not imposing new policy ___ associated press writer matthew daly contributed to this report

charles smith jones looks at the many variants of the cz 452 rifle all of which come with a proven pedigree so take your pick birth of the cz 452 some time ago blast from the past looked at the venerable brno model 2 a real workhorse of a small bore rifle that started production in the 1950s rugged unpretentious and dependable the model 2 changed its name and was updated when brno rebranded to cz the cz 452 is much the same rifle but has evolved into a number of variants production finally ceased in 2011 when cz replaced the 452 with its newer 455 continuing to manufacture only one 452 model the american in a left hand version for a few more years similarities all of the 452 variants have common features such as a carbon steel barrel threaded into the receiver frame later production models feature hammer forged barrels a manufacturing process using the directed blows of a hammer or anvil to shape the metal receivers are machined with a dovetailed rail of either 11mm or 3 8 in depending on the variant and the cartridge to accommodate mounts for a telescopic sight and triggers are adjustable for the weight of pull all use an interchangeable detachable box magazine made of either metal or plastic with a five round or 10 round capacity an optional 25 round magazine as well as a single shot adapter was sometimes available for 22 lr and 17 hmr calibres mainstream 452s came in a variety of names such as standard lux and trainer but they were essentially similar they commonly featured a european style stock with schnabel fore end an arched hogback comb and a hard plastic butt plate in addition to the dovetail provision for a telescopic sight open tangent sights came fitted graduated in 25m increments out to 200m the lux with its walnut stock and chequered grip was at the high end of these and was chambered for 22 lr and 17 wmr with a left hand version in 22 lr only the trainer was produced as a cadet rifle and was identical except for having a beech stock the standard only differs in that the grip was not chequered the latter two models were chambered for 22 lr and 17 hmr the example featured here represents one of the more popular 452 variants the varmint although its original stock has been replaced with a post production laminated one with a thumbhole it would have left the factory with a varmint style straight comb stock made from walnut featuring a chequered grip flat bottomed fore end and rubber butt pad the remainder of the rifle is original though and this variant never came with open sights being specifically intended for use with a telescopic sight the 20½in barrel is heavy as you might expect of a varmint or target rifle it is straight tapered with a polished and blued finish which contrasts with the matt finish of the receiver models there was also an american variant so named for its straight comb stock styling it came with either a 16in or 22½in barrel some leaving the factory screw cut it was offered in the widest variety of chamberings and a left handed version was available the scout was a scaled down rifle intended for younger shooters while the silhouette and style with their synthetic stocks were pitched more towards use in shooting competitions there was even a carbine length fs full stock version with full length mannlicher style turkish walnut stock a limited production run of only 1 000 rifles occurred in 2017 to commemorate the 452 the grand finale is recognisable by its oil finished walnut stock hand engraving gold plated trigger and custom metal magazine floor plate whichever cz 452 you come across and the chances are that it will probably be one of the standard or american models or the heavy barrelled varmint pictured it will certainly be worth considering all of the 452 range are well made reliable and highly accurate rifles that come with a proven pedigree barrel wear is unlikely to be an issue especially in rifles chambered for 22 lr and left handed shooters should also find themselves catered for a cz 452 may cost a little more than an older brno model 2 but it will justify every penny spent tech specs
