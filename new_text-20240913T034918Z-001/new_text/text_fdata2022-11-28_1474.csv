as retail companies continue to struggle amazon continues to grow and it seems those inverse paths are meeting in the middle with the e commerce giant considering making fulfillment centers out of vacant mall space amazon has had discussions with simon property group the country s biggest mall owner about putting distribution centers in shuddered jc penney and sears stores per the wall street journal and although other types of businesses like gyms would bring more traffic to the malls in normal times cove in 19 is keeping those companies from expanding camille renshaw ceo of investment brokerage firm be any told the journal to replace department stores mall owners considered schools medical offices and senior living with the current pandemic industrial is the only thing left now amazon is expected to get a significant discount on rent from simon according to the hill advertisement jcpenney was once a shopping giant can it make a comeback share copy link copy related video above amazon making fulfillment centers out of vacant mall spacemarc rosen didn t flinch when he was offered the top job at jcpenney last year a stalwart of twentieth century retail for middle class americans seeking affordable clothing and home furnishings jcpenney has struggled for more than a decade and fell into bankruptcy shortly after the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 but rosen a retail veteran who previously worked at walmart and levi s said he did not have any personal hesitancy at all about trying to revitalize the 120 year old brand and protect jcpenney from extinction like barney s lord taylor century 21 and other shuttered retailers i believe in taking on large scale transformation rosen 54 told cnn business in a video interview this month there was an opportunity to really take this brand and make it relevant again rosen is staking his turnaround plan on appealing to america s diverse working families the typical customer at jcpenney has a median household income of between 50 000 to 75 000 roughly 30 of the retailer s customers are black indigenous and people of color according to the company a larger share than many competitorsso jcpenney is chasing these shoppers with an overhauled beauty strategy after a long partnership with sephora ended it has remodeled stores and added new major brands and private label clothing and home furnishings labels the company has also improved its technology and online experience to draw more online sales just a quarter of jcpenney s sales are online trailing rivals rosen said customers now are shopping at jcpenney more frequently the first time that has happened for the brand in years and it s regaining market share in key departments such as home goods jcpenney does not break out sales publicly but there are signs of pressure visits to all jcpenney stores were down 29 as of october from the same time a year ago according to data from placer ai in october traffic to jcpenney s website increased only 1 26 from a year ago according to data from similarweb now a year into rosen s tenure he faces his biggest test at jcpenney yet the holiday shopping stretch and it comes at an uncertain moment for the u s economy and shoppers the company said it s off to a strong start to the holiday season but jcpenney s main customers are feeling strained by the highest inflation in 40 years and they have shown signs of pulling back on discretionary goods the bulk of what jcpenney sells rosen also has to dig out from years of mismanagement and failed strategies at the company the company faces unrelenting pressure from much larger retailers such as amazon walmart and target tjx the owner of tjmaxx and marshalls and other off price retailers that have undercut the department stores model by selling designer brands at bargain prices the future is going to be a challenging one because it s difficult for department stores to navigate even under the best circumstances said erin schmidt a senior analyst at coresight research a retail advisory and research firm the competition is really fierce rise and falljcpenney started as the golden rule a dry goods store in kemmerer wyoming in 1902 its founder james cash penney quickly expanded the business and by 1917 there were 175 stores later renamed jcpenney by 1929 on the eve of the stock market crash and great depression jcpenney had 1 000 stores its stores were known for their low prices merchandise could be bought only with cash not on credit jcpenney survived the depression and by 1950 fortune magazine declared the company the king of soft goods penney himself became known as the man with a thousand partners by the time he died in 1971 jcpenney had more than 1 600 stores many in newly built suburban malls and was the fifth largest u s retailer but the company s mid market appeal was tested by growing competition during the 1980s and 1990s discount stores including walmart and target spread stealing away jcpenney s budget conscious customers the company was hit hard by the great recession in 2008 it lost shoppers to discount stores and struggled to bring them back as the economy began to rebound by the end of 2010 jcpenney s sales had fallen 10 from their 2006 high of about 20 billion and the company attracted the scrutiny of hedge fund manager bill ackman ackman bought up a chunk of penney and installed ron johnson apple s former head of stores as ceo without testing shoppers reactions first jcpenney under johnson changed its advertisements its logo and its store designs the chain ditched top private label brands with loyal followings and introduced new ones that had little relevance to its middle income customers and it ended coupons a move that alienated loyal shoppers jcpenney s sales plunged 4 3 billion in 2012 a 25 drop from the previous year johnson left in 2013 17 months into the job the company cycled through several ceos and strategies in the following years and brought back appliances for the first time in decades a move that didn t resonate with customers the company was unprofitable every year beginning in 2011 and its sales fell each year starting in 2015 in may of 2020 soon after the covid 19 pandemic began and jcpenney was forced to close stores temporarily the company filed for bankruptcy after 118 years in business at the time jcpenney had more than 800 stores and 85 000 employees turning around jcpenneyjcpenney has around 670 stores today and has little debt for the first time in years the company is owned by mall landlords simon property group and brookfield asset management the two firms rescued jcpenney out of bankruptcy for 1 75 billion in the fall of 2020 it was in their interest to do so jcpenney was a key tenant at hundreds of malls and a liquidation would have left vacancies in their shopping centers during the bankruptcy process jcpenney restructured its debt and closed more than 200 stores rosen said jcpenney now has the financial flexibility to invest in upgrading its technology supply chain and revamping stores under its new owners that alignment with ownership is critical especially as you re going through a transformation that requires significant investment he said instead of chasing new shoppers as several of rosen s predecessors tried to do he has built a strategy centered on convincing existing budget focused customers to visit more frequently and buy a wider array of goods at jcpenney instead of other stores the company is attempting to highlight merchandise and services like hair salons and family portrait offerings that resonate with its core working class families teachers are the number one profession among its customers so jcpenney has focused on ensuring stores have clothing they want to wear to work jcpenney s 14 year partnership with sephora ended in 2020 and it has started to replace many sephora shops with new beauty departments roughly 20 of the products in new beauty areas come from a partnership with thirteen lune an e commerce company that features brands started by founders of color customers want to see brands that are brought to them by brown and black founders and they want to see brands that look relevant to their skin types rosen said retail experts say that jcpenney is improving under rosen and his strategy to target different customers than competitors is shrewd stores are better lit than they were before the bankruptcy and top vendors are selling merchandise to the company again a lot of people in the industry wrote them off said david katz chief marketing officer at randa apparel accessories which makes levi s dockers haggar and other brands today they are a good partner we re giving them a lot more financial credit than we used to we are developing more products for them because we have confidence they ll be able to sell it effectively still jcpenney faces both short term challenges and long term questions about its survival inflation is squeezing customers particularly its middle income shoppers it s not the only retailer facing that problem kohl s said last week that its middle income customers are buying fewer items when they shop and switching to private brands rosen said that more jcpenney customers are buying the company s lowest priced products and switching to its cheaper private brands the company plans to offer some products at 2019 prices during the holidays including its st john s bay cable sweater the bigger question remains whether there is a place for jcpenney in the changing era of retail and if it can draw younger customers stiff competition has taken a toll on the entire department store landscape including kohl s nordstrom and macy s jcpenney can t solely rely on winning more business from existing shoppers with limited discretionary ability said schmidt from coresight the chain needs to attract new shoppers too but winning new customers has never been harder they re doing some really good things in terms of their positioning schmidt said but the department store is a tough place to be it will be a challenging road
in this aug 6 2015 file photo for illustration purposes only a prairie dog barks at it s new colony after being trucked some 25 miles away from cedar city utah associated press file photo by rick bowmer st george news st george the utah division of wildlife resources is recommending a few updates to the rules regarding utah prairie dogs which would go into effect if they are delisted under the endangered species act as well as a few changes to bear hunting and furbearer seasons according to a press release issued this week the division is seeking the public s feedback on the proposals amendments to rule regarding utah prairie dogs the utah prairie dog has been listed under the endangered species act since 1973 several things contributed to the decline of the species but unregulated poisoning was the primary threat utah has three species of prairie dogs but the utah prairie dogs are only found in the southwestern part of the state extensive research monitoring and conservation efforts by federal and state agencies and others have been in effect since 1973 to help the species recover in addition to other conservation efforts the dwr does monitoring each spring to determine the population of utah prairie dogs in washington iron and kane counties over each of the past three years utah prairie dog populations were nearly 3 times the number counted in 1971 long term data shows that the range wide population of the utah prairie dog has been stable or increasing over the last three decades as a result the dwr maintains that the utah prairie dog should be federally delisted and removed from the endangered species act the dwr will continue to manage prairie dogs under the utah prairie dog conservation strategy which will be in place for the foreseeable future with periodic reviews the plan will continue to manage the population through ongoing monitoring while also helping to address concerns and conflicts with private landowners due to possible damage dwr mammal conservation coordinator kim hersey said in the news release hersey said they are proposing to make a few changes to the current rule regarding the removal of prairie dogs in situations where there are conflicts while still maintaining a healthy population and ongoing conservation efforts these changes would go into effect if the utah prairie dog is delisted and would allow for regulated control for prairie dogs that are causing damage for private landowners hersey said we would distribute agricultural control permits through a tiered system and would allow prairie dog removal for human health and safety some of those ongoing conservation efforts will include continuing to monitor how the populations are doing during annual spring counts continuing to work to prevent disease by using insecticidal dust on their burrows to kill plague carrying fleas advancing and implementing other plague control methods continuing to translocate utah prairie dogs from areas where there are conflicts with private landowners onto public land in an effort to reestablish or supplement colonies maintain genetic diversity and or decrease disease risks requiring surveys prior to development of an area and translocating prairie dogs from those development areas to public lands with suitable habitat working to establish prairie dog colonies on higher elevation areas with greater precipitation so the animals aren t as impacted by drought removing predators from areas with small vulnerable colonies working with federal local and nonprofit partners we feel secure that the future for the utah prairie dog continues to be bright hersey added utah black bear management plan and 2023 recommendations 2023 will begin the second year of a three year recommendation cycle for black bear hunting as a result the dwr is not currently recommending any changes to permit numbers or harvest objectives for black bears however the utah black bear management plan will expire next year so the dwr put together a committee of various stakeholders and organizations to help make recommendations to update the management plan a few changes to the black bear management plan were proposed including giving the district biologist more flexibility to take into account bear populations on surrounding hunting units the dwr is also recommending some rule changes regarding bear hunting including allowing a hunter with a valid bait permit to hunt over another hunters bait site with written permission from the cor holder allowing the use of a single metal container with a maximum size of 55 gallons to be used for bait if securely attached at the bait site prohibiting the use of chocolate or cocoa as bait since chocolate cocoa can have properties that can be toxic to animals requiring bait sites to comply with all dwr rules but that the dwr will not review locations and approve them before a cor is issued eliminating the mandatory orientation course but instead provide educational materials to permit holders with their mailed permits the dwr is also proposing a few changes to the season dates for using hounds for hunting bears and season dates for using bait the dwr is proposing to eliminate the fall bait seasons so they don t overlap with hound seasons as it s illegal to use both bait and hounds on a bear hunt the only season that would allow bait would be the spring season which runs from may 30 to june 30 2023 other recommendations the dwr is also proposing to keep the bobcat permit numbers and season dates the same in 2022 23 as they were this year allowing six permits per individual no total permit cap and the season running from nov 16 2023 through march 1 2024 the proposed season dates for the other furbearer species are beaver and mink sept 16 2023 to april 1 2024 marten badger gray fox kit fox ringtail spotted skunk and weasel sept 16 2023 to march 1 2024 the dwr is also recommending that a few areas be closed to beaver trapping to help facilitate some beaver introductions in the areas to help with habitat projects three mile creek garfield county and reservoir canyon washington county give feedback the public meetings for the recommendations

to reopen around april next year after the national people s congress takes place but there s a chance that authorities reopen earlier due to difficulties in keeping covid cases under control according to goldman sachs chief china economist hui shan said there s a 60 chance of the former scenario taking place there is also a 30 probability of earlier reopening precisely because of the difficulty in keeping covid under control and the lack of medical preparation suggests it could be quite a messy process she said medical preparation is not ready yet whereas the virus has evolved in such a way it s getting very costly to continue to implement that dynamic zero covid policy she said she said that policymakers need to weigh out the costs and benefits of the stringent covid

as retail companies continue to struggle amazon continues to grow and it seems those inverse paths are meeting in the middle with the e commerce giant considering making fulfillment centers out of vacant mall space amazon has had discussions with simon property group the country s biggest mall owner about putting distribution centers in shuddered jc penney and sears stores per the wall street journal and although other types of businesses like gyms would bring more traffic to the malls in normal times cove in 19 is keeping those companies from expanding camille renshaw ceo of investment brokerage firm be any told the journal to replace department stores mall owners considered schools medical offices and senior living with the current pandemic industrial is the only thing left now amazon is expected to get a significant discount on rent from simon according to the hill advertisement jcpenney was once a shopping giant can it make a comeback share copy link copy related video above amazon making fulfillment centers out of vacant mall spacemarc rosen didn t flinch when he was offered the top job at jcpenney last year a stalwart of twentieth century retail for middle class americans seeking affordable clothing and home furnishings jcpenney has struggled for more than a decade and fell into bankruptcy shortly after the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 but rosen a retail veteran who previously worked at walmart and levi s said he did not have any personal hesitancy at all about trying to revitalize the 120 year old brand and protect jcpenney from extinction like barney s lord taylor century 21 and other shuttered retailers i believe in taking on large scale transformation rosen 54 told cnn business in a video interview this month there was an opportunity to really take this brand and make it relevant again rosen is staking his turnaround plan on appealing to america s diverse working families the typical customer at jcpenney has a median household income of between 50 000 to 75 000 roughly 30 of the retailer s customers are black indigenous and people of color according to the company a larger share than many competitorsso jcpenney is chasing these shoppers with an overhauled beauty strategy after a long partnership with sephora ended it has remodeled stores and added new major brands and private label clothing and home furnishings labels the company has also improved its technology and online experience to draw more online sales just a quarter of jcpenney s sales are online trailing rivals rosen said customers now are shopping at jcpenney more frequently the first time that has happened for the brand in years and it s regaining market share in key departments such as home goods jcpenney does not break out sales publicly but there are signs of pressure visits to all jcpenney stores were down 29 as of october from the same time a year ago according to data from placer ai in october traffic to jcpenney s website increased only 1 26 from a year ago according to data from similarweb now a year into rosen s tenure he faces his biggest test at jcpenney yet the holiday shopping stretch and it comes at an uncertain moment for the u s economy and shoppers the company said it s off to a strong start to the holiday season but jcpenney s main customers are feeling strained by the highest inflation in 40 years and they have shown signs of pulling back on discretionary goods the bulk of what jcpenney sells rosen also has to dig out from years of mismanagement and failed strategies at the company the company faces unrelenting pressure from much larger retailers such as amazon walmart and target tjx the owner of tjmaxx and marshalls and other off price retailers that have undercut the department stores model by selling designer brands at bargain prices the future is going to be a challenging one because it s difficult for department stores to navigate even under the best circumstances said erin schmidt a senior analyst at coresight research a retail advisory and research firm the competition is really fierce rise and falljcpenney started as the golden rule a dry goods store in kemmerer wyoming in 1902 its founder james cash penney quickly expanded the business and by 1917 there were 175 stores later renamed jcpenney by 1929 on the eve of the stock market crash and great depression jcpenney had 1 000 stores its stores were known for their low prices merchandise could be bought only with cash not on credit jcpenney survived the depression and by 1950 fortune magazine declared the company the king of soft goods penney himself became known as the man with a thousand partners by the time he died in 1971 jcpenney had more than 1 600 stores many in newly built suburban malls and was the fifth largest u s retailer but the company s mid market appeal was tested by growing competition during the 1980s and 1990s discount stores including walmart and target spread stealing away jcpenney s budget conscious customers the company was hit hard by the great recession in 2008 it lost shoppers to discount stores and struggled to bring them back as the economy began to rebound by the end of 2010 jcpenney s sales had fallen 10 from their 2006 high of about 20 billion and the company attracted the scrutiny of hedge fund manager bill ackman ackman bought up a chunk of penney and installed ron johnson apple s former head of stores as ceo without testing shoppers reactions first jcpenney under johnson changed its advertisements its logo and its store designs the chain ditched top private label brands with loyal followings and introduced new ones that had little relevance to its middle income customers and it ended coupons a move that alienated loyal shoppers jcpenney s sales plunged 4 3 billion in 2012 a 25 drop from the previous year johnson left in 2013 17 months into the job the company cycled through several ceos and strategies in the following years and brought back appliances for the first time in decades a move that didn t resonate with customers the company was unprofitable every year beginning in 2011 and its sales fell each year starting in 2015 in may of 2020 soon after the covid 19 pandemic began and jcpenney was forced to close stores temporarily the company filed for bankruptcy after 118 years in business at the time jcpenney had more than 800 stores and 85 000 employees turning around jcpenneyjcpenney has around 670 stores today and has little debt for the first time in years the company is owned by mall landlords simon property group and brookfield asset management the two firms rescued jcpenney out of bankruptcy for 1 75 billion in the fall of 2020 it was in their interest to do so jcpenney was a key tenant at hundreds of malls and a liquidation would have left vacancies in their shopping centers during the bankruptcy process jcpenney restructured its debt and closed more than 200 stores rosen said jcpenney now has the financial flexibility to invest in upgrading its technology supply chain and revamping stores under its new owners that alignment with ownership is critical especially as you re going through a transformation that requires significant investment he said instead of chasing new shoppers as several of rosen s predecessors tried to do he has built a strategy centered on convincing existing budget focused customers to visit more frequently and buy a wider array of goods at jcpenney instead of other stores the company is attempting to highlight merchandise and services like hair salons and family portrait offerings that resonate with its core working class families teachers are the number one profession among its customers so jcpenney has focused on ensuring stores have clothing they want to wear to work jcpenney s 14 year partnership with sephora ended in 2020 and it has started to replace many sephora shops with new beauty departments roughly 20 of the products in new beauty areas come from a partnership with thirteen lune an e commerce company that features brands started by founders of color customers want to see brands that are brought to them by brown and black founders and they want to see brands that look relevant to their skin types rosen said retail experts say that jcpenney is improving under rosen and his strategy to target different customers than competitors is shrewd stores are better lit than they were before the bankruptcy and top vendors are selling merchandise to the company again a lot of people in the industry wrote them off said david katz chief marketing officer at randa apparel accessories which makes levi s dockers haggar and other brands today they are a good partner we re giving them a lot more financial credit than we used to we are developing more products for them because we have confidence they ll be able to sell it effectively still jcpenney faces both short term challenges and long term questions about its survival inflation is squeezing customers particularly its middle income shoppers it s not the only retailer facing that problem kohl s said last week that its middle income customers are buying fewer items when they shop and switching to private brands rosen said that more jcpenney customers are buying the company s lowest priced products and switching to its cheaper private brands the company plans to offer some products at 2019 prices during the holidays including its st john s bay cable sweater the bigger question remains whether there is a place for jcpenney in the changing era of retail and if it can draw younger customers stiff competition has taken a toll on the entire department store landscape including kohl s nordstrom and macy s jcpenney can t solely rely on winning more business from existing shoppers with limited discretionary ability said schmidt from coresight the chain needs to attract new shoppers too but winning new customers has never been harder they re doing some really good things in terms of their positioning schmidt said but the department store is a tough place to be it will be a challenging road

in haiti announced a resurgence of cholera cases after the last epidemic which was declared in 2010 killed more than 10 000 people affected at least 800 000 and continued until 2019 the ministry said on 4 november that the suspected number of cholera cases across haiti was 5 800 and that the number is forecast to increase dramatically to 100 cases per day within the next three months dieudonne leroy goal s head of security said that they are actively liaising with the irish team in the united nations to find a solution and warned that any expectation of establishing political stability is hopeless given the humanitarian crisis in his comments to the journal paul d anglejan goal country director in haiti said that while the gang violence has made it very difficult his teams are working with local groups to bring aid to the most affected areas bernard mccaul goal s regional co ordinator has outlined the response to the cholera outbreak as his team delivers specific assistance to fight the disease as previously reported by the journal the haitian capital has descended into heavily armed marauding gangs terrorising the local population in pitched battles against government forces the port had been barricaded halting much needed fuel and food supplies which has resulted in a major humanitarian crisis on the island nation such is the catastrophic descent that irish diplomats based at the un security council have found themselves at the centre of a major push towards a military intervention on the ground aid agencies have come under attack and it is estimated that hundreds of locals have been killed in indiscriminate fighting with 100 000 people displaced the us and canada have both imposed sanctions on gang leaders but while the diplomatic efforts are creeping towards intervention the aid agencies are working on efforts to assist as the security situation further deteriorates goal is the primary international non governmental organisation in port

aid agencies which in partnership with community based organisations has access to the most high risk and vulnerable neighbourhoods in port au prince including bas delmas cite soleil and carrefour gang violence the goal workers are understood to be particularly aware of the dangers in the area and the threats posed by the heavily armed gangs as previously reported it is suspected that guns have been smuggled from arms dealers in the us advertisement the gangs the united nations has said are using sexual violence indiscriminate killings and kidnappings as a weapon against the local population dieudonne leroy goal s head of security in lac region spoke about how the heavily armed gangs have capitalised on the political instability and haiti s poorest and most vulnerable people since the assassination of president moïse a vacuum in governance has emerged no replacement has been elected and without outside intervention from armed forces or un peacekeepers haiti will be unable to hold a fully democratic election given the current humanitarian climate explained leroy he said that the ngo is liaising with representatives from the un security council and ambassador fergal mythen ireland s permanent representative to the un to emphasise the importance of additional security support in haiti goal officials on the ground in haiti goal goal paul d anglejan goal country director in haiti said the ngo is using a network of local groups in port au prince to respond to the spread of cholera but that international assistance is urgently needed the return of cholera is a major threat for haiti amid significant levels of insecurity and civil unrest the cholera threat is also heightened because of a lack of access to clean water for a large portion of the population lack of basic sanitation facilities in communities including open defecation practices and a health system which is in a precarious state he said that goal is uniquely positioned to respond to this crisis our network of over 200 community based organisations have granted us access to some of port au prince s most dangerous neighbourhoods and we are supporting un agencies and facilitating their access to these communities too so they can carry out life saving protection interventions he said goal is currently working alongside the office of the high commission for human rights ohchr haiti s national

tech is full of smart people who build run and invest in successful companies that have produced a tremendous amount of innovation but the industry s recent spate of failures and reversals has made

according to their articles of faith their special powers of disruption could transform any industry while generating outsize returns making them worthy of magazine covers and tremendous wealth it s the myth of extreme competence key to the power of this myth was that it wasn t only techies who believed investors both professionals and everyday joes and janes bid up tech stocks to stratospheric

target of antitrust litigation until it became clear the company s products might be displaced by competitors like tiktok gods after all can be both powerful and vengeful and must be worshipped or fought accordingly in the past couple of weeks however it s become clearer than ever that the myth of extreme competence is just that a myth the collapse of ftx the mass layoffs the rapid unravelling of twitter all have put a huge dent in the notion that tech companies are led by anyone other than mere mortals to be clear amazon and meta are enormous companies that have created a huge amount of value and in some cases a lot of harm twitter while not as big has long had influence disproportionate to the size of its user base ftx is in a different situation it has collapsed and is under investigation for potential wrongdoing in each of these events what seem to be elementary errors of judgment have been laid bare for big tech companies like meta there was the delusion which zuckerberg acknowledged when announcing layoffs of more than 11 000 employees that the world would change little once pandemic lockdowns lifted unfortunately this did not play out the way i expected he wrote in an open letter announcing the layoffs not only has online commerce returned to prior trends but the macroeconomic downturn increased competition and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than i d expected in the case of ftx veteran investment firms collectively dumped nearly us 2 billion into a startup with no real oversight led by a 30 year old founder sam bankman fried who conducted business meetings while playing videogames ftx s new ceo a 40 year veteran of restructurings who took the helm after the company s filing for bankruptcy protection has said ftx suffered a complete failure of corporate controls the likes of which he has never seen ftx both welcomed and attempted to leverage scepticism of crypto and regulation of it part of the charm of bankman fried was that in interviews he gave the impression that he was not a crypto true believer and that he was in some sense in on the joke for example in may he declared that bitcoin would never be suitable for payments soon after comparing a common practice in crypto lending to ponzi schemes economic conditions abetted poor judgment years of low interest rates and stimulus by central banks meant there was just so much low cost money sloshing around that pumping it into startups hastily made a certain kind of sense the best investors did the logical amount of diligence for 2021 which was very little says jason lemkin a venture capitalist and managing director of the saastr fund it was so easy to make money by investing in the later funding rounds for fast growing startups in 2021 that the volume of vc deals soared along with the seeming returns on those deals in essence investors found themselves in a climate in which they could invest almost unprecedented amounts of money and quickly flip that investment for an almost unprecedented multiple with musk the rise of his two main companies tesla and spacex created an aura of limitless acumen around him for many of his followers with twitter though his style of micromanagement and hubris along with a series of engineer and revenue repelling antics have damaged the business musk himself has said the company could face bankruptcy taken together these unforced errors have seriously undermined the image of extreme competence that these companies and their leaders fostered during their ascent it leaves those both inside and outside tech asking whether these mortals should be given all the accolades and compensation they ve accrued indeed the most obvious expression of this change in sentiment about america s biggest tech companies is that they have collectively lost more than us 2 trillion in value on the stock market compared with their peaks this has wiped out more than half of the personal wealth of both musk and zuckerberg the realisation that these companies aren t omnipotent in the way many people hoped or feared also should reshape the perception of them by politicians and regulators on one hand it raises the possibility that some of the more speculative criticism and pre emptive regulation of them has been either undeserved or unnecessary this is especially true for attempts to check these companies power that assume there is no other way to rein them in is antitrust regulation of meta urgent if thanks in part to the company s own missteps tiktok is eating its lunch on the other hand many in washington also seemed to buy into bankman fried s snake oil it s telling that he made many trips to washington d c to advocate for regulation of crypto regulation of crypto was for ftx and bankman fried not an impediment to doing business but a validation of his approach regulated crypto exchanges like ftx would have allowed a variety of cryptocurrencies potentially including the ones that ftx made up and are now nearly worthless to trade as actual securities this would have made it possible for ftx to connect with the global banking system in a way that could have sent bankman fried s now mostly evaporated us 16 billion net worth into the stratosphere indeed a now deleted article commissioned by the investment firm sequoia declared bankman fried a future trillionaire disruption and creative destruction are real and marvelous new technologies are invented every day that transform the world but we should lay to rest the myth that those who are best at articulating grand visions also possess the kind of universal competence required to create companies of lasting value in the end the people hurt by this myth aren t the professional investors who banked record returns or company leaders with their diminished but still incomprehensible levels of wealth the people it hurts most are the average investor the retiree with a decimated portfolio the tens of thousands of laid off tech workers the ones it hurts the most in other words are most of us bangkok post thailand tribune news service

indicating that a pivot from the fed on interest rates could indicate a soft landing leading investors to believe happy days are here again but he said the treasury yield curve between the 2 year and 10 year yield is as inverted as it has been since 1982 the treasury yields scream that a recession is coming he said he said he sides with the bond market s more pessimistic outlook due to indicators such as fed surveys and what he called the declining housing market alex harring spacs retail ownership slides retail ownership in spacs has fallen dramatically as the frenzy in the market fizzled

china s covid management is baffling could hurt supply chain and inflation says allianz s el erian mohamed el erian allianz and gramercy advisor said the way china has been managing covid is totally

and allowed for certain degree of her immunity he told cnbc s squawk box monday china has been trying the covid zero policy never got out of the live versus livelihood dilemma has flip flopped and now

about it but it benefits me the challenge star suzan mutesi has broken her silence following claims she has purchased one million instagram followers the actress and influencer who has been a fixture of sydney s social scene for the last three years locked down her social media pages last week after she was accused of being a sham socialite jamie azzopardi a prominent sydney stylist accused the

credibility azzopardi who has known mutesi for years opened the floodgates by giving a tell all interview about her to the so dramatic podcast it fascinates me how she went from 200 000 followers pre lockdown to 1 2 million and is on a reality tv show where she is representative of influencers he said according to azzopardi publicly available statistics on social blade a website that tracks analytical information for social media platforms prove she bought 75 000 followers before sydney fashion week and challenged mutesi to prove him wrong he also claimed mutesi 36 purchased automated

mq 1c gray eagle in flight general atomics news from ukraine provides signs for hope with ukrainian forces reoccupying kherson and russians surrendering to drones however this conflict is still far from over and much remains on the line both for the people of ukraine and for security implications around the globe the longer the conflict extends the greater the costs on the ukrainian people and the coalition supporting them this can be measured in lives lost economic hardships borne by ukraine s friends and increasing political strain among western nations vladimir putin is a master at opportunistically maximizing the divisive potential afforded by these realities that is why the united states and its allies need to increase the scale and scope of the military tools they are providing the ukrainians to empower faster battlefield gains that will ultimately drive a resolution of this conflict nowhere is this truer than the impact western combat aircraft could have on the war most of the military assistance provided to the ukrainians so far is for surface operations things like artillery ground launched missiles and combat vehicles while this aid is important it fundamentally locks the ukrainians into a two dimensional force on force fight with the russians it does not take an advanced degree in military strategy to understand that traditional ground centric warfare is defined by physical attrition which will invariably favor russia given its larger supply of personnel and materiel it is also an incredibly slow way to fight measuring progress one step at a time a brutal meat grinder it is not in america s or its allies interests for this to play out much longer given numerous western economies on the verge of recession with energy supplies strained and key food stocks affected nor can the ukrainians sustain this kind of fighting in perpetuity from a manpower or resource perspective the clock is running and the ukrainians need a time based advantage to persevere given that reality it is puzzling and alarming why the biden administration once again chose to deny a ukrainian request to procure mq 1c gray eagle remotely piloted aircraft this is exactly the kind of capability the ukrainians need to accelerate battlefield gains given its ability to gather real time intelligence and use it to launch air to ground missiles against time critical targets the power afforded by this sensor shooter technology revolutionized u s combat operations and has been emulated by countries around the world it is no mystery why ukraine keeps asking for these aircraft one reason given for denying the ukrainian s request is the biden administration s security concern that sensitive technology could be exploited by the russians if they were to recover shot down aircraft this is a puzzling justification given that the u s and its allies have operated these aircraft for the past two decades in afghanistan and iraq with numerous losses it is not a question of what will happen if the russians gain access to this technology they already have it the reality is that while mq 1cs are highly capable their technology is well understood the administration further rationalizes denying the request because ukraine already has access to turkish made tb 2 remotely piloted aircraft while true this rationale fails to acknowledge that the tb 2 and the mq 1c are quite different with the latter carrying a far more powerful array of sensors munitions and with a much greater time aloft at a time when ukraine most needs a decisive advantage in the air it is crucial that we provide them the tools with which they can create that advantage administration officials also cite the cost of the mq 1c suggesting that available funds could be used to get larger numbers of alternate capabilities like the tb 2 this argument ignores the performance advantages that the mq 1c brings to the fight war is about winning not saving money and winning requires the right tools allowing putin to succeed would be much more costly over the long term it is also worth pointing out that if this is really an economic issue the administration could easily transfer mq 1cs and its larger mq 9 cousin that it has in u s military stocks just as it has done with everything from over a million artillery rounds to armored personnel carriers additional biden administration pushback centers on the notion of survivability with the mq 1c s vulnerability to russian air defenses cited while true in some respects the reality is that neither ukraine nor russia have secured air superiority both sides are shooting down each other s aircraft while a significant number manage to operate successfully what the administration needs to consider are the losses that will occur and the broader strategic interests at risk by failing to better equip the ukrainians with more effective airpower the question really needs to focus on the results that mq 1cs will secure versus failing to try at all the former turns up the pressure on the russians the latter cedes them battlefield sanctuary yes some mq 1cs will get shot down however that should not be a deterrent to providing them given the results they promise to deliver finally the biden administration denial cited concerns regarding the potential of further escalating the war of all the reasons not to provide ukraine mq 1c s this is probably the most puzzling the mq 1c is a propeller driven remotely powered aircraft whose core design is over twenty years old it is not a stealth bomber or a nuclear powered attack submarine russian forces have tortured raped and mercilessly killed thousands of civilians they have ruthlessly leveled ukrainian cities outright and have recklessly fired artillery at nuclear power plants ending this senseless russian violence as fast as possible on terms acceptable to the ukrainian people should be what matters most that demands an improved set of warfighting tools to move beyond the slow moving ground war of attrition this conflict has become to self deter now is a dangerous path to follow and may undermine ukrainian forces at the very time they need our help the most nor should this conversation be restricted to one type of aircraft the reality is that ukraine needs to reset its entire air force to win this war and secure the peace this will demand training personnel helping construct the necessary infrastructure and provide the combat aircraft and associated munitions necessary to replace the soviet era aircraft that it currently possesses deferring the process of transforming the ukrainian air force to one based on western combat aircraft and principles undermines ukraine while empowering putin a look at the map showing the relative position of ukrainian and russian forces clearly shows there is a long way to go in this fight accelerating that clock by providing an advantage in combat aircraft to better exploit the air domain is essential for ukraine to secure victory it will dial up the pressure on putin stop the suffering of the ukrainian people and ease the economic disruption rest of the world is experiencing because of the war the u s holds the power to positively shape the outcome of this conflict that is why there is bipartisan support for the issue in congress a rare feat these days let s get on with it provide ukraine the airpower it needs to win now

article 3 months old commodities nov 28 2022 this story features woodside energy group limited and other companies for more info share analysis wds one of the remarkable events that occurred in 2022 is the de coupling between share prices of energy producers worldwide and the price of crude oil as also shown in the graphic below this de coupling has turned the energy sector globally into a de facto safe haven as most risk assets experienced elevated turmoil while going through a painful de rating process including the price of oil parts of the investment community believe oil producers and potentially the energy sector in a broader sense incl nat gas and thermal coal can continue to act like a haven next year even with economic recessions potentially hitting economies in the uk continental europe the us and elsewhere the story below reflects this view the substantiality of investment in australian energy stocks capital preservation has become vital for investors faced with ongoing macroeconomic adversities energy stocks globally turned into a safe haven in 2022 australian energy stocks look poised to continue to provide favourable performance for investors by anuj sharma central banks have signalled more rate hikes and sustainability of rates at higher levels breeding fear of economic recessions in 2023 energy stocks are among those securities that protected investors capital and delivered price growth against market trends throughout the year past during the first half of 2022 when major sectors in the global stock market were experiencing significant adversities with share prices sinking most of the leaders in the australian energy sector were proliferating in terms of price growth showing decisive outperformance over benchmark indices mayhem in global financial markets a prolonged tightening of monetary conditions withdraws liquidity from the financial systems enhancing the risks of economic growth stagnation on the other hand strengthening the us dollar is concentrating the global capital flow towards the us and shifting economic stress and inflation to other advanced economies liquidity deficiency in equity markets enhances risk aversion among investors impacts stock price volatility and reduces trading volumes especially on the buy side levels of leading economic indices indicate significant weakness is ahead for the us european and chinese economies whereas in australia expected economic conditions are comparatively stronger performance of australian energy stocks higher energy prices with the increasing efficiency of energy producers in extracting and processing energy minerals lead to expanded profit margins and free cash flows the financial outperformance is integrated by the efficient market which is reflected in market valuations of australian energy companies the basis of the outperformance of energy stocks is directly related to instability in the global economy and the slower pace of technological emergence soaring commodity prices based on less availability of energy minerals deterioration of global trade and covid pandemic shocks on economic activities are breeding higher energy prices ontologically as of november 22 2022 the asx200 energy index shows a remarkable year to date ytd gain of nearly 47 over the same period the domestic benchmark asx200 has delivered a negative 4 return while the s p500 in the us retreated by 17 woodside energy wds the local sector leader has delivered a 73 return ytd returns generated by some of the sector participants have reached much higher levels including for whitehaven coal whc 230 new hope corp nhc 151 stanmore resources smr 144 and yancoal australia yal 96 whether energy stocks will continue their 2022 outperformance into 2023 is a critical question for investors the most vital fundamentals supporting the performance of australian energy stocks include the following ongoing energy crisis in europe after the russian energy blockade major european countries depend on coal hydropower and nuclear energy solar and wind to some extent the eu s current energy policy is weak in ensuring energy security for the region over the long term the united states is producing and exporting oil and gas at the maximum infrastructural capacity still there is a significant capital investment in motion but american energy will not have the ability to replace russian global energy exports canada is producing more oil and gas than domestic demand to export all the remainder to one customer the us opec is deviating from the us objective to balance the energy market to neutralise the russian energy effect instead opec is destabilising the global energy market by instrumentalising its energy output to preserve its strategic significance these factors create a broad scope and prolonged opportunity for australian energy that is readily available and cost effective for emerging countries and the eu after the onset of the pandemic growth in australian exports has become aggressive energy companies expect significant earnings growth in 2022 from the ongoing supply demand imbalance in the global energy market that is expected to continue through 2023 intensifying global energy crisis the global crisis is delivering inflationary pressures on the economy and breeding the risk of recession the boosted energy prices have generated nearly us 2trn over 2021 s earnings for energy producers fossil fuel energy markets are now extremely sensitive to macroeconomic changes a new wave of geopolitical turmoil supply shocks or escalation of war especially sanctions and financing restrictions can ignite a drastic supply side shift that can have a prolonged effect on energy prices into the future technical limitations if

the boston globe on a cape cod golf course the region s housing crisis comes to a head this isn t about one apartment complex it s about the sustained economic vitality of our region janet milkman executive director of the barnstable land trust is pictured on a footbridge crossing a small pond on the sixth green of the twin brooks golf course in hyannis barnstable a sense of peace permeates the air here in the wind that swirls over shaded greens through the brilliant orange leaves that line the fairways and under the wings of the shorebirds coasting overhead janet milkman pauses atop a grassy ridge to take it all in then sighs and shakes her head why she says would anyone want to develop this it is indeed tranquil as milkman walks the grounds of the twin brooks golf course 40 acres of greens and fairways in hyannis about a mile from the atlantic ocean on a pleasant autumn day but a bitter fight rages here too over what will become of the place and some say over the future of cape cod s economy advertisement despite its charm and prime location twin brooks built in the 1960s has long struggled to attract patrons due to its short layout and two years ago a national housing developer quarterra agreed to buy the place from the real estate firm that has owned it since 2007 quarterra declined to say how much it ll pay quarterra plans to build 312 apartments on the property across 13 residential buildings quarterra it plans to erect 13 buildings holding 312 apartments it s the sort of higher density development that housing advocates say the cape desperately needs to confront its acute housing shortage which is squeezing out the workforce that sustains the region s economy at an alarming pace already 48 percent of the region s workforce commutes in over the bridges linking the cape to the mainland but pushback from the community against the development has been powerful and it is still swelling as it inches closer to approval some local leaders groups want the town or a combination of public and private interests to purchase the property and preserve it as a massive swath of open space a central park for cape cod there s been talk of a lawsuit if the project moves forward it is a familiar story in a place where residents often bristle at the mention of large residential complexes advertisement should apartments sprout here they would represent a significant break from the cape s historical development pattern which has centered heavily around single family homes over the last decade the region has permitted four single family houses for every multifamily unit approved at the same time they d serve a deep and growing need a recent report by real estate analysis firm the concord group estimates that more than 800 families earning less than 100 000 annually will leave cape cod each year through 2026 due to a lack of housing in their income range the region s rental housing stock is 99 percent occupied the report found and it is shrinking regardless of outcome the uphill battle toward approval could well take at least another year or lead to an even more bitter fight if developers force the issue with a 40b appeal a state statute designed to encourage construction of affordable housing in communities that lack it and the intensity of the struggle offers a case study in why even communities facing the worst of the state s housing crisis still struggle to produce more units we are at a critical point said paul niedzwiecki ceo of the cape cod chamber of commerce people and not just advocates but our residents need to start asking themselves if we don t develop here where will we do it and if some kind of change to the way we view development doesn t happen now when this isn t about one apartment complex it s about the sustained economic vitality of our region advertisement it s easy to understand why some residents want to preserve this place framed by two trickling creeks and a thicket of trees the course is a picturesque swath of green a short walk from main street save twin brooks the resident group at the forefront of the opposition describes it as much more than a golf course it is residents say an urban wildlife sanctuary home to dozens of species of birds and mammals alongside protected wetlands they argue that the proposed development would destroy habitats contaminate the creeks and encroach on the wetlands the twin brooks golf course in hyannis andrew brinker we are talking about nothing short of an environmental disaster should these apartments be built said john ale a retired lawyer representing the resident group i understand the desire for housing but that shouldn t come at the expense of a beautiful property like this building on cape cod is often thorny it s estimated that more than 80 percent of the region s land is either already developed or under conservation restriction so environmental concerns around any large scale project are practically a given but in the case of twin brooks proponents and some environmentalists dispute claims that the site is particularly sensitive and despite its beauty they say its environmental value is limited a report published last year by two leading local advocacy groups listed twin brooks as one of the best locations in barnstable for housing development that s because municipal agencies on the cape consider golf courses to be developed land that is tainted by years of chemical grass treatment and careful landscaping making new development on those plots minimally harmful perhaps even generating less carbon runoff and twin brooks unlike most of the cape has access to the municipal sewer system meaning issues with pollution would be inherently limited compared with other properties that don t have the same luxury advertisement if built the complex would be one of the largest new residential developments on cape cod in recent years partly because some multifamily developers steer clear of the region knowing the likelihood of bitter almost reflexive opposition said rob brennan managing partner of the development firm capebuilt and an attorney representing large multifamily projects on the cape developers should be scrutinized and should have to listen to the community he said but on the cape i think people get particularly riled up a lot of the time what that means is that the approval process can get dragged out for years the creeks that frame twin brooks feed into the stewart s creek estuary pictured here barry chin globe staff single family home building has far outpaced multifamily development in barnstable county over the last four decades today single family homes account for more than 80 percent of the cape s total housing stock compared with 52 percent statewide that kind of development some local leaders argue is far worse for the environment than building larger denser apartment buildings designed to coexist with open space widespread single family building is akin to death by 1 000 cuts said niedzwiecki the chamber of commerce ceo we ve seen what the existing development pattern gets us on the cape it gets us on a very broad scale a fragmented landscape lousy water quality high volumes of traffic and reduced open space said andrew gottlieb executive director of the association to preserve cape cod the environmental group that helped create the development report i have some minor concerns about twin brooks but they pale in comparison to my concern with the way our region is looking at development overall advertisement milkman the executive director of the barnstable land trust a group that works to preserve environmentally valuable parcels of land on the cape said residents concerns go well beyond the environment some are worried the complex will worsen traffic problems at a nearby rotary others characterize the golf course as the last remaining green space near downtown hyannis regardless of motivation they are willing to fight milkman s group proposed an alternative plan that would cut the number of apartments in half while devoting part of the property to open space and in public meetings residents have appealed to the cape cod commission a regional regulatory body that must approve the project to block it save twin brooks is readying a lawsuit should the project move forward the banks of the stewart s creek estuary are lined with phragmites an invasive reed species that grows in wetland areas barry chin globe staff dan lee the head of quarterra s new england division said the developer has participated in repeated public meetings and made a number of changes to plans based on community feedback increasing the number of income restricted units for instance and moving one building further from wetlands ale the save twin brooks representative who has a second home in hyannis said those concessions do not address what he described as a dearth of open space in the town he wants the sale called off and for community stakeholders to find a way to purchase the course though he admits it would be challenging to gather the funding and he suggested that projects like the twin brooks proposal aren t needed to address the cape s housing shortage advertisement in a lot of cases people move to cape cod to buy a house they re not looking for a small apartment like what would be built here he said and we have hundreds of new housing units that have been recently permitted across the cape but by a number of measures there s an urgent need for more said alisa magnotta ceo of the housing assistance corporation the lead housing advocacy group on the cape and few places to build it at the scale of twin brooks she paints the debate in almost existential terms people are beating up the twin brooks project but these are people that either don t have to think about our housing crisis or haven t looked at the broader picture she said if we can t house our workers that s it our society dies our community dies

as the first snows of the season fall across ukraine the effects of russia s relentless terroristic targeting of ukraine s energy infrastructure are beginning to be felt blackouts had until recently been managed in a rolling coordinated fashion now they are affecting whole cities like lviv and kyiv without warning it is not just electricity that is down running water and even mobile phone reception is being shut off across ukraine winter has not even officially begun yet temperatures are already hovering around freezing in a country known for its brutally cold winters prolonged power outages are a bleak prospect many of ukraine s millions of city dwellers rely on communal heating for their apartment blocks they now face the very real prospect of whole heating systems collapsing the situation is so dire that earlier this week kyiv mayor vitali klitschko raised the possibility that the capital may soon need to be evacuated he has since taken a firmer stance insisting that while putin wants to terrorise people make them freeze without light we will not die or flee as putin wants yet ukrainian sources report that evacuation remains a very real prospect at some point people may have no choice the stubborn relentless resistance that ukrainians have shown thus far will not heat their homes as the attacks on its energy grid mount ukraine continues to call for more and better air defences from the west and despite the recent incident in poland where a stray missile from ukraine s air defence systems is said to have caused an explosion that killed two people western allies are continuing to supply ukraine still the fact remains that even a substantial acceleration of missile defence deliveries would not be enough to fully protect ukraine from russian missiles ukraine is so vast offering such an array of targets for russia that it is almost impossible to protect it all moreover missile defence requires substantially greater resources than missile offence especially with russia now deploying cheap iranian drones ukraine would need missile systems worth millions of dollars to protect it against swarms of drones costing mere thousands worryingly few seem to be taking the threat to ukraine s civilian population as seriously as they should be despite the often ingenious work of ukraine s civil engineers ukraine is running out of parts to repair the damage to the power network it is no simple task to source these either given that much of ukraine s network relies on soviet stock ukraine has formally requested help and parts to repair the network but the scale of the challenge is enormous even more worryingly western politicians and planners seem unprepared for the scale of the potential humanitarian disaster if its energy network was to completely collapse ukraine might well need hundreds of thousands of generators mobile radiators and other heating equipment it would also need plans for water fuel and food distribution even after the experience of the pandemic when many western states redirected resources in response it is not clear that any have the capacity for the scale of operation likely to be required in ukraine there will no doubt be some in the dark corridors of washington or brussels who are trying to develop a plan but there has been little of the broader political attention and public discussion needed to make this a reality instead western officials seem content to engage in little more than gesture politics this week for instance the european parliament saw fit to pass a resolution calling russia a terrorist state this type of self congratulatory posturing may make western politicians feel good but it will do nothing to help ukrainians

detect and destroy formaldehyde a strong smelling chemical used in building materials and it can be controlled using the mydyson app should you wait for a cyber monday air purifier deal this is something which we would all like to know but unfortunately there s no easy answer typically those deals which we saw during black friday continue through to cyber monday but in some cases we may see further price drops however this is dependent on stock levels and how keen retailers are to shift any remaining stock some air purifiers can also cool the air which is probably the last thing we want to do if we re heading into the colder months of the year that said an air purifier can quickly clean the air in a room with some capable of doing such a thing within an hour if we look back at adobe s 2021 holiday shopping report we can see that appliances as a category had their biggest price reductions over the black friday and cyber monday weekend however we didn t actually see a further drop in prices on cyber monday after all the change in cost on their typical value over these dates was pretty much the same at 8 57 and 8 39 respectively this year s black friday proved to be a little different from previous years with deals landing sooner than we had expected we saw some big drops in the first few weeks of november and then deeper discounts between the event and cyber monday although the air purifier cyber monday deals may not be the cheapest we ve ever seen due to the demand that they re in for a healthier lifestyle there is plenty of stock our advice would be that if you see something you like then we d recommend grabbing it now there s no guarantee of deeper discounts past cyber monday and although there may be stock now supplies won t last forever image credit levoit cyber monday air purifier deals our predictions when will cyber monday air purifier deals start in 2022 right now black friday this year was november 25 but many air purifier deals landed well ahead of the day itself and have continued throughout the weekend into cyber monday last year prices stayed low throughout the week with occasional flash sales and lightning deals offering particularly good offers we expect to see the same for cyber monday 2022 november 28 with a few last minute deals cropping up as the event continues where can you find air purifier deals on cyber monday amazon often leads the way when it comes to air purifier deals on black friday with discounts on dyson coway blueair levoit and more if you have a specific model in mind though take note of where else it s stocked ahead of black friday best buy and home depot also run some great promotions every cyber monday and we ll be keeping you posted on all the main discounts when they start dropping in november which air purifiers will be discounted for cyber monday last year air purifiers sold out at record speed and stock vanished almost as soon as it dropped this year though we re expecting a much more extensive range of promotions on budget brands such as honeywell right through to highly coveted dyson air purifiers stay tuned for price matching battles too because once those prices start to drop we re expecting to see stores like best buy and walmart matching the discounts you ll find at amazon and other retailers recent drops from shark and blueair may also see some big discounts given that they re already reduced well ahead of black friday itself we re also expecting to see some exclusive air purifier cyber monday deals from dyson since this is a trend we see year

energy that runs in a user s home solaredge readily admits that inverters have critical importance because while inverters account for less than 10 of system cost those components manage 100 of system

savings your retirement your investments your job your house the whole shebang is in danger today we turn our minds to the future which may prove murkier still as we saw in china during the 1930s and 40s the government printed money to pay its bills it ran up debt it couldn t pay and then the hyperinflation of the 1950s opened the door to mao s communists after that it was one disaster after another americans think they can continue to borrow and spend forever investors are trained to believe that stocks always bounce back they think that if they just hold on soon they will be making money again and if they owe money they think they ll soon be able to refinance at even lower rates but all that has changed now that we have inflation it s a whole new ballgame the fed can still print money but now it will cause consumer prices to rise even faster your stocks may go up as they did from 1966 82 but inflation will wipe out your gains and when you go to refinance your house you will be hit by a double whammy falling house prices may have erased your equity while rising mortgage interest increases your monthly payments the bubble epoch rip everybody knows you can t just print money and expect to get rich every nation that tried it turned into a complete disaster in germany russia and china high inflation led to the rise of the nazis the bolsheviks and mao s communists high inflation destroyed the economy of argentina in the 90s of zimbabwe in the 00s and venezuela in the teens they could call it stimulus or quantitative easing but it was nothing more than the old trick spending too much and trying to cover up the excess by printing more money eventually the bubble becomes a bust we ve already seen nearly us 100 trillion in losses stocks bonds real estate and private businesses worldwide and here s the important thing this is not just a typical market sell off stocks will go up and down but the bubble epoch won t come back already inflation is the worst we ve seen

other we were not in a proxy war with russia china was still a third world nation we didn t have more than half the population relying on money from the government and back then if you had mentioned a

which is not very easy to be transferred elsewhere and oftentimes that refers to very custom equipment and a trained workforce that are not readily available elsewhere said yang however he said he has high confidence that customers will not switch over to competitor samsung because of apple s competitive advantage the iphones perceived value over android phones have grown because apple is able to

petaling jaya the malaysian economy has the necessary buffers to withstand downside risks amid a challenging business environment exacerbated by the looming global recession next year say economists among the factors that may cushion the domestic economy from the global recessionary risks are a well capitalised financial system local currency denominated debts and china s gradual exit from its zero covid strategy the world bank has estimated that a one percentage point decline in the growth of the group of seven countries excluding japan could result in malaysia s gross domestic product gdp growth falling by a similar quantum while a one percentage point fall in china s growth would see a corresponding 0 7 percentage point drop in the country s gdp growth this is expected to reduce income and job creation leading to lower consumer spending as well as reduced business expansion and investment click to enlarge sunway university economics professor yeah kim leng told starbiz the rapidly cooling global economy might worsen into a global recession next year and it is expected to transmit a negative demand shock to the local economy via the trade and direct investment channel he said the rising importance of exports to the country s growth is evidenced by the rise of its share to gdp from 69 in 2021 to 72 in the first three quarters of 2022 yeah said however the momentum generated by the strong recovery in private consumption this year could help the local economy to withstand a mild softening in external demand in 2023 but would not be able to offset a more severe or synchronised global downturn economists concurred that the widely expected continuation of monetary and financial tightening in the us and european economies to contain high inflation would dampen economic growth they said it would also cause continued volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets and capital outflows from emerging markets including malaysia meanwhile bloomberg economics expects the us federal reserve s fed benchmark interest rate to hit 5 in early 2023 and possibility of more pain to come with higher borrowing costs hammering rate sensitive industries from real estate to autos it is predicting a us recession in the second half of 2023 on a positive note yeah said malaysia s financial system is well capitalised sufficiently deep and liquid to withstand foreign capital withdrawals as well as debt market turbulence arising from soaring interest rates currency depreciation and risk off sentiment moreover the country s corporate and government debt is denominated in the local currency and this will avert the dreaded ballooning of foreign debt repayments due to sharp currency depreciation nevertheless the ensuing tighter financial conditions and increased market uncertainty could dampen growth through the financial channel he said sunway university economics professor yeah kim leng due to the multiple global risks the gdp growth for 2023 is revised slightly downwards to between 3 5 and 4 he said the local economy is expected to grow by 4 to 5 in 2023 bank negara expects the full year 2022 growth to exceed the 7 projected earlier due to the healthy growth in the first nine months of this year the economy posted a robust gdp growth of 14 2 in the third quarter 3q22 juwai iqi global chief economist shan saeed said the most important variable that would drag the global economy in 2023 would be the deep recession in the united states and stagflation in many economies the united states is the third largest trading partner of malaysia with a share of 11 in trade based on the january to october 2022 data if the largest economy goes into a deep recession malaysia needs to find new markets especially the cooperation council for the arab states of the gulf or africa to minimise the impact of the recession in my opinion things will be very challenging next year but can be manageable if policy frameworks remain consistent and structured to maintain economic confidence among local investors he said shan maintained his gdp forecast growth for 2022 at between 6 5 and 7 for 2022 and 4 to 5 for 2023 he said this would be premised on among others malaysia s macroeconomic stability domestic consumption and its trade numbers that are expected to remain strong for the government to maintain economic confidence with the global economic fragilities expected to worsen in 2023 it must ensure that there are macroeconomic stability consistency of policies strong trade and investment in infrastructure as a small and open economy malaysia is not spared from the changes in external economic development according to bank islam m bhd chief economist firdaos rosli for example he said the united states and the european union are malaysia s largest non traditional trading partners malaysia s net exports account for about 6 of its gdp with north america and europe accounting for about 20 of the country s total trade bank islam m bhd chief economist firdaos rosli bloomberg economics base case is that high energy costs and rate hikes by the european central bank would tip the bloc into recession with gdp shrinking 0 1 in 2023 we estimate that the correlation between the united states and malaysian economies is 81 9 whereas it is much higher with the eurozone at 88 9 therefore a slowdown or even a recession in the two economies will impact the country s growth in 2023 the silver lining for malaysia and to a certain extent south east asia is china s gradual exit from its zero covid strategy in the event of an economic reopening we expect a pick up in tourism receipts and inward foreign direct investments from china this will give malaysia the necessary buffer against the downside risks from the west firdaos said on gdp growth he said the bank s latest forecast for 4q22 comes in at 4 8 with 2022 growth at 8 1 for 2023 it is penciling in 4 5 subject to further changes he added ram ratings senior economist and head of economic research woon khai jhek projected a slower gdp growth in 2023 of between 4 and 5 compared with 8 2 for this year he said malaysia could not avoid the ripple effects from the slower global economic growth particularly the slowdown in consumer electronic demands which would impact the semiconductor sector the country s gdp for the three quarters of this year grew 9 3 year on year underpinned by the reopening of the economy which saw a robust recovery in private sector activities economist intelligence corporate network s director for south east asia sumana

which is not very easy to be transferred elsewhere and oftentimes that refers to very custom equipment and a trained workforce that are not readily available elsewhere said yang however he said he has high confidence that customers will not switch over to competitor samsung because of apple s competitive advantage the iphones perceived value over android phones have grown because apple is able to

april next year after the national people s congress takes place but there s a chance that authorities reopen earlier due to difficulties in keeping covid cases under control according to goldman sachs chief china economist hui shan said there s a 60 chance of the former scenario taking place there is also a 30 probability of earlier reopening precisely because of the difficulty in keeping covid under control and the lack of medical preparation suggests it could be quite a messy process she said medical preparation is not ready yet whereas the virus has evolved in such a way it s getting very costly to continue to implement that dynamic zero covid policy she said she said that policymakers need to weigh out the costs and benefits of the stringent covid restrictions as protests

back to basics the fed s big miss on inflation has led powell to start invoking the lessons of paul volcker who famously tamed it in the 1980s since volcker stepped down in 1987 the fed s remit has expanded alan greenspan chairman until 2006 rode a boom in productivity to even lower inflation but also stepped in to support markets whenever there were threats to the economy when reckless lending eventually blew up the housing and credit markets in 2008 then chairman ben bernanke deployed the fed s balance sheet in ways that hadn t been seen since the great depression coming out of the covid induced recession it looked as if central bankers had pulled it off again their co ordinated response in march 2020 put a floor under asset prices and kept bond yields low helping governments fund the massive spending needed to support millions of unemployed people with inflation still tame central bankers assumed responsibility for tackling problems such as climate change and inequality including setting a new goal of broad based and inclusive employment meanwhile stocks bonds and cryptocurrencies were racing higher then consumer prices did too and central bankers didn t see it coming the fed s new policy framework prevented a more aggressive approach to inflation says carl walsh an economist at the university of california at santa cruz who previously worked at the federal reserve bank of san francisco he quotes the federal open market committee which admitted that goals such as inclusive employment can shift over time and be tough to quantify making policy decisions informed by employment shortfalls from a goal that is not directly measurable has the potential to impart an asymmetric inflationary bias in policy he says rajan says central bankers simply lost sight of their primary role which is maintaining price stability if you told them that is your job focus on that and leave all this other stuff aside they would do a better job he says advertisement keep it simple it follows that the simpler the mission is the simpler the messaging should be monetary policy works through central bankers manipulation of points along the yield curve essentially the price of money over different periods of time central bankers provide signals about whether to expect interest rates to rise fall or trend sideways and traders in the financial markets buy and sell vast quantities of bonds accordingly those moves percolate through the broader society influencing pension account balances business and consumer confidence and views on future price movements that s what determines whether the central bank policies work or not monetary policy is 90 per cent communication and 10 per cent action says bank of thailand governor sethaput suthiwartnarueput in early 2022 as the fed ecb and the bank of england changed their outlooks for the economy and inflation there was a pretty massive failure to communicate how policy would address those changes says athanasios orphanides who served on the ecb s governing council from 2008 to mid 2012 tightening of monetary policy is not difficult this is a no brainer in central banking the crossed wires could be seen in wild swings in global bond and currency markets throughout the year in august the move index of implied bond volatility known as the us treasuries fear gauge jumped to a level exceeded only three times since 1988 investors began demanding a premium to hold australia s aaa rated bonds after the central bank reversed its pledge to keep interest rates on hold until 2024 and instead began its fastest tightening cycle in a generation some central banks flashed early warning signs in october 2021 the reserve bank of new zealand started raising interest rates and the bank of canada adopted a more hawkish stance towards inflation halting its bond purchase program more recently the bank of canada announced it would start publishing a minutes like summary of deliberations by officials after each policy decision to enhance transparency adrian orr governor of the reserve bank of new zealand bloomberg by contrast the bank of england already taking flak for letting inflation get out of control has also been criticised for how it handled a run on britain s currency and government bonds after former prime minister liz truss government proposed a deficit busting tax overhaul first the central bank was accused of dragging its feet before helping to manage the fallout when the pound dropped to an all time low against the dollar and then investors were shocked when the boe pledged an abrupt end to emergency gilt purchases in the end it was truss who took the blame resigning after just 44 days advertisement stephen miller of gsfm says he s been poring over spreadsheets of economic indicators such as the federal reserve bank of cleveland s consumer price index measures in a way he hasn t done for more than three decades the reason he doesn t trust the forecasts and guidance coming from central banks for me the alarm bells started ringing on inflation long before central bank language changed he says one of the advantages of being 61 is that your formative years were a period where inflation was the norm oil shocks were the norm for the last year i felt like i was harking back to that period miller s report card is harsh the bank of canada the fed and the rbnz i d be giving a c the rba a c and the rest including the boe an f for jerome haegeli the less is more mantra should extend to so called fedspeak the former swiss national bank economist says too many officials making public statements causes confusion he recommends that the fed take a lesson from the very lean swiss communications after the annual summer gathering of central bankers in the mountain retreat of jackson hole wyoming fed officials fanned out onto the public circuit in one 24 hour period three fed officials spoke about the economic outlook at three different events and with three different tones esther george emphasised steadiness over speed christopher waller signalled support for a 75 basis point interest rate rise at the next meeting and charles evans said he was open to 50 or 75 it s a similar story at the ecb where at least 19 of its primary officials were out giving speeches in the last week of september alone while central banks in most modern economies enjoy day to day independence their mandates are set by democratically elected governments in australia and new zealand authorities are reviewing the parameters of their directives to monetary policymakers to get their message across to the public the ecb has introduced cartoons and animated videos some of which accompany rate decisions and strategy review documents and bank indonesia which already has massive followings on facebook and instagram now also has its own tiktok account trying to communicate to both audiences the markets and the public can sometimes lead to confusion maintain flexibility advertisement a third common prescription for central banks ditch forward guidance that practice first adopted in the early 2000s aims to tell the public the likely direction of monetary policy the problem it s too hard to predict the future and it can lock policymakers into a particular mindset rba governor philip lowe during a hearing at parliament house on monday alex ellinghausen in an october 12 speech fed governor michelle bowman blamed the fomc s forward guidance for its failure to tackle inflation sooner the committee s explicit forward guidance for both the federal funds rate and asset purchases contributed to a situation where the stance of monetary policy remained too accommodative for too long even as inflation was rising and showing signs of becoming more broad based she said and broken promises can do real harm to investors confidence gsfm s miller cites lowe s failed guidance as an example phil lowe saying no rate increases to 2024 those kinds of messages are dead he says markets can no longer take central bankers at their word given that they ve pretended to be all seeing james athey investment director of rate management at edinburgh based abrdn warns that forward guidance won t end until central bankers stop speaking so often the sheer number of speeches by central bank policy makers in a given week and the seeming desire of these speakers to expound on their own subjective expectations for the economy and monetary policy means that even when the official communication is shying away from specific guidance there is still plenty for markets to latch on to he says communicating policy objectives gets more difficult as inflation climbs reserve bank of india governor shaktikanta das said in september it can be quite difficult to provide coherent and consistent guidance in a tightening cycle he said central bank communication in the current context has thus become even more challenging than the actual policy actions of course central banks will continue to play a crucial role in their economies even if they dial back the rhetoric and scrap more difficult to measure goals such as the promotion of inclusive growth they will continue

in today s money morning the stunning rise of new york city was an unlikely story control over trade flows propelled its rise but it was its eventual control over money flows that cemented it not just in the us but around the world however this power is now under threat a new new york is rising up and the powers that be don t like it the island of manhattan was famously sold off by indigenous inhabitants for us 24 worth of beads and trinkets not a bad deal for the wily dutch but it wasn t obvious for a while the us s agricultural resources grains tobacco dyes and cotton were mostly produced inland or in the southern states and new york had no vast gold deposits like south america either the main advantage it had was its natural harbour a harbour that provided the initial gateway to trade with europe but new york made the most of it in 1810 some clever financiers cooked up a scheme to build a canal from the great lakes at buffalo to new york s hudson river as you can see here it opened up new york city by ship to the country s vast interior the risky plan paid off commodities from all over the young nation were shipped to europe through the erie canal with new york collecting the toll on the way through on the return trip empty cargo ships would offer cheap passage to immigrants from europe looking for a better life and they came in droves the idea of the us and particularly new york a land of individual freedom and economic opportunity appealed to millions shut out from such opportunity in their own lands but what these immigrants found on arrival was often disappointing greedy robber barons wall street reptiles corrupt politicians riots and civil wars awaited them and yet they kept on coming over time the city adapted to each and every new group and each and every new challenge this melting pot of nations drawn together for a chance at the american dream became battle hardened to anything the world could throw at it if you could make it there you could make it anywhere during the gilded age of the late 1800s the city became a cultural icon too the new world s centre for art music and philanthropy and by the time the 20th century arrived new york was in the perfect position to take over the world thanks to its role as a trading centre it also became the financial centre of the us it was home to the new york stock exchange and all the major banks and over time as us dominance grew it became the global financial centre too the two world wars which bankrupted the european powers only sped up this process in short control over money is how new york became the city we know today but could this era of dominance be coming to an end and what will take over there s only one candidate their hatred runs deep in a way the story of new york reminds me of the story of bitcoin people get into bitcoin and crypto for many reasons sure to get rich and make a fast buck is one and yes there are scammers and frauds to contend with but like those early immigrants to new york people are also drawn to it for many more noble reasons too the idea of financial self sovereignty is the main one while that appeals to some people in western countries it s especially inviting to those in developing nations locked out of the global banking system or forced to use currencies prone to radical devaluation the benefits of bitcoin are often more blatantly obvious to such people to them bitcoin is a chance to fight back and take back control there s a great little list here of 13 human rights use cases for bitcoin put forward by new zealand environmentalist not some crypto bro daniel batten he finishes the list by adding most technologies cell phones the grid roll out in the west first the developing world first bitcoin flips that on its head this time the west will feel bitcoin s value last but don t assume that because you can t see value because you may have taken for granted the freedom affluence and human rights other don t have that value doesn t exit it does and it has been a lifeline for millions and don t assume the rights you enjoy today have cannot be taken away they can bitcoin protects us also i d echo this sentiment but for some reason it s not a feeling the mainstream press shares right now they re basking in the schadenfreude of the current crypto price woes here s an actual thanksgiving tweet put out by bloomberg funny perhaps but definitely telling i mean i don t see them publicly gloating about grandpa losing his nest egg in the worst bond market in history their hatred of bitcoin runs deep the funnier thing about what s happening right now is that it was actually their man in crypto that was the biggest fraud the truth of this may shock you money and power the current crypto carnage stems from the failure of a crypto exchange called ftx it was run by an american named sam bankman fried sbf you might know a bit about this and i won t go into the depths of it today but michael saylor got to the long and short of it bitcoiners true proponents of decentralised money have been calling out scams like this for years the inconvenient truth it was mainstream publications like this one that were giving legitimacy to sbf so are such publications offering apologies now fat chance in fact they re rushing to protect sbf explaining it all away as an unfortunate business mishap i kid you not this was the headline in the wall street journal what a joke think about it the mainstream has waged war on bitcoin and crypto for as long as i can remember taking any opportunity they could to take a potshot and yet when an obvious fraud like this is exposed they run puff pieces elon musk put it best in response but there s more here s another one this time from the new york times this is an unbelievably bad take on someone who essentially just stole other people s money again you can see elon musk s scathing response below it which begs the question why is he getting such protection on this some think sbf s links to the new york establishment run deep and that this is a concerted effort to protect people higher up the chain there s no doubt he s connected both his mum and dad are stanford law professors and his mum was a big democrat campaign fundraiser sbf himself gave us 39 8 million of stolen customer money to mainly democrat candidates before the recent mid term elections the whole thing stinks and some people think this was all actually a front for a deeper state plot there s definitely more to this story than meets the eye let s see what develops the only alternative i started off today s piece by talking about the rise of new york new york s story is about many things diverse people new ideals social and economic challenges new technologies and massive trade all helped shape it every chaos new york had to survive set it up for its eventual success but underneath it all new york is also the story of modern money don t forget new york is where jp morgan famously helped set up the federal reserve after the panic of 1907 a federal reserve that these days has the power to create or destroy money and whole economies at will but the fact is this centralised system of money is failing a lot of us right now we re feeling it through high inflation we re seeing it in the rise of unsustainable debts and we re seeing it play out in some of the worst instances of crony capitalism we ve ever seen things like this for example ask yourself how it s possible that the wealthiest people in the world got richer at a time global trade came to a standstill the answer is in this chart this graph shows the growth in us money supply over the past decade as you can see the fed threw money at covid which propped up the asset values of the rich it s pure manipulation manipulation of money has reached the point of no return while this is hurting us in the west it s a lot worse for people in places like turkey argentina and africa bitcoin isn t perfect but it s the only alternative that has a chance of beating the existing monetary powers and as a decentralised protocol open to all it welcomes anyone eager for economic opportunity and financial freedom just as new york welcomed those huddled masses in days gone by you might not know it yet but bitcoin is the new new york good investing ryan dinse editor money morning ps if you re looking for a good place to dive deeper i highly recommend you read this article from jeff booth he uses first principles to build a case of why deflationary money bitcoin is actually better for humanity than our current inflationary fiat money his reasoning is worth a read even if you re a bitcoin sceptic
the man who brought us charlie brown snoopy and the whole peanuts gang would be turning 100 today cartoonist charles schulz died in february 2000 the night before his final comic strip ran in the sunday paper but the characters he created and developed over the course of five decades still endure in the form of reruns beloved tv specials a movie and a museum dedicated to schulz s work so too does the comfort they provide that s according to schulz s widow jeannie schulz and gina huntsinger the director of the charles m schulz museum in santa rosa calif they spoke to morning edition about schulz s life and legacy which huntsinger calls pervasive sfipt schulz museum sfipt schulz museum charles schulz and jean schulz pictured in 1975 she says he s had a global influence from popularizing the term security blanket looking at you linus to inspiring peanuts fans from around the world to visit the museum the most common comment she gets is that people feel comforted by revisiting something nostalgic that still makes them laugh jeannie schulz offers another explanation for the comic s lasting and widespread appeal i always say that sparky expressed the human condition he wrote about real emotions that kids are feeling and it s always delivered with a little bit of humor she says anybody can read that strip in four seconds and get comfort from it because it talks about humanity alamy stock photo alamy stock photo in oct 1950 the first peanuts comic strip first appeared in seven newspapers across the u s more than 2 600 newspapers carried it by the end of its run in 2000 peanuts broke ground aesthetically and emotionally peanuts centers on the adventures and perspectives of children famously tuning out any off screen adults and it grew out of another schulz comic about precocious kids after serving in world war ii schulz who always wanted to be a cartoonist started working at his alma mater art instruction inc on a weekly panel comic called li l folks one of the principals at art instruction schools where he worked as a corrector of peoples art lessons said i think you should stick with the little kids jeannie schulz recalls that s what he turned in to all the syndicates to see if he could get a contract little kids no parents peanuts worldwide llc peanuts worldwide llc charlie brown looked a little different in his official debut in 1950 schulz told npr s fresh air decades later that he regretted drawing that strip because he thought i hate him was too strong a declaration schulz s original submission to united feature syndicate was a panel cartoon rather than a strip meaning it had no definite characters schulz himself recalled in a 1990 interview with npr s fresh air when he went to new york to sign the contract he brought half a dozen strips with him and the syndication service immediately said they d rather go with a strip because they were easier to market they said well you ll have to create some definite characters schulz remembered so i said well that s no problem because i already knew i liked to draw a little dog and i just went home and i asked my friend charlie brown if i could use his name and he said that was fine and so i created patty and shermy and those were the four lead characters the first peanuts strip appeared in newspapers across the country in october 1950 and they weren t like the other cartoons on the funny pages at that time huntsinger says aesthetically schulz s lines were simple and minimalistic using only what was necessary to tell the story and creatively huntsinger says he was a genius we could relate to his strip like we could see ourselves as charlie brown our kite s stuck in a tree again or the frustration of something happening she says and also charles schulz was the first one to really talk about emotions in the strip so it changed the cartooning industry he was so different than what was on the page when he first started brennan spark photography brennan spark photography the charles m schulz museum and research center in santa rosa calif says it has welcomed more than 1 million visitors from around the world since it opened in 2002 and has the largest collection of original comic strips on display at any given time it remains a source of comfort even in reruns schulz spent a lot of time with his characters over the decades as did the public by 2000 peanuts was running in more than 2 500 newspapers in 75 countries and he related to each of them telling fresh air that he doubted it would be possible to do something every day with a group of characters without each one of those characters being a little bit of myself that s probably why they changed in little ways over time he added i try to be consistent in their personalities but i also think that none of us is ever really consistent in the things that we do and say he said we all have our little good points and bad points this is what the characters have and while the universe he created lives on schulz was very clear that he didn t want anyone reviving peanuts after him his syndicate contract stipulated that when he stopped drawing the strip would stop schulz himself told fresh air that his children were the ones who insisted on that clause because they said we don t want anybody else drawing dad s strip peanuts worldwide llc peanuts worldwide llc after his colon cancer diagnosis schulz announced in december 1999 that he would stop drawing new peanuts cartoons and that the last strips would run in the new year he died in february 2000 the night before the final sunday strip published i hope that no one else ever touches the strip because the strip is me he said so while plenty of artists may have wanted to fill schulz s shoes jeannie says the peanuts cartoons that people herself included see in newspapers today are all reruns and what amazes me is that it s still funny she says you still want to read it right now snoopy s going to needles or somewhere to find spike and it s just funny she said that many people remember being comforted by the peanuts crew as kids like running home from school to shut themselves in their room with the paperbacks and still seek comfort in them now huntsinger agrees sfipt schulz museum sfipt schulz museum schulz in the 1990s we ve been listening to so many people talk around the centennial and one of the cartoonists said you know people are trying to sell us things all the time like you re supposed to be happy you re supposed to do this and charles schulz sort of said it like it was so people were like yeah i get these characters i feel a part of this they speak to me the interviews for this story were conducted by a martínez produced by taylor haney and edited by hj mai copyright 2022 npr to

mr levin co founded chainalysis alongside michael gronager in 2014 in new york building the company to be the world s foremost cryptocurrency data analysis and investigative tool provider chainalysis has helped governments track crypto movement in and out of russia as it invaded ukraine and highlighted how north korean hackers launder stolen cryptocurrencies mr levin was unable to comment directly on the ftx investigation because chainalysis has been retained to track the us600 million in cryptocurrencies that were drained from ftx accounts the same day the company was declared bankrupt nearly three weeks ago chainalysis is also a creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings as ftx had been a customer but mr levin said the ftx fiasco has sharpened investor and customer understanding of how misunderstood assets like cryptocurrencies can be manipulated by those with malicious intent what we re talking about here is a financial fraud first and foremost mr levin said of the ftx collapse which has sparked a worldwide sell off in crypto assets and thrown the integrity of the industry into doubt advertisement but this isn t a reflection of the technology itself it s a reflection of the operating principles of a group of people and the lessons that will be learnt aren t really about the underlying technology in any way it s really about the essence of their governance operating procedures segregating customer funds all those things that are very well known in traditional financial markets legislation coming that the crypto industry is mimicking the faults of traditional finance like the overleveraged assets that led to the demise of lehman brothers means regulations for the industry are coming fast when it comes to what happened to ftx and alameda we re still in the stages of finding out exactly what happened and the lessons to learn mr levin said but you ve seen over time that crypto overcomes these challenges and the things people throw at it along the way advertisement cryptos have moved beyond very simple transactions where either one person has the money or another person has the money we ve moved to a world where there s more complicated sets of transactions thanks to smart contracts there will soon be comprehensive oversight on how these technologies are used chainalysis has confirmed that some of the funds stolen from ftx have moved to accounts linked to the bahamas regulators who were eager to ensure assets were not completely removed to the united states where the bankruptcy proceedings have started the rest of the stolen money has moved to the account of an individual actor who seems to be transferring it through decentralised exchanges meaning accounts cannot be frozen by a governing body in the hopes of cashing the money out to bitcoin what market participants do to update their operating procedures is one thing mr levin said the other is really looking on chain about how did this money flow what did it look like and marrying that with the off chain data about what loans were taken out and who earned money from what and what claims are levered on different assets mr levin argues that while the ftx collapse is damaging for new retail investors it is unlikely to disrupt the growth in tokenisation or blockchain based business development advertisement for those that have lost money and have been really hurt by such a massive failure that s really upsetting i don t think some of those people will come back to crypto very quickly because their trust has been broken and that s fair he said but the reasons why people got involved in crypto this year has nothing to do with speculation it had to do with nfts or gaming or music or something completely different non fungible tokens or nfts exploded in popularity last year as people began experimenting with tokenising digital assets across different industries using blockchain based technology people were able to create digital things that could not be copied or replicated for people who got involved in crypto for those reasons i don t think this collapse has a major implication in the way they think about things mr levin said while sam bankman fried faces questions over the mismanagement of customer money in ftx chainalysis has pointed out the collapse isn t as significant as other collapses like that of japanese based exchange mt gox in 2014 the analysis firm said that mt gox accounted for a much larger proportion of customer funds lost booking around 10 9 per cent of total crypto inflows in the 12 months before its collapse versus 4 7 per cent for ftx advertisement chainalysis is also researching the behaviour of trading firm alameda research which appears to have lost billions of dollars in trades over the last 18 months on chain analysts have suggested that alameda lost billions of dollars that were stored in cross chain bridges cross chain bridges are software applications that enable transactions to occur between various blockchains one cryptocurrency is placed in a type of escrow and its equivalent is issued in another wrapped cryptocurrency while mr levin would not confirm alameda had lost money in hacks on bridges over the last year he did reaffirm they remain a prominent security risk there have been several attacks on different bridges and it s fair to characterise those as very vulnerable cybersecurity risks in the cryptocurrency ecosystem he said

mk bhadrakumar former ambassador at the initiative of the united states the g7 nations have agreed to set a fixed price cap on russian oil from december 5 the cutoff date for the european union s eu import of russian oil the price cap is a novel approach energy sanctions generally target export volumes but this plan would instead cut prices crucially the g7 also bans eu companies from providing shipping insurance brokering services or financing for oil exports from russia to third countries the g7 s price cap calculus was always rather ambiguous ostensibly aimed at trimming russia s oil revenue but also making sure russian oil kept flowing the level of the cap is to be announced but bloomberg reported last wednesday that the g7 is expected to settle on a figure from within the 65 70 range this is intriguing since it will be a level rather generous to moscow well above its cost of production which is estimated to be less than 10 per barrel russian oil currently trades at a significant discount compared to brent around 65 per barrel and if the g7 price cap is going to be set at a similar level it wouldn t do much harm to russia the us and its european allies made such a fuss about india s purchase of russian oil but only to veer around to possibly adopting roughly the same price at which india is purchasing as their ceiling what a delightful irony india enjoys considerable discounts for russian crude and can purchase as much as it likes from its time tested friend from a marginal presence in the indian market before the ukraine war began russia figured as the top supplier in october according to russia s ministry of finance the average price of urals russian blend in october was 70 6 per barrel while the average price of brent was 93 3 ie the average discount of russian oil to brent was about 22 7 or 24 now with brent trading at around 85 a barrel last wednesday that would imply a price of 50 60 a barrel of urals which is below the cap under discussion by the eu interestingly the latest us treasury guidance published last tuesday says the cap will be placed on what are known as free on board fob prices which do not include the cost of insurance and shipping fob would be the price that the crude would be sold if a buyer picked it up from a russian terminal indian refiners typically pay for crude to be delivered to them and that price includes insurance and freight that is india is paying 15 20 a barrel below brent for delivered urals crude the g7 s price cap calculus was always rather ambiguous ostensibly aimed at trimming russia s oil revenue but also making sure russian oil kept flowing in effect the reported g7 price cap may be actually softening the impact of the impending eu sanctions on russian oil indeed that could be the hidden agenda the oil market is full of clever rapacious people who are virtuosos in bending or breaking rules if a price cap is imposed economic theory will collide with the messy reality of the market steven mnuchin the former us treasury secretary said recently that the plan by the g7 countries to impose a price cap on russian oil was not only not feasible i think it s the most ridiculous idea i ve ever heard mnuchin added that the market is going to set the price russia has warned of consequences trust the kremlin to make the g7 a laughing stock if these westerners are indeed bent upon their professed intent to control russia s national income since demand for cheaper russian oil will outstrip supply the price cap will create multiple prices the global crude price the capped price and a shadow price that would settle somewhere between the two that will open flood gates for traders and middlemen monitoring and enforcement will be challenging ship to ship transfers illicit tanker trade crude blending etc will proliferate besides if the price of russian brands with a discount exceeds the likely g7 price ceiling alternative carriers and insurers in the regions outside the eu will be found the local non eu tanker fleet will have insurance from state reinsurance companies too since the g7 price cap does not include transportation and insurance costs all that may eventually increase the export of russian oil thus the end result would be the loss of lucrative business for london as the world s leading centre for maritime insurance services including p i and for greek shipping companies will g7 trigger such a calamity the bottom line is that although the g7 is trying to sell the price cap plan to the world audience as an anti russian masterstroke the hidden agenda is something else to adjust the ceiling to the real selling price of russian oil in the asia pacific countries which is now just approaching 70 by building the system in such a way that it would be beneficial for russia to join it optics apart by imposing a ceiling on russian oil prices the west in reality seeks to gain access to russia s domestic hydrocarbons on equal terms with asian buyers if the flow of russian raw materials continues to go mainly to asia china and india principally this region will gain competitive advantages in the global economic struggle the big picture is that russia is after all not facing defeat in ukraine and europe will need russian oil in future in fact g7 has exempted a number of european countries and japan from the december 5 embargo on russian oil the sound of muffled laughter can be heard filtering through the walls of shastri bhawan and north block on the ceremonial boulevard of the indian government in delhi

stock image photo courtesy usu extension st george news feature recent u s census bureau data show that slightly more utah women are earning bachelor s degrees than utah men 23 4 vs 22 6 however utah has the most significant educational attainment gap among advanced degree holders in the u s nationally 13 of females and 12 4 of males have a graduate degree but in utah only 9 3 of females have a graduate degree compared to 14 1 of males to better understand this disparity a research team at utah state university led by sojung lim associate professor of sociology in partnership with the usu utah woman leadership project collected quantitative and qualitative data examining the resources and challenges of women pursuing undergraduate or graduate degrees this report is the first of two and summarizes results from the quantitative data the goal of this study was to examine the challenges utah women face when they pursue higher education said susan madsen founding director of the uwlp understanding this will help us learn how to better assist women in attaining higher education which will in turn help in other areas of inequity including the gender wage gap study results came from a survey of utah women 18 or older enrolled in colleges universities pursuing an undergraduate or graduate degree participants were recruited through the registrar s and graduate offices of utah universities and through social media platforms and professional networks in june 2022 907 women completed the survey participant demographics showed characteristics unique to utah that may affect women s educational attainment for example more than one in four undergraduate students and almost half of graduate students were married and 1 in 5 women have child ren more than one in five women were employed full time and almost half were employed part time in addition those in graduate programs were more racially and religiously diverse than women in undergraduate programs when asked why they went to college about 30 reported wanting to learn skills necessary for their desired job one in four respondents said they felt an undergraduate degree was necessary regardless of their career life goals and about 17 chose college to increase potential earnings to better understand utah women s educational aspirations and goals they were asked if they plan to go to graduate school almost half said they were considering it this result is somewhat surprising given that utah is the state with the largest gender gap in advanced education among all states lim said it suggests that challenges and circumstances not ambition and desire are influencing the gap the study showed that women in graduate programs were older and more diverse in terms of race ethnicity and religious affiliation compared to those in undergraduate programs in addition women in graduate programs were more likely to be married cohabiting and have at least one child graduate students worked at higher rates and were more likely to hold regular full time jobs than undergraduates additionally the percentage of women who rated their health as good very good or excellent was slightly higher among graduate students than undergraduates women in undergraduate programs with clear career goals appear to be aware of the benefits of graduate degrees and how they can advance their careers and economic prospects conversely those with unclear career goals and strong family orientations are less interested in graduate school also financial and time burdens associated with graduate programs are significant barriers half of utah women in higher education have considered leaving school due to financial difficulties many undergraduate women did not consider attending graduate school due to the cost and time commitment these concerns could be alleviated if women understood that many graduate students receive financial support from their programs through assistantships and fellowships another challenge for utah women is learning to manage family responsibilities and education this could be addressed by making students aware of childcare services and providing mentoring programs that target students with children a final challenge was women not fully understanding their career goals and the pathways that lead to them undergraduate students who were less inclined to attend graduate school often lacked knowledge about it i e what graduate school entails resources available potential benefits and return on investment lim said through this research we realized the importance of raising awareness and addressing barriers early during secondary and undergraduate education so more women consider and plan to pursue advanced degrees institutions of higher education government agencies businesses and individuals can innovate ways of supporting women in higher education both financially and emotionally so more women complete advanced degrees taking steps will not only mitigate gender disparity in advanced education in utah but will move the needle in other areas of gender inequity in the state including the gender wage gap additional report authors are claudia wright usu ph d

pollution and congestion in the wake of urban stress and deprivation the experience of a returnee by david z logan i recently concluded a three week visit to monrovia from october to november 2022 this write up is a few of my thoughts and experiences during the visit with an additional reflection on the future management of the city to begin with getting around in monrovia s urban spaces is cumbersome and a commuter s nightmare somehow the city managers and urban and transport planners have decided to reconstruct all three major road arteries in the city at about the same time entry into monrovia from the northeast via kakata through to the red light district market is a nightmare due to the ongoing reconstruction of the elwa to the coca cola road axis and the omega market bottleneck from the south eastern end of the country via robertsfield ria axis there is also the famous reconstruction of the airport entry route into monrovia connecting the elwa to liberia revenue authority intersection on tubman boulevard all of these works are ongoing simultaneously and as if these are not enough there has been the recent completion of the duala market building project causing further delayed access into the city from the western cape mount and bomi axis the duala market is an important but congested open air market in greater monrovia covering an area of about 0 20 km2 these are all remarkable urban planning and project delivery efforts it however ignores the need for efficient mobility of the population for the needed delivery of public and private services that serve as the lifeblood of urban life how did we get here it is interesting that my visit in part coincided with the anticipated launch of the 2022 national population and housing census let s remind ourselves that census data provides critical information for urban planning transformation and delivery of services monrovia s spatial demography has followed an important trend showing clearly an increase in the population of the city relative to its land area and social and economic infrastructure greater monrovia is the capital region of liberia and the nucleus of the country s economy over 40 of liberians live in greater monrovia which comprises the cities of monrovia and paynesville as well as 12 smaller townships urban areas in liberia are classified with a population of more than 2 000 persons by lisgis own account the total population of the greater monrovia area was 970 824 in 2008 however compared to the overall population of montserrado county 1 118 241 one soon realizes that out of every ten persons living in montserrado about nine reside in greater monrovia 87 percent furthermore montserrado county of which monrovia comprises 87 percent of its population has the highest population growth rate of 3 5 as compared to other counties and the national population growth rate of 2 1 despite the drop in the average household size from 5 4 persons per household in 1984 to 4 7 in 2008 the total population of the capital has increased lisgis 2009 the reasons for monrovia s high population growth include an upsurge in both rural to urban migration and inter urban migration the larger economy of liberia is centered mainly in monrovia and there are large disparities between monrovia and other parts of the country in terms of wealth infrastructure and possibilities for citizen participation in city governance during the civil war when monrovia was under the control of peacekeeping forces many rural liberians fled to monrovia for safety and security since the conflict ended many of those internally displaced persons have chosen to remain in the city and can be seen working as security guards at many of the city s supermarkets and other small businesses while others do menial jobs across the city like cities across africa the development of infrastructure and social services can hardly keep pace with rapid population growth leaving many of monrovia s poorer neighborhoods in slum like conditions combined with extensive war damage monrovia faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding at the same time as expanding its urban infrastructure it is therefore understandable that the urban transport network needs to be improved but to do so all combined and at the same time with so much congestion is bewildering according to a recent world bank report the greater monrovia urban review 2020 liberia enjoys the characterization together with the central african republic as being the only two countries that have experienced urbanization without economic growth past and present trends show that the population of persons living in urban areas in liberia has been on the increase since 1974 past census data show that 29 percent of the population of liberia was living in urban areas in 1974 and the level of urbanization increased to 39 percent in 1984 and 47 percent in 2008 the current projected population of monrovia is 1 6 million 2022 and is expected to reach 2 1 million by 2030 urban population growth can sometimes be beneficial especially if it is matched by a concomitant increase in urban trade and industry and the provision of employment it is therefore a continuing worrying sign that monrovia like the rest of liberia urban areas is caught in this non economic growth dynamism my observations on a typical day in monrovia a gridlock of vehicles and keh keh mini tricycle taxis run bumper to bumper amid the tooting of deafening horns throughout the city this is even more so in the crowded adjoining urban communities of red light elwa junction and the duala market axis hundreds of weary looking and frustrated members of the traveling public are seen shoving each other at parked buses taxis and keh keh stops as they try to outmuscle each other to access commercial vehicles in addition scores of pedestrians can also be seen struggling to meander their way through the traffic jam in a desperate attempt to get to their destinations the various road users are constantly competing for the same inadequate road infrastructure that has no provisions for other means of urban mobility thereby offering limited options for pedestrians no wonder motorbike accidents are commonplace the victims of the accidents are taken to hospitals and other emergency wards and clinics in and around monrovia monrovia urban planners and city managers will need to reinforce its urban resilience systems awareness coping adapting and transforming the urban spaces clearly cities that invest in and implement policies to build resilience are better equipped to withstand shocks address chronic stresses and mitigate the risks derived from both weak urban resilience on the other hand perpetuates the poverty trap the urban poor particularly those living in unsafe areas and informal settlements are often the most vulnerable to risk planning implications of such rapid urbanization in the absence of efficient urban services mobility and jobs monrovia urban governance officials must begin to plan for other urban transport modes the recently completed redlight to gardnerville and the freeport axis seems a good place to start this is an urgent requirement a river transport system right through from paynesville to the downtown waterside and waterfront areas will greatly enhance the scenic beauty and promote the return of entertainment and other businesses the downtown monrovia old central business district cbd can also be redesigned to accommodate a bicycle riding culture and link this to historical preservation and urban tourism initiatives that will rope in providence island providence baptist church centennial pavilion the national museum to the ducor hotel and masonic temple on the mesurabo hills all in downtown monrovia planning for and developing open urban spaces to serve as digital technology hubs that plug in with existing services for young people including the ymca etc can restore vibrancy to the downtown areas such an initiative will bring back jobs and growth decent dining experiences and vintage heritage shops this should happen alongside the new trend that is shaping businesses away from the central downtown to the access routes into the city especially along the kakata fendell and elwa to robertsfield highways that are closely following the growth of residential neighborhoods along these axes the great urban planner of new york ny mr robert moses took on a similar gargantuan task when he reshaped the urban landscape and infrastructure of the city of ny early in this century moses s far reaching planning approaches and dynamism gave new york city and other public spaces in the entire state of new york its world famous accolades under robert moses s leadership public parks beltways highways bridges public housing and the famous niagara falls in upstate ny were built these monumental infrastructures generated and the urban service economy have given the city of new york its acclaimed status empowering city states have been shown to be good for growth monrovia is in desperate need for jobs for its teeming young population skills will have to be built among this segment of the population and a culture of discipline must be ingrained to attract the needed investment for jobs and additional urban infrastructure and services china rwanda and other countries have developed the policies that empower local urban communities and their municipal metropolitan governments to lead the improvement in urban services and by extension economic growth can monrovia pick the signals for the economic growth revival of its urban spaces and services one option is to use the issuance of municipal bonds to finance its urban renewal and resilience the capacity for financing through bonds and other investment instruments will first have to be developed among key stakeholders and partners skills building will be critical and there are likely to be willing partners the banks and insurance service providers estate and other property developers etc in this direction the return of the french development agency agence francaise de development afd is a welcome development david logan is a policy analyst in the past he has worked at the university of liberia and the ministry of health in monrovia

bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs sounds like the perfect net zero solution grow some form of plant material burn that material for energy capture the co2 emitted during combustion and store it underground you can then grow more plant feedstock in the same area which sucks up carbon from the atmosphere meaning at the end of it all you have created energy at a net loss of carbon but despite its utopian pretensions beccs has yet again found itself at the centre of a scandal involving unsustainable practices in the sourcing of biomass feedstock in october the bbc s panorama alleged that uk based power producer drax bought logging licences to cut down two areas of environmentally important forest in british columbia including large areas that have been identified as rare old growth forest a new report released in november by sustainability non profit forum for the future outlined 30 strict conditions that must be met if beccs is to deliver positive outcomes for society climate and the economy but after a series of similar controversies calling into question beccs s sustainable credentials is it finally time to call it quits on the tantalising dream of this fanciful decarbonised energy technology drax s power station in north yorkshire england photo by phil silverman via shutterstock problems with sustainability and costs first conceived in the 1990s beccs is the world s only carbon removal technology that can also provide energy beccs plants can capture anything from the process emissions from biofuel and biohydrogen production to combustion emissions from biomass fuelled heat and power generation organic waste to energy and industrial applications fired by biomass cement pulp and paper or from using biochar as a reducing agent steel instead of being stored the captured carbon can alternatively be used to create various products today only around two megatonnes mt of co2 are captured each year from biogenic sources with around 1mt of co2 stored in dedicated storage more than 90 is captured in bioethanol facilities one of the lowest cost beccs applications due to the high concentration of co2 in the process gas stream from january 2021 to june 2022 companies announced plans for more than 50 new facilities involving beccs which would add around 20mt of co2 of capture capacity per year based on current projections carbon removal through beccs could reach around 40mt of co2 per year by 2030 although that still falls well short of the 250mt per year by 2030 required under the international energy agency s iea net zero emissions by 2050 scenario despite the iea s endorsement the technology has its drawbacks in 2019 campaign group sandbag warned that europe s beccs plans would accelerate rather than address the climate crisis by potentially destroying forests quicker than they can grow back due to the staggering amount of tree cutting needed to fuel beccs plants the group warned that the amount of biomass pellets needed to fire europe s beccs plants would equate to half the size of germany s black forest each year similarly the daily telegraph reported earlier this year that the uk government s beccs targets would require burning the equivalent of the new forest national park every five months how well do you really know your competitors access the most comprehensive company profiles on the market

warrant that the email address submitted is your corporate email address you ll eventually start eating into carbon stocks says pieter de pous leader of the fossil fuel transition programme at environmental think tank e3g on a very fundamental level there is an opportunity cost issue of mobilising biomass for energy purposes because storing carbon in natural ecosystems is actually another way of taking carbon out of the atmosphere then there are the supply chain issues in 2019 a decade long investigation by media independent watchdogs and ngos revealed that global demand for wood pellets to burn for biomass energy primarily in the uk and europe was devastating forests in the south east us the investigation exposed damaging logging practices used by enviva the world s largest wood pellet manufacturer to supply wood pellets to the bioenergy industry including the clearcutting of iconic wetland forests this involved chopping down vast quantities of native hardwood trees in biodiversity hotspots enviva would then ship the pellets from these ravaged forests to utilities overseas such as the uk s drax power station traceability is a big issue says dr alexandre köberle an advanced research fellow at the grantham institute at imperial college london how can you tell where this material is coming from it is being produced in the us burnt in the uk by one company and then sunk into the north sea by another and as you scale the industry up that will become even more of a problem there are also real cost challenges that have yet to be ironed out carbon capture and storage ccs technology is still in its infancy and continues to be expensive and under deployed with the limited capacity coming online likely to be focused on hard to abate industries such as cement and steel we don t expect anyone ever to do ccs seriously in the power sector says de pous on the bioenergy side there is a fundamental problem in that unlike wind solar and batteries the costs will actually go up as the industry scales because your feedstock is your main cost factor limited supply more demand says de pous so to make it work you are going to need to sustain very generous subsidies indefinitely in fact just days after the uk government committed to increased forest protections at cop27 a new report commissioned by the us ngo natural resources defense council nrdc revealed that it spent almost 2bn to subsidise the logging of forests for bioenergy in 2021 the vast majority going to drax this was the highest out of the 11 european countries analysed and constituted a 70 increase from 2015 in the future subsidies for just one uk beccs project are forecast to hit 3 8bn 4 59bn beccs where is it working yet the un ipcc s sixth assessment report concluded there is a role for beccs in the net zero transition and many companies are investing in the technology the largest operating beccs project to date is the illinois industrial ccs bioethanol plant which has been capturing 1mt of co2 per year for permanent storage in a deep geological formation since 2018 the red trail energy bioethanol project also recently came online in north dakota other small scale bioethanol facilities are capturing co2 in europe and the us but these either sell the co2 to greenhouses for yield boosting or use it for enhanced oil recovery a large scale biomass fired power plant in japan was retrofitted with carbon capture in 2020 although a storage site for the co2 has yet to be identified that same year drax s uk power plant the largest biomass fired plant in the world started a pilot capturing up to 1tco2 per day at one of its four 660mw biomass units however the co2 is released after capture globally around 40 bioethanol facilities are planning to capture co2 before 2030 totalling more than 15mt of capture capacity according to the iea there are also plans to capture around 15mt of biogenic co2 from heat and power plants with around two thirds from dedicated bio power plants and a third from waste to energy plants in industry five cement plants are planning to integrate biomass feedstock into the clinker production process and retrofit carbon capture utilisation and storage ccus note however that some cement plants plan to use beccs for carbon neutrality rather than removal such as the brevik norcem plant in norway the cementa slite plant in sweden and the k6 lumbres project in france there are also a couple of projects targeting ccus retrofits at pulp and paper mills in norway and indonesia and plans for two hydrogen production facilities to run partly or fully on biomass however i am not aware of anywhere in the world where beccs is currently being done sustainably says köberle de pous concurs to get to that point the iea concedes the industry needs to evolve in key areas the capture technology needs to become more efficient and less energy intensive with much hope pinned on the development of solid absorption capture and biomass gasification technology biomass facilities should also be focused within industrial clusters to leverage economies of scale and aggregation finally the beccs value chain the biomass supply feedstock pre processing bioenergy plants and co2 storage are rarely co located which means additional mapping and infrastructure is needed to connect them in a sustainable and traceable manner however de pous believes the iea s faith in the technology is built on false premises the energy system modellers have misunderstood the issue of opportunity costs and competing land use they talk about lots of degraded land ready to be exploited not understanding there is a reason the land is degraded there is no virgin land left out there that is not already performing a function an arrow in the quiver it remains an open question whether despite all its negative press beccs should keep its place in countries net zero armouries or whether the time and resource would be better spent elsewhere as well as the iea the un s ipcc and the uk s independent advisory panel the climate change committee have both given the technology their blessing the 2021 coalition for negative emissions report produced by various stakeholders within industry found that at least one gigatonne gt per year of negative emissions from beccs is needed globally by 2025 and 4gt annually by 2030 to keep global warming within the paris agreement s target of 1 5 c of warming that could be mobilised sustainably from agricultural residues woody residues and energy crops grown on degraded land states the report similarly a recent national renewable energy laboratory report indicates that by 2035 the us will need 100mt of carbon removals from beccs to offset remaining positive carbon emissions in the power sector the deployment must start by 2026 and the installed capacity range must be 7 14gw by 2035 in the uk a drax commissioned study by the energy consultancy baringa found that drax s beccs project will save the country 26bn in reaching its 2050 net zero target baringa reached that figure by calculating the opportunity cost of having to start another project afresh as well as the value of facilitating decarbonisation earlier in the country s pathway beccs is critical to energy security as well as global efforts to urgently address the climate crisis because no other technology can deliver reliable renewable power whatever the weather whilst permanently removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere a drax spokesperson told energy monitor others are less convinced however an analysis done by tim searchinger a senior research scholar at the princeton school of public and international affairs and senior fellow at the world resources institute found that to produce 20 of human energy needs from bioenergy by 2050 would require an amount of biomass equal to all the plants harvested annually across the entire world all the crops crop residues wood and grasses eaten by livestock the world does not have the room searchinger writes every time we dedicate land to bioenergy we sacrifice the opportunity to use that land for some other human need ranging from food to carbon storage the trade off is a bad one because bioenergy is an inefficient use of land furthermore a 2021 nrdc analysis revealed that a large portion of lifecycle co2 emissions deriving from bioenergy actually occur offsite away from the biomass power station and are therefore uncapturable by the addition of ccs at the smokestack these emissions equal to approximately 60 of the stack emissions at the plant come from logging the trees converting them into wood pellets at manufacturing facilities and transporting them across the world the analysis indicates that employing beccs at a power station like drax s while relying on the biomass supply chains that dominate the company s fuel supplies today is responsible for roughly 80 as much carbon as a coal plant per megawatt hour even after accounting for subsequent forest regrowth and on site carbon capture at the power plant there aren t any countries in the world presently using beccs from biomass combustion at scale says elly pepper deputy director for nrdc since it hasn t been proven at scale no country can or should rely on it very few countries have captured carbon from mixed waste combustion which would be classified as partial beccs except on a very small really experimental scale she adds i think both bioenergy and ccs are plays of operators to keep coal plants running a bit longer says de pous neither are scalable solutions as with most debates surrounding potential climate solutions today the arguments around beccs can quickly devolve into research paper tit for tats between advocates and detractors with the veracity of the findings often difficult to discern however for what it is worth one of the most reputable analyses of the issue sees merit in both camps the 2019 analysis from imperial s grantham institute concludes that beccs could be a useful tool in the net zero transition but should be deployed on a relatively small scale and only in areas where it has already proven to be beneficial primarily for biofuels rather than power production it is not a silver bullet it is one arrow in your quiver says köberle a co author of the report ccs isn t scaling fast enough to support these 10 15gt per year sequestration scenarios so the limited capacity you do have should be saved for bioliquids rather than bioelectricity he points out that electricity has many cheap carbon free alternatives such as wind and solar power whereas biofuels have few particularly for aviation and freight transport to that end second generation drop in biofuels can be synthesised by breaking down the molecules in biomass and reassembling them to imitate fuels used in engines maybe having 100 or so beccs power plants globally is not a problem to provide some baseload power but the feedstock has got to be sustainably sourced agricultural or forestry residues adds köberle there is a value in beccs but how it is done is extremely important and the enviva drax example shows exactly how not to do it

pollution and congestion in the wake of urban stress and deprivation the experience of a returnee by david z logan i recently concluded a three week visit to monrovia from october to november 2022 this write up is a few of my thoughts and experiences during the visit with an additional reflection on the future management of the city to begin with getting around in monrovia s urban spaces is cumbersome and a commuter s nightmare somehow the city managers and urban and transport planners have decided to reconstruct all three major road arteries in the city at about the same time entry into monrovia from the northeast via kakata through to the red light district market is a nightmare due to the ongoing reconstruction of the elwa to the coca cola road axis and the omega market bottleneck from the south eastern end of the country via robertsfield ria axis there is also the famous reconstruction of the airport entry route into monrovia connecting the elwa to liberia revenue authority intersection on tubman boulevard all of these works are ongoing simultaneously and as if these are not enough there has been the recent completion of the duala market building project causing further delayed access into the city from the western cape mount and bomi axis the duala market is an important but congested open air market in greater monrovia covering an area of about 0 20 km2 these are all remarkable urban planning and project delivery efforts it however ignores the need for efficient mobility of the population for the needed delivery of public and private services that serve as the lifeblood of urban life how did we get here it is interesting that my visit in part coincided with the anticipated launch of the 2022 national population and housing census let s remind ourselves that census data provides critical information for urban planning transformation and delivery of services monrovia s spatial demography has followed an important trend showing clearly an increase in the population of the city relative to its land area and social and economic infrastructure greater monrovia is the capital region of liberia and the nucleus of the country s economy over 40 of liberians live in greater monrovia which comprises the cities of monrovia and paynesville as well as 12 smaller townships urban areas in liberia are classified with a population of more than 2 000 persons by lisgis own account the total population of the greater monrovia area was 970 824 in 2008 however compared to the overall population of montserrado county 1 118 241 one soon realizes that out of every ten persons living in montserrado about nine reside in greater monrovia 87 percent furthermore montserrado county of which monrovia comprises 87 percent of its population has the highest population growth rate of 3 5 as compared to other counties and the national population growth rate of 2 1 despite the drop in the average household size from 5 4 persons per household in 1984 to 4 7 in 2008 the total population of the capital has increased lisgis 2009 the reasons for monrovia s high population growth include an upsurge in both rural to urban migration and inter urban migration the larger economy of liberia is centered mainly in monrovia and there are large disparities between monrovia and other parts of the country in terms of wealth infrastructure and possibilities for citizen participation in city governance during the civil war when monrovia was under the control of peacekeeping forces many rural liberians fled to monrovia for safety and security since the conflict ended many of those internally displaced persons have chosen to remain in the city and can be seen working as security guards at many of the city s supermarkets and other small businesses while others do menial jobs across the city like cities across africa the development of infrastructure and social services can hardly keep pace with rapid population growth leaving many of monrovia s poorer neighborhoods in slum like conditions combined with extensive war damage monrovia faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding at the same time as expanding its urban infrastructure it is therefore understandable that the urban transport network needs to be improved but to do so all combined and at the same time with so much congestion is bewildering according to a recent world bank report the greater monrovia urban review 2020 liberia enjoys the characterization together with the central african republic as being the only two countries that have experienced urbanization without economic growth past and present trends show that the population of persons living in urban areas in liberia has been on the increase since 1974 past census data show that 29 percent of the population of liberia was living in urban areas in 1974 and the level of urbanization increased to 39 percent in 1984 and 47 percent in 2008 the current projected population of monrovia is 1 6 million 2022 and is expected to reach 2 1 million by 2030 urban population growth can sometimes be beneficial especially if it is matched by a concomitant increase in urban trade and industry and the provision of employment it is therefore a continuing worrying sign that monrovia like the rest of liberia urban areas is caught in this non economic growth dynamism my observations on a typical day in monrovia a gridlock of vehicles and keh keh mini tricycle taxis run bumper to bumper amid the tooting of deafening horns throughout the city this is even more so in the crowded adjoining urban communities of red light elwa junction and the duala market axis hundreds of weary looking and frustrated members of the traveling public are seen shoving each other at parked buses taxis and keh keh stops as they try to outmuscle each other to access commercial vehicles in addition scores of pedestrians can also be seen struggling to meander their way through the traffic jam in a desperate attempt to get to their destinations the various road users are constantly competing for the same inadequate road infrastructure that has no provisions for other means of urban mobility thereby offering limited options for pedestrians no wonder motorbike accidents are commonplace the victims of the accidents are taken to hospitals and other emergency wards and clinics in and around monrovia monrovia urban planners and city managers will need to reinforce its urban resilience systems awareness coping adapting and transforming the urban spaces clearly cities that invest in and implement policies to build resilience are better equipped to withstand shocks address chronic stresses and mitigate the risks derived from both weak urban resilience on the other hand perpetuates the poverty trap the urban poor particularly those living in unsafe areas and informal settlements are often the most vulnerable to risk planning implications of such rapid urbanization in the absence of efficient urban services mobility and jobs monrovia urban governance officials must begin to plan for other urban transport modes the recently completed redlight to gardnerville and the freeport axis seems a good place to start this is an urgent requirement a river transport system right through from paynesville to the downtown waterside and waterfront areas will greatly enhance the scenic beauty and promote the return of entertainment and other businesses the downtown monrovia old central business district cbd can also be redesigned to accommodate a bicycle riding culture and link this to historical preservation and urban tourism initiatives that will rope in providence island providence baptist church centennial pavilion the national museum to the ducor hotel and masonic temple on the mesurabo hills all in downtown monrovia planning for and developing open urban spaces to serve as digital technology hubs that plug in with existing services for young people including the ymca etc can restore vibrancy to the downtown areas such an initiative will bring back jobs and growth decent dining experiences and vintage heritage shops this should happen alongside the new trend that is shaping businesses away from the central downtown to the access routes into the city especially along the kakata fendell and elwa to robertsfield highways that are closely following the growth of residential neighborhoods along these axes the great urban planner of new york ny mr robert moses took on a similar gargantuan task when he reshaped the urban landscape and infrastructure of the city of ny early in this century moses s far reaching planning approaches and dynamism gave new york city and other public spaces in the entire state of new york its world famous accolades under robert moses s leadership public parks beltways highways bridges public housing and the famous niagara falls in upstate ny were built these monumental infrastructures generated and the urban service economy have given the city of new york its acclaimed status empowering city states have been shown to be good for growth monrovia is in desperate need for jobs for its teeming young population skills will have to be built among this segment of the population and a culture of discipline must be ingrained to attract the needed investment for jobs and additional urban infrastructure and services china rwanda and other countries have developed the policies that empower local urban communities and their municipal metropolitan governments to lead the improvement in urban services and by extension economic growth can monrovia pick the signals for the economic growth revival of its urban spaces and services one option is to use the issuance of municipal bonds to finance its urban renewal and resilience the capacity for financing through bonds and other investment instruments will first have to be developed among key stakeholders and partners skills building will be critical and there are likely to be willing partners the banks and insurance service providers estate and other property developers etc in this direction the return of the french development agency agence francaise de development afd is a welcome development david logan is a policy analyst in the past he has worked at the university of liberia and the ministry of health in monrovia

when french president emmanuel macron made his first state visit to washington in 2018 he was in the midst of a fleeting bromance with u s president donald trump and the transatlantic alliance was in disarray a champion of both multilateralism and pragmatism the french president was on a mission to convince trump to remain in the 2015 iran nuclear deal and maintain a significant u s military presence in northeastern syria neither of which was to be macron s second state visit on december 1 2022 will take place in a very different context it comes a year after a public spat between france and the united states over the latter s new security partnership with australia and the united kingdom known as aukus which cost paris a valuable submarine deal with canberra and at a time of renewed transatlantic unity following russia s invasion of ukraine u s leadership in europe has been reaffirmed while france s and germany s has been called into question europe s center of gravity has moved east toward nato s borders pushing france s main security concern jihadi terrorism from the middle east and the sahel region of africa down the list of priorities macron was reelected in april but he lost his parliamentary majority and like most european leaders he faces the prospect of a winter of discontent thanks to high energy prices and a looming recession hosting macron at the white house can be construed as a gesture of grace by u s president joe biden he and the french leader have made efforts to rebuild trust after the aukus blowup but their administrations remain to some degree misaligned on vital economic and strategic issues since macron s last visit to washington the world has undergone a series of major shifts from a global pandemic to the return of war in europe to china and russia s dangerous convergence that are now forcing the united states and its european allies to adjust their partnerships in addition to addressing immediate concerns such as energy scarcity and the conflict in ukraine biden and macron must make sure that the u s french alliance is ready for the even bigger tasks ahead ensuring that europe can contain an aggressive russia and reforming international institutions so that they are more inclusive efficient and resilient in the face of challenges such as china s rise climate change and technological threats more than nato russia s invasion of ukraine combined with its nuclear saber rattling has underscored that nato remains the foundation and essential framework for europe s collective security as macron s government put it in its national strategic review published in november after years of pushing for a stronger european defense france has come to terms with the reality that its credibility as a military partner depends on greater involvement with nato france has increased its troop presence and capabilities in the baltic states and is now a framework nation for nato s forward presence in romania coordinating the training and operations of allied troops stationed there yet some of france s biggest concerns about european defense have not disappeared behind the reassuring shield of u s security guarantees for instance europeans remain divided over what a stronger european pillar within nato should mean in practice and over how to respond to threats from an increasingly assertive china divides that put washington and paris on opposite sides the war in ukraine has exposed the perils of europe s overreliance on the united states for security hampered by limited military stocks and budgetary constraints european countries have been more willing than able to provide military support for kyiv in september eu high representative josep borrell warned that european military stockpiles were greatly depleted and that many countries were struggling to refill their armories of the nearly 39 billion euros committed to assist ukraine s military as of october 3 almost 28 billion euros had come from the united states according to the kiel institute france still hopes to persuade europe to shoulder more responsibility for its own defense not just by building made in europe capabilities but also by conducting more autonomous missions after the dispute over aukus biden issued a joint statement with macron emphasizing the importance of a stronger and more capable european defense complementary to nato a little more than a year later macron seeks confirmation that the war in ukraine does not invalid this statement but rather affirms it the target audience being europeans more than americans translating this idea into action would require a cultural shift the united states would need to admit that european dependency while a source of u s leverage is not in the united states long term interest as a result washington would need to start backing explicitly european led initiatives that make europeans less dependent on the united states including on its industry for instance washington should support the eu s efforts to set up a mechanism for common defense procurement instead of trying to limit the mechanism s ambitions because it excludes u s industry already the war in ukraine has demonstrated how nato and the eu can complement each other although nato has played a critical role in deterring russian aggression beyond ukraine it has not been the driving force behind direct military support to kyiv ad hoc initiatives such as the u s led ukraine defense contact group have coordinated most of the military support while the eu has pitched in with aid delivered through its european peace facility and military assistance mission this record of successful collaboration should encourage greater cooperation between nato and the eu something that has long been debated in europe but that in france s view cannot be postponed any longer push me follow you if the french are hoping for a push from the united states on european defense the americans are hoping for closer alignment from france on china in its effort to outcompete beijing and build a strong coalition to oppose its revisionism the biden administration aims to close the gap between american and transatlantic priorities the united states worries about a potential chinese invasion of taiwan perhaps as early as 2027 washington does not expect the europeans to offer a military response but it does hope that europe will help deter china from using force and impose sanctions in the event of an attack to that end the united states needs to continue working with france and the eu to make europe more resilient for instance by decreasing its dependence on chinese trade technology and critical materials such as rare earths and by countering chinese misinformation while also signaling to beijing that it is ready to take action if need be given that transatlantic unity has proven such an effective weapon against russia washington cannot afford to lose it when dealing with china from that perspective france is a key u s partner but a difficult one to manage although it shares many of the united states concerns about china france intends to chart a distinct national and european policy one that eschews automatic alignment with washington and that leaves open the possibility of cooperation with beijing when interests align france also aims to offer a third way to countries of the indo pacific region pushing for a reinforcement of international rules and a defense of sovereignty instead of encouraging countries to join competing camps within europe france has been ahead of the curve in responding to predatory chinese behavior pushing for the establishment of eu mechanisms to screen foreign direct investments and combat coercive economic practices yet france views itself as a balancing power that rejects the logic of opposing blocs and its cautiousness about confronting china within nato and joining u s led initiatives perceived as directed against beijing is an obstacle to european alignment on china to break this impasse france and the united states will need to identify the best forums for discussing china related matters nato may be one such forum but it cannot be the only one as the challenge posed by beijing is not uniquely military the eu has a role to play in preparing europe for potential economic shocks caused by disruptions in world trade and there is room for increased cooperation between the united states and the eu on trade and technology for instance by further empowering the u s eu trade and technology council without improved coordination france and the united states face three interconnected risks that their lack of unity and preparation will invite chinese aggression that divisions over how much to decouple from china will translate into uncoordinated policies that could undermine the stability of the indo pacific and that the united states will feel it has no choice but to pursue its indo pacific strategy without the europeans no one wants to see the global economy become an arena of zero sum competition between the transatlantic partners in its frenzied competition with china the united states achieved an important legislative goal with the inflation reduction act of 2022 which authorizes enormous investments in green u s businesses and industries but the law which incentivizes domestic consumption and may lead to disinvestment from europe risks alienating european countries which fear a permanent u s turn toward protectionism france and germany are already pushing for similar subsidies for european industries and macron has even floated the idea of a buy european act france has also complained loudly that europeans must pay three to four times as much as americans for natural gas a sign that even in a moment of remarkable transatlantic solidarity protectionist impulses can be divisive with far right populism rising on both sides of the atlantic macron and biden each have an acute understanding of the political risks faced by the other both may eventually be replaced by leaders who could engage in destructive competition with rivals or antagonize partners the era of transatlantic unity may not last long that is why no one wants to see the global economy become an arena of zero sum competition between the transatlantic partners even before american voters have had a chance to return another trump like president to office in addition to finding common ground on china and on european defense biden and macron must seize this opportunity to fortify the relationship for what may be on the horizon one way to insulate the alliance from future troubles is to build new bureaucratic mechanisms that are more flexible than established forums such as nato and the g 7 these could be bilateral such as u s french strategic dialogues or multilateral such as the european quad but they must provide a setting to prevent misunderstandings and advance shared strategic objectives biden and macron also have a historic opportunity to build faits accomplis for the future as the leaders of two countries with historically universalist aspirations they can do much to demonstrate how the democratic world is a better ally than the authoritarian one both agree on the need to address the challenges and grievances of developing countries while calling on them to take part in defending universal principles at the un general assembly this year macron and biden gave strikingly similar speeches both advocating for the rest of the world to oppose russia s war in ukraine and to defend the sovereignty of nations yet in this competition for the soul of the world developed democracies such as the united states and france must achieve practical successes to win over developing nations ever since the early days of covid 19 when many rich countries hoarded masks and other protective equipment macron has pushed for result driven multilateralism that can deliver for the global south and in a speech at the un climate conference in egypt this month he advocated for reforming the imf and world bank to foster the transition to clean energy endorsing calls from developing nations to make the multilateral financial system more equitable but such change can happen only with u s backing together france and the united states can do much to reform international institutions to better serve the needs of poor nations on climate finance food security debt and many other issues this is no small task but it must be part of the discussion between macron and biden this week if france and the united states are to be prepared for what lies ahead

early in october it lifted my spirits to be able to bloviate about how a too widely anticipated october crash seemed as likely as a martian invasion one lunar calendar based prediction in particular had october 21 as the crash date although the forecast went squishy at sundown that day when dark clouds failed to materialize over wall street even so the trading world remained atwitter about the guru and his earth shaking prediction until after the election now five weeks later who even remembers his name at the time i made the boldest prediction that a guru can make i e that nothing even remotely interesting would happen for the foreseeable future this was going way out on a limb since we gurus are always expected to predict that something will happen even if we sometimes wuss out with a sooner or later qualifier but more months of nothing zilch nada when was the last time such a boring forecast was celebrated for its prescience and which guru made the call what makes this one so daring however is that even the village idiot knows that the global economy is poised to collapse at any time perhaps even before you have read this commentary bloomberg s a team instead we have the usual eggheads and bloomberg regulars debating whether the u s is even in a recession yes the pundits nearly always embarrass themselves all of us can see that tens of millions of middle class americans are making the kind of economic tradeoffs that are usually associated with very hard times but perhaps the eggheads have a point not necessarily on the top of their heads maybe things are not so bad after all and the economy will continue to limp along until the next outbreak of buy side psychosis strikes the proletarian mind to assess the odds consider the chart of aapl above the eye senses several possibilities 1 the stock could continue to screw the pooch staying in the channel for longer than most of us might imagine especially with iphone sales about to confront simultaneous recessions in europe asia and the u s 2 the next upthrust could impale the upper red line for no logical reason propelling aapl if not necessarily the broad averages to new record highs or finally 3 aapl could collapse taking out support at the lower channel line a black swan from a purely visual standpoint 3 somehow seems least likely perhaps it is because aapl s decision free sponsors look so comfortable where they are now in the middle of a cruising zone that has obtained for nearly two years whatever happens aapl will remain an infallible bellwether for the stock market as a whole you need only get aapl right as i continue to remind you in order to get the big picture right the chart above is the best evidence we have that 2023 could be a do nothing year i say that as a permabear who thinks a deflationary collapse is coming that will be even worse than the great depression plummeting stocks will lead us into the abyss but this will not occur because money managers have changed their minds about owning stocks rather massive redemptions will force them to sell implying the catalyst will be an exogenous shock a black swan the exact nature of which cannot be predicted by any seer
tim boyle getty images news while the u s railroad industry has been in the news because of a potential strike that could take place within weeks many segments of the u s economy are facing the pressure of higher wages as employees attempt to recover their standards of living which have been damaged by high inflation unions have been effective in highlighting the impact of inflation on their workers the transportation industry as a whole is heavily unionized and also critical to the u s economy the u s airline industry has returned to profitability with strong post pandemic travel demand and the reopening of more and more countries around the world to normal levels of human interaction and travel many airline industry labor contracts became amendable during the pandemic including at american nasdaq aal in order to discuss the investor impact of the current labor environment it is first necessary to understand the airline labor process in the united states airline labor regulatory and political realities the most significant aspect of airline labor relations that must be understood is that they are governed by the railway labor act â rla which provides a very different regulatory framework for the u s airline industry and their labor unions than for most industries originally enacted nearly a century ago the rla provides both a guaranteed mechanism for employee representation in the railroad industry and an elaborate system of checks and balances to prevent damage to the u s economy should labor unions seeks to strike the rla remains largely as it was implemented in 1924 but has been expanded to include the interstate airline industry one of the most important differences between airline labor contracts and those governed by other statutes is that airline and railway labor contracts do not expire but rather become amendable once a labor contract becomes amendable there is a defined process that includes federal mediation and escalation procedures should labor and management fail to reach agreement on new contracts the national mediation board â a unit of the dept of labor â is available at the request of labor and management once they are requested to assist with a labor negotiation for an airline or railroad company the nmb will be involved until both parties either reach an agreement or the complete process under the rla has been exhausted which could end with a strike by the union or a lockout by management should mediation fail the nmb encourages arbitration should arbitration be rejected by either labor or management and the nmb determines that the lack of resolution to a contract could harm the u s economy the nmb is required to notify the president of the united states which forms a fact finding presidential emergency board peb while the findings of the peb do not result in an imposed decision on either side both parties are strongly encouraged to negotiate an agreement while outside of the railway labor act and after all other mechanisms within the rla have been exhausted congress does have the right under the commerce clause of the u s constitution to impose a settlement railway labor act processes ourcontract org while the current dispute between railroad unions and management has reached the peb stage and the biden administration believed it had assisted in a obtaining an agreement two months ago some railroad labor groups rejected the agreement which is why the potential for a strike is now much higher because the president and congress have additional powers to prevent damage to the u s economy which have not been exercised in the current railroad dispute the chances remain low that a prolonged strike will occur in contrast no u s airline labor group has reached the stage where they might be free to strike because there is no specified time for mediated negotiations labor and management have every incentive to continue to make progress failure of either side to negotiate in good faith could result in escalation of the process because contracts under the rla can stretch on for years after they become amendable seeking retroactive pay is common by labor while it often becomes necessary for management to include it as long as economic conditions indicate that they could have economically supported if a settlement had been reached earlier in the process unlike railroads airlines were not profitable throughout the pandemic and received substantial amounts of government assistance which was targeted directly at labor costs making it unlikely that mediators would support terms of retroactivity that extended before the 2nd quarter of this year airline labor groups are allied with their railroad counterparts in seeking double digit initial increases in compensation with above average single digit increases in pay during the life of the proposed contracts which generally are proposed to extend from two to four more years a number of airline pilot groups have engaged in informational picketing over the past six months as airline industry profits returned in frustration by employees for the two year delay in moving forward with negotiations due to the pandemic â but none are allowed to strike at this point unionized transportation workers including railroad and airline employees receive above average compensation compared to the general american workforce but also seek continually improvements in quality of life issues since both industries work around the clock and require many employees to travel away from home the primary sticking point in the current railroad labor dispute is about the lack of true time off free from any obligations to the company while airline crewmembers want to see improvements in their scheduling many airlines used their labor groups very inefficiently during the pandemic requiring some crew members to work demanding schedules while other crewmembers did not work as much as they could have because of backed up training processes politically post mid term elections airlines and railroads are in a far less advantageous position than they have been for more than two years airline labor rallied to obtain federal support for the industry leading up to the 2020 elections while the proposed administration settlement for railroads happened before the recently completed mid terms the biden administration has been much more vocal in speaking in recent days about the danger to the economy if a railroad strike occurred similarly the responsibility for settling airline labor contracts shifts much more heavily back to labor and management rather than with the likelihood that politics will favor either side americanâ s labor situation american airlines is not only the largest employer in the u s airline industry with more than 123 000 employees but also has the most employees currently working under amendable contracts including its pilots flight attendants and passenger service agents united ual has a similar number of employees and amendable contracts while deltaâ s dal pilots are its only large unionized group four of southwestâ s luv five large labor groups have amendable contracts although the number of employees in each labor group at luv is smaller than at the big 3 global airlines contracts for pilots at all four of the largest airlines are in negotiation and the big 3 airlines are most advanced in their pilot negotiations pilot compensation represents about one third of the total salary and benefits expense for u s airlines about twice the ratio of total employees at each airline making it important for airlines to settle pilot contracts in order to know the impact on total labor cost increases in 2020 according to data which american reported to the u s dept of transportation american paid its pilots an average of 250 000 with an additional 60k in benefits and payroll taxes for 2021 american spent nearly 12 billion on labor expenses which amounted to 38 of its total operating expenses aal union contract status aal 10k 2021 united led the current airline pilot contract cycle with a proposed contract for its pilots that ended up being soundly rejected by its rank and file pilots during the ratification process united management had stated that it intended to lead the industry with a new contract in order to obtain the pilots necessary to staff the hundreds of new aircraft that the airline is acquiring in order to replace regional jets which are operated by other airlines on contract to united in addition to unfavorably low pay increases compared to what railroads have negotiated with their employees united pilots did not like the higher premiums which were being offered to pilot trainers at the expense of comparable raises for rank and file pilots the rejected proposed contract has led to recalls of several union officials in unitedâ s pilotsâ union â the airline pilots association â which will further delay negotiations for a new contract american proposed slightly richer terms for a new contract with its pilots just days after united released its proposed contract to its pilots for a vote dooming the united contract to failure however americanâ s pilotsâ union leadership rejected the proposed contract its negotiating team reached with the company and never sent the proposal to its pilots for a vote fearing the backlash that has cost united pilot union leaders their jobs american executives have released statements on several occasions demonstrating confidence that they will be able to absorb the pay levels that become the norm for legacy u s airlines â specifically established by delta and or united americanâ s labor situation is different than unitedâ s and the rest of the airline industry while the difference in hourly compensation at the big 3 airlines is similar for similar aircraft americanâ s pilot work rules and total compensation are generally regarded as inferior to delta and unitedâ s as a lingering result of americanâ s chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization while it has been a decade since american reorganized industry history shows it often takes two or more contract cycles for the losses suffered under bankruptcy to be reversed in addition american has the most senior pilot group at u s airlines meaning that although it has the most pilots that will face required retirement due to mandatory age restrictions during the remainder of this decade its current average pilot compensation could grow higher than other airlines due to a more senior workforce in addition a number of strategic decisions by the company has reduced the earnings potential for american pilots pressuring the company to increase compensation in other areas to offset american disposed of more widebody aircraft than delta or united during the pandemic and has been slow to replace them admitting that current market realities make it impossible to support the size of international fleet that it operated before the pandemic as i have noted previously american operated its international network at lower profit margins and consistent losses across the pacific than delta the industryâ s most profitable global airline or united which operates the u s industryâ s largest widebody fleet in addition american has outsourced flying on the east coast to jetblue jblu as part of the northeast alliance between the two airlines which is being challenged by the dept of justice and alaska air group alk on the west coast aal jblu partnership aa com delta for the breakthrough delta has also been actively negotiating with its pilots in a process mediated by the nmb its ceo recently appeared on nbcâ s today show repeating that the company wants to have a pilot agreement before the end of the year â which is less than a month away considering holidays while neither delta nor its pilot union also alpa have not received terms of any proposed contracts internet chatter indicates that delta is offering considerably richer terms than american or united offered its pilots validating delta ceoâ s statements that dal will offer its pilots the richest pilot contract in the industry if delta and its pilot union agree on a new pilot contract it will set a standard for americanâ s pilot contract american has the best chance of reaching a contract after delta southwestâ s pilot union appears to not be as advanced as the big 3 in the process although their contract is much less complicated because of their use of a single aircraft type and lack of long haul international flying the chaos at unitedâ s pilotsâ union could well push it to the back of line in the timeline for new pilot contracts if americanâ s pilots obtain a new contract it will almost certainly accelerate negotiations for a new contract for is flight attendants and passenger service agents american also has a more senior flight attendant workforce than at other airlines however american has refocused efforts to reduce its labor efficiency which includes reducing the number of gate agents american has also reduced the number of flight attendants per flight which will accelerate as the airline ends international and transcontinental first class service airline labor history shows that workforce efficiencies are usually offset by increased compensation for the remaining employees competitive labor situation u s airlines are suffering from the same manpower shortages that have swept through the economy for months many airlines offered early retirement packages during the pandemic in order to reduce costs since there was no certainty of the economic or demand future while many airline employees chose to leave the workforce using covid aid for individuals some airline employees including at delta received their 2019 profit sharing payouts a week after covid shutdowns began the crippling process that would decimate airline demand for nearly two years because airline pilots face a federally mandated retirement age of 65 many took early retirement packages once demand returned earlier this year many airlines found themselves short of pilots further the training pipeline for new pilots was interrupted as fears grew that the airline industry would face yet another of its many historic down cycles which would remove the pre pandemic attraction of pilot careers all of these factors combined have resulted in one of the deepest pilot shortages that the u s airline industry has ever seen with the impact being first by regional airlines and then low cost carriers with legacy carriers such as american in a relatively strong position aal regional jet fleet aa com american operates over 600 regional jets with half operated by one of its two wholly owned regional carriers and the remaining aircraft operated by contract carriers aalâ s wholly owned regional airlines have led the regional carrier industry in offering hefty bonuses of as much as 100 000 or more for pilots to remain at aalâ s regional airlines instead of advancing to low cost carriers or legacy airlines including aal as soon as they gained the necessary experience the effect has been to require carriers such as alaska airlines which has reached an agreement with its pilots to significantly increase pay in order to remain as an attractive option for pilots ultra low cost carriers such as frontier ulcc and spirit save are experiencing high levels of attrition as pilots choose to fly with the big 3 global airlines and southwest because of higher career earnings while southwest doesnâ t operate widebody international aircraft they have long had pilot compensation that has provided career earnings potential as high as at the global airlines the effect of wage pressure has been for the gap between pilots flying the smallest aircraft such as regional jets and for those that fly for smaller airlines to shrink and for pilots at the global carriers to expect compensation increases of a similar magnitude as the increases that are being seen at airlines such as alaska and regional airlines since none of the big 4 airlines have reached agreement on a new pilot contract it is hard to know the increased level in personnel expense that american will face but it is very likely that at least a 10 increase in salary and benefits expense will be seen within one year of signing a new pilot contract if similar increases are provided to other employee groups with open contracts revenue growth will fund labor cost increases while the prospect of a 1 5 billion or more increase in labor costs might seem daunting american execs are likely justified in believing they can absorb whatever raises they need to offer likely driven by deltaâ s stated commitment to have the highest paid pilots there are a number of reasons to be optimistic about americanâ s ability to fund a new pilot agreement and the follow on agreements that will come for other labor groups american like most of the rest of the industry continues to see strong demand esp on its domestic system which is currently generating the highest revenues among u s airlines american is focusing its network rebuilding efforts on its two largest hubs at charlotte and dallas ft worth which provide strong connectivity across and to from the southern u s which continues to lead air travel recovery americanâ s largest international region is latin america where it is also the largest carrier the upcoming winter travel season promises to be one of the strongest low cost carriers including jetblue and spirit have reduced some of their capacity in the region including from s florida where aal is the largest carrier and where aalâ s massive miami hub is the primary gateway to the region american has recognized that its previous forays on a number of routes to asia and continental europe have not been profitable and they are taking a careful approach to restarting long haul international markets as well as in replacing the capacity from its airbus 330 and boeing 767 fleets which it retired during the pandemic americanâ s fleet spending over the next three years will the lowest of the big 4 after years of leading the industry giving american the youngest fleet among the largest u s airlines aal has upgauged increase the average aircraft size of its mainline fleet and pushed back deliveries of its remaining boeing 787s beyond this year in order to buy the improved performance package which boeing is developing for that aircraft because americanâ s stock price has remained depressed because of its low earnings and high debt levels which has resulted in the highest amount for debt service among u s airlines aalâ s reduced capex will allow it to reduce its debt levels a strategy it is committed to pursuing during the next three years aal operating stats 3q2022 aa com further the legacy airlines have demonstrated over the past year that they are more capable of absorbing higher costs and translating them into higher revenues than the low cost carriers legacy airlines have years of history of offering fares competitive with low cost carriers but the legacy carriers also are capable of attracting premium passengers for years aal was the lowest margin airline in the airline industry but low several cost carriers generated profit margins lower than aal in the most recent quarter the legacy carriers as a group and specifically american are better positioned relative to low cost carriers than they have been for years there are a few negative factors that could weigh on aalâ s financial performance which investors should track american is committed to maintaining one of the largest regional jet fleets in the world which will require above average labor costs per passenger on those aircraft aal believes the increased domestic feed from regional jets will give it a competitive advantage by connecting more passengers to its mainline flights aal continues to have more employees than either delta or united even adjusting for the amount of outsourced work at each airline american execs have previously aalâ s large workforce is due in part to the massive operation that american has at dfw airport where it operations from multiple terminals spread across more space than any other u s airline american has considered building a massive new terminal at dfw airport which would likely be the largest airline terminal project in the u s if not the world if american moves forward aal stock remains undervalued aal stock is down the most of the big 4 down over 22 on a ytd basis and yet seeking alphaâ s quant rating is at a strong buy driven by growth and eps revision given that airlines as network businesses are able to translate increased revenue growth and efficient capacity additions into bottom line growth aal is in a favorable position to see earnings growth aalâ s market cap at 9 4 billion is also the lowest of the big 4 airlines continuing a years old trend but disconnected from the industry topping revenues the company is generating aal chart 25nov2022 seeking alpha aal quant rating seeking alpha aal is an attractive potential investment as the airline industry continues to recover and as american builds on its own strengths while gaining competitive advantages esp relative to several low cost carriers
