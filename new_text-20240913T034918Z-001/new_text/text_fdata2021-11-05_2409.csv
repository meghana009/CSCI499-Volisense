strong quarterly sequential results despite the secular headwinds impacting the satellite industry network services benefited from the continued recovery in north american airline travel resulting in higher in flight connectivity revenues media was impacted by a large planned service migration from the intelsat network onto customer owned assets coupled with the ongoing business trends the start of hosted payload service on our galaxy 30 satellite and continued demand for our flexmove land mobility managed services created positive momentum for our government business spengler concluded our team remains committed to delivering a superior customer experience while making critical investments to expand our ability to deliver mission critical services we remain focused on executing the c

three months ended september 30 2021 an increase of 43 compared to the three months ended september 30 2020 factors positively impacting revenue included in flight connectivity services and the expansion of services with mobility and network customers the increase in revenue was partially offset by specific non renewals and capacity and price reductions across our mobility and networks customer sets media media revenue was 181 1 million or 34 of intelsat s total revenue for the three months ended september 30 2021 a decrease of 11 compared to the three months ended september 30 2020 the decline in media was primarily driven by a planned service migration by a specific customer from intelsat s network to the customer s own network assets other factors impacting revenue were terminations and non renewals reflecting industry trends the declines in revenue were slightly offset by new business expansion government government revenue was 95 0 million or 18 of intelsat s total revenue for the three months ended september 30 2021 a 12 decrease compared to the three months ended september 30 2020 the decline was largely due to a one time equipment sale last year the decline in revenue was partially offset by new hosted payload services on our galaxy 30 satellite and increased demand for flexmove land mobility managed services average fill rate intelsat s average fill rate as of september 30 2021 on our approximately 1 620 36 mhz station kept wide beam transponders was 74 similar to our average fill rate at june 30 2021 in addition as of september 30 2021 our fleet

months ended september 30 2021 as compared to the three months ended september 30 2020 the increase was primarily due to a 73 6 million increase in costs attributable to our commercial aviation business partially offset by a 13 0 million decrease in equipment costs largely related to government customers incurred in 2020 and a 3 6 million decrease in staff related expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased by 27 6 million or 40 percent to 96 8 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 as compared to the three months ended september 30 2020 the increase

use ebitda as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers we believe that ebitda is an operating performance measure and not a liquidity measure that provides investors

ebitda consists of ebitda as adjusted to exclude or include certain unusual items certain other operating expense items and certain other adjustments as described in the table above our management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors lenders and financial analysts regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it permits clearer comparability of our operating performance between periods by excluding the potential volatility related to the timing and extent of non operating activities our management believes that adjusted ebitda provides a useful means of evaluating the success of our operating activities we also use adjusted ebitda together with other appropriate metrics to set goals for and measure the operating performance of our business and it is one of the principal measures we use to evaluate our management s performance in determining compensation under our incentive compensation plans adjusted ebitda measures have been used historically by investors lenders and financial analysts to estimate the value of a company to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate performance our management believes that the inclusion of adjusted ebitda facilitates comparison of our results with those of companies having different capital structures adjusted ebitda is not a measure of

warner who will start on page four of our presentation warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer thanks andrew good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to begin i am pleased to report that our team continues to effectively execute our strategic plan across all of our businesses which includes making significant investments in our energy infrastructure to enhance the reliability and resiliency with the energy grid as well as transition to a cleaner energy future in a responsible fashion these investments coupled with our continued focus on disciplined cost management and delivering significant value to our customers communities and shareholders well now do our third quarter earnings results yesterday we announced third quarter 2021 earnings of 1 65 per share our earnings were up 0 18 per share from the same time period in 2020 this slide highlights the key drivers of our strong performance michael will discuss the key drivers of our third quarter earnings results a bit later due to the continued strong execution of our strategy i am also pleased to report that we raised our 2021 earnings guidance our 2021 earnings guidance range is now 3 75 per share to 3 95 per share compared to our original guidance range of 3 65 per share to 3 85 per share turning now to page five where we reiterate our strategic plan the first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks this has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long term benefit of our customers as a result and as you can see on the right side of this page during the first nine months of this year we invested significant capital in each of our business segments these investments are delivering value to our customers as i said before our energy grid is stronger more resilient and more secure because of the investments we are making in all four business segments as we head into the winter months id like to highlight some of the value these investments have created in our ameren illinois and ameren missouri natural gas businesses our natural gas transmission and distribution investments are focused on upgrading and modernizing gas main and equipment infrastructure all the strength in safety and reliability of our system for our customers being mindful of the gas distribution issues experienced in the industry in the past i will note that our ameren illinois and ameren missouri natural gas distribution systems are comprised almost entirely of plastic and protected coated steel pipelines there is no cast iron pipe in our systems and we expect to eliminate all unprotected steel pipe by the end of this year these investments are just another example of how we are putting our customers at the center of our strategy moving now to regulatory matters in late march ameren missouri filed a request for a 299 million increase in annual electric service revenues and a 9 million increase in annual natural gas service revenues with the missouri public service commission in our illinois electric business we have requested a 59 million base rate increase in our required annual electric distribution rate filing these proceedings are moving along on schedule michael will provide more information on these proceedings a bit later finally we remain relentlessly focused on continuos improvement and disciplined cost management including maintaining many of the cost savings that we realized in 2020 due to the actions we took to mitigate the impacts of covid 19 moving to page six and the second pillar of our strategy enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies over the years we have been successful in executing this element of our strategy by delivering value to our customers for our investments in energy infrastructure and through extensive collaboration with key stakeholders in all of our regulatory jurisdictions i am very pleased to report that these efforts paid off again in the third quarter when the illinois legislature passed the climate and equitable jobs act or ceja which is later signed by governor pritzker ceja is a constructive piece of legislation that addresses the key objectives that we felt were important for our customers and the communities we serve it will enable us to continue to make important infrastructure investments to enhance the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid for a new forward thinking regulatory framework it will also give us the ability to earn fair returns on those investments as well as enable us to invest in two solar and or battery storage pilot projects ceja allows for an electric utility to opt in to a multiyear rate plan effective for four years beginning in 2024 we are currently working with key stockholders and will continue to over the course of 2022 to establish specific procedures including performance metrics to implement this legislation subject to finalizing key aspects of this rate making framework we anticipate filing a multiyear rate plan by mid january 2023 michael will discuss this constructive piece of legislation in more in a moment shifting now to the federal level where important energy legislation continues to be discussed needless to say the situation around federal legislation remains fluid and ever changing one thing that remains constant is our strong support for clean energy transition tax incentives including wind and solar production tax credits transmission and storage investment tax credits as well as direct pay and normalization opt out provisions we also continue to strongly support significant funding for research design and development for new clean energy technologies electrification of the transportation sector and grid resiliency we support these important legislative initiatives because we strongly believe they will deliver significant long term benefits to our customers communities and country we will continue to work with key stakeholders along with our industry colleagues to advance constructive federal energy and economic policies that will help us transition to a cleaner energy future in a responsible fashion speaking of our transition to our cleaner energy future please turn to page seven in the discussion of future transmission investment needs as we have discussed with you in the past miso completed a study outlining the potential road map of transmission projects through 2039 taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant additions of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans state mandates and goals for clean energy or carbon emission reductions among other things under misos future one scenario which is the scenario that resulted in an approximate 60 carbon emissions reduction below 2005 levels by 2039 and miso estimates approximately 30 billion of future transmission investment would be necessary in the miso footprint under its future three scenario which resulted in an 80 reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2039 miso estimates approximately 100 million of transmission investment in the miso footprint would be needed it is clear that investment in transmission is going to play a critical role in the clean energy transition and we are well positioned to plan and execute the potential projects in the future for the benefit of our customers and country we continue to work with miso and other key stakeholders and believe certain projects outlined in future one are likely going to be included in this years miso transmission planning process which is expected to be completed in early 2022 moving now to page eight and an update on litigation regarding ameren missouris past compliance with the new source review provisions of the clean air act as you may recall this litigation dates back to 2011 and the department of justice on behalf of the epa filed a complaint against ameren missouri alleging that in performing certain projects at the rush island energy center we have violated the new source review provisions of the clean air act in 2017 the district court issued a liability ruling and in september 2019 ordered the installation of pollution control equipment at the rush island energy center as well as at the labadie energy center in september of this year u s court of appeals preferring the district courts 2019 order requires us to install a scrubber at our rush island energy center but denied the order to install additional pollution control equipment at labadie last month we filed a request for rehearing with u s court of appeals while we wait for a final decision from the courts we continue to assess several alternatives to effectively address the court of appeals decision including legal operational and regulatory measures in reviewing these options we are also carefully assessing the impact on customer costs as well as generation or transmission investments needed to maintain system reliability and we are certainly mindful of the policies that are being considered at the federal level to help address climate change should our decision result in a material change to our integrated resource plan we will file an updated plan with the missouri psc turning to page nine we remain focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers communities and our country this page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental social and governance matters and is consistent with our vision leading the way to a sustainable energy future beginning with environmental stewardship last september ameren announced its transformation plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in missouri and illinois this plan includes interim carbon emission reduction targets of 50 and 85 below 2005 levels in 2030 and 2040 respectively and is consistent with the objectives of the paris agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1 5 degrees celsius we also have a strong long term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful this slide highlights the many things we are doing for our customers and communities including being an industry leader in diversity equity and inclusion further our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse board of directors focused on strong oversight thats aligned with esg matters and our executive compensation practices include performance metrics that are tied to sustainable long term performance diversity equity inclusion and progress toward a cleaner sustained energy future finally this slide highlights our very strong sustainable growth proposition which is among the best in the industry turning to page 10 you will go down further on this key element our strong sustainable growth proposition is driven by a robust pipeline of investment opportunities over 40 billion over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders and making our energy grid stronger smarter and cleaner importantly these investment opportunities exclude any new reasonably beneficial transmission projects including the potential road map of miso transmission projects i discussed earlier all of which would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as help to enable our countrys transition to a cleaner energy future in addition we expect to see greater focus on infrastructure investments to support the electrification of the transportation sector in the future our outlook through 2030 does not include significant infrastructure investments for electrification at this time maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner energy future in a safe reliable and affordable fashion will be critical to meeting our countrys future energy needs and delivering on our customers expectations moving to page 11 another key element of our sustainable growth proposition is the five year earnings per share growth guidance we issued in february which included a 6 to 8 compound annual earnings per share growth rate from 2021 to 2025 this earnings growth is primarily driven by strong rate base growth and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers importantly our five year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1 200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities outlined in ameren missouris integrated resource plan our team continues to assess several renewable generation proposals from developers we expect to file with the missouri psc for approval of a portion of these planned renewable investments this year i am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all four of our business segments that fact coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts has positioned us well for future success further our shares continue to offer investors a strong dividend which we expect to grow in line with our long term earnings per share growth guidance simply put we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders finally turning to page 12 i will wrap up with a few comments about the organizational changes we announced a few weeks ago over the past eight years i have had the great privilege to serve as chairman president and chief executive officer of ameren during this time ive been very fortunate to lead the team that has done an excellent job in executing our strategy and delivering strong value to our customers communities and shareholders last month i was humbled and honored that

strategy in the future will deliver superior value to our customers communities shareholders and the environment thank you all for joining us today ill now turn the call over to michael michael l moehn executive vice president chief financial officer chairman of ameren missouri president of ameren thanks warner and good morning everyone turning now to page 14 of our presentation yesterday we reported third quarter 2021 earnings of 1 65 per share compared to 1 47 per share for the year ago quarter turning to ameren missouri our largest segment increased 0 27 per share driven primarily by a change in seasonal electric rate design resulting from the march 2020 rate order which provided for lower winter rates in may and higher summer rates in september rather than the blended rates used in both months in 2020 higher electric retail sales also increased earnings by approximately 0 10 per share largely due to continued economic recovery in this years third quarter compared to the unfavorable impacts of covid 19 in the year ago period as well as higher electric retail sales driven by warmer than normal summer temperatures in the period compared to near normal summer temperatures in the year ago period weve included on this page the year over year weather normalized sales variances for the quarter total weather normalized sales year to date shown on page 27 of the presentation are largely consistent with our expectations outlined on our call in february as we still expect total sales to be up approximately 2 in 2021 compared to 2020 that said weve seen a net benefit in margins due to residential and commercial sales coming in higher than expected and industrial sales slightly lower than expected increased investments in infrastructure and wind generation eligible for plant and service accounting and the renewable energy standard rate adjustment mechanism or resram positively impacted earnings by 0 07 per share the timing of tax expense which is not expected to materially impact full year results increased earnings by 0 03 per share higher operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by 0 04 per share in 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 which was affected by covid 19 and remained flat year to date driven by disciplined cost management finally the amortization of deferred income taxes related to the fall 2020 callaway energy center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage also decreased earnings 0 02 per share moving to other segments ameren transmission earnings increased 0 03 per share year over year reflecting increased infrastructure investment ameren illinois electric distribution earnings per share were comparable which reflected increased infrastructure and energy efficiency investments and a higher allowed roe under performance based ratemaking partially offset by dilution earnings for ameren illinois natural gas decreased 0 04 per share increased delivery service rates that became effective in late january 2021 were more than offset by a change in rate design during the quarter which is not expected to impact full year results ameren parent and other results decreased 0 08 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to the timing of income tax expense which is not expected to materially impact full year results finally 2021 earnings per share reflected higher weighted average shares outstanding before moving on ill touch on year to date sales trends for ameren illinois electric distribution weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to illinois residential customers decreased 0 5 and weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to illinois commercial and industrial customers increased 2 5 and 1 5 respectively recall that changes in electric sales in illinois no matter the cause do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling turning to page 15 now wed like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance we have remained very focused on maintaining disciplined cost management and well continue that focus as warner noted due to the solid execution of our strategy we now expect 2021 diluted earnings to be in the range of 3 75 per share to 3 95 per share an increase from our original guidance range of 3 65 per share to 3 85 per share select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in february moving to page 16 for an update on regulatory matters on march 31 we filed for a 299 million electric revenue increase with the missouri public service commission the request includes a 9 9 return on equity a 51 9 equity ratio and a september 30 2021 estimated rate base of 10 billion in october missouri public service commission staff and other intervenors filed a rebuttal testimony missouri psc staff recommended a 188 million revenue increase including a return on equity range of 9 25 to 9 75 and an equity ratio of 50 based on ameren missouris capital structure at june 30 2021 which will be updated to use the capital structure as of september 30 2021 the october staff recommendation was lower primarily due to lower recommended depreciation expense which would not be expected to impact earnings turning to page 17 in addition to the electric filing on march 31 we filed for a 9 million natural gas revenue increase within the missouri psc the request includes a 9 8 return on equity a 51 9 equity ratio and a september 30 2021 estimated rate base of 310 million missouri psc staff recommended a 4 million revenue increase including a return on equity range of 9 25 to 9 75 and an equity ratio of 50 32 based on ameren missouris capital structure at june 30 2021 which will be updated to use of the cash flow structure as of september 30 2021 other parties including the missouri office of public counsel have also made recommended adjustments to our missouri electric and gas rate request evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in late november and the missouri psc decisions from both rate reviews are expected by early february with new rates expected to be effective by late february moving to page 18 ameren illinois regulatory matters in april we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing under illinois performance based rate making these annual rate updates systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs in august the icc staff recommended a 58 million base rate increase compared to our request of 59 million base rate increase an icc decision is expected in december with new rates expected to be effective in january 2022 turning now to page 19 as warner mentioned in september constructive energy legislation was enacted in the state of illinois this allows ameren illinois the option to file a four year rate plan in january 2023 for rates effective beginning in 2024 the return on equity which will be determined by the illinois commerce commission may impacted by plus or minus 20 to 60 basis points based on the utilitys ability to meet certain performance metrics related to items such as reliability customer service and supplier diversity the plan also allows for the use of year end rate base and an equity ratio up to 50 with an higher equity ratio subject to approval by the icc in addition it calls revenue decoupling and an annual reconciliation of cost and revenues for each annual period approved in the multiyear rate plan theres a cap on the true up which may not exceed 105 of the revenue requirement and excludes variation from certain forecasted costs the exclusions include cross associated with major storms changing in timing of expenditure and investment that moved the expenditure investment into or out of the applicable calendar year and changes in income taxes among other things the true up cap also excludes cost recovered through riders such as purchase power transmission and bad debts rate impact to customers may also be mitigated through the ability to phase in rates the legislation also allows for two utility owned solar and or battery storage pilot projects to be located near peoria and east st louis at a cost not to exceed 20 million each it also provides for programs that encourage transportation electrification in the state we believe this framework will improve our ability to make significant investments in the state of illinois and earn a fair return on equity looking ahead we have the ability to opt in to the multiyear rate plan or use the future test year traditional rate making framework both of which include a return on equity determined by the icc and revenue decoupling should we choose to opt into the new multiyear rate plan our four year plan must be filed by january 20 2023 we anticipate continuing to use the performance based ratemaking until we proceed with a multiyear rate plan filing or choose to move ahead with using the traditional framework moving to page 20 for a financing update we continue to feel very good about our financial position were able to successfully actually on several debt issuances earlier this year which we have outlined on this page in order for us to maintain our credit earnings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan and consistent with prior guidance as of august 15 we have completed the issuance of approximately 150 million of common equity through our at the market or atm program that was established in may further approximately 30 million of equity outlined for 2022 have been sold year to date under the programs forward sales agreement together with the issuance under our 401 k and drplus program our 750 million atm equity program is expected to support equity needs through 2023 moving now to page 21 id like to briefly touch on the recent increase in natural gas prices around the country and the potential impact it may have on customer bills this coming winter beginning with our natural gas business heading into the winter season ameren is approximately 75 hedged and ameren missouri is approximately 85 hedged based on normal seasonal sales approximately 60 of illinois winter supply of natural gas was bought this summer at lower prices and is being stored in the companys 12 underground storage fields both companies are 100 volumetrically hedged based on maximum seasonal sales regarding the electric business in missouri we are currently long generation and any margin made through off systems sales flow back to customers as a benefit on their bills through the fuel adjustment clause given our low cost of generation rising natural gas and power prices have the potential to benefit our electric customers in missouri turning to page 22 we plan to provide 2022 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in february next year using our 2021 guidance as a reference point we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about earnings outlook for next year beginning with missouri we expect the new electric service rates to be effective in 2022 as a result of our pending rate review these rates are expected to reflect recovery of and return on new infrastructure and wind generation investments which are expected to increase earnings when compared to 2021 prior to new electric service rates taking effect in late february we expect increased investments in infrastructure and wind generation eligible for plant and service accounting and a resram that positively impact earnings next i would note we expect to recognize earnings related to energy efficiency performance incentives from both 2021 and 2022 plan years in 2022 as a result we expect energy efficiency performance incentives to be approximately 0 04 per share higher than 2021 further our return to normal weather in 2022 would decrease ameren missouri earnings by approximately 0 04 compared to 2021 results to date assuming normal weather in the last quarter of the year next earnings from our ferc related electric transition entities are expected to benefit from additional investments in the ameren illinois projects made under forward looking formula ratemaking for ameren illinois electric distribution earnings are expected to benefit in 2022 compared to 2021 from additional infrastructure investments made under illinois formula ratemaking the allowed roe under the formula will be the average 2022 30 year treasury yield plus 5 8 for ameren illinois natural gas earnings are expected to benefit from new delivery service rates effective late january 2021 as well as an increase in infrastructure investments qualifying for rider treatment that were in the current allowed roe of 9 67 and lastly turning to page 23 were well positioned to continue executing our plan we continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2021 as we successfully execute our strategy and as we look to the longer term we expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management further we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers and ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend in summary we have a total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers that concludes our prepared remarks we now invite your questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from jeremy tonet with jpmorgan please state your question warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer good morning jeremy jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst hi good morning warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer good morning jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst good morning thanks thanks for all the detail there and i just want to pick up on the miso mtep side i was just wondering if you might be able to provide any more color for your expectations there in the process and what could this specifically mean for ameren over time i realize we might be getting a little bit ahead of ourselves here but just wanted to know if theres any way you could frame i guess what you think could be possible for ameren capex here warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer yes thanks jeremy for the question number one let me just start with this were very excited about the opportunity that we have for the transmission investment number one were absolutely convinced that transmission is going to play an integral role and thats a fair company for our country and really executing this clean energy transition and were right in the middle of it we have been before and we are going to continue to be and so look its premature to put i would say a specific number as you heard us in our prepared remarks miso has identified 30 billion to 100 billion of investment opportunities of potential projects and i will tell you where the country is going is closer to that scenario 3 which is closer to the 100 billion number so what were doing what miso is doing what stakeholders are doing look were working together to try and make sure that we put together a good set of projects coming out of this first ntap that will start us on this path toward this clean energy transition and as we look at it if you look at that scenario one thats highlighted out there we really think the focus will be on more no regrets types of projects as we start putting our toes in the water if you will maybe getting up to our knees and then from there i think well see it continue to get progressively bigger over time we think therell be some no regrets projects and in terms of timing look i think the group our group and many stakeholders are working collaboratively to try and figure out the best projects as well as cost allocation things these things are all things that you typically go through in this process and so at the end of the day we think that miso will propose early in 2022 these projects to their board of directors it will be well informed and then what we believe will be hopefully will be an approval process that will get them in early 2022 so when you look at them in our overall plans as weve said before you might see some of these projects in our current five year plan start coming into play toward the back end of our five year plan but certainly in the second half of this decade i think youre going to see a significant emphasis and need for transmission projects so thats really what i can tell you today but as ill finish the way i started there were excited about the opportunity because we think its significant and important jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst got it thats helpful we eagerly await there warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer we do as well jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst maybe just pivoting over to the missouri irp here just wondering if you could share with us thoughts on next steps and i guess how rush island plays into it what we should be thinking about there warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer yes thanks jeremy marty lyons has been in the middle of all those things im going to turn it over to him to respond to your questions marty go ahead martin j lyons chairman president of ameren missouri thanks jeremy appreciate the question yes as it relates to the integrated resource plan obviously we filed last fall and as warner said earlier in the prepared remarks we continue to work with multiple developers with respect to several projects that would fit within that 1 200 megawatts of clean energy that we plan to deliver over the next several years consistent with that integrated resource plan so were continuing to work on those and we still expect to file with the commission still this year for approval of a portion of the project so that work is going on and then you mentioned the rush island energy center and so as you saw in our slides today in august the court of appeals affirmed the district courts september 19 order as we said in our slides and prepared remarks we did file for a rehearing of that decision on october 18 so we do expect to hear back from the court and quite likely by the end of this year we expect in terms of that rehearing so its really premature to say what action we will take with respect to rush island at this point well wait to see whether theres a rehearing but if that rehearing is denied and ultimately were faced with that decision obviously it may entail scrubbers in rush island or the accelerated retirement of that plant which might also include the utilization the securitization legislation was passed earlier this year so those are some of the things were looking at considerations as we think about those alternatives or things like customer rate impacts replacement generation needs and importantly reliability and investments that may be required in terms of transmission to the extent that rush island were to be prematurely retired so those are some of the considerations ill tell you this if ultimately a decision is made to retire rush island prematurely versus the date we had in our prior integrated resource plan that will require them that we file an updated integrated resource plan with the missouri public service commission so stay tuned on that like i said its premature to say how all of that will turn out but that gives you a little bit of color on the potential path forward jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst got it thats helpful thank you for that and just one last quick one if i could just wondering if you might be able to comment on your generation position and do you see any potential customer benefits under current market conditions right now warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer jeremy its michael yes i think we indicated in the prepared remarks in the slide that we historically have been long in the missouri side and so obviously to the extent that were able to take advantage of that in the marketplace its off systems sales that flow back to customers through the fuel adjustment clause so certainly given where natural gas prices are which is what the impact its having on power prices its definitely a bit of a tailwind from a customer affordability standpoint jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst got it ill leave it there thank you warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer thanks jeremy see you next week jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst see you then operator our next question comes from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america please state your question warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer good morning julien how are you doing dariusz lozny bank of america analyst this is dariusz on for julien actually thank you for taking my questions can you just clarify it was a little unclear from the opening remarks do you intend or are you still evaluating whether or not youll file under a multiyear rate plan in illinois in or before january 23 warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer yes so this is warner so let me just summarize what weve said clearly as i said and as michael said we think this is a forward thinking constructive regulatory structure and not only is it constructive that enables us to make investments that we think are important for customers but also gives us the opportunity to earn a fair return on those investments now what we said too is that the structure is out there but theres still some work to be done meaning that there are workshops that have to be taken care of next year as you might have with any specific and comprehensive piece of legislation and were going to work through those workshops now we believe those workshops were at the table and we expect them to be constructive outcomes and so as a result as we said too we anticipate filing for a multiyear rate plan in 2023 but theres still some work to be done and so were not trying to hedge or be cute we just sort of telling it like it is but at the same time as i said we think its a constructive piece of legislation that we think will bring benefits to our customers in state of illinois and certainly to our shareholders michael do you have anything you want to add michael l moehn executive vice president chief financial officer chairman of ameren missouri president of ameren look you said it all correctly i mean these workshops will continue on through 22 and i think well have a conclusion of them by the fall so well have even better clarity but as warner said the benefits clearly seem to be pretty significant here in terms of just the overall framework itself so warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer yes and just to give you a perspective these workshops as you know where we talk about performance metrics theres a performance based ratemaking perspective and concept incorporated in this legislation so the performance metrics have to be determined how you work through some of the details of the multiyear rate plan these are things that stakeholders have to come to the table and we look forward to working collaboratively with all of them next year dariusz lozny bank of america analyst thats very helpful color and if i could pivot maybe to federal legislation if i can have you quantified at all or thought about the potential upside impact on your credit metrics from direct pay if that were included in final legislation warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer yes thanks needless to say that is a very fluid situation just in the bigger picture and so to say that weve quantified in particular the specific impacts that would be premature i will say there are elements of the clean energy tax incentives which i think are very good for customers and could be good for cash flows especially when you look at the direct pay portions around certainly the itcs and the ptcs that you have for wind and solars really the entire tax incentives so michael i know that you and your team have been looking at it but we havent put a specific finger on it but do you want to add a little more color than that michael l moehn executive vice president chief financial officer chairman of ameren missouri president of ameren yes i mean at a high level thats correct warner i mean we are they get into it i think there are some positive aspects there are also some things that we got to just get our hands around head around with respect to like this minimum tax liability which seems to run counter to some those credits as well so those are just some different aspects that were really trying to balance at the end of the day but hopefully over the course of the next quarter or so well have a much better feel for where this is going warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer one thing you can rest assured is that me and my industry colleagues were at the table to try and make sure that we get a constructive piece of federal legislation down across the board that will enable us to continue to move forward thoughtfully and effectively with the clean energy transition dariusz lozny bank of america analyst great thank you very much ill pass it on from here warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer you bet thank you operator our next question comes from insoo kim with goldman sachs please state your question warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer good morning insoo how are you doing insoo kim goldman sachs analyst good morning warner how are you my first question is on the question on the rush island and the long term generation plan if the appeal process is unsuccessful first of all is it by the end of 23 that you need to either put the scrubbers on or retire or is it 24 and then my the related question to that is as you think about potential changes to the plan if this had to shut early given that long generation position how do we think about some of the opportunities on the replacement side of things warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer marty why dont you jump on and then address that one please martin j lyons chairman president of ameren missouri yes thanks insoo good to talk to you again with respect to moving forward with scrubber i think there the expectation is that we would if we went that route move as expeditiously as possible to put the scrubbers in place at rush island so im not sure that theres an exact time line obviously the acquisition design construction would take some time to get that put in place and then with respect to the other route that you described the retirement route i think there wed be looking at how long rush island would continue to operate obviously given the things i talked about before replacement generation needs importantly reliability issues around the system in the event of premature retirement which again may necessitate some transmission investments in order to maintain reliability so all of those things would be taken into consideration and ultimately to the extent that incremental generation was required or some acceleration of the clean energy transition that weve got laid out in our irp that would all be laid out in that updated integrated resource plan so again if we dont move forward with the scrubber if we do decide that the rush island needs to be shut down earlier than the day in our irp which was 2039 then we would move forward with an update to the integrated resource plan and again and so that would assess all of the potential adjustments to generation need and timing that were laid out in that prior september integrated resource plan filing insoo kim goldman sachs analyst got it thanks for the color marty the second question is on the 2021 guidance raising that by 0 10 and as we think about the 22 i know some of the weather benefit helped this year as well but how do we think about some of the moving pieces that help 21 that could potentially carry into 22 and in that consideration slide i didnt see a specific mention to year over year low growth just curious on your base assumption there michael l moehn executive vice president chief financial officer chairman of ameren missouri president of ameren yes look theres a lot in that question there let me give you a couple of pieces just in terms of the growth itself i mean year to date weve put in there from a residential standpoint were up 1 5 commercial 3 5 and industrial 1 so about 2 and thats really what we guided to at the beginning of the year in february now the mix is a little bit different so were seeing some improvement in margin there which is a driver of that increase in the midpoint that you talked about in addition to weather so we the plan remains on track with respect to that sales piece that 2 we see that sort of guiding in at the same point toward the end of the year as we talked about at the beginning of the year that will get us close to being back to 2019 but not quite so i think the recovery continues and were optimistic about how we continue to see things open up here in both of our service territories in missouri and illinois with respect to the guidance itself i just remind you again we released in february last year that 6 to 8 guidance was off of that midpoint obviously at 375 million that original midpoint of 375 million we certainly have given you some select items to think about here in 22 and then obviously in february well roll all this forward to give you another look at capital as well as give you just more specifics about obviously where our range will be in our earnings guidance for 22 at that point in time so hopefully that gives you a little bit of color youre looking for insoo kim goldman sachs analyst got it thank you and congrats marty and warner both of you and see you soon martin j lyons chairman president of ameren missouri thanks insoo warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer thanks insoo well see you next week operator our next question comes from durgesh chopra with evercore isi please state your question warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer good morning durgesh durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst good morning warner congratulations and to you as well marty warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer thank you durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst i look forward to working with you maybe just can you talk about the 1 2 gigawatts in missouri irp just kind of what of that what how many what portion of that capacity are you going to file for with the commission or get approvals for this year or early next year just as youre thinking about your capex plan being extended another year im thinking about how much of that 1 2 gigawatt might be layered in warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer sure you bet marty why dont you come on in and address that from an operational perspective and maybe michael you can talk about how we think about guidance in terms of capital expenditures and those types of things martin j lyons chairman president of ameren missouri yes that sounds great warner durgesh i appreciate the question the and i think michael will get into this and expand on it none of that 1 200 megawatts is really included today in the rate base growth or earnings guidance we have as i said earlier we continue to work with multiple developers with respect to multiple projects that would go toward filling out that 1 200 megawatts at this point as we negotiate through those i mean its important to understand that those negotiations take time theres diligence involved theres again multiple developers were working with really to get the best deals we can for our customers ultimately and there are multiple contracts that need to be negotiated with each one of the developers so we continue to work again with multiple of them on multiple projects and at this point id say again id say were expecting to file for approval for a portion of that 1 200 megawatts i expect that that will happen this year still but also then even further into next year so stay tuned i think its premature to say exactly which project or projects well announce this year or early next but were working actively on several so thats where we stand today michael l moehn executive vice president chief financial officer chairman of ameren missouri president of ameren thanks marty just a couple of other small points on that 17 billion plan that we have out there as marty pointed out theres very very little in there with respect to any of these renewable projects now we did indicate in that 10 year plan that 40 billion plus there is 3 billion of potential projects which what marty is referring to so as we get more clarity on that timing obviously typically what we do in february as we roll forward that capital plan to be able to give you a bit more transparency about what the timing of that to the extent that we feel better about it and know it so thats just a little bit more color on exactly whats there from a capital standpoint durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst right i appreciate that detail then just shifting gears to illinois obviously now the under the new framework the roe goes back to the icc and they kind of come back with an roe number just any early thoughts on how might they be calculating that i mean we and investors have talked about sort of your gas assets there and the roes theyre getting in 9 plus percent range just any from your seat just any early color into what roe might look like or how might that be calculated i appreciate that warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer sure this is warner look its certainly be premature to predict where the roes would be i mean the filing is going to be sometime in 2023 and its a multiyear filing but what we can point to is obviously the 580 basis points plus a 30 year treasury what that yields today what we can point to is that in our gas business that we did at the beginning of this year put in place say the rate review results that was a 9 67 return on equity for our gas business its not the electric business but its the gas business it is just a data point but how that will ultimately look and what the request will be for a multiyear rate plan and a lot of facts and circumstances will go into that but we do see an opportunity for improvement clearly from our existing return on equity going forward martin j lyons chairman president of ameren missouri yes i mean and just think about that 9 67 is kind of traditional cost of capital kind of calculations theres nothing thats sort of about it from a regulatory perspective so its obviously different than moving away from this formulaic piece that we have warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer exactly and we would expect the overall process and looking at that return on equity in terms of sort of a traditional look would be very similar but obviously with the multiyear rate plan there may be some other factors that have come into it so stay tuned durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst all right ill leave it there thanks guys warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer you bet thank you operator our next question comes from paul patterson with glenrock associates please state your question paul patterson glenrock associates analyst good morning how are you doing warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer im good how are you paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay so what i wanted to first of all i want to congratulate you guys is this your last call warner warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer number one thank you im truly excited about the new leadership structure and certainly the new roles that marty and i are taking and in terms of the last call gosh were taking one step at a time were not saying this is my last call or anything like that well take that one step at a time but you can kind of meet me at the eei next week thats for sure paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay well congratulations both of you warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer thank you paul patterson glenrock associates analyst and so just some most of my questions have been answered but a couple of quick ones for you and i apologize for not knowing this but what are no regrets projects i just dont see it that drew blank what does that mean warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer its probably a warner term right so really when you look at all these projects i mean some you can sit there and say gosh when we had to get where were having these congestion areas when we had to get from point a to point b we have these projects that are in the queue there are certain of these regional projects which really satisfy a lot of those transmission or excuse me renewable energy projects that are in the queue and you do the analysis and you sit there and say gosh no one could do this no one i shouldnt say that it would be hard for people to argue that this isnt a project that isnt going to be significantly beneficial to the miso footprint frankly to our country so i cant put those as no regrets low risk lets call them that way lower risk projects relatively speaking compared to some that may have more complications and so when you look at that scenario 1 we think from our perspective right beauty is in the eyes of the beholder but from our perspective and we think there are several of those in there that need to be that need to move forward so thats what i mean we havent outlined which of those that we believe are there and this is part of the collaborative process that we go through with miso and other key stakeholders but thats how we think really lower risk is probably a better term to characterize those projects as paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay fair enough and then sort of a technical question there was this discovery dispute in the missouri rate case on the smart energy plan and it looked to me like basically they didnt address it in their testimony or rebuttal or what have you and i just wanted to make sure has that really been resolved it just wasnt clear to me from what they were saying they didnt really seem to address it and the revenue requirement everything didnt seem to penalize you or anything for the recommendation so my question is has that issue been taken care of martin j lyons chairman president of ameren missouri paul its marty i cant say whether its been fully taken care of everybodys satisfaction i will tell you this we do look to work constructively with all the parties in these rate reviews to get everybody the information they need in a timely basis to make decisions and to your point do not believe its an active issue in terms of a quantified difference between our position and the positions of others in the case so hopefully we have resolved that issue fully but like you said its not manifesting itself today in any kind of difference between the parties paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay great and then finally back to the 2024 question i realize its very early but it does seem like a big opportunity with respect to the illinois legislation and im just wondering when you guys might incorporate it the potential outlook with it into your long term guidance i mean it doesnt sound like it will be anything immediate but i was just wondering could it be a year from now or so that you guys would feel more comfortable talking about its potential benefit impact to the long term growth outlook or would you be basically waiting until i guess whenever the 2023 decision was made kind of so to speak warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer sure yes paul this is warner its a fair question well provide a lot more guidance right on that specific question and others when we come with our longer term guidance in february well give you our view right on how we think about the guidance that we set in and how we think about regulatory frameworks and all those types of things so as we sit here today obviously nothing to change nothing to talk about other than as weve said we think its a constructive piece of legislation that we anticipate assuming that things go well in the workshops so we would file for a multiyear rate plan how we embed that into our long term guidance in early 2022 stay tuned well be able to provide more detail on that paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay awesome well thanks so much and congratulations again have a great one warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer thanks paul you do the same operator thanks and our next question comes from david paz with wolfe please state your question warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer hello david how are you doing david paz wolfe analyst hey warner how you doing congratulations to you and marty warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer thank you martin j lyons chairman president of ameren missouri thanks david warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer thank you david paz wolfe analyst i just want to follow up on a couple of quick questions just the following up on the 1 200 megawatt maybe lots of missouri question i understand the spend is not in your stated outlook financial outlook but is any of the equity for that investment in your financing plan michael l moehn executive vice president chief financial officer chairman of ameren missouri president of ameren david this is michael i mean that 17 billion plan again out there the equity that we talked about back in february really supports that 17 billion plan its again sort of there by default that win is not in there theres no equity in there for david paz wolfe analyst got it and then in an earlier question michael did you say that you would be going forward your growth rate off of 2022 guidance or 2021 actuals when you were talking about the february update michael l moehn executive vice president chief financial officer chairman of ameren missouri president of ameren yes i was just referring to last february david when we gave the 6 to 8 earnings per share growth guidance it was off of that midpoint of 3 75 and so thats where people should continue to stay focused we obviously gave you some 22 select items here to think about in the third quarter and then well obviously roll forward stuff and give you a specific guidance in february of 22 david paz wolfe analyst i see okay great and maybe just a last question i think its marty can you provide an update maybe on just how settlement talks are going in the rate case or whether theyre still going martin j lyons chairman president of ameren missouri thanks david the settlement talks really get going here over the next couple of weeks we actually have as we laid out in the slide a rebuttal testimony thats actually due friday so i think all the parties are focused on that and then soon after that the parties will be pulling together reconciliations of the differences between our case and the updated positions of the staff in particular but also other parties and then settlement discussions will get underway as you know again is our right now the evidence youre hearing are really scheduled to begin right after thanksgiving on november 29 so my expectation is that starting next week and all the way through that time period therell be settlement discussions hopefully to narrow the issues and if possible to resolve the entire case obviously we have been successful in settling a number of cases that weve had over the past several years including the last rate review so we certainly expect to work toward that goal and like i said those discussions will really be happening between now and likely the beginning of those evidentiary hearings david paz wolfe analyst great thank you so much warner l baxter chairman president chief executive officer thanks david see you next week operator thank you and we have reached the end of the question and answer session so ill now turn the call back over to andrew kirk for closing remarks andrew kirk director of

provided is used by our management and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies as we turn to slide three i d like to turn the call over to sam samuel j mitchell chief executive officer and director thanks john fiscal year 2021 was a remarkable year for growth and transformation at valvoline our strategy to become a more service driven business was strengthened as our retail services segment contributed 54 of our total segment adjusted ebitda our year over year results were exceptional with sales growing 27 and adjusted ebitda seeing a 28 increase both segments generated strong results including 21 year over year same store sales growth for retail services and 20 year over year sales growth in global products we are very pleased with our progress to date and excited about the results we are seeing let s turn to the next slide our strategic investments to grow retail services helped us reach a critical inflection point in our fiscal 2021 results and helped us deliver 28 returns on invested capital with 3 billion in revenue the benefits of our transformation to a service driven business are evident in our growth since 2018 success of both the tremendous progress we have made and we expect that both businesses will continue to thrive as separate we believe a separation will allow both businesses to pursue their individual strategic priorities allocate capital to drive success and create significant and sustainable value for our shareholders moving into segment highlights let s discuss retail services on slide six our retail services segment is the second largest quick lubes operator in north america with nearly 1 600 stores that deliver a wide selection of preventive auto maintenance services the segment had another outstanding year in fiscal 2021 sales of 1 2 billion grew 38 year over year and nearly 50 versus pre pandemic fiscal 2019 the top line continues to be driven by our growth levers of same store sales performance and unit additions our market leading scale and data sophistication enhances our ability to gain share and expand average ticket and drive sustainable growth and profitability we expect that our superior will continue to deliver growth going forward top line results were driven by the combination of same store sales which increased 21 plus unit growth of 9 2021 marked the 15th consecutive year of same store sales growth highlighting our superior in store experience store level sales across the system reached roughly 2 billion growing 30 and demonstrating the scale of the preventive auto care business that our team has built our outstanding same store sales performance for fiscal 2021 was driven first by transactions as we capture significant market share as well as a high single digit growth rate in average ticket we exited fiscal 2021 at a rate of more than 50 oil changes per day across the system significantly outperforming the industry average which is in the low 30s the top one of three of our stores finished the year performing more than 70 oil changes per day demonstrating the strength of our system pricing power and the ongoing shift to synthetic drove growth in average ticket recall from our may business update that synthetic oil changes generate roughly two times the revenue and three times the service margin versus conventional just over one of three of our oil changes are synthetic while roughly 70 of new cars would have a recommendation for a synthetic lubricant we believe that our quick easy trusted customer experience and data driven approach will continue to transaction and average ticket growth in the future as we continue to grow our market share and open new locations our customer base expands generating more data to leverage further growth in a virtuous cycle in the future our customer relationships will be utilized to drive incremental services as the car park evolves let s review results in global products on the next slide i m pleased with the strong top line growth in global products in fiscal 2021 sales grew 20 year over year and 12 versus prepandemic fiscal 2019 led by international markets each region grew over this period and international markets have seen accelerated growth as we continue to enhance our supply chain capabilities and invest in brand marketing global products business uses a value added selling approach to win and retain installer and heavy duty customers we are driving synergy across the global products business to accelerate share growth and benefit our customers for example we have recently expanded digital capabilities from north america and we are bringing our expertise in heavy duty internationally where it represents a higher percent of our mix to north america the combination of international growth performance in north america and low maintenance capital needs has generated profitable share growth and strong discretionary free cash flow over the past several years and we expect this to continue into the future next slide please our global products business is well positioned to increase its market share globally by leveraging our leading valvoline brand extensive distribution network and robust technology all of which helped drive top line growth in fiscal 2021 we expect this momentum to continue in fiscal 2022 adjusted ebitda margins were close to 19 for the year margins were impacted by price cost lag in the second half of 2021 and as expected particularly in q4 due to significant raw material cost increases this past spring although we expect lingering price cost lag in supply chain bottlenecks to impact the first half of fiscal 2022 we are making good progress passing these cost increases through even with pressure on margins global products delivered another year of over 200 million in discretionary free cash flow across regions and channels we are encouraged by our volume performance and strength of demand for our preventive maintenance products north america s diy volume has been healthy at auto parts retailers mass merchandisers and has benefited from new distribution in the convenience store channel we saw volume growth in all international markets both year over year and versus 2019 despite covid 19 and supply chain challenges we expect volume growth to continue in both north america and international markets in fiscal 2022 the fundamentals of the global products business are as is the long term outlook now i ll turn things over to mary to review our financial results in more detail mary e meixelsperger chief financial officer thanks sam our q4 results are summarized on slide 11 we saw robust top line growth both year over year and versus the pre pandemic period in q4 of 2019 which is a testament to the ongoing strong demand for our products and services sales growth was primarily driven by retail services including more than 300 basis points from store acquisitions year over year growth in adjusted ebitda due to significant price cost lag impacts particularly in global products as raw material costs were declining in fiscal 2020 and the past year our adjusted effective tax rate in q4 came in lower than expected due to a favorable discrete tax item which benefited adjusted eps let s take a closer look at segment ebitda margins on the next slide retail services adjusted ebitda growth in the quarter was driven by exceptional same store sales and strong unit additions ebitda margin declined compared to last year due to investments we made in labor during the quarter along with the impact of passing through pricing to cover higher raw material costs as expected price cost lag was the primary driver of declines in adjusted ebitda results in margin in global products sales grew faster than volume highlighting progress in passing through cost increases however our sales growth will not translate into margin rate expansion as unit price increases generally offset unit cost increases focusing on ebitda dollars and cash generation more appropriate metrics than percentage margins in a volatile rate raw material environment our full year 21 results are summarized on slide 13 both segments made contributions to the substantial growth in sales and gross profit compared to last year versus fiscal 19 retail services led the way with top line and margin improvement driven by leveraging outstanding same store sales and unit growth acquisitions added 300 basis points to overall sales growth and roughly 260 basis points to adjusted ebitda growth sg a was impacted by several key factors year over year first we reinstated advertising spending that we prior year due to the severity of the pandemic second we saw increases in variable compensation driven by our record results third we made investments to drive future growth including acquisitions and investments in it and sales support and finally we saw increases due to fx impacts and inflation as you can see on slide 14 the cash generative nature of the business remains strong maintenance capital was roughly 1 of sales for the year while discretionary and free cash flow were 12 and nearly 9 respectively growth capex was modestly lower than we expected due in part to supply chain driven delays in new company store openings in fiscal 21 we returned 218 million in cash to holders via dividends and share repurchases including 27 million in share repurchases made in q4 under our recent 300 million three year share repurchase authorization we believe our capitalized business model will continue to drive significant cash flow to fund growth and returns to shareholders let s review our fiscal 22 guidance on the next slide we expect the top line momentum we saw in fiscal 21 to continue in fiscal 22 driven by strong same store sales growth of 9 to 12 the addition of more than 100 new stores continued top line growth in global products we anticipate overall adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 675 million to 700 million representing 7 to 10 year over year growth retail services is expected to generate mid to high teens growth and contribute segment ebitda of 440 million to 455 million while global products is projected to contribute segment ebitda of 315 million to 330 million unallocated corporate expenses comprise the balance we expect improved profitability as we progress through fiscal 22 in global products with projected second half ebitda and margin exceeding the first half due to the near term impact of price cost lag below the line we anticipate our growth focused capital investments to increase depreciation and amortization next year to between 105 million to 110 million based on current rates interest expense should level out to roughly 18 million per quarter we continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate for the year to be in the 25 to 26 range leading to adjusted eps in the range of 2 06 to 2 18 per share for fiscal 22 with carryover capital from fiscal 21 including new company store build we expect an increase in capex in fiscal 22 leading to free cash flow of 260 million to 300 million with that i ll turn things back over to sam samuel j mitchell chief executive officer and director thanks mary we want to spend a few minutes discussing our recent decision to pursue a separation of our global products and retail services segments we believe that this is the right time because valvoline s transformation has progressed to the point where both parts of the business can stand on their own and fund their individual strategic priorities for continued success with the significant growth of the retail services segment the two businesses are now each of considerable scale and contributed in excess of 300 million in adjusted ebitda just four years ago our retail services business contributed 34 of segment ebitda it s important to note that this transformation reflects the strong growth of retail services as global products has continued to generate strong stable cash flows the board and executive team are confident that the separation will create significant and sustainable value for our shareholders employees and other stakeholders and will best position both outstanding businesses for continued long term success turning to slide 18 this is a strategically compelling step for the company and its stakeholders both businesses are strong with robust financial and operational performance and scale they are leaders in their respective markets we have built a brand that stands for great products and great services we have invested in our teams and digital capabilities and have developed an intense customer focus that sets both businesses up for long term success in addition the separation will best position each segment to evolve its business model as needed to effectively and sustainably compete in an evolving powertrain environment the separation will allow each business to focus on its own distinct customer base and business model and deploy capital where needed to enhance the respective services and product lines as the car park continues to evolve with the separation we see a clear path to unlocking significant shareholder value on slide 19 we look at retail services and its attractive opportunities for continued growth auto aftermarket services is a 300 billion addressable market that is highly fragmented growing and resilient our retail services segment is well positioned to continue to increase its market share by leveraging its world class service model and executing on our three pillar growth strategy consisting of one expanding the footprint through new company owned locations acquisition opportunities and franchise development two leveraging proprietary data analytics technology to effectively market and a best and drive best in class customer experience and three evolving our service offerings to capture growing opportunities in the market for example we are pursuing fleets service solutions to address medium and heavy duty vehicles which will require comprehensive maintenance needs additionally we are exploring relationships with ev oems for both products and services including our joint intent to partner with a rival to service their future fleet of electric vehicles in the u s our nearly 1 600 locations our customer centric brand and leading operating model best positions valvoline to expand service offerings and delivery in the future moving to slide 20 we have compared our retail services segment against a few publicly traded peers on several sales growth and profitability metrics as you can see our business outperforms the peer group on most of these segments most of these metrics the peer multiples underscore the compelling opportunity we believe we have to unlock shareholder value what should be the opportunity in global products on the next slide global products is a market leading strong cash generating automotive solutions provider preventive maintenance products like lubricants are non discretionary which provides market resilience while the shift toward synthetic premium lubricants drives the potential for margin expansion the addressable market for lubricants internationally is estimated to be 3 5 times larger than north america global products is well positioned to continue delivering profitable share growth driven primarily by international growth markets such as india china latin america and emea our industry leading research and development capabilities strong growing distribution network and powerful brand are key competitive strengths in a changing market we are partnering with technology leaders oems and researchers to address the needs of both current and future vehicles let s move to the next slide as we just did with retail services here we compare global products against a few publicly traded companies with similar business models on sales growth and profitability metrics as you can see global products performed in line or favorably against the peer group on these metrics again we believe that peer trading multiples show the compelling value creation potential from a separation on slide 23 we describe next steps as noted in our october 12 announcement we are working with outside advisors to determine the best way to accomplish the separation while we are diligently evaluating possible transaction and capital structures for each business no timetable has yet been established for the completion of the separation irrespective of how the separation is executed we anticipate that retail services and global products will enter into commercially beneficial product supply and brand use agreements that will position both businesses for continued success we will approach all upcoming decisions with the goal of minimizing these synergies for both businesses and maximizing shareholder value in closing i want to thank our valvoline team for delivering a great year our teams have never been stronger and continue to do an outstanding job of taking care of customers and driving the business we are focused on delivering results in the new fiscal year as we work to capture the compelling value that we see from the separation of our two excellent businesses and with that i ll hand things back to sean to open the line for question and answer sean t cornett senior director of investor relations and assistant treasurer thanks sam quick reminder to limit questions to one and a follow up so that we can get to everybody with that sam please open the line questions and answers operator our first question comes from simeon gutman from morgan stanley simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst this is michael kessler on for simeon first i wanted to ask about retail services i think you mentioned the ticket growth was around 10 in the quarter it s been strong that alone is above your the kind of longer term 6 to 8 same store sales algo for the business and then you also have general throughput increases and traffic increasing so i guess i m curious how you guys are thinking about if that is a sustainable level of ticket growth for the business given the tailwind with mix and other factors and how much upside could there be to same store sales given these tailwinds and i guess given the way you ve guided 2022 being well above that algo it looks quite strong samuel j mitchell chief executive officer and director yes we were certainly impressed with our performance this year in same store sales growth both on the transaction side which was the primary driver but also on the ticket side too as you pointed out and the big ticket drivers this year were the synthetic penetration which is a nice driver for us so we saw a few hundred basis points improvement in our synthetic oil change penetration but also moves on pricing too that helped us cover some of the increased costs so we ve been able to make effective price adjustments this past year and i think that will continue to be important next year as we do have some rising costs particularly on the labor front but with regard to expectations for next year we do see same store sales growth moderating somewhat still above our guidance that we gave back in may but we are expecting to be closer to that with a 9 to 12 guidance for next year and i expect that to be a pretty good balance between both transaction and ticket performance but to your point though on just the long term opportunity the synthetic trend is going to continue at a good steady rate so that s a nice driver but the penetration of the non oil change services is another big opportunity for us and so the team is very much focused on that and so we feel that ticket has got a long way to run in terms of its continued performance but i got to say i got to come back to the growth that we had in transactions and the market share growth that we re seeing with tremendous growth in car counts and that is a great driver of future performance of this business when we re seeing this kind of growth so it provides just really strong leverage to the bottom line too as we bring in more customers and we drive that loyalty through the capabilities that we have both in store and through our digital marketing capabilities mary e meixelsperger chief financial officer and sam i would add to that we have seen improvements in miles driven as they re seeing some recovery from the pandemic and so that s provided some tailwinds as well certainly in the fourth quarter and going into the new fiscal year we expect to continue to see some benefits from the miles driven recovery versus prior periods samuel j mitchell chief executive officer and director definitely analyst okay great and my follow up is on margins and maybe on both segments the retail services maybe would have expected a little bit better margin performance given the top line growth if it was down a little bit on ebitda margin so just kind of what drove that was it through the labor issues and the position there and then on the global products side i know the margin can be very volatile in these environments it does look like for 2022 we re going to end up probably below the 17 to 19 target range is there any reason to think we won t get back there once we get to kind of normalized base oil pricing which it feels like we are at least stabilizing and we can get back to that maybe in 2023 mary e meixelsperger chief financial officer so on the second half of your question i do think that longer term we will see return in terms of the ebitda margins once we ve stabilized and have been able to see full pass through of price increases i do think that base oils today are trading at unusually high margins because of the refining capacity limitations and my expectation is there ll be some reversion to more normal levels as we see some of the supply chain issues to take out longer term so i think the guidance the longer term guidance we gave is still a reasonable to think about as we think about 2023 and beyond on the margins for the retail services business we re still seeing nice leverage in our same store sales margin we had some impact in the quarter and for the full year related to labor we ve made some incremental labor investments in fourth quarter that created some deleverage and interestingly we saw some deleverage related to price increases that were being passed through on products to our franchisees so as you know we sell all of our products to the franchisees and that in fact passing through those cost increases caused some deleverage in margins unit margins as noted on profitability for oil chains were still quite strong and but because of the pass through of that pricing we did see some transient margin deleverage to franchisees and then finally we ve got some mix impacts as we ve mixed seen our mix weigh a little bit more heavily to company stores from franchise that results in a modestly lower margin impact as well so but i think the important thing for you to know and for investors to know is that as it relates to our core performance in our same store businesses we re continuing to see our margin rates leverage as we re seeing these strong same store sales performance operator our next question comes from mike harrison of seaport research partners mike harrison seaport research partners analyst was wondering if you can talk about the 110 to 130 system wide store additions affecting for the year how do those break out between franchise and company operated and have you seen any of the costs for constructing a new location go up maybe talk a little bit about how inflation has impacted your new store economics or returns samuel j mitchell chief executive officer and director as far as the growth plan for next year about half of those stores are going to be new ground up stores so we ve got a good pipeline of new stores that will be coming out of the ground in fiscal 22 we do expect solid franchise growth too and that would be the second largest contributor of i would say roughly one of three of the growth of those new stores and then we have a good pipeline of small acquisitions that would add to put us in that range so another solid year of unit growth for valvoline regarding inflationary pressures in construction those are real i don t have a percent increase that we re seeing i would say our biggest challenge this past year has been just some of the builds taking a little bit longer with some of the contractor labor issues that they ve had mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right and then was hoping maybe you could provide a little more color on what you re seeing in terms of overall inflation within your business a lot of us focus on the base oil tricks but you re also spending on additives packaging freight and logistics as well as labor can you talk about what your expectations are for each of those areas in terms of inflation and maybe any availability issues that you ve faced mary e meixelsperger chief financial officer sure i can take that mike we certainly have been seeing some inflationary pressures in the other key aspects of our cost of sales which really are early in the additives and logistics freight area we have certainly been factoring that into our pricing when we re looking at how we re pricing to our customers so that ultimately we believe we ll be able to see recovery from those costs but there have been continued cost pressures probably more significantly than the cost pressure has been in some areas the availability and some of the pressure on the additive side that s created some supply chain pressure our supply chain team has just done an outstanding job of managing those challenges with our important suppliers and that s really allowed us provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace because of that performance but we still are seeing some pressure in the additive space that frankly goes back to some of the damage that was done in those in the freeze down in texas and along the gulf coast impacting many chemical providers down in that area that have created some constraints in the additive space and that s been a bigger challenge for us the demand signals have been very very strong and so we ve been working very diligently to make certain that we re able to provide products across our customer base during this time but that s been probably the bigger challenge that we ve seen than the actual cost increases sam anything you d add to that samuel j mitchell chief executive officer and director i think mary covered it well with the fact that we re adjusting prices accordingly to protect our unit margins but we are feeling that price cost lag impact because the costs are hitting us a bit faster than pricing the diy channel where we tend to have the most significant price cost lag is always an issue for us but we ve got pricing that we re implementing here in our first quarter we expect to see another price adjustment executed another price adjustment in q2 and then as some of the tightness in the market resolves itself we think we ll be in a nice position for the second half of the year but the key takeaway is that we are having success in passing through pricing first of all and the demand is very strong in our business so some of the marketing initiatives that we ve been investing in the partnership that we have with our key retail accounts is really producing strong fruits for the business both this past year this summer but well positioned with our line reviews and store sets merchandising plans for fiscal 22 so the business is in a strong position fundamentally and that s why you hear the confidence in our forecast for the global products side of the business in fiscal 22 operator our next question comes from wendy nicholson of citi wendy nicholson citi analyst my question has to do kind of longer term and sort of bigger picture on the global products business if i look at the chart on figure nine sales by region the north america business has been largely flat plus or minus over the last four years which is fine but the growth is coming from outside the u s and just again sort of bigger picture over the next let s call it two three years do you think that north america business will grow i know you talked about incremental distribution in the c store channel meaningful and related to that can you talk about the margin impact of the growth coming from the international business is that international business going to be higher margin lower margin just net of all of the commodity costs and all of that i m just looking for sort of longer term outlook samuel j mitchell chief executive officer and director yes but so just breaking down that north america versus international growth the north american business over a multiyear period you say looks pretty flat but if you recall we had some significant pressure back in 2018 into 2019 in the diy channel we have had really good success stabilizing that business and our share and now with some of the investments that we ve been making in some of our new programs we re beginning to see real growth in that channel as i pointed out both in retail auto parts and maps and some of the new distribution that we ve had so we re feeling more confident about north american growth than we have in quite a while and the fundamentals on the installer side have been solid too we ve signed re signed our largest national accounts to multiyear contracts and some of our digital initiatives are really paying off with some of the smaller regional accounts too so feel very good about north american s volume being able to grow in that low single digit range and on the international front boy we were really seeing strong volume momentum pre covid before the spring of 2020 we re definitely impacted in 2020 in our growth rates but as this past year has shown we re really back on track with international growth and so performing at a level measurably higher than 2019 volume performance and we feel like we re very well positioned for 2022 growth particularly as we move beyond the lingering effects of covid in the markets so growth rate obviously a lot of confidence there on the margin front the international business we ve been able to move pricing up appropriately within with some of the inflationary pressures but you re correct in that the international business carries a lower margin than north america and that s factored into our guidance that we provided in terms of what we expect overall from the global products business the key thing that s holding global products profit growth back is really this price cost lag effect in the first half of the year and most of that is in the north american business operator our next question comes from laurence alexander from jefferies laurence alexander jefferies analyst this is dan rizzo on for laurence you mentioned minimizing synergies in the split i was just wondering where you see the largest dissynergies and if you have a relative ballpark on what stranded costs or synergy cost would be mary e meixelsperger chief financial officer so we don t have a ballpark yet there s a lot of work that we ve provided and understanding we re the product of a separation ourselves we separated from our former parent ashland 5 5 years ago and so we re well aware that there can be cost dissynergies created through a separation certainly the costs associated with standing up two businesses often involve some dyssynergy in the support areas like it and hr finance and legal we re working through to better understand those we do think there are some opportunities within the structuring of the product support and the brand arrangements to minimize dissynergies and we re working with our board as well to better understand strategically how to best structure a commercially reasonable commercially beneficial approach between the two separated businesses but we re in very early days so more to come on that as more work is completed analyst and then in the past you mentioned that the installer channel i think was kind of lagging the rebound that you ve seen in other subsegments i was wondering if that s kind of accelerated at all or if it s still somewhat of a lagger samuel j mitchell chief executive officer and director it s we ve seen improvement as the year has progressed in miles driven but i would say it s still lagging versus where we d expect it to be longer term and so we ve seen some of the like the oil change penetration rates at some of our installer accounts being tracking a little bit lower than historical rates and some of that cause based on conversations with our largest customers it has to do with some of the labor challenges in their stores and being able to provide all the services that they typically have done in the past but we are seeing improvement because they were the installer side of it was definitely the hardest hit back in 2020 operator our next question comes from stephanie moore from truist samuel j mitchell chief executive officer and director i wanted to touch on a little bit i wanted to touch on as you kind of think long term strategy on the retail side you obviously provided some data but it s a large total addressable market and you just said you re having these discussions with the strategic review where would you view might be some viable alternatives or options to extend the retail services what type of retail categories would you consider supports the high margin and the strong brand that you currently have yes so when we think about the long term strategies for retail services we re thinking about an evolving car park new powertrains servicing more hybrid and electric vehicles and servicing more fleet vehicles too and so we mentioned that in today s presentation so at the core of the strategy is making vehicle care easy for car owners for fleet owners and we believe it s not easy today and so we re looking to create a stronger approach via both what is offered in our stores and in our network and through our digital platforms to make vehicle care a lot easier than it is today and we think that creates a number of longer term growth opportunities but at its core we re going to be growing out from what we call preventive maintenance services in other words those services that don t require appointments that we can do in a fast and convenient way and build trust with our customers and keep both car owners and fleet owners vehicles on the road and that s been our core strength is our ability to deliver that consistently so it s our capabilities have to do with our process the technology behind the process the digital capabilities and especially the teams in the stores to attract the right type of talent to retain talent to train them and develop their capabilities these are the things that have built an incredibly strong business and we think that these core capabilities will leverage into a broader range of services and the one that we re highlighting right now is of course our fleet initiative where we see a big opportunity to grow our current fleet business into something much bigger than that and that includes making sure that our stores are prepared to handle even some of the larger vehicles class three and four vehicles so a lot of work going on right there in that area and i think it will be a good indication of what we re capable of as we grow our fleet business too specifically like new categories we re not calling out any specific moves at this point in time but it will grow out over time from our core preventive maintenance services and because our focus right now is just creating tremendous leverage in our system with relationships with more and more car owners operator duration 18 minutes call participants sean t cornett senior director of investor relations and assistant treasurer samuel j mitchell chief

indicated in these forward looking statements due to a variety of factors information concerning these factors can be found in the company s filings with the sec in addition we will make reference to the certain non gaap measures the reconciliations with the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon i ll now turn the call over to travis stice travis stice chief executive officer thank you adam and welcome everyone and thank you for listening to rattler midstream s third quarter earnings call the third quarter of 2021 was another strong operational performance for the rattler team as the business generated 60 million in free cash flow while the volumes were lower with diamondback completing eight delaware basin wells outside of the rattler dedication during the quarter the rattler team did an incredible job managing expenses and limiting capex to more than offset the impact to free cash flow the best practices implemented in our operations are beginning to bear fruit and are expected to have long term benefits to rattler s unitholders despite inflationary headwinds hitting the industry rattler also announced recently a series of strategic transactions that collectively repositioned the rattler portfolio in line with diamondback s shift to midland basin development where 75 of its drilling capital is currently being allocated the wtg transaction gives rattler exposure to a growing gas gathering and processing business in the northern midland basin and the new plant currently under development by wtg will help enable diamondback and other producers to continue their highly economic development there the drop down transaction with diamondback is largely a sale of complementary adjacent assets and gives rattler additional scale in the midland basin particularly with which to apply its learnings in building out large integrated systems in the delaware basin additionally by purchasing the available water assets and increasing the exposure to diamondback development across the produced and sourced water segments rattler expects to limit the volatility in volumes and earnings finally the sale of the pecos gas system presented a unique opportunity to divest an asset with little expected growth to a logical buyer of the system at an attractive multiple in order to fund the previously discussed acquisitions and maintain a conservative financial management with greater capital investment expected in the near future as rattler integrates the acquired drop down assets and constructs a new system in southeast martin county the proceeds from the gas gathering divestiture enhanced rattler s flexibility and continuing to return capital unitholders altogether after 1 5 years of reducing expenses limiting capital expenditures and focusing on free cash generation rattler is once again finding attractive investments that we believe fit within our operating expertise and align with our strategy of leveraging the diamondback relationship to generate value for our unitholders with these comments now complete operator please open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of vinay chitteti with jpmorgan your line is open vinay chitteti jpmorgan analyst hi good morning guys i just wanted to follow up on the volumes commentary for next year here so fang kind of assumes a maintenance mode for 2022 and then considering the activity shift in different regions for fang maybe if you could share on how that would translate to rattler do you expect the volumes next year to be same or better than what fang is guiding right now travis stice chief executive officer yes good question i mean with the drop down the volumes are certainly going to go up on a consolidated basis and i think you may have a couple of slides that show what percent of diamondback s completions will be dedicated to rattler on the sourced water side as well as the disposed water side and i think the drop down certainly cleans up the consistency of volume performance we should see a pretty substantial increase from where we are today pre drop down to the pro forma business in 2022 vinay chitteti jpmorgan analyst got it and then maybe on the multiple guidance on the transactions here i think you kind of mentioned what the ebitda expectations for the drop down assets are but any details on you could share on the jv and the other the asset sales which you guys had travis stice chief executive officer yes i mean we talked about 25 million to 35 million of ebitda for the drop down in 2022 is set to increase pretty dramatically in 2023 as capital is deployed to build out these recycling systems and then i d say generally on the equity method ebitda contribution next year definitely going up with the wtg deal as well as wink to webster coming on in full force and our omog jv humming on all cylinders i think volumes on that system are up 40 from where they were a year ago so i think generally we kind of hint that we had 40 million to 45 million of distributions this year a little bit more on the ebitda side i bet you that number goes up 20 to 30 next year vinay chitteti jpmorgan analyst got it yeah that s it thank you guys travis stice chief executive officer thanks operator thank you your next question is from kyle may with capital one securities your line is open kyle may capital one securities analyst hey good morning guys maybe just one question to start on the recycled water side i believe in the release you highlighted the 23 of sourced water volumes during the quarter were from recycled produced water just curious if you have the ability to grow the amount of recycled water and kind of how much that could potentially grow travis stice chief executive officer yes good question kyle very topical we re spending a lot of money on recycling particularly in the midland basin we kicked off our recycling program in the delaware where you have so much water production that you re able to pull 100 of the water you need for a frac from recycled sources and as we move into the midland basin diamondback consolidated with rattler have made commitments to recycle at least 55 of water by 2024 2025 and the key to that is going to be us building these large recycle pits in the midland basin so we acquired a few of those from qep i think we re going to build some larger ones throughout the course of next year to be able to kind of move and recycle water across all of martin county and other areas too particularly spanish trail in that area as well so it s picking up and we set the contracts up where recycling is incentivized because diamondback paid less for recycled water but rather makes a higher margin and that s where we re headed in 22 and beyond kyle may capital one securities analyst thanks for that case and then maybe just one more now that rattler has increased and extended the share buyback program just wanted to get your latest thoughts about balancing dividend growth with buybacks going forward travis stice chief executive officer yes good question i think we didn t touch the distribution this quarter because there s a lot of cash going out for the drop down as well as the wtg deal and a little bit of cash coming in from the brazos sale to offset that i think we need to see where leverage settles post all of that and then we ll continue to look at touching the distribution i think the buyback has been a good weapon for us at rattler as well as our other two companies and the board recognized that having it out there is a good sign of defense sometimes with market weakness and i think we re pretty consistent last quarter using it and i think that s a decent run rate going forward kyle may capital one securities analyst all right that sounds great appreciate the time travis stice chief executive officer thank you kyle operator i don t see additional questions at this time i will now hand the conference back to travis stice ceo for closing remarks sir travis stice chief executive officer thanks again to everyone participating in today s call if you ve got any questions please contact us using the contact information provided operator duration 11 minutes call participants adam t lawlis vice president of investor relations travis stice

million or 18 of intelsat s total revenue for the three months ended september 30 2021 a 12 decrease compared to the three months ended september 30 2020 the decline was largely due to a one time

clearer comparability of our operating performance between periods by excluding the potential volatility related to the timing and extent of non operating activities our management believes that adjusted ebitda provides a useful means of evaluating the success of our operating activities we also use adjusted ebitda together with other appropriate metrics to set goals for and measure the operating performance of our business and it is one of the principal measures we use to evaluate our management s performance in determining compensation under our incentive compensation plans

quarter ended september 30 2021 during the third quarter we returned to live event touring with record average attendance driving our better than expected performance said vince mcmahon wwe chairman ceo even with only one large scale international event due to covid related circumstances we will exceed our previous financial guidance given the overall strength in each of our business lines we

primarily driven by higher ticket sales and to a lesser extent venue merchandise sales resulting from the company s return to ticketed live events including summerslam additionally the contractual escalation of core content rights fees from the distribution of the company s flagship programs raw and smackdown was partially offset by a decrease in network revenue driven by the timing of the

64 0 million an increase of 1 or 0 6 million benefitting from the growth in revenue described above and the absence of a 5 5 million covid associated severance expense as compared to the prior year

in july in the prior year quarter wwe produced a majority of weekly televised content from its lower production cost training facility the company s operating income margin decreased to 25 0 from 28 6

company s draftkings investment cash flows generated by operating activities were 56 9 million a decrease from 116 8 million primarily driven by the timing of collections associated with our large scale international events in the prior year quarter free cash flow was 44 8 million a decrease from 110 8 million driven by the decrease in operating cash flow primarily due to the change in working capital and to a lesser extent the increase in capital expenditures 4 cash cash equivalents and short term investments were 449 million as of september 30 2021 debt totaled 221 million as of september

statements more detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the sec which are available on our website also you will find the reconciliations between gaap and non gaap measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website now let me introduce tony will our president and ceo w anthony will president chief executive officer and director thanks martin and good morning everyone yesterday afternoon we posted our financial results for the first nine months of 2021 in which we generated adjusted ebitda of 1 5 billion these results reflect the drastically improving industry fundamentals that we experienced over the course of the year nitrogen prices are at their highest levels in over a decade as strong demand and lower worldwide production have tightened the global supply demand balance considerably at the same time energy spreads between north america and high cost regions have widened dramatically supporting margin expansion for our cost advantage network the cf team also continues to perform exceptionally well navigating a couple of severe weather events in the u s our highest levels of turnaround and maintenance activity ever and a challenging natural gas situation in the u k most importantly they did so safely our recordable incident rate at the end of september was just 0 24 incidents per 200 000 labor hours significantly better than industry averages these factors have driven substantial cash generation over the last year our trailing 12 month net cash from operations was 1 7 billion and free cash flow was 1 billion as we look ahead we re excited about the opportunities to build on this performance we have good visibility into the fourth quarter of 2021 we have priced virtually all of our product shipments through the end of the year while also hedging our natural gas requirements while there is always some uncertainty about the volume of ammonia that will be applied in q4 given the dependency on weather we would expect full year 2021 adjusted ebitda to land between 2 2 billion and 2 4 billion further out we believe nitrogen industry conditions will remain positive for an extended period as bert will describe in a moment we see very strong demand constrained global supply and wide energy spreads between north america and europe to persist for some time these factors support our ability to continue to generate significant free cash and to deploy that capital to create shareholder value our priorities remain the same invest in growth where opportunities offer returns above our cost of capital and return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we remain focused on disciplined investments and are excited about the two new projects supporting our clean energy growth platform once completed these projects will enable us to produce over one million tons of blue or carbon free ammonia chris will share more about our announcement yesterday in a moment we are also pleased to have achieved investment grade credit ratings which recognizes and underscores all of the work we have done to remove fixed costs in the business reduce debt and highlights the positive industry fundamentals for a north american producer on the balance sheet we are quickly closing in on our target of 3 billion of gross debt and expect to repay the remaining 500 million outstanding on our 2023 notes on or before their maturity however that still leaves a substantial amount of excess free cash flow we expect to generate and as such the board has authorized a new 1 5 billion share repurchase program to facilitate the return of capital to shareholders with that let me turn it over to bert who will discuss the global nitrogen outlook in more detail then chris will follow to talk about our financial position and clean energy initiatives before i return for some closing comments bert bert a frost senior vice president of sales market development and supply chain thanks tony the last six to nine months have seen a dramatic tightening of the global nitrogen supply and demand balance high crop prices and increased economic activity continue to drive demand meanwhile lower global production and government actions have created a supply constrained global market the impact of this can be seen on slides 11 and 12 where both our spot cost curve and 2022 cost curve are much higher and steeper than in recent years as you can see the margin opportunities available to our network have expanded greatly due to a widened energy spread between north america and marginal production in europe we expect strong global fertilizer demand to last into at least 2023 as you can see on slide 8 global stocks to use ratios for both grains and oilseeds are at their lowest levels in nearly a decade supporting high crop prices these prices will support farm profitability in north america even with higher input prices incentivizing farmers to plant acres and maximize yield based on our order book we expect the fall ammonia application season will be the largest since 2012 demonstrating farmer commitment to planting corn and applying fertilizer we believe farmers around the world will make similar decisions with import demand continuing to be led by india and brazil we believe global supply will remain constrained in the near term with relief unlikely to appear anytime soon we believe inventory in the channel is very low global production has been lower in 2021 due to severe weather in north america higher maintenance worldwide and ongoing european shutdowns and curtailments further the russian and chinese governments are discouraging nitrogen fertilizer exports through the spring these factors suggest the potential for strong fertilizer demand to last beyond 2023 even as some regions are unable to secure enough product in this supply constrained environment resulting in lower yields if this were to happen demand would be deferred into future years as it would take more than two growing seasons to replenish global grain and oilseed stocks as we prepare for the spring application season we continue to receive substantial interest for any product we offer into the marketplace we are building a solid order book for the first quarter of 2022 at the prices you see in the market today similar to what we did for the fourth quarter we are adding natural gas hedges as we make first quarter product commitments in order to lock in margin and protect against significant energy price spikes as a result we believe we re in a strong position heading into 2022 in this dynamic market we remain focused on leveraging our manufacturing distribution and logistics capabilities to serve our customers and look forward to the opportunities before us with that let me turn the call over to chris christopher d bohn senior vice president chief financial officer thanks bert for the first nine months of 2021 the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 212 million or 0 98 per diluted share ebitda was 984 million and adjusted ebitda was approximately 1 5 billion net earnings and ebitda reflect the recognition of a noncash impairment charges related to our u k operations as discussed in the earnings release our results for the first nine months and third quarter are preliminary pending the completion of the impairment analysis and finalization of the noncash impairment charges we continue to monitor market conditions for the u k assets which accounted for two of our gross margin in 2020 the billingham complex is operating due to recently improved carbon dioxide contracts and industrial contracts that pass through natural gas costs operations at ince remain halted free cash flow free cash generation remains strong the trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 1 7 billion and free cash flow was 1 billion we believe we have a good opportunity in 2022 to build on these results based not only on our positive outlook but also on increased production from our network in 2021 we completed a record level of maintenance activity that included turnarounds at seven of our 17 ammonia plants we will return to a more normal level of turnaround activity in 2022 as a result we expect to return to our typical high ammonia utilization rates with gross ammonia production between 9 5 million and 10 million tons we expect to sell everything we produce and achieve sales volume between 19 million and 20 million tons in 2022 as we sell these product volumes into a favorable market environment we expect to continue to generate substantial free cash flow and create shareholder value as tony said our board authorized the new 1 5 billion share repurchase program which becomes effective january 1 2022 we continue to operate under our existing program which has enabled us to acquire more than 11 million shares to be repurchased since 2019 this program expires at the end of the year at the same time we ll continue to evaluate clean energy initiatives to meet the demand for ammonia s clean energy capabilities that we expect to emerge in the second half of the decade this includes positioning our network for the production of blue and green ammonia to support the development of a market for low carbon ammonia constructing carbon dioxide dehydration and compression units at donaldsonville and yard of the city are a necessary step to enable blue ammonia production through carbon capture and sequestration these projects leverage our existing asset base and represented an efficient use of capital with a return profile we expect to be above our cost of capital once sequestration is initiated we ll be able to produce more than one million tons of blue ammonia annually while reducing our carbon emissions in a meaningful way with our strong balance sheet we also have the flexibility to evaluate additional opportunities in the years ahead we continue to collaborate with global leaders where we can provide value including jointly exploring with mitsui the development of blue ammonia projects in the united states with that tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to q a w anthony will president chief executive officer and director thanks chris before we move on to your questions i want to recognize our team here at cf for their strong work so far in 2021 their commitment and dedication continue to be the foundation of our success we are excited about what lies ahead for cf industries in fact i think the company is better positioned today than we have ever been in our history we are again an investment grade credit issuer we have the fewest shares outstanding ever we expect the business to produce between 2 2 billion to 2 4 billion of adjusted ebitda this year and as we look forward to next year we should have significantly more tons to sell at overall average higher prices than this year so the business should generate all time records for free cash flow per share we see demand for low carbon ammonia developing that should provide a long term growth platform for the company and with our investments in both green and blue ammonia production we will be at the forefront of this exciting opportunity taken together we have never been in a better position to create value for shareholders with that operator we will now open the call to your questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of adam samuelson from goldman sachs please go ahead sir adam l samuelson goldman sachs group inc analyst yes thank you good morning everyone so tony chris i guess what i m trying to reconcile and think about is the risk of demand destruction at current nitrogen and fertilizer prices broadly i mean you talked about record demand for ammonia in the fall those prices were also booked several hundred dollars ago relative to where the spot market is and so as you think about the order patterns into the first quarter do you see any risks on farmers and their application rates and obviously nitrogen is less discretionary but do you think that could have any impact on economic yield given where affordability is today bert a frost senior vice president of sales market development and supply chain when you look across the world and where we are starting with just supply it s just not there so this is more of a supply constrained market the demand is definitely there you re seeing india desperately trying to pull in tons and will continue to do so through i expect into their next fertilizer year which begins in april brazil is ahead 10 percent year on year and probably will continue at that pace through importing urea at least through february for their safrina and then we hit our spring in the northern hemisphere with what s going on in europe with gas prices and the level of shutdown there s over 11 million tons of ammonia that is currently not being upgraded into ammonia nitrate urea or can and so tons need to flow which were not planned in the supply and demand scenario to europe so we were in a supply limited market and that s what s going to keep prices elevated the demand side of the equation is still very strong and you re correct what we sold for fall and we re applying today was sold at levels much lower than the current market which is probably over 1 000 for ammonia that being said we re selling 1 000 ammonia for fall application on our incremental tons that are available where as i said in my prepared remarks we re selling urea and there is significant demand at that 730 750 a short ton nola it s even higher in the interior at over 800 which we ve transacted at port neal and you ve seen in the publications the uan reaction and the demand pulling and i just looked at the analysis of where we are to date with order books and demand and again in a very good place at 550 uan calculating all that forward with current trend yield at 177 bushels per acre on the trend yield that s not considering the i states where you ll be 200 to 275 bushels even with rented land at today s economics you re cash positive you re actually profitable at a pretty healthy level if you own your land even more so there are ways to economize and so if you re a farmer you can look at different options but that s not going to come at the expense of nitrogen and probably even at fertilizer it s going to come at some other issues so we re constructively as i said positive i would say very positive and the customer advances continue to come in and so we re working with our retail partners to make sure that that supply is available and our retail partners are buying that and moving there s going to be a substantial amount of cash coming into our retail friends through year end as farmers prepare for 2022 w anthony will president chief executive officer and director i would just add one thing adam which is as bert said demand is clearly there if you look at our customer advances our order book is strong you can continue to sell forward and it looks like farmer economics are positive but given the supply shortfall particularly now with both russia and china withholding tons from the export marketplace there is a real shortage of nitrogen and price has got to basically arbitrate who s going to get the scarce tons that are out there and so it s not so much that you re going to destroy demand there s going to be a lot of unmet demand that s going to be pent up and so we do think yield is going to be on a global basis off next year again not because demand destruction just because there s not enough tons available and what that means is it s going to promote favorable supply demand dynamics in course grains as we get out into 2023 and probably beyond so our view is that this is a very very healthy dynamic that leads to a much longer period of positive fundamentals for our business adam l samuelson goldman sachs group inc analyst ok i appreciate all that color i ll pass it on thank you operator your next question comes from the line of joel jackson from bmo capital markets please go ahead joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst hey good morning everyone just thinking about your order book and bert i don t want to misquote you but i think you talked about before when prices go up you tend to book more product more forward to have kind of a longer dated order book as far as go up prices have really gone up so would that be the case that really you book more product into q1 than you normally have at this time you normally have it at the at this time bert a frost senior vice president of sales market development and supply chain yes so we re pleased with our order book and like the position that we ve placed ourselves in with the opportunities that the market has given us and you re right we have seen an accelerated market we started the year at 350 per ton of urea moved to 400 by april moved to 500 by july 600 in september and 700 in october we have index contracts at every week price and you can see in the publications we started our fill program in july at 285 nola equivalent and then moved to 435 in september and then in october 535 and so as i said we re booked for q4 and the majority of the 285 uan was shipped in q3 a little bit in q4 and then those other prices will be bled in as we look forward to q1 we re starting to book those values today and so you re looking at that 535 550 for q1 and 700 to 750 probably for urea and we have yet to price q2 ammonia and once we book out q1 then we ll look at q2 but we ve there s substantial demand for q2 we would rather sell q1 first joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steve byrne from bank of america please go ahead steve byrne bofa securities analyst yes thank you so you laid out the significant levels of disruption in supply that are going on and most recently you have russia jumping into that theme and i wanted to get your view on how significant is that i understand that essentially all of the ammonium nitrate that brazil imports comes from russia if that is the case and where are they going to get it now and are there regions of the world that you think are just flat out not going to be able to get nitrogen for the spring bert a frost senior vice president of sales market development and supply chain yes so when you look at the russia announcement i would say in contextually the chinese announcement is much more significant because of what has come out traditionally from china the four million to five million tons of urea exports and also phosphates that is going to have a because that s the incremental ton that is continually bid in so in a world of 50 million tons of world traded urea to take out up to 10 percent is going to be felt on top of the demand as i mentioned earlier from europe that needs to move so you re going to see north african tons moving into europe and there s going to be a hole like tony said somebody is going to have to struggle or pay up the russia announcement was a little bit of a surprise the russian demand for nitrogen fertilizers has been fairly consistent in that 5 5 million to 6 5 million tons demand per year and they ve exported the remainder and so when you look at from year on year what russia has consumed and what russia has exported on the margin there s probably going to be a shortage of up to 0 5 million tons so brazil will be able to get their ammonium nitrate and i believe the suppliers from russia eurochem acron and the others will do that as well as supply some of the portion that s needed in europe so it s going to come again on the margin and every month there ll be less tons available from an expected source which further exacerbates this supply demand imbalance that we ve been discussing steve byrne bofa securities analyst and maybe a question for chris the decision to focus on yazoo city as another carbon capture project in addition to donaldsonville do you have any more clarity about where the demand is going to be coming from for this the blue ammonia are you increasingly confident that you can move those tons and generate a sufficient premium to offset your capital investment and generate a return christopher d bohn senior vice president chief financial officer yes thanks steve yes yazoo city as you know has excess co2 and that s why that was one of the sites also chosen to do the dehydration and compression unit there as with donaldsonville we re in pretty extended discussions with different sequestration areas whether it be eor or people who are in the process of filing their class vi permits related to both those areas i think when you look at the economics steve both at d ville and yazoo city given what s been proposed from the 45q tax incentive it allows us to not only more than fund those particular capital expenditures but also see a return above our cost of capital and the reason for that is you know better than a lot of people do is because we re already capturing the co2 off of our ammonia process today so that equipment is already in place and that s limited the amount of capex that we had need and therefore increases our return profile on that bert a frost senior vice president of sales market development and supply chain but i think steve we are confident we ll be able to move that product into position and even if that demand is international make that effectively show up at d ville for not very much cost and be able to export it as appropriate it s not very far from yazoo to d ville and we feel comfortable that there s a ready market for that for those tons the other thing that makes yazoo attractive as chris said is a lot of excess co2 it s very close to existing co2 pipeline capacity with denbury and there s a lot of options in the area the geology there is really attractive so yazoo was an obvious add on with the d ville project w anthony will president chief executive officer and director and i think when these projects do come online because it will take two to three years you will also see domestic demand for blue specifically at the levels that would be being produced at yazoo steve byrne bofa securities analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jeff zekauskas from jpmorgan please go ahead jeffrey john zekauskas jpmorgan chase co analyst hi thanks very much when do you expect to produce 1 25 million tons of blue ammonia and how do you think about the price of blue ammonia is it relative to the price of agricultural ammonia or is it independent or it s relative to fuel prices and so with those kinds of issues how do you think you re out to returns on selling blue ammonia w anthony will president chief executive officer and director yes so relative to kind of the value of blue ammonia at a minimum i would say the value is equivalent to a regular conventional ton plus whatever carbon jurisdiction you re talking about so in europe you re talking about eur50 or above a ton in the u k it s more like gbp50 other regions are going to have different cost structures from a regulatory environment and so at a minimum i would say you re able to get whatever prevailing value of carbon is on top of a regular sort of traded ton and as chris highlighted if you think about the total variable cost required to produce a ton of blue ammonia we probably have somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 to 10 a ton of electricity cost on plant site and then we re in pretty advanced discussions with a number of potential parties on the transport and injection and believe that that is a very manageable number from an overall cost standpoint and so the all in the variable cost that we incur is less than the value of the 45q credit and so the differential will go toward paying back the capital even before you put any premium on blue ammonia so just on the value of the 45q we feel comfortable that we ll get returns above our cost of capital and then to the extent you re able to realize margins and additional premium on blue that just further adds to the attractiveness of this investment for us jeffrey john zekauskas jpmorgan chase co analyst i see okay and for my follow up some farmers say that they really can t secure nitrogen product for the second quarter and in your commentary you said you re really trying to put together your first quarter order book is that a generally correct description that farmers can t really get commitments into the second quarter just yet bert a frost senior vice president of sales market development and supply chain yes i would say that s not necessarily true and we don t deal directly with farmers we deal with the kind of the retail wholesale trader group first retail then some wholesalers and a little bit of trading for exports but we are selling our tons are being moved to the market and so those are in the hands of the retail group they have tons available to sell we re producing record amounts of uan and you can see with some of the disruptions from the hurricane and weather problems we did lose some tons but we are moving our tons into the market we have a record number of uan tows in service since i ve been here and as well none of our railcars are in storage which is the first time since i ve been here in 13 years that all of our railcars are occupied so product is moving to market product is available now that being said cf is not pricing q2 as of yet and that s a pricing position that s not a volume nor a commitment situation so i believe if retailers wanted to take that out or a farmer wanted to get a quote or an offer that should be available in the market and there will be sufficient tons to meet spring demands not only from cf but from the broader industry group imports are up domestic production will recover and yes we will have a spring w anthony will president chief executive officer and director jeff i realized i didn t sorry answer your first part of the question about blue ammonia in terms of when is it going to be available we ve gone ahead and launched those projects now we anticipate probably end of 2024 or early 2025 so by 2025 we expect basically a full year of operating on that basis jeffrey john zekauskas jpmorgan chase co analyst ok great thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of vincent andrews from morgan stanley vincent stephen andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you and good morning everyone tony i would love to get your thoughts on just sort of as we think about the next few years or three to five years or how ever you want to frame it we re in a precarious situation now with obviously very tight grain stocks and now we ve had this spike in gas and coal prices and so forth and we re having a lot of food inflation and bert laid out a very plausible scenario where we could have lower yields because of the inability of everybody to get nitrogen and so forth so what do you think the global response to this is going to be over time in terms of trying to manage the food supply and make sure that we kind of don t get into extreme situations like this into perpetuity but at the same time we need to balance our sort of climate goals and our green energy aspirations and so forth so how does this needle get thread in your view w anthony will president chief executive officer and director yes vince it s a great question and i think as you point out there are a lot of competing priorities out there that have second order and tertiary kind of knock on effects that not everyone understands well so the push to reduce availability and affordability of fossil fuels because of a focus on climate change and move toward renewable i think is directly part of what s going on in europe right now with extremely high natural gas costs and that means that all of those plants that bert talked about earlier curtailed or off line at the same time you ve got a number of governments around the world that are very focused on trying to limit rate of nitrogen fertilizer in particular because they re concerned about nutrient loss to the environment and runoff and whether it s nitrous oxide produced on the field that it s pretty potent greenhouse gas or whether it s other kinds of runoff into waterways and so forth there s a real push in some areas canada notably and other places as well to reduce application rate and if you do that you re going to have a year one impact on yield so there are a number of i would say competing priorities out there all of which generally speaking i would say benefit north american producers because we do have ready access to low cost gas we re on the very low end of the supply curve and as yields continue to struggle due to either lack of availability of nutrients or are these programs designed to reduce nutrient application that s just going to keep grain prices higher for longer i mean ultimately i think where this goes is governments are going to have to capitulate to the requirements of their people and provide affordable food which means some of those priorities that they have heretofore held out as being these holy grails are going to probably have to take a back seat for a while just to make sure that we can feed the people of the world but i think that you will see people backing off i mean again germany has decommissioned their nukes and they ve brought on coal fired power plants that s not exactly what i would call a green initiative you ve seen the same thing in china as well and the u k and continental europe are struggling with high gas costs so i do think there is going to have to be a reassessment of what is required to for the planet to be able to eat and fuel itself vincent stephen andrews morgan stanley analyst thanks very much i appreciate all this color operator your next question comes from the line of john roberts from ubs please go ahead john ezekiel e roberts ubs investment bank analyst thank you and back on the earlier question on the blue ammonia do you expect to sell it as fuel or do you expect to sell it as fertilizer and have some carbon credit broker get you the revenue for the sequestration values w anthony will president chief executive officer and director yes john so as chris mentioned and we ve highlighted earlier we do have this mou in place with mitsui we re having very productive conversations with them i think there is a real emphasis particularly in japan but in some other regions as well to go into co combustion of ammonia with coal to reduce the co2 emissions out of those plants and we think that that is something that will develop into a pretty sizable market estimates can be as much as five million tons by the time you get to 2030 or possibly even before and that s a huge increase in terms of the total amount of ammonia being consumed particularly when you ve got curtailments and outages in across broad swaths of the production universe here in europe and the u k and so we re excited about the clean energy attributes that blue ammonia has we think that that s probably where the majority of value sits at least in the near term while i think there is certainly the possibility to get some incremental value off of carbon sequestration in the soils from an agricultural application given that most of that is going into the voluntary marketplace today where values trade at a pretty small discount to where structured carbon trades in the rest of the world i think that s probably the last place just because of lower values that we would go now if the u s develops a more structured approach to the cost of carbon and you can get a scientific valuation placed on carbon capture and sequestration in the soil then that may change the math but i think in the near term what we re really looking at is more of a clean energy source and we re working very closely with mitsui to help develop that and bring that about the other point though that i would say is we believe these projects are attractive just based on the 45q credit that we ought to be able to generate a return on these projects without any embedded premium on blue now our expectation is there s going to be a sizable premium on blue but to be clear we re able to make the math work pretty easily just with the 45q credit john ezekiel e roberts ubs investment bank analyst and then how are you thinking about the pace of buyback under the new authorization is it going to be opportunistic or are you thinking something that s just going to be more structured over the two years w anthony will president chief executive officer and director yes i mean i think based on what we re looking at in terms of not only current year performance but our expectations for next year there s going to be a lot of cash that needs to find a home and so while we ll certainly buy more on dips or at lower prices i think it needs to be that the volume that we re talking about is sizable enough that it probably needs to be a bit of a structured leg in there as well so ultimately probably a combination of approaches john ezekiel e roberts ubs investment bank analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris parkinson from mizuho your line is open christopher s parkinson mizuho securities usa llc analyst great thank you so just over the last five years there s been a plethora of variables that s still driving a bit of volatility in the end unit uan pricing versus urea just given current supply demand dynamics trade flow adjustments over the last few years and the recent doc case can you just comment on your outlook for uan pricing for 22 23 as it pertains to end units versus urea thank you so much bert a frost senior vice president of sales market development and supply chain you re correct in terms of a lot of variables a lot of volatility in the last 1 5 years we ve traded as low as 115 a short ton for uan and as high as 550 in nola what drove that volatility we believe we were pushed down low because of excessive imports of subsidized products and consigned products and therefore we took the case forward to the department of commerce and the itc and we re successful we re pleased with that result and we believe that that information will come out with what the ruling will be and how that will be applied step 1 and so the discount to urea took place for several years and that was an inappropriate response to a more a valued product an expensive invested product and an asset base we ve invested several billion dollars to maintain and construct so we re entering probably a normalized market now where uan again is trading at a premium to urea for the reasons i just articulated and it should so through spring most definitely it will trade at a premium we ll reset in july as we always do we believe at a higher level for the reasons we have articulated we are in a different or a differentiated global market driven by a lack of supply with high levels of demand that is not going to correct itself probably for a couple more years and so in that context we see uan trading at a advantaged position to urea as well as ammonia and ammonium nitrate and that market we don t see demand destruction we just see differences of supply availability christopher s parkinson mizuho securities usa llc analyst that s great color and just as a quick follow up just given what s going on in china what s your intermediate to long term view of export trends and what the ultimate price will be for those tons on an mmbtu basis thank you bert a frost senior vice president of sales market development and supply chain yes so where you re looking at export trends i would look at the chinese economy holistically and looking at what they re trying to do with energy and where they are you ve got the risk of entering winter and ground may not be able to have heat in some of these big cities are you going to value the urea production or are you going to value the population and the ability to heat homes and to produce value added products or a commodity product i would bet on the latter than the former and so or the former rather than the latter there you go and so what we re seeing in china is a result of several factors coming to play whether that s pollution economically driven decisions higher polluting level product or production taken offline and then this restriction to have products available you ve seen their production capacity full status capacity fall from 90 million tons at its peak to probably 75 million tons today and then you take an operating rate that s ranged from 55 percent to 75 percent in china you only have available probably 53 million to 55 million tons of urea per year domestic consumption has rebounded and is over 50 million tons so there is not that substantial amount of tonnage to export and why export a value destructive product that s where we see the future of china and other production is going to have to come on stream in other locales so you have nigeria coming up russia coming up we need more and so more construction will probably take place but it s long dated so you re not going to see this market correct for the arrival of new production even though we need it w anthony will president chief executive officer and director and i would also add chris just based on what the forward curves look like it s moved really europe and in particular eastern europe into what i would call the marginal production ton in the world as opposed to out of china but the factors that bert was talking about means that china is not going to overwhelm the global marketplace with excess exports and so that s going to maintain what we believe is going to be a relatively tight supply side equation and just based on energy spread differentials that you can look forward it s a much steeper supply curve than it s been recently and that gives us a lot of opportunity here to generate cash in the u s so we re very constructive about all of these trends christopher s parkinson mizuho securities usa llc analyst great color as always thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of pj juvekar from citi your line is open prashant n juvekar citigroup inc analyst yes hi good morning there is all this resource nationalism going on about nitrogen that you talked about but u s is still a net importer of urea so how does this play out would growers switch from corn to soybeans at the margin or maybe the industrial demand has to back down to make room for agricultural demand in your mind how does this play out in the medium term w anthony will president chief executive officer and director i mean i think that the u s based on crop prices and efficiency of growers and requirements on the industrial side is able to bid away tons from other parts of the world that are less able to do so particularly those economies that require government subsidies in which to bring tons in and so our expectation is that there s going to be availability of product here in north america and honestly i don t see a scenario where industrial demand starts backing off based on ag demand i see a situation where you end up with inflation in terms of the industrial goods as opposed to some reduction in economic output but i think ultimately as bert talked about you see some new projects on the drawing board but not very many and particularly not enough with respect to some of the closures and shutdowns or even curtailments that you see out there right now so ultimately i think what s going to have to happen is you end up seeing more capacity added because the world just needs more than what s available that s before you even get to clean energy applications for ammonia going forward so i think the net of all of that suggests that there are new plants that the world is going to need to construct in order to be able to feed itself and utilize ammonia and these kind of new alternative applications versus what we ve seen in the past bert a frost senior vice president of sales market development and supply chain yes i think it s a false narrative p j that those two are competing and i think we re in the you have to go back to in the united states or in north america we re in the resource rich region of natural gas and energy products we have the capability to construct and move with the infrastructure that s in place whether that be rail barge truck pipe and we are set up to do that very efficiently so what i can see over time is these other economies progress into lower carbon output or lower carbon consumption using natural gas or renewables you re going to see the natural gas spreads continue to expand or stay expanded maybe not at its current level today of 20 per mmbtu but maybe it s 10 rather than 6 and that maintains north america as a low cost high margin region in the world and i think you ll see maybe some industrial production in other areas compromised that would be europe and maybe some even in china over time as we move to a new market on the corn to soybean competition today it s favoring corn and it has been and this is the time when it makes sense and when it s very good for us to have that favorability because that s when today or in this period is when farmers are making that spring planting decision and allocating their resources accordingly and therefore booking fertilizer which is positive for us we re seeing very strong industrial demand in our book and we balance both of those we think well as well as our industry so i think it s a net positive prashant n juvekar citigroup inc analyst great that s good color and just one quick one tony when you talked about and thank you for giving the details on blue versus gray ammonia it seems like blue ammonia will be more costly to make by 20 or 30 or something like that per ton and so why would growers buy more expensive ammonia unless they re incented to buy i mean what s the mechanism for them to spend more w anthony will president chief executive officer and director yes so remember 20 to 30 that might be in the range or it might be a little high relative to our expectations but that s not a crazy number remember the 45q tax credit the way that it was originally constructed was going to be sort of 45 ish to 50 in the current regs it s substantially above that right so although it s a little bit more expensive for us to make if you net against it the 45q tax credit it s actually a discount relative to conventional ammonia from a producer side but the reason why a grower would pay for it is if they want to be able to make carbon labeling claims that go into consumer products companies because they re going to care about that or if you re trying to produce low carbon ethanol that might be qualified for california s clean fuel standards that might be a reason for it or even in the voluntary market if you can get 5 to 10 a ton for sequestering carbon in the soil being a grower there were a couple of high profile transactions that happened along those lines a couple of months ago i think there s a lot of value there potentially for growers to try to differentiate what they re doing versus just a commodity bushel or corn and so based on kind of where some of those pockets of value are we would expect there to be some margin opportunity for us or at least some incremental demand for that product and again to the extent that the u s actually adopts a more regulated and structured cost of carbon then there s real economics available to the farmer if they can demonstrate the sequestration and sell those credits into a structured marketplace so christopher d bohn senior vice president chief financial officer yes i was just going to add to that i think one of the benefits of this is the incremental demand that tony speaking of is the agriculture is already using ammonia but as you start to see more of the industrial move in that s where you ll start to see the bidding on ammonia go up and more constrained so it s really about the demand addition that we think is going to occur here bert a frost senior vice president of sales market development and supply chain plus you have to remember if it s 50 more a ton let s take it there than conventional to a farmer that s 10 an acre that s two bushels so the cost is insignificant to the farmer based on the benefits that tony articulated and we already have people wanting to buy blue ammonia so we think there s going to be a demand challenge which is very good for our business in the future years w anthony will president chief executive officer and director and that s also honestly why donaldsonville and yazoo city are not the last dehydration compression projects that we re likely to build we want to continue to evaluate other places with ready access to sequestration and continue to build out our network because our belief is it s a project that pays for itself and also gives upside opportunity on access in the clean energy market in a way that is differential for us versus other market participants prashant n juvekar citigroup inc analyst thank you you guys give always good color thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of michael piken from cleveland research your line is open michael leith piken cleveland research company analyst yes hi thanks for the question just wanted to discuss in a little bit more detail on the status of your u k operations i know they were down for a couple of days and then you guys were reached an agreement with the government to restart it when you talked about getting back to that kind of 19 5 million to 20 million ton the implication i assume there is that those plants are going to run full next year so maybe you could just talk about the status of those plants and are they going to be profitable or what type of returns we re looking out there given the higher gas costs w anthony will president chief executive officer and director yes michael thanks so the first thing that i want to just highlight is the relative importance of the u k in terms of the overall portfolio as chris mentioned if you look back to our results in 2020 it represented 2 of our total gross margin so from an aggregate profitability standpoint it s on the small end of the scale now it does provide a little bit of a natural hedge for us when global energy costs are low and relatively flat then we earn a better return there when energy costs are high we earn a much better return in the u s on a larger production base so it s a little bit of a kind of a natural hedge in that regard but as you mentioned because of a huge spike in gas cost in september we took the plants off line we worked i would say very constructively with the u k government to restart the facility at billingham and be able to provide co2 into the u k marketplace that s pretty critical for the normal functioning of a number of different industries over there and during that period of time the u k government also is very helpful in us working with us and the co2 offtake companies the industrial gas companies from billingham to restructure those contracts in a way that makes that plant viable so we re really pleased with how that whole process developed and the billingham plant is up and operational and we expect that to be viable in the long term the ince plant in the northwest is not yet back online we re evaluating a number of different options and scenarios they are including being able to secure a vessel to bring ammonia into the facility so we can at a minimum run the upgrade plants given again the high cost of natural gas through the winter it doesn t look like ammonia production there is going to make a lot of sense but being able to bring in ammonia will allow us to run the upgrades and make an appropriate return on those products so we re kind of in a little bit of a wait and see mode in terms of what the longer range situation develops in the u k but i think for now billingham is up and operational we expect that to happen and again we expect to be able to turn the back end of the fertilizer portion of the plant up and running and ince hopefully soon within the next couple of weeks once we get the ammonia vessel squared away michael leith piken cleveland research company analyst great and then just understanding a little bit longer term by the time some of these blue ammonia projects are up and running i mean is this going to increase your number of product tons is this going to come out of some of your other products like how should we be thinking about the cadence of your product tons sold over the next call it three to five years w anthony will president chief executive officer and director yes i mean we already run our ammonia plants at full operating rate with the one exception of the u k which we just talked about right and so it s not necessarily a situation where there s new tons unless we engage in some debottlenecks or new capacity or other things like that and so this is definitely a pulling tons away from the least profitable portion of or segment of our business and reallocating them to a higher margin application and so it s a margin upgrade as opposed to new production at this time michael leith piken cleveland research company analyst great thanks operator your next question comes from the line of andrew wong from rbc capital markets please go ahead andrew d wong rbc capital markets analyst hey thanks for taking my question just going back on blue green ammonia here can you talk about how the blue green ammonia market could impact the dynamics around the gray ammonia market in the future i mean we have projects like d ville and yazoo turning some of the volumes from gray to blue and as those tons are sold into clean ammonia applications like maybe with mitsui does that effectively mean a loss of supply for the gray ammonia market and then on the demand side like the molecules are the same could there be a scenario where demand and supply maybe aren t matched up properly so you have some applications that maybe need blue green ammonia but if there isn t enough you use a little bit of gray just in general does the emergence of a blue green ammonia market mean potentially a tighter gray market in the future thanks w anthony will president chief executive officer and director yes i mean i certainly think that s where we see things headed i also think that s where not wanting to interpret things for them but i think that that s consistent also with where air products and others see things headed hence the announcement both of the neon project in saudi arabia but also the recent announcement they had in louisiana around a blue project and i think a number of the market participants see this coming i think ultimately what that s going to mean is you ve got more demand than what current supply is in ammonia it s going to bid in new production new capacity which the world is going to need and that s pretty attractive relative to valuing existing assets so we think overall this is a terrific set of factors that create a revaluation or rethinking about what the value of our asset base is being that we re the largest ammonia producer in the world and i think the situation is not unlike what we ve got today right which is today as bert mentioned it s more of a supply side constraint given a bunch of curtailments and shutdowns and other disruptions but in the future even if those plants are off and running and you see demand continue to exceed where supply is capable of reaching you see price escalation like we re experiencing right now andrew d wong rbc capital markets analyst yeah that makes a lot of sense thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of adrien tamagno from berenberg your line is open adrien tamagno joh berenberg gossler co kg analyst hello good morning as a follow up from the previous question so from a cf industries perspective the combination of the world being short of ammonia as you described and the current technical difficulty to make significant volumes in a low carbon way would that makes you thinking about going for greenfield ammonia at some point in time or it s out of question for you w anthony will president chief executive officer and director well i mean we constantly are evaluating ways to add capacity where appropriate i think our biggest focus area and the thing that we use as a lens to make all of those decisions is ultimately cash flow per share and if we can find an opportunity that allows us to expand capacity whether that s a debottleneck inorganic acquisition or an organic kind of growth where we believe that that s going to grow our free cash per share then we ll take a serious run at it i think in these kind of context we would be much more likely to think about partnership structures or other things like that if we were going to move forward on any of those things but i do think it s a positive sign when others out there are making announcements about adding capacity i do believe we re the best operators of ammonia plants in the world and so if there s opportunities for new capacity additions we ought to be thinking about that along with other people and i do think the world is going to need it it s a question of when and in the interim are you better off buying existing assets or debottlenecking what you already have versus building new but i think those are appropriate questions that anyone in the industry today is kind of mulling over and really thinking about adrien tamagno joh berenberg gossler co kg analyst thank you operator ladies and gentlemen that is all the time we have for questions today i would like to turn the call back to martin jarosick for closing remarks martin a jarosick vice president of investor relations thanks everyone for joining us and we look

investments aim to drive long term sustainable growth at attractive margins 1 yelp has not reconciled its adjusted ebitda outlook to gaap net income loss because it does not provide an outlook for gaap net income loss due to the uncertainty and potential variability of other income net and provision for benefit from income taxes which are reconciling items between adjusted ebitda and gaap net

and adjusted ebitda margin each of which the securities and exchange commission has defined as a non gaap financial measure we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss adjusted to exclude provision for benefit from income taxes other income net depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense and in certain periods certain other income and expense items such as fees related to shareholder activism restructuring costs and impairment charges we define adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted ebitda divided by net revenue adjusted ebitda which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of yelp s financial results as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap in particular adjusted ebitda should not be viewed as a substitute for or superior to net income loss prepared in accordance with gaap as a measure of profitability or liquidity some of these limitations are although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for yelp s working capital needs adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of the recording or release of valuation allowances or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to yelp adjusted ebitda does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity based compensation adjusted ebitda does not take into account any income or costs that management determines are not indicative of ongoing operating performance such as fees related to shareholder activism restructuring costs and impairment charges and other companies including those in yelp s industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin alongside other financial performance measures net income loss and yelp s other gaap results the following is a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda as well as the calculation of net income loss margin and adjusted ebitda margin for each of the periods indicated in thousands except percentages unaudited

remarks operator good day and thank you for standing by welcome to the rattler midstream q3 2021 conference call and now i would like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today adam lawlis vice president of investor relations thank you please go ahead 10 stocks we like better than rattler midstream lp when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and rattler midstream lp wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of october 20 2021 adam t lawlis vice president of investor relations thank you paul good morning and welcome to rattler midstream s third quarter 2021 conference call during our call today we will reference an updated investor presentation which can be found on rattler s website representing rattler today are travis stice ceo and kaes van t hof president during this conference call the participants may make certain forward looking statements relating to the company s financial condition results of operations plans objectives future performance and businesses we caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward looking statements due to a variety of factors information concerning these factors can be found in the company s filings with the sec in addition we will make reference to the certain non gaap measures the reconciliations with the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon i ll now turn the call over to travis stice travis stice chief executive officer thank you adam and welcome everyone and thank you for listening to rattler midstream s third quarter earnings call the third quarter of 2021 was another strong operational performance for the rattler team as the business generated 60 million in free cash flow while the volumes were lower with diamondback completing eight delaware basin wells outside of the rattler dedication during the quarter the rattler team did an incredible job managing expenses and limiting capex to more than offset the impact to free cash flow the best practices implemented in our operations are beginning to bear fruit and are expected to have long term benefits to rattler s unitholders despite inflationary headwinds hitting the industry rattler also announced recently a series of strategic transactions that collectively repositioned the rattler portfolio in line with diamondback s shift to midland basin development where 75 of its drilling capital is currently being allocated the wtg transaction gives rattler exposure to a growing gas gathering and processing business in the northern midland basin and the new plant currently under development by wtg will help enable diamondback and other producers to continue their highly economic development there the drop down transaction with diamondback is largely a sale of complementary adjacent assets and gives rattler additional scale in the midland basin particularly with which to apply its learnings in building out large integrated systems in the delaware basin additionally by purchasing the available water assets and increasing the exposure to diamondback development across the produced and sourced water segments rattler expects to limit the volatility in volumes and earnings finally the sale of the pecos gas system presented a unique opportunity to divest an asset with little expected growth to a logical buyer of the system at an attractive multiple in order to fund the previously discussed acquisitions and maintain a conservative financial management with greater capital investment expected in the near future as rattler integrates the acquired drop down assets and constructs a new system in southeast martin county the proceeds from the gas gathering divestiture enhanced rattler s flexibility and continuing to return capital unitholders altogether after 1 5 years of reducing expenses limiting capital expenditures and focusing on free cash generation rattler is once again finding attractive investments that we believe fit within our operating expertise and align with our strategy of leveraging the diamondback relationship to generate value for our unitholders with these comments now complete operator please open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of vinay chitteti with jpmorgan your line is open vinay chitteti jpmorgan analyst hi good morning guys i just wanted to follow up on the volumes commentary for next year here so fang kind of assumes a maintenance mode for 2022 and then considering the activity shift in different regions for fang maybe if you could share on how that would translate to rattler do you expect the volumes next year to be same or better than what fang is guiding right now travis stice chief executive officer yes good question i mean with the drop down the volumes are certainly going to go up on a consolidated basis and i think you may have a couple of slides that show what percent of diamondback s completions will be dedicated to rattler on the sourced water side as well as the disposed water side and i think the drop down certainly cleans up the consistency of volume performance we should see a pretty substantial increase from where we are today pre drop down to the pro forma business in 2022 vinay chitteti jpmorgan analyst got it and then maybe on the multiple guidance on the transactions here i think you kind of mentioned what the ebitda expectations for the drop down assets are but any details on you could share on the jv and the other the asset sales which you guys had travis stice chief executive officer yes i mean we talked about 25 million to 35 million of ebitda for the drop down in 2022 is set to increase pretty dramatically in 2023 as capital is deployed to build out these recycling systems and then i d say generally on the equity method ebitda contribution next year definitely going up with the wtg deal as well as wink to webster coming on in full force and our omog jv humming on all cylinders i think volumes on that system are up 40 from where they were a year ago so i think generally we kind of hint that we had 40 million to 45 million of distributions this year a little bit more on the ebitda side i bet you that number goes up 20 to 30 next year vinay chitteti jpmorgan analyst got it yeah that s it thank you guys travis stice chief executive officer thanks operator thank you your next question is from kyle may with capital one securities your line is open kyle may capital one securities analyst hey good morning guys maybe just one question to start on the recycled water side i believe in the release you highlighted the 23 of sourced water volumes during the quarter were from recycled produced water just curious if you have the ability to grow the amount of recycled water and kind of how much that could potentially grow travis stice chief executive officer yes good question kyle very topical we re spending a lot of money on recycling particularly in the midland basin we kicked off our recycling program in the delaware where you have so much water production that you re able to pull 100 of the water you need for a frac from recycled sources and as we move into the midland basin diamondback consolidated with rattler have made commitments to recycle at least 55 of water by 2024 2025 and the key to that is going to be us building these large recycle pits in the midland basin so we acquired a few of those from qep i think we re going to build some larger ones throughout the course of next year to be able to kind of move and recycle water across all of martin county and other areas too particularly spanish trail in that area as well so it s picking up and we set the contracts up where recycling is incentivized because diamondback paid less for recycled water but rather makes a higher margin and that s where we re headed in 22 and beyond kyle may capital one securities analyst thanks for that case and then maybe just one more now that rattler has increased and extended the share buyback program just wanted to get your latest thoughts about balancing dividend growth with buybacks going forward travis stice chief executive officer yes good question i think we didn t touch the distribution this quarter because there s a lot of cash going out for the drop down as well as the wtg deal and a little bit of cash coming in from the brazos sale to offset that i think we need to see where leverage settles post all of that and then we ll continue to look at touching the distribution i think the buyback has been a good weapon for us at rattler as well as our other two companies and the board recognized that having it out there is a good sign of defense sometimes with market weakness and i think we re pretty consistent last quarter using it and i think that s a decent run rate going forward kyle may capital one securities analyst all right that sounds great appreciate the time travis stice chief executive officer thank you kyle operator i don t see additional questions at this time i will now hand the conference back to travis stice ceo for closing remarks sir travis stice chief executive officer thanks again to everyone participating in today s call if you ve got any questions please contact us using the contact information provided operator duration 11 minutes call participants adam t lawlis vice president of investor relations travis stice

learning from wall street s edge in buying fixer uppers the block purchases of single family houses by institutional investors which began during the housing and foreclosure crisis was first credited with putting a floor under the housing market in 2010 through 2012 since then it has been blamed for keeping large numbers of homes off the market leading to shortages and higher home prices some owners have been criticized as well for landlord abuses the urban institute has now published research on another aspect of institutional ownership of rental properties ui says these findings should be considered a possible model rather than something to disparage ui analysts laurie goodman and edward golding say that most of the homes purchased by wall street investors as rentals need repair to enhance rentability and the institutional buyers have significant advantages not available to individuals in purchasing and improving them the authors propose studying some of the methods these buyers use improve the competitiveness of individual homebuyers to benefit from buying and rehabilitating fixer uppers to live in institutional buyers have expertise and can realize economies of scale when doing major work before purchasing a property a company sends out an in house team to inspect its structure and systems prepare a budget and weigh whether renovations will increase the property s rental value after purchase they request bids from local venders usually negotiating a volume discount and extended warranties for products commonly used in an upgrade such as appliances and hvac systems this expertise and cost advantage is factored into the purchase price of the property giving investors an advantage when bidding to buy even with the volume discounts goodman and golding say investors put significant money into their properties one of the biggest companies invitation homes spent 39 000 per home for up front renovations last year while american homes spent 15 000 to 30 000 the authors say a typical homeowner spends 6 300 during the first year after purchasing a home they add corporations extensive experience internal capacity reliable vendor relationships and discounts yield more cost effective renovations than a homeowner could generally achieve for the same work then there are the financial advantages institutional buyers have in this market they typically pay cash secured through capital markets for purchase and repair then refinance later through the securitization market lines of credit or loans from a bank insurance company or other institutional investor thus corporations can cover purchase rehab and financing costs separate from and not contingent on that financing in contrast an owner occupant usually needs a loan and standard purchase loans are not appropriate to this task because they are based on current rather than a post improvement value fha s 203k program and fannie mae or freddie mac s renovation finance programs do base the loan amount on after repair market value but there are downsides to their use ui says that 2019 data provided through the home mortgage disclosure act shows that of 4 437 million purchase loans originated that year only 174 000 were rehab loans with a lower number used for purchase rather taken out by existing homeowners to finance major remodeling projects these loans have a high denial rate among conventional loans those for rehab have a turn down rate of 36 3 percent compared to 9 1 percent for purchase loans and 14 9 percent for all mortgage loans for fha rehabs the denial rate is 28 8 percent rather than 12 9 percent for purchase and 19 6 percent for all loans this means sellers are usually more reluctant to accept a buyer s offer that is contingent on these mortgages ui says these loan programs also have more limitations and are more expensive than regular mortgages there are two forms of the fha 203k loan one is for smaller nonstructural projects costing up to 35 000 the second version covering major repairs requires the borrower hire a department of housing and urban development consultant to oversee the work the gse programs fannie mae s homestyle and freddie mac s choicerenovation vest the risk of shoddy work or cost overruns with the lender and give the gse recourse against it although it s not required many lenders hire contractor oversite to mitigate risk and may charge borrowers extra for this recognizing that lender recourse can limit participation on monday freddie mac began to offer a new program for more limited improvement projects it will cover additional funding of up to 15 percent of the purchase price in high need areas and 10 percent in other locations and does not require lender recourse the authors add that none of the renovation loans provide much flexibility once the scope of work is agreed on the loan details are particularly difficult to navigate if a project grows or changes as they so frequently to do goodman and golding say it is unlikely the playing field between investors and hopeful homeowners can be fully leveled but it makes sense to understand how the former operate and explore whether adopting some of their techniques can bring expertise scale and financing opportunities to aspiring homeowners pilot programs could include direct government subsidies or government partnerships with home improvement companies or building supply companies the successful pilots could be expanded to promote homeownership the authors add that we should be mindful that institutional investors play an important role in the market by improving the quality of the housing stock and increasing the supply of decent rental housing as long as they are not predatory they are providing valuable upgrades to homes that need

by pete papaherakles with a new federal reserve chairman nomination expected soon the buzz is on as to who president barack obama will appoint to replace current fed chair ben shalom bernanke will the new chairman be more of the same will the whole system collapse on his watch the two names that come up most often as possible nominees are former treasury secretary larry summers and current fed vice chairwoman janet yellen former treasury secretary timothy geithner former bank of israel governor stanley fischer and former fed vice chairman roger ferguson are also seen as possible candidates depending on whether one believes obama really gets to appoint whomever he wants to the position several theories have been entertained some feel that obama tends to favor minorities in which case ms yellen a woman and ferguson a black man have the advantage both will be firsts in that position others feel obama tends to nominate people he has worked with closely in the past in which case summers and geithner have the advantage insiders feel that geithner doesn t really want the job and that he has even been secretly endorsing summers who like himself is a former treasury secretary and fellow protege of former secretary robert rubin being jewish seems to be an important credential for the position since all the candidates except ferguson qualify although his wife is jewish bernanke is jewish of course as was alan greenspan before him in fact since the privately owned and controlled central bank s inception 100 years ago most of the fed chairs have been jewish it might have something to do with the fact that the federal reserve bank is a consortium of nine zionist jewish owned and associated banks with the rothschilds at the head by some accounts the rothschilds of london hold 57 of the fed s stock which is not available for public trading when the chips are down however the most likely candidates are summers and yellen according to establishment analysts yellen s disadvantage is that she is considered a bleeding heart in every chart of hawks and doves on the fed those who live in mortal terror of inflation are hawks while those who worry more about unemployment are doves yellen is always pegged at the dove end of the scale conservatives are worried that she won t pay close enough attention to inflation summers on the other hand has a proven track record for delivering what the fed owners want as treasury secretary in 1999 he was responsible for repealing the glass steagall act which restricted banks from gambling with their depositors money this was one of the causes of the derivatives based bubble which ensued in the early 2000s whose popping brought about the financial collapse of 2008 and today s economic crisis summers was also complicit in destroying russia s economy under boris yeltsin s privatizations while his friends profited immensely as president of harvard summers lost 2 billion of the university s funds in stock market gambling and as the architect of obama s economic policy he set a course that drove the united states 9 trillion deeper in debt more than all previous administrations in the country s history combined summers is just the guy the fed is looking for as the country is staring into the deepest financial abyss in history he has both the ruthlessness and calculated recklessness to push the economy off the economic cliff and the political savvy to get away with it his track record speaks for itself

indigenous delegates arrive the un climate change conference cop26 in glasgow reuters published fri 5 nov 2021 3 13 am last updated fri 5 nov 2021 3 26 am with science warning that only swift action can avoid cataclysmic global warming countries already feeling the lash of climate change are demanding that the timetable for updating national carbon cutting pledges be radically accelerated currently the nearly 200 nations that submitted voluntary emissions reduction schemes under the 2015 paris agreement have agreed to update those plans every five years a process described as a ratchet mechanism the first set of revisions came due at the end of 2020 but most were not submitted until this year because of the covid pandemic china by far the world s top carbon polluter filed its update only last week and india the number four emitter did so at the cop26 summit in glasgow on monday but even if all national pledges are honoured a big if earth s surface would still warm a catastrophic 2 7 degrees above pre industrial levels according to the un a far cry from the paris treaty target of 1 5c the next scheduled rendezvous for upping ambition isn t until 2025 sobering projections however from the un s science authority along with a crescendo of unprecedented heatwaves flooding and wildfires strongly suggest this is not soon enough leading the charge for a more compressed timetable is un secretary general antonio guterres let s have no illusions he said on the opening day of the talks if commitments fall short by the end of the cop countries must revisit their national climate plans and policies not every five years every year until keeping 1 5c is assured the idea got further backing on thursday from bangladeshi foreign minister ak abdul momen who said major emitters should raise their 2030 targets at every annual climate conference until they are aligned with the 1 5c goal we re hoping expecting this cop will respond to our demands as a moral compass of the international community he said at a press conference various proposals for including a call for nations to review and improve plans to shrink their carbon footprints are already on the table in preliminary discussions among negotiators according several sources at the talks a first draft known as a non paper in un climate jargon could be circulated as early as friday they said momentum has been building on the issue more than 50 developing countries in the climate vulnerable forum have called for a pact that would mandate yearly ambition raising for governments and especially major carbon emitters for every year through to 2025 g20 nations which account for nearly 80 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions have also indicated an openness to up the pace a communique issued on sunday at the close of the g20 summit in rome committed to further action this decade but it was trailed by a string of caveats indicating just how difficult ramping up carbon reduction pledges in the short term is going to be it depends on the language said alden meyer a senior associate at climate policy think tank e3g if it sounds like it s mandatory then china and other countries will say that is re interpreting the paris agreement which is correct while signatories are collectively enjoined to reach the treaty s temperature targets individual contributions are strictly on a voluntary basis a call for yearly updates would also run into a practical problem analysts pointed out it took years of internal wrangling before the european union succeeded in increasing its 2030 target for greenhouse reduction from 40 to 55 per cent compared to 1990 levels trying to do that every year whether in the eu the united states or japan would be nearly impossible they suggest a more realistic goals would be picking an interim year by which nations would be asked to submit new plans on a voluntary basis most people have been talking about 2023 said meyer the paris agreement mandates a stock take in that year an accounting exercise to evaluate the effectiveness of efforts to date the best that countries pushing for yearly or more frequent updates of carbon reduction plans can hope for meyer and other veterans of the un climate process agree is something aspirational anything beyond an encouragement for greater efforts on a voluntary basis would be a non starter for china india and russia said a senior diplomat

adjusted due to immateriality of impact management commentary1 brad soultz chief executive officer of willscot mobile mini holdings commented our entire portfolio delivered strong financial and

units in na modular increased by 20 3 and portable storage unit rental rates in na storage increased 6 9 year over year continued strong price and volume trends in the u k and tightening oec utilization in the tank pump segment drove year over year revenue growth of 30 6 and 26 7 respectively based on our leading market indicators and our internal initiatives we expect strength in these core leasing kpis for the foreseeable future finally we expanded our ready to work value proposition to new customers as we closed and fully integrated three acquisitions during the quarter and closed

rate expectations for 2022 continue to improve as reflected in our updated financial guidance our adjusted ebitda margin progressed as we expected improving 70 basis points sequentially to 38 8 in q3 driven by an accelerating lease revenue run rate amidst strong sustained delivery volumes consistent with normal seasonality we continue to expect strong adjusted ebitda margin expansion year over year in the fourth quarter and expect to sustain those increases in 2022 we generated 78 5 million of free cash flow during the quarter at a 16 margin and we are reinvesting that capital in our business to compound our earnings growth we increased net capex by 18 6 million versus prior year to 52 0 million to support organic initiatives we invested 56 3 million to acquire three regional storage businesses and we repurchased 106 3 million of common shares and equivalents choosing to maintain leverage at 3 7x given the attractiveness of these alternatives recognizing that the

growth by several quarters average portable storage monthly rental rate in na storage increased 10 or 6 9 to 155 driven by process improvements focused on rate management average portable storage units on rent in na storage increased by 31 902 units or 30 3 reflecting broad based end market strength especially in the retail sector and a transfer of approximately 12 000 units from na modular into the na storage segment across both segments in north america average portable storage units on rent increased by 16 922 units or 14 0 which is a better reflection of organic volume growth for

margin of 38 8 in the third quarter increased by 70 bps sequentially from the second quarter and declined 40 basis points versus prior year similar to the second quarter results strong year over year delivery volume growth drove an additional 9 9 million of variable leasing costs and a higher mix of delivery and installation revenues relative to prior year strong delivery volumes and financial results also drove a 6 9 million increase in variable compensation and sales commissions relative to the third quarter of 2020 together these factors drove the expected temporary year over year margin compression in the third quarter these elevated activity levels also drove the 6 5 sequential increase in our leasing and services revenues which we expect will continue to build and drive margin expansion in the fourth quarter heading into 2022 net income of 61 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 increased by 67 2 million versus prior year and included 11 1 million of

of our business the company believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are useful to investors because they i allow investors to compare performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis by removing from operating results the impact of items that do not reflect core operating performance ii are used by our board of directors and management to assess our performance iii may subject to the limitations described below enable investors to compare the performance of the company to its competitors and iv provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating

reporting periods on a consistent basis the company believes that net capex provide useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and accordingly should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity these non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with gaap other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda and other non gaap financial measures differently and therefore the company s non gaap financial measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies for reconciliation of the non gaap measures used in this press release except as explained below see reconciliation of non gaap financial measures included in this press release information reconciling forward looking adjusted ebitda to gaap financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort we cannot provide reconciliations of forward looking adjusted ebitda to gaap financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of our control and or cannot be reasonably predicted such as the provision for income taxes preparation of such reconciliations would require a forward looking balance sheet statement of income and statement of cash flow prepared in accordance with gaap and such forward looking financial statements are unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort although we provide a range of adjusted ebitda that we believe will be achieved we cannot accurately predict all the components of the adjusted ebitda calculation the company provides adjusted ebitda guidance because we believe that adjusted ebitda when viewed with our results under gaap provides useful information for the reasons noted above

periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends we evaluate business segment performance on adjusted ebitda a non gaap measure that excludes certain items as described in the reconciliation of our consolidated net income loss to adjusted ebitda reconciliation below we believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the company we also regularly evaluate gross profit by segment to assist in the assessment of the operational performance of each operating segment we consider adjusted ebitda to be the more important metric because it more fully captures the business performance of the segments inclusive of indirect costs we also evaluate free cash flow a non gaap measure that provides useful information concerning cash flow available to fund our capital allocation alternatives adjusted ebitda we define ebitda as net income loss plus interest income expense income tax expense benefit depreciation and

of analyzing the company s results as reported under us gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted

reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to reinvest

all of that unwanted stuff piles up some of it will be diverted into a global shadow industry of bulk resellers some of it will be stripped for valuable parts and some of it will go directly into an incinerator or a landfill it sounds harmful and inefficient all the box trucks and tractor trailers and cargo planes and container ships set in motion to deal with changed minds or misleading product descriptions to say nothing of the physical waste of the products themselves and the waste created to make things that will never be used that s because it is harmful and inefficient retailers of all kinds have always had to deal with returns but processing this much miscellaneous maybe used maybe useless stuff is an invention of the past 15 years of consumerism in a race to acquire new customers and retain them at any cost retailers have taught shoppers to behave in ways that are bad for virtually all involved the retail logistics industry is split into two halves forward logistics the process of moving goods from manufacturers to their end users is the half most consumers regularly interact with it includes postal workers your neighbourhood ups guy and the people who stock shelves at target or pick items and pack boxes at amazon warehouses pick packing and shipping individual things to satisfy customer orders is a madness but it s a straightforward madness says mark cohen the director of retail studies at the columbia university school of business and the former ceo of sears canada the other half reverse logistics isn t straightforward at all shoppers say they would pay more for items that aren t wasteful or harmful to the environment but the receipts tell a different story getty reverse logistics is nasty says tim brown the managing director of the supply chain and logistics institute at georgia tech the process of getting unwanted items back from consumers and figuring out what to do with them is time and labour intensive and often kind of gross online returns are collected one by one from parcel carriers brick and mortar stores a growing number of third party services and sometimes directly from customers homes workers at sorting facilities open boxes and try to determine whether the thing in front of them is what s on the packing list to discern the difference between the various car parts sold on amazon or the zillion black polyester dresses available to order from h m they also need to figure out whether it s been used or worn if it works if it s clean and if it or any of its components are economically and physically salvageable sometimes the answers to those questions are clear consumers say they re returning xyz but they really return a dead rat and a cinder block brown said that kind of fraud accounts for 5 to 10 per cent of returns usually though the situation is ambiguous how used do jeans have to be for them to be considered used does a mere try on count if they ve been removed from their packaging advertisement logistically prohibitive we can dispense now with a common myth of modern shopping the stuff you return probably isn t restocked and sent back out to another hopeful owner many retailers don t allow any opened product to be resold as new brick and mortar stores have sometimes skirted that policy products that are returned directly to the place where they were sold can be deemed close enough to new and sold again but even if mailed in products come back in pristine unused condition say because you ordered two sizes of the same bra and the first one you tried on fitted fine the odds that things returned to a sorting facility will simply be transferred to that business s inventory aren t great and in some cases they re virtually zero many retailers don t allow any opened product to be resold as new jim rice getting an item back into a company s new product sales stream which is sometimes in a different state can be logistically prohibitive some things such as beauty products underwear and bathing suits are destroyed for sanitary reasons even if they appear to be unopened or unused perfectly good stuff gets thrown away in these facilities all the time simply because the financial maths of doing anything else doesn t work out they re too inexpensive to be worth the effort or too much time has passed since they were sold fast fashion the extremely low cost quick churn styles you can buy from brands such as forever 21 and fashion nova tends to tick both boxes and the industry generates some of the highest return rates in all consumer sales imagine a dress that sold for us25 and was sent back without its plastic packaging at the end of the typical 30 day return window add up the labour to pick pack and dispatch the item the freight both coming and going the labour to receive and sort the now returned item the cardboard and plastic for packaging and the sorting facility s overhead and the seller has already lost money advertisement by one estimate an online return typically costs a retailer us10 to us20 before the cost of shipping and within a month the people who might have paid full price for the dress have moved on to newer items on the seller s website at that point one way or another the dress has got to go many products survive their initial return and even get sold again just not to the retailer s customers stores such as neiman marcus and target which carry a bunch of different brands can often return excess product to those brands for at least a partial refund unwanted clothing and other goods are sold off thousands of kilograms at a time in shipping containers ap that might mean a pallet of polo shirts goes back to ralph lauren or hanes eats part of the loss on a new line of socks that didn t sell at that point the brand or wholesaler taking back the product has to decide whether it should be thrown away or sold or when someone returns a computer to best buy for example the company can try to sell it elsewhere even if it s just for parts perhaps its outer case would be discarded and its processor and video card removed and off loaded along with thousands of others to a middleman who flips them to repair services or retailers that sell refurbished parts discarded or waste bulk sales of intact merchandise supply much of the inventory in domestic deep discount retailers such as big lots according to georgia tech s brown and are also why so many people in countries without american stores wear american clothes unwanted clothing and other goods are sold off thousands of kilograms at a time in shipping containers the buyers discard what they can t resell and ship the rest overseas to wholesale it as fresh merchandise this is why it s difficult to accurately estimate what portion of returned merchandise is discarded or even how much waste it adds up to though we do know that billions of kilos of returns are thrown away in the us every year joel rampoldt a managing director at consulting firm alixpartners says most people in the industry believe that about 25 per cent of returns are discarded although the proportion varies widely depending on the product clothing tends to be easier to resell than electronics that may contain user data for example advertisement there are so many points in an object s life when it could go to the trash heap instead of to a person who will use it and once it s off the books especially if it s out of the country american retailers are no longer keeping track these practices are essentially unregulated companies do whatever they deem most profitable now is usually when people start wondering why more returns aren t just donated don t lots of people in the us need winter coats and smartphones and other crucial tools of everyday life that they can t afford wouldn t providing those things be good pr for retailers wouldn t it be a tax write off at the very least donation would be the morally sound move but companies have little incentive to act morally and many avoid large scale domestic donations because of what is politely termed brand dilution if paying customers catch you giving things to poor people for free the logic goes they ll feel like the things you sell are no longer valuable some of the largest retailers such as amazon and target have begun to quietly acknowledge that it doesn t even make sense for them to eat the cost of reverse logistics to get back many of the things they sell they ll refund you for your itchy leggings or wonky throw pillows and suggest that you give them away which feels like an act of generosity but more likely is really just farming out the task of product disposal brand dilution the birth of the returns problem is almost always pinned on zappos in the mid 2000s the company persuaded millions of americans to buy shoes online a turn of events that at the time seemed extremely unlikely by marketing its fast free shipping and free no questions asked return policy as ardently as it did its products the easy returns tactic was hardly new in retail nordstrom among others was long famous for being so lenient that the store would take back things it didn t sell in the first place to keep customers happy but the free returns model had never been applied at such a large scale to online sales where the logistics of giving buyers so much latitude is much more costly zappos success helped shape how people understood online shopping to work it s so baked into consumer expectations and consumers are very irrational about the cost of shipping and returns says joel rampoldt to some extent retailers have created that and now they re stuck with it advertisement businesses often lose money in the pursuit of customers hoping to make back the initial loss in the long run by creating durable economies of scale which zappos has successfully done scott schaefer the company s vice president of finance says that it s profitable and has no need or desire to tighten its shipping and returns policies but zappos strategy had ramifications far beyond its own sales figures by changing consumer behaviour it inadvertently pushed lots of other businesses to adopt the buy it all return it later policies that have now become the industry standard especially as e commerce spending consolidates among a few mega companies such as amazon target and walmart retailers of that size are better able to absorb the cost of return shipping and junked product than smaller businesses are but many of those smaller businesses must adopt similar policies anyway to hold on to their customers alarmingly the problem seldom comes up in business education there s very very very very little academic work in reverse logistics brown says meanwhile forward logistics and supply chain is taught in every business school in the country people are taught to sell and stores don t want to talk about returns seven of the eight that i contacted for this story which specialise in everything from cheap dog toys to luxury fashion declined to comment the issue is a non starter in almost every way no company wants to draw attention to customers who are disappointed in their purchases if a retailer admits that it wants to cut back on its generous policies it risks headlines painting it as stingy and once people start thinking about returns they might start asking where all that returned product goes which is a whole other can of public relations worms even some of the biggest retailers in the world now see rampant returns as an existential threat shutterstock this avoidance runs deep public companies have to disclose a litany of financial details to shareholders every year but regulatory agencies don t require them to include return rates or specify their financial impact so they don t when everyone s mouths are shut the size of the problem becomes very difficult to discern schaefer from zappos says that the centrality of returns to the business s sales model means that the price of service has long been baked in i could be significantly more transactionally profitable if i cut off and said no returns schaefer says but i would easily lose all of my customers and all my customer trust because zappos doesn t carry fast fashion it has an advantage over some other apparel retailers much of its return volume comes back unworn and is reintegrated into its regular inventory advertisement but even some of the biggest retailers in the world now see rampant returns as an existential threat in recent years many have started using third party software to find and ban their highest volume returners from sending things back and sometimes from buying anything at all amazon sephora best buy ulta and walmart among many others close shoppers accounts or bar them from stores if their returns seem atypical or potentially fraudulent details on what these companies consider aberrant behaviour are scant but mark cohen oversaw one of the first such policies at sears canada in the mid 2000s in its sweep he says sears found 1400 people who were engaged in what he called recreational shopping buying things nearly every week and returning all or almost all of them what s more many of these people even employed the tactic with big ticket items such as tractors lawn mowers and refrigerators third party businesses have also sprouted up to wrestle returns into some kind of submission if you shop online with any regularity you ve probably interacted with a post purchase retail logistics company such as narvar even if you didn t realise it these companies notify buyers when things have shipped or they re about to arrive clean up the tracking information into something understandable at a glance and collect and organise data about why and how often certain products come back other companies promise to intervene in the physical logistics of moving us100 billion in online returns back to sellers roadie for example will pay gig workers to ferry returns back to sorting facilities in their own cars ostensibly in situations where drivers are already heading that way happy returns lets shoppers drop off their unwanted unpackaged goods at return bars inside local businesses drugstores stationery shops fedex offices which in theory minimises the hassle and thus speeds things up happy returns then sorts and sends the items back to retailers creating some measure of greater efficiency but returns don t seem like a problem that can necessarily get solved completely as the places where people used to buy clothes or stationery or kids toys in person are pushed out of business online shopping becomes even more of a necessity and consumers will probably continue to buy more than they intend to keep even if it means an extra trip to the post office prices will go up to account for how expensive it is to send all this unwanted stuff back and forth and companies will make nonbinding sustainability pledges that attract positive headlines while still shovelling things into landfills advertisement they will do so until that is no longer legal or no longer profitable for the largest and most powerful retailers at which point they ll force their customers to get used to something else when surveyed about their preferences big majorities of americans under 40 say that they d happily pay more to patronise businesses that aren t wasteful or harmful to the environment that is the right answer when another human asks you whether you care about the future of the planet but the receipts tell a different story so far those same shoppers do a far larger portion of their shopping online than their older counterparts do and they re also more likely to place big orders buying items in multiple sizes and colours with the intention of sending some back that s the slick thing about shopping now so much of it takes place in the same manner as returns in the privacy of your own home with no human interaction or judgment required what happens in australia this year australians shopped online like never before with a 57 per cent year on year increase in e commerce with great sales comes the need for some items to be returned so what happens to those pants that don t fit or that swimsuit that looked much better on the model the australian financial review asked the question of three of australia s biggest fashion retailers myer and david jones did not comment but the iconic australia s biggest pure play online fashion retailer did advertisement last year it is estimated the iconic delivered 6 million parcels a number that substantially increased this year although it does not divulge how many of these are ultimately returned this year the company s return rate decreased by 6 5 per cent year on year a figure the iconic s chief operating officer anna lee attributes to more efficient sizing technology used on the site when returns do happen lee is adamant that no piece of returned clothing is sent to landfill once an item is returned to our fulfilment centre it goes through a 15 step quality check process says lee the team checks to see if the product has been returned as per our guidelines if it has it can be placed back into the company s inventory system to be sold again importantly says lee the swing tag must still be attached there must be no damage to the item and the customer must explain why the item was returned issues like sizing for example can further improve the site s algorithms the company won t say how many returned items are damaged but lee says most are returned in the same condition received these she says go back into the system to be sold in instances where items do come back to us damaged these are never sent to landfill says lee instead we have a number of channels for damaged items all focused on ensuring the product ends up as a loved item in someone s wardrobe those measures include donating items to thread together which matches disadvantaged members of the community with new clothes and the iconic outlet for end of season items stock with major damage is given back to brands at thread together a team of volunteers repairs damaged items says ceo anthony chesler we have millions of garments given to us yearly says chesler but a very small amount of them are returns i would guess about 2 per cent overall small issues such as popped buttons or stains are fixed by volunteers and anything more challenging is sent to a team of seamstresses who can repair ripped seams and the like our view is to give the garment an infinite life says chesler lauren sams atlantic

second quarter fiscal 2022 investor call i will now turn the call over to joe shoen chairman of amerco joe shoen chairman of the board president chief executive officer thanks sebastian well we had another good financial report most of my teams have meaningful direction and are hard on their objectives attracting and retaining team members remains a struggle we are blessed with many long term persons and a company work ethic that is attractive to many people as i have related before general motors and ford are unable to supply u haul with replacement trucks in the type and quantity we desire as a result maintenance expense must increase this will also cause some blips in capex when replacement units do become available i have a push on this winter to bring bigger u box warehouses online and to expand the number of warehouses i expect some results by late spring we are also working to increase the size of our u box container fleet and delivery truck fleet our u box business continues to grow we are continuing to expand our inventory of self storage units ramp up of existing units remains strong i am working to accelerate new product coming online perhaps more than ever our continued success is due to the hard working nimble teams we have in every phase of our organization should you visit one of our locations and witness a team member going above and beyond give them a word of encouragement they need it i value your continued support jason will now walk us through the numbers jason allen berg chief financial officer thanks joe so yesterday we reported second quarter earnings of 20 90 a share as compared to 13 58 a share for the same period in fiscal 2021 throughout my presentation the majority of the comparisons are going to be for the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of last year unless otherwise noted starting off with equipment rental revenue we saw an increase of nearly 27 that s approximately 248 million the additional revenue came from a combination of growth in transactions and increased revenue per transaction which was due to both more miles being driven and average rental rate per mile we have seen growth in u move revenue continue for the month of october we are taking in new equipment from our manufacturers but as joe mentioned at a rate slower than what is desired we ve also slowed the number of trucks that we re retiring and selling capital expenditures on new rental trucks and trailers were 548 million for the first six months that s up from 395 million in the first six months of last year our original plans were skewed heavier toward heavier growth in the first half of this year there is still a possibility of having a relatively having relatively good acquisition activity over the second half of this fiscal year however since we initially set our fleet plan before the year started given customer demand we would have increased the size of our orders to be more in line with customer activity had the equipment and available to purchase our expectation for net fleet capex in fiscal 2022 is still around 550 million but that s subject to manufacturer availability and quite frankly could go up or down proceeds from the sales of retired rental equipment decreased by 10 million to a total of 300 million in the first six months of this year for the trucks that we do choose to retire and sell the market for these units remain strong demand for self storage continues to be steady our occupied unit count at the end of september increased by 104 000 occupied units compared to the same time last year while revenues were up 38 million which is about a 33 improvement for the quarter our all in blended occupancy rate for the quarter experienced an increase from 72 in the second quarter of last year to 84 in the second quarter of this year if you look at the subset of these facilities that have stabilized under the definition of being at 80 occupancy for the last two years those locations occupancy increased about 280 basis points to 96 5 this group of properties that fall under this definition also increased by count of 82 this quarter versus how many qualified last year at this time we have also seen increased revenue per foot indicating improvements to our average rental rates capital expenditure spending related to real estate was 444 million for the first six months that s up from 226 million last year at this time our goal has been to increase the pace of investment and we re seeing some success at doing that we currently have approximately 7 3 million new square feet in development across 155 projects in october we closed on another 16 development properties and our acquisition pipeline continues to accelerate with approximately 310 million of deals currently in escrow that s around 125 properties operating earnings at our moving and storage segment increased by 182 million to 556 million for the quarter operating expenses saw an increase of 120 million in spite of this increase we still saw an improvement in our operating margin our two largest operating expenses personnel and fleet repair and maintenance accounted for approximately half of the increase for personnel the increases are less than the revenue improvements thereby helping the operating margin the positive margin impact of fleet maintenance that we saw in the first quarter narrowed during the second quarter and may start to turn a bit negative going forward several of our other categories increased to a lesser extent including shipping costs property taxes and maintenance for buildings and non rental equipment items we continue to improve our cash and liquidity position as of september 30 of this year cash along with availability from existing loan facilities at our moving and storage segment totaled 2 486 billion included in that was during the quarter that we entered into a note purchase agreement to issue 600 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes in a private placement offering the weighted average interest rate was 2 59 our intended use of these funds is primarily to expand our presence with new locations self storage and to add warehouse space in support of our u box program with that i would like to hand the call back to our operator debbie to begin the question and answer portion of the call questions and answers operator sebastien reyes director of investor relations debbie i ll go ahead and ask two questions that have come in beforehand from partners the first question is what influence if any of course is the constrained production of new trucks having on truck rental pricing would management assume pricing weakens as production comes back i m sure this is too simple an assumption so thoughts on how management views the current pricing environment would be helpful joe shoen chairman of the board president chief executive officer all right i ll take that pricing is rates are up i had a customer push back real hard on monday they paid 669 for rental that five years previously they d done for 197 and the press feel pretty very thoughtful that i had overreached on the pricing i reviewed it and repriced at a lower number but what i found was the budget was 900 plus and is exactly 1 000 above our rate on the same rental so of course my pricing people said we re already discounting so it s kind of an uncertain journey here of course our cost of equipment are up and they re going to continue to go up we re in some kind of an inflationary cycle but i don t understand any better than any of you but we know from our vehicle suppliers that they re going to be passing on considerable costs over the next probably two years so i think it s going to have some impact on pricing and they probably already has had some impact on pricing i don t believe that the prices i saw from this particular transaction from either our competitors made any sense whatsoever so i didn t give it a lot of weight very frankly i think we still have a pact with the customer to try to be a low cost provider of household moving storage services and we want to try to honor that but will prices come down as availability increases i doubt it because i think what we ll see is inflated costs and that s going to mitigate the increased availability now i obviously don t give certainty on this but what i m seeing on with all our various vendors is that there s more cost increases on the horizon and we ve been served up a lot of price increases that of course we re pushing back on sometimes successfully sometimes not so that s kind of an overview of it sebastien reyes director of investor relations great and then the second question jason you kind of alluded to this cash is stacking up on the balance sheet which is positive what is management s plan for all that cash jason allen berg chief financial officer so our goal has been to begin reinvesting back into real estate so we had made a big push several years ago with the infusion of capital from the sale of a portion of our chelsea new york location this time around now we ve entered into this private placement type debt which is eight nine 10 and 12 year maturities with the idea that this is going to be working capital to help support the next round of development for the organization and this next round of development will look a lot more like ground up development versus the last time around which was largely conversions with kmart properties so we thought that this type of funding better fit that type of property profile operator the next question in the queue comes from jamie wilen with wilen management jamie wilen wilen management analyst outstanding quarter it s amazing what the hard work and effort produces in the outcome on the self storage side enthused with your increase in occupancy rates that have gone up literally 500 basis points from march to september march to june and june to september is that continuing has october shown increased strength and it looks like it s kind of a straightforward progression joe shoen chairman of the board president chief executive officer well i m going to say to your question yes the reason is is we re not bringing what i consider enough new product online we re absorbing the product faster than we re bringing it online so the party will be over if we don t bring more product online so we run a real hard to rooms rented jamie instead of occupancy percent of course we have to have enough occupancy to pay our bills and everything but we have to see units rented grow consistently and we don t have enough in inventory to continue at the present pace no the good news is that it will raise occupancy percent but the bad news is it will constrain growth so we re trying to balance that out it s a little inexact because normally construction s herky jerky but with all this other nonsense in the economy it s worse than it was five years ago so it s very all your plans keep falling apart and you put them back together but i expect by late spring to have some more product significant more product online and that might cause occupancy to slip a little bit all along our occupancy and jason has tried to present this we have two kinds of occupancy the stores that have been around a while and then whatever we re able to bring online so at this time we re doing a lot of phase two build outs you re aware of the kmart stores we have many of them we only built out 50 so we will and have been and well through the rest of the winter continue to build out the rest of them which will make each property cash flow better and be better provide enough money that we can afford management on site so that part of the picture is pretty easy to see the part is about bringing total round ups on lines a little more murky although we have several that are half built at this time which means they ll be done by late spring no doubt so that it s kind of you and i see it just a little bit different i try to appreciate your view my view is i need more inventory so i can continue to grow jamie wilen wilen management analyst as occupancy rates obviously are improving for everyone in the industry that goes hand in hand with realized rental rates and as i look at public storage increase their year over year rental rates by 13 lsi by 14 have your rental rates increased by similar numbers joe shoen chairman of the board president chief executive officer no and a little bit of what they re showing us mirage they cut prices well they cut prices march a year ago and march 1 5 years ago real solidly we never cut our prices so you d have to do a three year trend on them to know what is comparable i don t know what their comparable is on a three year trend but no we re not seeing something like 13 increases no sebastien reyes director of investor relations okay in the 10 q you talked about other revenues of u box being the most significant contributor to a 50 million increase was it am i reading that correctly jason allen berg chief financial officer yes jamie wilen wilen management analyst and could you give us a handle on what u box revenues are today jason allen berg chief financial officer it s by far the largest component of that if not yet 10 of the total revenue that would require us to break it out and as i mentioned before since there are no other public competitors in that space who report any sort of information we re going to continue to blend that in with our other revenue number until it s required to be broken out but it s starting to be a big enough number where you can kind of see the movement there because what else is in other revenue would be interest income on our short term cash it would be income from revenues from some of our ancillary programs like moving help so u box far and away overshadows what s in that category right now jamie wilen wilen management analyst and is there their percentage increase greater than the corporate increase at this point jason allen berg chief financial officer yes jamie wilen wilen management analyst and historically you said their margins are all in pretty close to historical corporate margins for everything else is that still the case jason allen berg chief financial officer it s that game of how we choose to allocate expenses and how we have that sort of internal tracking setup we allocate very heavily so it s typically running a couple of points back but at this point it s certainly as we re underwriting new projects we re finding that the inclusion of the u box is certainly helping the economics of our overall moving and storage offering jamie wilen wilen management analyst okay and when you i see all the new self storage being opened you really seem to have a much greater u box component or as you build those you make sure you have room for u box does that give you a competitive advantage in there and is that fueling the growth in u box at the moment joe shoen chairman of the board president chief executive officer i would say yes but ultimately it s just consumers want it we re going to try to get it to them at a fair price i mean there s people who want that kind of a move and we just need to honor their requests it s a big country there s a lot of markets to get this into to where you could say you really have it i think i could say today that no one has extensive a network as we do in place but our work is not as extensive as i can see it being and the more we get a network the more the customer sees that as a viable alternative so we have to continue to establish a physical presence in a number of cities and towns and i think as we do that we ll see the business continue to grow and hopefully grow faster than the truck rental part of the business truck rental is much more mature relative probably there are no accurate numbers on market market share and those things but just from my experience is that there s more there s a lot of room to grow in the containerized moving business jamie wilen wilen management analyst okay and lastly joe in canada while the business is very very profitable the profit margins are not as great as they are in the states is there anything that you can do in the future and you don t seem to have much of a build out in sell storage in canada is what will you do in the future so those margins in canada can approach the u s or is that not possible just because of the logistics up there joe shoen chairman of the board president chief executive officer i think it s possible everything is a little bit different in it s its own country no kidding they re very proud of that as we are of our distinct characteristics we are we don t have as strong a storage presence relative to our unit presence until september of this year i was prohibited from going to canada for almost 17 months that had the predictable effect ok so since then i ve been able to get into canada and my other management personnel have and i think we ve got canada running hard and aggressively but before that would have any impact on product availability is probably 18 months so maybe march of 23 before you really see this stuff really percolating through but we re hard at it we understand the deal the basic consumer wants and needs are very similar in canada and the united states it s a question of getting up there and getting the product presented operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks joe shoen chairman of the board president chief executive officer i just want to thank everybody for their continued support and repeat my request i hope you go into one of our stores from time to time we re only as good as our last visit which when i say that i always cross my fingers because of course it is just that simple but if you go into one of our stores or when you go into one of our stores you see somebody doing a good job tell them you re an investor and you appreciate the work they re doing we re counting on them so i thank you look forward to talking to you again in 90 days sebastien any closing comments sebastien reyes director of investor relations we look forward to speaking with you in february thank you everyone operator duration 25

his comments came during a briefing with wall street analysts on third quarter earnings on friday morning the day after square shareholders approved the us29 billion 39 billion afterpay acquisition in a flurry of activity around australia s biggest deal mr dorsey s observations were followed by afterpay s 431 page scheme of arrangement document released on friday afternoon which also detailed how square intends to integrate the afterpay app into its cash app to help drive leads for merchants and consumer engagement independent experts lonergan edwards associates said the square offer was fair and reasonable as afterpay shareholders prepare to vote on the combination on december 6 afterpay shares which have largely been trading in lockstep with square since the august 2 offer were down 4 4 per cent on friday afternoon at 118 84 after square s quarterly revenue missed forecasts as revenue from bitcoin trading fell we have these incredible network effects in peer to peer and now we need to look forward to being more of a commerce front end jack dorsey on one of his endgames with the afterpay square union more of the questions on a conference call focused on mr dorsey s plans for cash app which is competing with paypal and major us banking applications advertisement cash app is not available in australia but the imminent public launch of afterpay money is a similar concept and ultimately the two may be brought together analysts probed mr dorsey s thinking around network effects from the retail and business sides of the business and new functions being rolled out mr dorsey the ceo and controlling shareholder of square explained the larger game plan as new features are loaded into its cash app including contactless payments and loans to help customers buy things he wanted cash app to become a tool for digital and physical commerce we have these incredible network effects in peer to peer and now we need to look forward to being more of a commerce front end he said new family feature for teens cash app s initial roots were in money transfers before it added investment holdings including bitcoin and a tax service a contactless payment functionality via qr codes or a button in the app was introduced only in the past quarter advertisement cash app also holds deposits square is a bank in the us and is developing a loan product in addition to afterpay s short term instalment credit square s strategy is in focus as 60 000 afterpay shareholders consider whether to hold square shares when the afterpay deal completes through its new york stock exchange listed shares or in australia via asx cdis this week it announced a new family feature making cash app available to teens between 13 and 17 with parental controls this will let parents oversee kids saving and spending more of which would be done digitally as cash usage reduces mr dorsey said mr dorsey said after closing the transaction afterpay can add direct commerce across sellers and individuals and we think it is a really smart connection between the two systems any connections we make between the two ecosystems strengthens the overall value of our broader ecosystem and our value to customers and the company obviously afterpay has done very well with larger retailers and that is both on the seller side and individual side the more cash app is on the commerce front end from discovery to transactions the stronger our relationship and as we look to integrate afterpay after the transaction closes we will have even more opportunity we have ecosystems that are cohesive and very broad in their tool sets so it allows us to reach sellers in a much more cohesive way advertisement square s strategy is influencing that of commonwealth bank which is making a more concerted effort to use both sides of its business retail customers and business customers to drive the same kind of networks that saw afterpay take off afterpay s ability to drive incremental sales and higher basket sizes for its retail partners was the main dynamic that triggered the rise of the buy now pay later sector and banks were slow respond square cfo amrita ahuja said the company would ramp up investment to chase its opportunity with expenses in the fourth quarter to increase by 115 million over the third quarter just gone in 2022 we see significant investment opportunities she said with expenses set to grow by 40 per cent or 1 3 billion more than 2021 as it hires more people and beefs up sales and marketing advertisement she also flagged expanding out our banking capabilities including new products like borrow to drive engagement and attain more inflows into the network square s stock sagged after it missed revenue expectations for the third quarter revenue was us3 84 billion up 27 per cent year on year but below the us4 5 billion analysts were expecting as revenue from bitcoin fell to us1 8 billion from us2 7 billion the previous quarter gross profit was us1 13 billion and it broke even at the net income line gross profit for its seller business was us606 million up 48 per cent year on year while the cash app profit of us512 million was up 33 per cent the shares fell sharply in after hours trading rebounded then fell away again as the market digested the result

commentary1 brad soultz chief executive officer of willscot mobile mini holdings commented our entire portfolio delivered strong financial and operating results in the third quarter driven by increasing delivery volumes and continued rate optimization in all segments as well as exciting progress in vaps penetration in na modular delivery volumes remained elevated due to broad based end market demand modular space units on rent in na modular inflected positively increasing about 700 units sequentially from june 30 to september 30 and average portable storage units on rent across both segments in north america increased approximately 16 922 units year over year for the quarter or 14 0 average monthly rental rate for modular space units in na modular increased by 20 3 and portable storage unit rental rates in na storage increased 6 9 year over year continued strong price and volume trends in the u k and tightening oec utilization in the tank pump segment drove year over year

expanded our ready to work value proposition to new customers as we closed and fully integrated three acquisitions during the quarter and closed a fourth acquisition in october highlighting the

reflected in our updated financial guidance our adjusted ebitda margin progressed as we expected improving 70 basis points sequentially to 38 8 in q3 driven by an accelerating lease revenue run rate amidst strong sustained delivery volumes consistent with normal seasonality we continue to expect strong adjusted ebitda margin expansion year over year in the fourth quarter and expect to sustain those increases in 2022 we generated 78 5 million of free cash flow during the quarter at a 16 margin and we are reinvesting that capital in our business to compound our earnings growth we increased net capex by 18 6 million versus prior year to 52 0 million to support organic initiatives we invested 56 3 million to acquire three regional storage businesses and we repurchased 106 3 million of common shares and equivalents choosing to maintain leverage at 3 7x given the attractiveness of these alternatives recognizing that the opportunities ahead for our business are large in magnitude and

forward to seeing you in person on november 8th third quarter 2021 results1 total revenues increased 17 6 to 490 6 million while leasing revenues increased 21 1 versus the prior year quarter driven by

modular space monthly rental rate increased 141 or 20 3 to 834 in the na modular segment modular space delivery volumes in na modular increased 8 0 year over year reflecting broad based strength in our end markets units on rent increased by approximately 700 units sequentially from june 30th to september 30th while average modular space units on rent were down 2 5 year over year in the quarter the sustained delivery growth and sequential gains give us line of sight to year over year unit on rent growth lagging delivery growth by several quarters average portable storage monthly rental rate in na storage increased 10 or 6 9 to 155 driven by process improvements focused on rate management average portable storage units on rent in na storage increased by 31 902 units or 30 3 reflecting broad based end market strength especially in the retail sector and a transfer of approximately 12 000 units from na modular into the na storage segment across both segments in north america average portable storage units on rent increased by 16 922 units or 14 0 which is a better reflection of organic volume growth for north america portable storage units revenues of 28 1 million in the u k and 29 5 million in our tank pump segment were up 30 6 and 26 7 respectively driven by continued strong price and volume trends in the u k and tightening oec utilization in the tank pump segment on a

over year with growth across all four segments the transfer of 12 000 storage units on rent in q3 from na modular to na storage reduced revenue and adjusted ebitda each by 5 0 million in q3 relative to prior year and increased revenue and adjusted ebitda in the na storage segment by the same amount adjusted ebitda margin of 38 8 in the third quarter increased by 70 bps sequentially from the second quarter and declined 40 basis points versus prior year similar to the second quarter results strong year over year delivery volume growth drove an additional 9 9 million of variable leasing costs and a higher mix of delivery and installation revenues relative to prior year strong delivery volumes and financial results also drove a 6 9 million increase in variable compensation and sales commissions relative to the third quarter of 2020 together these factors drove the expected temporary year over year margin compression in the third quarter these elevated activity levels also drove the 6 5 sequential increase in our leasing and services revenues which we expect will continue to build and drive margin expansion in the fourth quarter heading into 2022 net income of 61 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 increased by 67 2 million versus prior year and included 11 1 million of discrete costs expensed in the period related to transaction and integration

flow increased by 50 5 million year over year to 78 5 million this represents a 16 0 free cash flow margin including a 17 8 million year over year increase in capital expenditures for rental equipment

financial measures we use certain non gaap financial information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends we evaluate business segment performance on adjusted ebitda a non gaap measure that excludes certain items as described in the reconciliation of our consolidated net income loss to adjusted ebitda reconciliation below we believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the company we also regularly evaluate gross profit by segment to assist in the assessment of the operational performance of each operating segment we consider adjusted ebitda to be the more important metric because it more fully captures the business performance of the segments inclusive of indirect costs we also evaluate free cash flow a non gaap measure that provides useful information concerning cash flow available to fund our capital allocation alternatives adjusted ebitda we define ebitda as net income loss plus interest income expense income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization our adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda reflects the following further adjustments to ebitda to exclude certain non cash items and the effect of what we consider transactions or events not related to our core business operations currency gains losses net on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency substantially all such currency gains losses are unrealized and attributable to financings due to and from affiliated companies goodwill and other impairment charges related to non cash costs associated with impairment charges to goodwill other intangibles rental fleet and property plant and equipment restructuring costs lease impairment expense and other related charges associated with restructuring plans designed to streamline operations and reduce costs including employee and lease termination costs transaction costs including legal and professional fees and other transaction specific related costs costs to integrate acquired companies including outside professional fees non capitalized costs associated with system integrations non lease branch and fleet relocation expenses employee training costs and other costs required to realize cost or revenue synergies non cash charges for stock compensation plans gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value and extinguishment of common stock warrant liabilities other expense includes consulting expenses related to certain one time projects financing costs not classified as interest expense and gains and losses on disposals of property plant and equipment adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider the measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow from operations or other methods of analyzing the company s results as reported under us gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda does not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness adjusted ebitda does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes adjusted ebitda does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to meet our obligations the following table provides an unaudited reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda three months ended september 30 nine months ended

us president joe biden has blamed russian and saudi oil supply restraint for a surge in us petrol prices which have risen 60 per cent in the past 12 months jennifer granholm the us energy secretary told the financial times last month that a release of oil from the country s strategic stockpiles was among tools the biden administration could deploy to cool crude prices that have more than doubled in the past year saudi arabia defended its stance on thursday friday aedt saying the producer group was acting as a responsible regulator by only gradually increasing oil output by 400 000 barrels a day each month what we have seen over the past few months again and again and again is that energy markets must be regulated otherwise things will go astray saudi energy minister prince abdulaziz bin salman said at a press conference the group sought to present a united front to the us with energy ministers from mexico to the uae lining up to support the decision opec said in a statement it wanted to provide clarity to the market at times when other parts of the energy complex outside the boundaries of oil markets are experiencing extreme volatility and instability advertisement prince abdulaziz repeatedly referenced gas and coal markets the prices of which have risen faster than oil this year to justify the group s actions but the explanation failed to satisfy the white house mr biden took his climate change agenda to the cop26 summit in glasgow where he sought for countries to sign up to ambitious goals to cut emissions from high carbon energy sources such as coal gas and oil saudi arabia has long been one of washington s most important middle eastern allies but tensions are increasing with the biden administration mr biden has refused to speak with crown prince mohammed bin salman the heir to king salman and day to day ruler of the country the us released a declassified intelligence report in march that said the crown prince authorised the murder of washington post journalist jamal khashoggi prince abdulaziz is the half brother of the crown prince and is seen as frustrated by the push by western countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuels while also asking the kingdom to raise oil production advertisement the relationship between saudi arabia and the us is at risk of being strained as the latter is going full bore to tackle climate change said christyan malek head of oil and gas research at jpmorgan but saudi arabia in this context needs to fund its own energy transition and it s looking for an oil price and a relationship which is conducive for that the white house has also said it is monitoring russia s actions in natural gas markets as prices in europe and asia have soared fivefold this year some lawmakers in europe and the us have blamed moscow for exacerbating the gas price surge by restricting supplies to western europe bob mcnally head of rapidan energy group and a former adviser to the george w bush white house said the decision by opec could prompt a response from consumer countries given the complete rebuff by opec and president biden s clear threats to respond odds of a us if not an international energy agency strategic stock release are rising fast along with other retaliatory options he said under the current plan opec will add 400 000 barrels a day every month until the end of 2022 restoring oil supply removed last year after the us cajoled saudi arabia and russia to make record deep cuts to prop up an industry devastated by the pandemic financial times

hugely experienced and technology aware gary gensler as chairman of the securities exchanges commission sec noonan added â he and his team have been left with much to catch up on through the rise of crypto new and unregulated securities such as nfts non fungible tokens and innovative trading technology â nevertheless crowdfunding momentum from the 2016 jobs act highlighted an era of opportunity

investors â crypto and blockchain technology has also raised questions about managing and regulating rapid change but we have assembled a team of highly talented and experienced people each averaging 20 years on wall street â chief operating officer joel steinmetz has huge knowledge in data analysis and electronic trading while our head of market structure lee saba is a trading tech guru and a leading global thought leader and networker who co chairs the fix trading community the non profit global trading standards body â such expertise had created a new generation company for changing

services to use rialto marketsâ platform â we are currently running nine live crowdfunding investment opportunities completed capital raises with 10 more in the pipeline â said shari noonan â but even

business overview australia cooper basin queensland pl303 and pl 1028 cuisinier controlling permit atp 752 30 357 wi a pilot reservoir pressure maintenance scheme was initiated during the prior fiscal year this pilot well encountered mechanical disruptions during initial attempts to commence water injection which have been addressed through additional water filtration at the injection site the joint venture expects to resume water injection activities during calendar q4 2021 the location of this pilot is in the southeast quadrant of the cuisinier pool with injection of water to take place at the cuisinier 24 well the broad nature of the cuisinier structure combined with variable flank aquifer pressure support has resulted in pressure depletion within the central portion of the cuisinier pool the injection of produced formation water is anticipated to both increase production in up to four offsetting wells and reduce water handling charges on establishing success of the pilot the joint venture will begin a multi phase water injection scheme targeted fracture stimulation and more commercially efficient development drilling bengal will participate in the 3d seismic controlled chef exploration drilling project which has been proposed by the joint venture operator santos and is expected to commence in calendar q4 2021 this target is in the northeast portion of the block which is immediately adjacent to the cook and cocinero fields also operated by santos this well will target the jurassic age reservoirs of the birkhead hutton formations which have proven to be prolific producers in the neighboring cook and cocinero fields atp 934 barrolka 100 wi atp 934 is the company s 100 owned natural gas exploration block in order to mitigate both financial and development risk bengal conducted extensive state of the art geophysical work that has not been widely applied in australia which gives a higher degree of confidence in the block and high grading prospects bengal received special amendment approved for atp 934 in march 2021 which relinquished 50 of the existing atp area and extended the term of the atp by entering into an outcome based later work program lwp for another 6 years to february 28 2027 the lwp includes the drilling of up to 3 wells and 260 km2 of 3d seismic bengal entered into an agreement with santos in july of 2020 to farm in on a portion of the atp 934 block this farm out finances and de risks the company s initial field exploration by the basin leading gas explorer with whom bengal has an existing and successful partnership at the cuisinier field additionally and of equal importance the partnership offers extensive operating experience backed by santos recent exploration success in neighboring fields analogous to the joint venture s exploration targets santos will carry the drilling costs of one well to earn a 60 operated interest in the atp 934 southern farm out block which represents 57 8 of the total block post april 2020 relinquishment on october 14 2021 the company s joint venture partner santos completed the drilling of the legbar 1 exploration well santos paid 100 of the costs to drill

development activities specifically this program is expected to include the following development activities a recommissioning of a 26km pipeline to tie two previously producing wareena liquids rich gas wells into a nearby compression station accessing the eastern australia local and export market b subject to an appropriate commercial agreement with a crude oil buyer work over of the ramses well that demonstrated both a permian gas discovery and oil zone completion in a cased well which recovered 588 bbls d of light crude oil based on a 105 minute drill stem test c work over of the ghina well to evaluate the previous permian liquids rich gas discovery and assess the economics of tie in and field recovery and finally d twin drilling of the existing karnak well that showed a liquids rich gas pay zone in the permian formation bengal expects that with the application of advanced underbalanced drilling techniques now commonplace in the cooper basin a successful new well could be immediately tied into nearby gathering infrastructure the 100 ownership of these assets presents an appraisal and development opportunity that will be operated by the company and is seen not only to be complementary to our proven producing non operated cuisinier asset but also as a key stepping stone for bengal s natural gas platform with immediate market access to an existing pipeline upon which

seven hunters from pilot station have been stuck at a fish camp for one week the group includes a child the hunters were headed upriver after fall seal hunting on the yukon they got stuck outside of emmonak on their way home it s traditional for hunters from lower yukon river villages to travel down to the coast in the fall to hunt for seal to stock their freezers for the winter especially this year since subsistence fishing for most salmon species was closed after the yukon river saw a massive chum salmon collapse normally hunters are able to get to the coast and back home this time of year without any problem but former pilot station mayor abraham kelly said that this year winter weather snuck up on them it got cold a lot faster than what we thought said kelly as the hunters were making their way upriver ice began forming across the water just past emmonak they couldn t go any further four of the seven hunters volunteer with the local search and rescue in pilot station so they knew to contact the nearby emmonak search and rescue from their inreach device according to emmonak search and rescue the hunters provided their location and the emmonak group directed them to the nearest fish camp the hunters pulled over between what they brought and what was at the fish camp they had enough to feed themselves and stay warm for several days but according to alaska state troopers the weather soon turned foggy and turbulent and it was too risky to land an aircraft on day three oct 31 troopers were able to do a fly by drop off of food supplies and medications needed by one of the hunters in the group the group needs to be rescued by air because the river and overland trails are not yet frozen enough for snowmachines or other vehicles the entire area is off the road system back in pilot station the head of the local search and rescue group paul fancyboy had gotten word that his friends and his second in command were stuck near emmonak he was concerned that no one had rescued them yet so on day four he said that he called gov mike dunleavy s office he reached an aide he said he was taking notes and he s gonna give it to the governor i wouldn t know why he hasn t called me back about why it took so long for those guys to get rescued said fancyboy fancyboy said that the governor never called him back the governor s office said that they provided fancyboy with another number to call the next day day five troopers attempted to evacuate the group with a fixed wing aircraft but according to a spokesperson for emmonak search and rescue the pilot couldn t land due to a heavy crosswind the spokesperson from emmonak search and rescue said that the men were starting to get agitated that it had been five days and no one had picked them up yet emmonak search and rescue coordinated another fly by food drop this time food was donated by the local ac store and the village store and the flight was donated by grant aviation the drop included a charger for the hunter s inreach satellite the group is using it to communicate with emmonak search and rescue the mood at camp briefly lifted plus the weather was looking good for the next day emmonak search and rescue told the hunters to pack their gear in and get ready the u s coast guard s helicopter in nome was preparing to pick them up but on day six the chopper never came the weather turned once more according to kelly finally they were gonna pick them up yesterday morning and then that fog rolled in again so they cancelled the chopper from nome was supposed to pick them said kelly he said that another fog bank had rolled in on nov 4 and the coast guard confirmed that as of yet they have not been able to get the boaters as of nov 4 emmonak search and rescue was working on coordinating a third food drop

believe our long term goals are within reach our strategy is working and as we delivered another quarter of solid and consistent growth q2 revenue was up 11 with high single digit growth in bookings we are delivering strong profitability and continued eps expansion up almost 20 year over year our high single digit bookings growth was in line to our long term objectives and is reflective of our normal seasonality with the first half of our fiscal year historically being seasonally lower the start of q2 was impacted by expected weaker summer demand and covid reopening as more people mobilized or prioritized to travel and other activities as we balanced all of our operational metrics and investment we finished the quarter with strong momentum delivering our eighth straight quarter of net direct customer adds sequentially our direct customer count grew over 178 000 sequentially and we added over 2 6 million customers year over year bringing our total customer count to 23 3 million in

and more robust product portfolio as we reach more consumers on a global basis while driving higher engagement with our existing customers our net promoter score continues to improve from low 40s last year to 49 this quarter reflecting our focus on customer experience and providing peace of mind to our customers as they live their digital lives our international expansion efforts continued in q2 and grew double digits similar to last quarter we continue to invest in our freemium model as it increases our consumer reach and awareness and we are encouraged that our nascent expansion into identity internationally is now available in more than 20 countries across europe and asia it is a critical component of our ability to provide more value to our customers outside of the us replicating the success we have had with id advisor in japan where we combined dark web monitoring with elements of restoration our partner business posted double digit revenue for the quarter for the actually fourth straight quarter up 25 in q2 all channels contributed meaningfully to these results amongst those the employee benefits channel delivered another very strong quarter we ve expanded beyond the united states offering our employee benefit solutions to canadian employers and unlocking a broader customer base our investment in this area are paying off as we have strengthened our sales team and market coverage in the last few quarters we intend to expand our overall partner business and we will continue to invest in our multichannel approach evaluating all potential opportunities and markets globally overall we are on track to our plan and committed to investing in what we see as a long term secular growth opportunity to develop the best cybersafety portfolio for consumers as a result we continued to accelerate the pace of our product innovation pipeline as we work to bring cybersafety to every digital user and release products that help protect consumers devices privacy and identity we opened the quarter with the release of norton utilities ultimate a new performance maintenance offering that helps create a faster and smoother and more secure experience for consumers whether they re gaming or browsing or streaming content or more on their windows pc we expanded norton family with new features including favorite locations to help parents establish approved geographic locations and receive notifications when their child s device arrives or departs those set locations we also introduced alert me which helps parents inform about their children s location by setting specific dates and times to receive automatic check in alerts from the location of their child s device both of these new features were quite timely as many kids headed back to school in person on the identity front we added payday loan lock to selected us lifelock plans to help block the opening of fraudulent payday loans and other short term loans and we ve added new features like social media monitoring in more markets to provide consumers with broader protection as their digital footprint expands as awareness grows globally for identity protection we continue to evolve our road map to protect our customers and provide the most relevant products and features to new audiences as we continue to strengthen our privacy pillar and help provide additional ways for consumers to control their online privacy we released norton antitrack in the us a new app and browser extension that helps prevent websites from tracking and profiling users in ways normal private browsers or vpns cannot do that way people can protect and control their digital footprint from companies and websites that track online activities and collect or sell their personal data we ve seen positive momentum from this new product release as consumers are seeing ways to protect their privacy and i m pleased to share that norton antitrack has expanded now to apg and emea earlier this week privacy overall is one of the three pillars of our cybersafety portfolio and we should continue to see investment in this area to help consumers manage their privacy and reputation online in q2 we also released our first environmental social and governance report this report highlights nortonlifelock s ongoing pledge to bring together our team expertise and technology

25 year over year with continued strength in employee benefits as well as growth from other distribution channels although it accounts for approximately 10 of our total our partner business remains a key tenet of our long term growth strategy and will continue to be an important investment area for us and we are encouraged by the year to date growth unlocks thus far turning to profitability q2 operating margin was 52 up 200 basis points year over year we operate with a growth focused approach in our investment decisions with sales and marketing we are constantly evaluating the effectiveness of our spend to optimize how we reach consumers and market our products to maximize the return on these investments for both the short term and long term in an increasingly competitive advertising environment with r d we have focused our efforts on increasing the pace of new product launches while maintaining a robust evolving product pipeline for our customers and we self fund these investments through productivity gains and lower infrastructure costs operating at 87 gross margin and with g a less than 5 of revenue as we drive long term sustainable growth q2 net income was 255 million up 19 year over year diluted eps was 0 43 for the quarter also up 19 year over year and at the high end of our guidance range we remain focused on eps expansion and achieving our long term eps objective of 3 that we shared back in may this year turning to our cash flow and balance sheet q2 operating cash flow was 60 million and free cash flow was 59 million which included seasonal tax payments year to date operating cash flow was 318 million in line with our net income improvement and growth we ended q2 with over 1 5 billion of total cash which includes the cash proceeds from the july sale of our mountain view ellis building we remain levered at approximately two times net debt and maintain both a strong liquidity position and a healthy balance sheet in q2 we also returned approximately 73 million to shareholders in the form of our regular quarterly dividend of 0 125 per common share for q3 the board of directors has approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0 125 per common share to be paid on december 15 2021 for all shareholders of record as of the close of business on november 22 2021 as described in the press release and a reminder that while we still have approximately 1 8 billion remaining in the current share buyback program we cannot deploy it in the short term due to the pending avast transaction now turning to our q3 and full year outlook we expect q3 non gaap revenue in the range of 695 million to 705 million assuming stable currency rates quarter over quarter which translates to 9 to 11 growth year over year we expect q3 non gaap eps to be in the range of 0 42 to 0 44 per share for the full year we expect non gaap revenue growth of 9 to 10 year over year in constant currency and non gaap eps in the range of 1 70 to 1 75 narrowing the range to the high end on both revenue and eps versus what we shared with you back in may at our analyst day we look forward to building on our growth momentum and consistent profitability in the second half of this year and we are well positioned to deliver on our objectives even with the macro impacts around inflation foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the evolving pandemic conditions we have successfully navigated through and continued to hit expectations as we look forward we will continue to challenge ourselves to anticipate prioritize and meet customer needs in a growth focused manner thank you for your time today and i will now turn the call back to the operator to take your questions please do keep in mind we are not able to answer any questions related to any specific m a at this time operator questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of saket kalia from barclays your line is now open saket kalia barclays analyst hey good afternoon hey vincent hey natalie thanks for taking my questions here natalie maybe just to start with you i was wondering if you could just double click a little bit into the billings metric i think we heard 7 growth in bookings which was really good to hear i think the billings growth is a little bit lower than i come to that 5 can you just walk through maybe some of the puts and takes there i know that maybe there was a slightly tougher compare there s always currency i mean just maybe you could just touch on that growth kind of compared to bookings kind of compared to billings growth in prior quarters natalie derse chief financial officer sure thanks saket look i m not surprised with the question around 7 bookings i m going to focus on bookings in the response to your question but i m also not surprised at our q2 results as it s in line with our models our internal models as you know we don t guide bookings but we did share that q2 is historically a seasonally lighter quarter we also recognized early on that even if you look at the external search traffic metrics either on google metrics analytics etc and you hone in on our branded and non branded terms we knew that search volume was lower than prior quarters than what we saw last year and then we also saw very early on that the advertising spend being put into the market across our competitive landscape was up the other thing i d encourage you guys to look at is as you know with our recurring business model and as you know with customer acquisition when they get to the first year retention and renewal there s a healthy step up in terms of the bookings amount that we get as those customers choose to renew with us so you really have to date back to last year in q1 we added 379 000 net new customers again factor in the seasonality component from q1 to q2 last year at this time we added about 117k net customers when you factor into the model the step up in the renewal bookings that we get from that renewable customer base it would point you to a 7 result for us vincent pilette chief executive officer if i can add just a few step back saket quarter in quarter out obviously we represent bookings so investors can understand the underlying metrics but revenue and bookings trend about the same way not every quarter but on a multi quarter trend and we guided revenue for next quarter 9 to 11 again we don t guide bookings but we see this trending somewhat in that range saket kalia barclays analyst got it got it that s very helpful vincent maybe for my follow up for you a lot of good things happening internationally can you just remind us how big is international currently as a percentage of the business and sort of what s i guess how big can you see international long term as a percentage of total and is that more of an antivirus type of market is that more of an identity monitoring market is it a little bit of both curious how you sort of see international sort of longer term vincent pilette chief executive officer it s a good question saket i ll give you the short belgium answer international is not big enough today it represent about 30 of our business as you know we acquired avira to accelerate our growth internationally as you said a lot of good efforts initially are offering in those outside of the us countries did not include identity elements we now start to build up the portfolio to move above and beyond that security moving into protecting the digital lives exploring element of restoration and so what i call solutions which includes services i think on a long term perspective outside of the us we have a huge structural growth opportunities obviously the proposed merger avast will boost all of that it will be more balanced when i look at different industry technology or even the demographic as you know we should be more 40 in the us 60 international versus the reverse on a unit basis and we re going to continue to expand saket kalia barclays analyst very helpful thanks guys vincent pilette chief executive officer thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of hamza fodderwala from morgan stanley your line is now open hamza fodderwala morgan stanley analyst hey good evening guys thanks for taking my question so i ll keep it to one question natalie since you alluded to inflation i m curious what nortonlifelock is thinking about in terms of pricing on renewal particularly into the next fiscal year thank you vincent pilette chief executive officer if you don t mind i ll take it and i ll step back a little bit in a broader context first as you know we ve acquired avira our number one objective is to scale our cybersafety platform and you re going to see us continue to invest into the freemium model expanding the freemium model to board security expanding to other countries and that s our first point of entry we would love that the five billion internet users are all fully consciously protected from cybercriminality when it comes to then our ongoing prices obviously pricing structure and how do you upsell and move to a premium model have different structure first your price as you know as a promotion to get in the first time you get in and then you have the renewal price at the normal msrp that we have set and then we re tracking the dynamic of cost inflation competition in every country it is a dynamic environment it is a competitive environment and so our pricing philosophy follows the value we provide to the members as we continue to add new product and new value to that membership then customers opt to higher level of membership and that s the whole business model that we have this time hamza fodderwala morgan stanley analyst thank you operator thank you at this time there are no more questions i will turn the call back to vincent pilette ceo for closing remarks vincent pilette chief executive officer why don t we wait one minute to see if there s nobody last time there was no more question we had two minutes later plenty of questions trying to get in so let s check one more time operator if you don t mind operator sure vincent pilette chief executive officer okay well we obviously are always as management very open and available for any questions our investors or analysts would have we ll have plenty of one on one sessions between now and the next few days i do want to thank our shareholders that have overwhelmingly approved the issuance of shares to for the acquisition or the merger with avast we see that as a vote of confidence confidence into our strategy

charaid nó don chomharsain agus an oiread sin cor is féidir leis an gnáthshaol a chur dhe mar sin is maith ann an chosaint shibhialta this estimate is for the sum of 9 652 400 gross and after the deduction of appropriations in aid 9 508 700 net an increase of 660 600 over the net estimate for 1962 63 it will be seen that the increase is largely accounted for by a provision of 273 000 for helicopters and an increased provision of 237 949 for clothing both of which i will be referring to further in the course of my statement deputies will notice that the estimate is presented in a revised format which brings together under single subheads items which were previously scattered over a number of subheads for instance the entire pay of the permanent defence force is now concentrated in one subhead as are also the permanent defence force allowances it is hoped that these changes will make it easier for the house to obtain a picture of the proposed expenditure under the principal broad headings the estimate for the pay of the permanent defence force is as usual based on the full peace establishment of 1 359 officers and 11 607 men with deductions in respect of the numbers by which the actual strength is likely to be below establishment over the year the net average strength for which the estimate provides is 1 148 officers 110 cadets and 7 500 other ranks i think that the house has found it convenient on previous occasions that before proceeding to an analysis of the estimate a reasonably comprehensive survey should be make of the work of the department the defence forces and the civil defence organisation during the previous financial year and i propose therefore to follow that course again on this occasion during the past year the policy of providing a contingent for the united nations force in the congo has been continued by the government we have in the congo at present the 38th battalion and the no 2 armoured car squadron the latter unit consisting of 95 officers and men was the first of its kind to be supplied by this country and is equipped with vehicles provided by the united nations in addition there are some 50 officers and non commissioned officers employed on miscellaneous staff duties mainly at the force headquarters at leopoldville one of these a colonel is chief of staff to the force commander in all a strength of between 800 and 900 officers and men has been maintained in the congo throughout the past year they have upheld the high standard of conduct and efficiency set by our troops in the congo from the outset none of our men was killed in action during the year but i regret that one officer and a non commissioned officer were killed accidentally during december and january last the 38th battalion had a major role in the most recent operations in katanga province their objective was the important town of kipushi which they succeeded in taking virtually without using force the unit suffered only one minor casualty later they established excellent relations with the townspeople the 38th battalion is now located at the important katangan mining centres of kolwezi and jadot ville the prospects of settled conditions in the congo are now better and the united nations is reducing the strength of its force there the next irish battalion and armoured car squadron to go to the congo will be of a reduced total strength of approximately 500 officers and men compared with a total of 800 in the case of the 38th battalion and the no 2 armoured car squadron we shall all welcome the day when the presence of a united nations force in the congo will no longer be necessary in august last we supplied two officers from our congo units to the un military observers in new guinea and we have one officer on duty in palestine i once again wish to thank the individuals and firms who have provided comforts for our troops overseas while the conditions under which the troops now serve in the congo are considerably improved since the early days of the undertaking the additional comforts are a valuable contribution to the welfare and morale of the troops i now leave the realm of overseas commitments and turn to matters closer home but not without expressing appreciation of the continued work of the staffs commands and corps which have succeeded in ensuring despite difficulties that the organisation equipping and training of the units sent to the congo have been maintained at a very high standard and have at the same time despite the absence of so many of our troops overseas carried on the trying and less spectacular home duties and training twenty former non commissioned officers who successfully completed a potential officers course were appointed officers in december to fill appointments as stores officer administrative officer and assistant quartermaster the question of when the next such course will be held is under consideration the naval service continues to be occupied with the demanding problem of fishery protection the service provides on behalf of the department of transport and power a 24 hour service for the receipt and dissemination of marine distress messages and for the co ordination of rescue efforts it also takes part in air sea rescue operations as required within the limit of its resources not alone does the air corps fulfil a military task but it also operates a scheme for the training of pilots for aer lingus this corps is finding great difficulty in obtaining and retaining personnel because of outside competition another feature of the corps activities is aerial photography on behalf of the ordnance survey and a number of government departments and offices the corps will also be responsible for the operation of the helicopter service an fórsa cosanta áitiúil and an slua muiri continue to supply a large proportion of our military force it gives me great pleasure once again to acknowledge the debt we owe to the members of these components of the defence forces for the time and effort which they devote to training and especially for their attendance at the annual summer camps the schemes of training of apprentices in scoil phrintísigh an airm and in the air corps continue upwards of 55 apprentices are appointed as a result of each annual competition for scoil phrintísigh an airm while up to 36 are appointed from each such competition for the air corps training is given by skilled instructors in a wide variety of trades and the trades union organisations have agreed that personnel trained and qualified under the schemes may be accepted as journeymen and on return to civil life admitted as members of the appropriate trade unions in 1962 teams from scoil eachaíochta an airm competed in eight international horse shows dublin london lucerne barcelona harris burg washington new york and toronto at these shows they won seven first seven second and four third prizes teams from an scoil competed also at 17 irish provincial shows it has been decided that teams from an scoil will attend six international shows in 1963 nice rome dublin harrisburg usa new york and toronto this relatively light programme of international shows will enable an scoil to concentrate on training and building up the team four horses for an scoil have been acquired to date in the financial year 1962 63 one at 2 000 two at 650 and one at 495 as deputies will see from the estimates the provision for the purchase of horses in 1963 64 has been increased to 12 000 as against 7 000 in 1962 63 in this connection i would like to correct an impression which appears to be widespread despite a categorical statement to the contrary made by my predecessor on 18th april 1961 when replying to the debate on the 1961 62 estimate namely that there is a specific limit to the amount which may be paid for a horse for an scoil there is in fact no such limit each case is considered on its merits but naturally the horse purchase board considers that it is incumbent on it to buy to the best advantage last year i referred to the arrangements being made for the inclosure of portion of the curragh in accordance with the provisions of the curragh of kildare act 1961 the inclosure was effected in time for the irish derby and as a condition precedent to the inclosure a number of sheep grazing rights commensurate with the area involved were extinguished steps are being taken at present to prepare by laws under the act in relation to the curragh and the management and control of it these by laws will be designed primarily to prevent unauthorised use of the property and to control effectively the exercise of sheep grazing rights returns from the local authorities show that in the course of the past twelve months there has been an over all net increase allowing for wastage of some 3 000 volunteers in the civil defence organisation making the current strength approximately 10 700 i must make special mention of the continued improvement in the position of the warden service county chief wardens have been selected for each county and about two thirds of them have undergone courses in the civil defence school similarly sub county wardens have been selected in all counties and these will be trained on lines similar to the county chief wardens greatest progress has however been made at district warden level for this key appointment some 630 persons are required of these about 560 or 90 per cent of the total have been selected and about 300 have been trained i am happy to say that we have got an excellent response from people who have the qualities of leadership to accept the responsibilities of district warden our volunteers in this field are very representative of various classes and professions in some counties great progress in the training of district wardens is being made by resorting to short full time courses of about a week s duration this arrangement has been found feasible in counties roscommon galway and sligo leitrim with the result that these counties are now well advanced in their district warden organisation other counties have made great progress in their warden training over a period of months the training being carried out locally by specially trained district warden instructors at local level training of members of the rescue welfare casualty and auxiliary fire services continued steadily and there was a marked spread in the number and location of training centres similarly the number of training courses conducted by my department at an scoil cosanta sibhialta during the year also increased in all there were 22 courses in which a total of 609 persons participated the courses could be broadly described as being in two categories those for potential instructors for the local civil defence organisation for the army and the garda and those for the training of the county control element of civil defence in the course of the year ten new fire engines were made available to selected local authorities for the training of the auxiliary fire service these engines also constitute a significant addition to the national stock of firefighting equipment and it is intended to provide a further 15 in the course of the next few years it has always been recognised by my department that a very important contribution to the membership and skill of the casualty service of civil defence could be made by the unit members of cumann croise deirge na héireann the st john ambulance brigade of ireland and the order of malta ambulance corps the existing arrangements for the participation of members of these three societies in civil defence had not proved as satisfactory as was originally hoped and so it was necessary during the year to review these arrangements in conjunction with the joint committee of the three societies following this i had discussions with the heads of the three societies at which substantial agreement was reached on revised measures to govern the co ordination and participation of these organisations in civil defence last year i referred to the question of providing control centres at county and regional levels from surveys and examinations which technical officers of my department have made in a number of counties it appears that contrary to what had been hoped it may be exceedingly difficult to set up control centres in existing public buildings on account of this and other difficulties there has not been the progress in this work that had been expected every effort will be made to achieve the maximum progress in the establishment of these centres in the coming year and the provisions made in the estimate for 1962 63 are being repeated namely 50 000 for grants in respect of county and sub county control centres and 10 000 for regional control centres two of the main activities during the year have been local exercises and local training courses local exercises have shown a considerable increase in numbers and they may be expected to show a further increase during the coming year indeed i may say that such exercises are not only important from the point of view of organisational well being and esprit de corps but they are essential for the development and maintenance of an efficient organisation as far as it was possible i made a point of attending these exercises and courses and other civil defence functions during the year and it was gratifying to me to see that on all occasions members of the oireachtas were taking a keen interest in the development of civil defence their active interest and encouragement can be a very significant factor because the building up in peacetime of an efficient civil defence organisation is as i have said on another occasion uphill work that is sometimes frustrating and unrewarding for those engaged in it be they volunteers or officials turning to the subheads i may commence by observing that a number of them show little change from last year i will confine myself therefore to speaking about those in which there is a substantial variation or in which specific comment would otherwise be helpful to the house in subhead b pay of the permanent defence force provision is made for a somewhat smaller strength than was provided for in 1962 63 and this explains the saving of 14 625 subhead c allowances of the permanent defence force shows an increase of 10 045 this is mainly attributable to increased rates of ration allowance in subhead d which relates to the pay allowances grants and other expenses of the reserve defence force there is an increase of 31 730 in recent years the tendency has been towards better and longer attendances at training and courses particularly on the part of an forsa cosanta áitiúil and this necessitates the increased provision which i have mentioned subhead g civil defence makes provision for 247 391 much the same as the provision for 1962 63 the sum of 91 948 for grants to local authorities includes 50 000 in respect of county and sub county controls to which i have already referred about 18 500 in respect of central and local training about 11 600 in respect of storage servicing and maintenance of equipment and 10 600 in respect of administration the sum of 159 739 for equipment and stores includes 71 600 in respect of warden service equipment 22 600 in respect of auxiliary fire service equipment 20 200 in respect of casualty service equipment 18 300 for uniform clothing for civil defence personnel 14 000 for instructional equipment for the civil defence school and smaller sums for rescue service and welfare service equipment the sum of 21 000 for regional controls etc includes the specific provision of 10 000 in respect of the regional controls which i mentioned earlier 9 000 for certain equipment and 2 000 for national and regional exercises and competitions the provision of 450 000 under subhead h for defensive equipment is the same as that for 1962 63 as i have stated on previous occasions we have not yet built up anything like full mobilisation stocks of defensive equipment and proposed purchases for 1963 64 represent only a further instalment towards this end while we do not spend a lot of money on equipment of this nature i can assure deputies that what we do spend is spent to the very best advantage in the purchase of the most modern and up to date conventional arms available subhead j mechanical transport shows an over all increase of 36 200 as compared with 1962 63 5 000 of which is accounted for by increased vehicle maintenance costs the provision of 116 520 for capital expenditure on vehicles is 31 200 higher than the corresponding provision last year this is due to an increase of 28 000 in the provision for the purchase of new vehicles including 16 800 for artillery prime movers 6 100 for a fire tender and 6 500 for an aircraft refueller and to an increase of 3 200 on advances which will be repaid to officers for the purchase of motor cars for use on duty with an fórsa cosanta áitiúil an slua muiri an cór breathnadóirí and an tseirbhís cosanta sibhialta subhead m clothing and equipment shows an increase of 237 949 as compared with the corresponding provision in 1962 63 the principal reason for this is the proposed purchase at an estimated cost of 200 203 of a relatively small reserve stock of soldiers uniform about two thirds of a normal year s requirements of the principal items this will serve a dual purpose first it will enable essential issues to be made to soldiers as they are required without having to await deliveries against the current year s contracts which are often slow issues which have to be made from the reserve stock will be replaced subsequently from normal annual purchases secondly the reserve stock will help to meet a special need of additional uniform clothing in the event of an emergency subhead o 1 general stores shows a net increase of 21 312 as compared with 1962 63 this is made up of a gross increase of 73 078 under certain headings partially offset by reductions totalling 51 766 under others the largest increases are 44 608 in respect of signal equipment and 21 135 in respect of radiac instruments items which would be particularly useful in maintaining communications and saving life in the event of hostilities involving destruction of telephonic communication and the presence of radio active fall out the decrease under the heading of aircraft is due to the non repetition of a provision of 40 307 made in 1962 63 for a dove aeroplane partially offset by some new increases such as 7 000 for a new link trainer and an additional 6 000 approximately for maintenance as deputies are already aware from the announcement of the minister for transport and power in this house on 22nd january last an rialtas has decided to establish a helicopter service for air sea rescue work and for other emergencies this service will be under the aegis of my department and subhead o 2 of this estimate makes provision in the sum of 273 000 for the purchase during 1963 64 of three helicopters 250 000 additional aviation spirit for their operation 3 000 and special training courses abroad for pilots 20 000 the provision under subhead s buildings is practically the same as that for 1962 63 about threequarters of the total provision is required for the ordinary maintenance of barrack buildings and roads the balance being in respect of miscellaneous new works with regard to soldiers married quarters i might mention that 162 new houses have now been erected in recent years throughout the country a further eight houses are at present in course of erection and are expected to be completed in 1963 64 it is hoped to commence the erection of a further 20 new houses in athlone in replacement of old married quarters which have been condemned and which could not be modernised and it is the intention to continue the policy of supplementing local authorities efforts in the provision of housing by providing from the vote for defence houses for married soldiers at centres throughout the country where the need is greatest from time to time while dealing with this subhead i think i should also mention that some new dining halls and cookhouses for soldiers have been built over the past few years and many of the older type dining halls and cookhouses as well as older type billet rooms which are structurally sound have been modernised considerable progress has also been made in providing modern toilet and ablution facilities in barracks the aim generally being to bring the accommodation for soldiers living in barracks up to modern standards of comfort cleanliness and hygiene it is the intention to continue with this work subhead t at 96 035 shows an increase of 7 405 over the corresponding provision last year the increase is accounted for largely by the necessity for furniture for a new girls school erected at the curragh and for additional bedding under this subhead also attention continues to be given to the improvement of amenities for soldiers living in barracks a programme in this regard which has been pursued for some years past has been speeded up in the last few years the old timber forms and trestle tables used in dining halls are being replaced with modern tubular steel chairs and plastic topped tables and in the billets the floors are being covered with attractive coloured linoleum and steel wardrobes new beds bedside lockers bedside rugs writing tables etc are being provided the increase of 6 473 in subhead u is mainly caused by increased transport charges and that of 15 042 in subhead v is caused by the increased rates of employers contributions provision for cumann croise deirge na héireann to the extent of 23 000 is made under subhead aa it shows an increase of 6 550 compared with 1962 63 this arises from increased expenditure on salaries pensions fund contributions rent rates telephone charges heating lighting travelling costs etc it is necessary therefore to provide for a sum of 13 550 for the normal activities of the society as against 10 000 for this purpose in 1962 63 furthermore it is considered necessary to provide for a grant of 5 000 to the emergency relief fund compared with 2 000 in 1962 63 as there was a considerable amount paid out of this fund in 1962 63 towards relief for victims of natural disasters the provision for the white russian refugees from north china and the state contribution to the international committee remain at 4 000 and 450 respectively the year 1963 is the centenary year of the foundation of the international red cross and it is an interesting coincidence that the irish ratification of the 1949 geneva conventions for the protection of war victims comes into force this year the society in this country is continuing its excellent work in many spheres white russian refugees from north china continue to be maintained at naomh aindrias rathmines and in the field of international emergency relief the society in the course of the past year has contributed over 2 500 for the victims of the iranian earthquake 1 000 for algerian refugees and 500 in connection with the pakistan flood disaster i should like to renew the appeal for help for the freedom from hunger campaign which i made last year and
