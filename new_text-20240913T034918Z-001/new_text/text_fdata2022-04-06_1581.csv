what is musk up to at twitter speculation mounts the tesla boss is plotting a full takeover after buying a 9 2 stake elon musk has wasted no time imposing himself on twitter after becoming its largest shareholder a day after it emerged he had snapped up a 9 2 per cent stake for 2 2billion he was yesterday appointed to the board where he will have influence over strategy and direction musk is a maverick and no stranger to controversy so the shake up at the social media platform over the coming months will be dramatic twitter took the world by storm in 2006 but has since come under criticism for its left leaning politics and banning of political figures bruce daisley a former twitter vice president said twitter has underperformed in the last ten years on price compared with other tech stocks it has left itself open yesterday musk flexed his muscles asking his 80million followers to vote on whether there should be an edit button on the platform much to the dismay of new twitter chief executive parag agrawal almost three quarters of the 3million plus respondents voted yes forcing agrawal to tweet the consequences of this poll will be important please vote carefully an edit button would give users a few seconds in which to change a message something twitter has traditionally been against agrawal welcomed musk to the board but the two have history in december the entrepreneur compared the twitter boss to the former soviet union dictator joseph stalin analysts have speculated that musk might replace him russ shaw founder at tech london advocates said he d need the backing of the board but his first move could be bringing in his own guy what a statement that would be neil wilson of markets believes agrawal who was made chief executive in november is in for a rough ride as musk views himself as the de facto head of the company what is clear is musk already thinks he s running twitter said wilson agrawal is going to have to deal with this debate is raging about where musk will take twitter and he has been fiercely critical of its approach to free speech and even suggested setting up his own platform the view is that musk wants to bring the site back to its early libertarian days there are even suggestions musk might look to lift the ban on donald trump who was kicked off the platform following the capitol riot on 6 january 2021 errol webber who is a republican party candidate in california tweeted time to get this platform back to its former glory step one bring back president trump step two give everyone who has been banned a second chance step three end all forms of political and other censorship musk has described himself as half democrat half republican he is seen by many observers as socially liberal but fiscally conservative publicly smoking marijuana in 2018 and dancing at business events he has previously attacked democrats such as bernie sanders over high tax policies on corporations and wealthy individuals last year musk said he would be moving tesla s headquarters from california to texas citing the lower tax regime he has donated to both the republican and democrat parties shaw said he leans right on many issues especially on taxation twitter is centre left but there ll be a lot of different political views among the top executives at twitter one thing is for sure musk will make his views known he is the largest investor with a 9 2 per cent stake buying around 73 5million shares that have already jumped 800million in value to 3billion after joining the board musk agreed not to increase his stake past 15 per cent until 2024 but tech experts believe his aim is to own it outright wilson said he is annoyed at the twitter algorithms the censorship and he wants to change it he ll make an offer in the next few years interestingly similar to trump musk has a love hate relationship with twitter in 2020 he tweeted that pronouns suck a slight to non binary and trans people who put their pronouns in their twitter bio musician claire boucher better known as grimes who has two children with musk responded i love you but please turn off ur phone i cannot support hate please stop this i know this isn t your heart the pair have since split the south african born father of seven is also locked in a legal battle to free himself from a deal he made with us regulators in 2018 and regain control over his tweets the agreement forces him to have his messages about tesla pre approved by a lawyer to avoid breaking rules around the disclosure of market sensitive information musk had tweeted that he had secured funding to take tesla private at 325 a share and in 2018 he called a british caver who helped rescue trapped thai schoolboys a pedo guy a us jury in 2019 found that musk did not defame caver vernon unsworth how this all ends no one can predict but the next few months are set to be quite a ride dan ives analyst at wedbush said now it s time to get out the popcorn and watch the developments over the coming months with musk on the board

despite the recovery the stock is still down sharply for the year what happened shares of epam systems epam 1 68 a tech company that provides services like product development and digital platform engineering were rebounding in march after a sharp sell off in february in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine about half of epam s employees were located in ukraine belarus and russia making the company particularly vulnerable to the conflict and management pulled its guidance at the end of february due to the impact the stock fell nearly 50 in one day when epam made the announcement however the stock recovered some of those losses in march as tech stocks started to rebound in the second half of the month and investors were hopeful that there could soon be a resolution to the war according to data from s p global market intelligence the stock gained 43 during march as you can see from the chart below much of the gains came on march 16 when the market rallied after the federal reserve raised interest rates so what there was not much company specific news out on epam systems last month but the stock continued to be volatile as investors assessed the impact of the war in ukraine and epam s response in the feb 28 announcement cutting its guidance the company said that it was actively working to relocate its ukrainian employees and their families and it said it was accelerating hiring in areas including central and eastern europe india and latin america on march 4 the company followed up that announcement by saying it would discontinue services to customers located in russia it pledged 100 million in humanitarian support for its ukrainian employees and their families and it said it had ample resources and infrastructure to serve customers the stock fell that day in line with a broader sell off in the market but began recovering the following week and surged 25 on march 16 as the nasdaq jumped nearly 4 a risk on shift in market sentiment after the fed raised rates and hopes for a ceasefire in ukraine helped boost the stock and it tacked on some more gains through the end of the month now what it s unclear what the full effect of the war will be on epam s bottom line but it s important for investors to understand that its customer base is global the issue is that its employees were concentrated in the three participant countries in the war epam appears to be adjusting its operations and the impact of the war should be mitigated if it drags on analysts have cut their estimates expecting earnings per share to be flat this year despite the tech stock s gains in march it s still down 58 year to date meaning the recovery could continue

jack abramoff whose aggressive lobbying activities led to a prison sentence for him and several others and to a re examination of lobbying rules in washington once said what s legal in this system is the problem the real scandal it appears is what is allowed current proposals to require mandatory conversion of ownership of individual stocks into mutual funds are yet another attempt to ratchet up standards of government ethics the stated goal is to prevent insider trading while well intentioned these reforms do not address the most important conflict of interest problems therefore the no individual stock law will be largely symbolic symbolism is important but this reform will also have several collateral effects that could make the situation worse concern that members of congress are using inside information to trade their portfolios is not new in 2012 congress enacted the stop trading on congressional knowledge stock act requiring members of congress to report purchases and sales of securities on a monthly basis this disclosure was supposed to deter such improper trades the statute was a reaction to a story on 60 minutes suggesting that certain members had made unusual profits through stock transactions the story was focused only on congress but the statute was expanded at the last minute to cover senior members of the executive branch then congressman eric cantor argued what s good for the goose is good for the gander and today thousands of reports are filed every year they have apparently been ineffective hence the proposed law to ban individual stock transactions it might as well be called the no stock act could that ban be limited to members of congress the experience of the stock act indicates not in fact senior members of the white house staff are currently subject to such a ban if it does apply to potential nominees then many individuals coming from the private sector to serve in government will decline to do so and perhaps that is a cost that advocates are willing to bear there will also be line drawing problems does the law cover bonds or only equities does it cover private equity funds what about closely held family companies a second effect will be that individuals who do decide to serve will be able to defer tax on all their gain when they re forced to divest all of their individual securities and reinvest in mutual funds in other words the ban will provide a tax benefit gain deferral and risk diversification for which many will be grateful the tax and estate planning opportunities will be welcomed on the other hand the ban would not have any impact on the biggest source of conflicts in washington the revolving door jack abramoff said the best way to get what he wanted to was to offer high ranking congressional aides a job when they left public office once that was done he told cbs we owned them the revolving door phenomenon is an implicit contract the government hires talented individuals from the private sector at lower than market salaries because those individuals can profit from their government experience once they return to industry congress could prohibit its members and staff from working in the private sector but that would limit its personnel to the independently wealthy and retirees if extended to the executive branch such a prohibition would either require substantial increases in federal salaries and lifetime tenure or it would exacerbate the current generational distortion less than 7 of the federal workforce is under the age of 30 because young people can t forgo private sector careers it almost certainly would undercut the quality of the personnel recruited to handle critical governmental functions reforms that would solve the problems of government ethics will always remain elusive the most we can hope is not to make the problems worse robert rizzi is a partner at the law firm of steptoe johnson and for the past 10 years has co taught a course in government ethics at the harvard law school

tesla ceo elon musk now has a 9 stake in twitter and a seat on its corporate board of directors raising questions about how the billionaire business magnate could reshape the social media platform he is now twitter s biggest shareholder and has the ear of top managers does musk have a history with twitter indeed he does musk s 80 5 million twitter followers make him one of the most popular figures on the platform rivaling pop stars like ariana grande and lady gaga but his prolific tweeting sometimes gets him into trouble when for instance he uses it to promote his business ventures rally tesla loyalists question pandemic measures and pick fights with those with whom he disagrees in one famous example musk apologized to a british cave explorer who alleged the tesla ceo had branded him a pedophile by referring to him as pedo guy in an angry and subsequently deleted tweet the explorer filed a defamation suit although a los angeles jury later cleared musk he s also been locked in a long running dispute with the u s securities and exchange commission over his twitter activity musk and tesla in 2018 agreed to pay 40 million in civil fines and for musk to have his tweets approved by a corporate lawyer after he tweeted about having the money to take tesla private at 420 per share which didn t happen but caused tesla s stock price to jump his lawyer has contended that the sec is infringing on musk s free speech rights what does musk plan to do at twitter musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist and has made clear that he doesn t think twitter is living up to free speech principles an opinion shared by followers of donald trump and several right wing political figures who ve had their accounts suspended for violating twitter content rules but what s really driving musk s twitter involvement isn t clear his preoccupations with the service include arguing to make twitter s algorithm viewable by the public widening the availability of verified twitter accounts and blasting a profile photo initiative involving non fungible tokens or nfts musk has also called crypto spam bots which search tweets for cryptocurrency related keywords then pose as customer support to empty user crypto wallets the most annoying problem on twitter we don t know what his goals are said jennifer grygiel a syracuse university communications professor and an expert on social media maybe elon musk secretly wants to blow twitter up maybe he wants to destroy it what can musk actually do as a board member musk s role as both a board member and twitter s largest shareholder certainly gives him an outsized voice in the company s future he s been publicly praised this week by the ceo and other board members a sign that twitter leadership is likely to take his ideas seriously but he s still just one member of a 12 person board that twitter says has an important advisory and feedback role but no responsibility over day to day operations and decisions that means musk won t have the authority to add an edit button or to restore donald trump s suspended account our policy decisions are not determined by the board or shareholders and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions said twitter spokesperson adrian zamora what do shareholders think several wall street analysts said they were encouraged by musk s new role at twitter this is a guy that does push for change that does i think refuse to have failure on his resume a perfect guy you need on the board of directors for them said cfra research analyst angelo zino that s true zino said even if what exactly his ideas are who the heck knows other investors aren t so sure meredith benton founder of the investment consulting firm whistle stop capital has been pushing for shareholders at both twitter and tesla to back stronger policies affecting workplace harassment and discrimination she describes musk s new role as a concerning development for twitter investors especially given accusations by california regulators that tesla has been discriminating against black employees at its san francisco bay area factory twitter s greatest current challenge is to navigate successfully through the societal implications of its platform s use benton said elon musk with his air of reckless bravado presents a risk of undermining thoughtful and strategic management of these topics where is twitter as a company there has been executive turnover since co founder jack dorsey s departure in november left twitter with a new ceo parag agrawal whose initial actions have involved reorganizing divisions wall street analysts had approved of the choice of agrawal as the new leader but there have been no major changes to the platform yet the company has long lagged behind its social media rivals and boasts far fewer users the mere fact of linking musk s high profile name to twitter could get people to spend more time on on the platform and help it make more money zino said calling musk the most important individual at twitter isn t musk a pretty busy guy you wouldn t know it from his prolific posts but he does hold several big roles including ceo and technoking of electric car company tesla and ceo of the rocket company spacex he is also the founder of the boring company an underground tunnel company and neuralink which wants to plant computer chips in people s

composite image with background stock photo overlay stock image of st george police patrol units taken by cody blowers st george news st george officers seized 10 pounds of fentanyl pills during a traffic stop on northbound interstate 15 in st george over the weekend adding to the current surge of the deadly potent drug on saturday an officer noticed a black ford mustang cross over the white fog line adjacent to the right shoulder as the vehicle headed north shortly after 10 p m after following the car for nearly six miles the officer stopped the vehicle at mile marker 7 just south of the st george boulevard exit according to charging documents filed in support of the arrest the officer approached the driver identified as 26 year old deybin y turcios doblado who presented a driver s license issued out of mexico as well as an identified card issued out of utah while running a check on the vehicle the officer was unable to locate any car registered under the vin number provided on the insurance card the driver then provided additional documentation for the newly purchased vehicle even with the additional information the records check found no such vehicle on file when the officer ran a background check on the driver the officer was advised of an active 2 700 warrant for the driver s arrest issued out of midvale justice court by emergency dispatch at that point the driver was handcuffed and detained on the warrant and officers found a pipe and what appeared to be cocaine during a search of doblado s pants pocket prior to transport meanwhile a k 9 unit responded to the traffic stop and conducted a free air sniff around the outside of the vehicle shortly thereafter the report states the animal alerted officers to the possible presence of narcotics a search of the vehicle ensued during which officers reportedly recovered approximately 10 pounds of fentanyl pills marked with an m 30 from the car the estimated street value of the fentanyl seized was roughly 1 5 million the driver was transported to purgatory correctional facility facing second degree felony possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance as well as third degree felony possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person based on the knife the officer reportedly found in the suspect s pocket while the suspect was being processed at the jail the arresting officer was advised by an agent with the department of homeland security that doblado was a citizen of honduras and was in the country illegally the officer also noted that doblado has ties to northern utah and likely would flee to that area if released also noted was the fact the active warrant was connected to a case filed in 2016 and the suspect had failed to appear in court the officer requested a no bail hold on the suspect citing it is highly likely will flee if he is not kept on a very high bail or no bail at all according to the request that was later signed by district judge g michael westfall fentanyl surge with no end in sight since march 3 st george news and cedar city news have reported on multiple traffic stops that combined have led to the recovery of more than 50 pounds of fentanyl the total value of the narcotics recovered is estimated to be more than 6 million at street level pricing a congressional report released in 2018 states the surge of fentanyl is having a dramatic and deadly effect on our communities and stated that battling the surge will take an all hands on deck approach to combat the surge that appears to continue with no end in sight the report states the report also found that the fentanyl crisis is exceptionally dangerous because of its high potency and the speed with which it reaches the brain just 2 milligrams of fentanyl can kill whether swallowed inhaled or absorbed through skin to show how small of an amount two milligrams is a sweetener packet at a restaurant table contains 1 000 milligrams st george police capt jordan minnick who also serves as captain for the washington county drug task force told st george news last month that 40 of all fentanyl pills seized by police are found to contain a lethal dose of the drug which is roughly 2 mg meaning that nearly half of all fentanyl buyers are at risk of overdosing the main component is the enormous profit that can be made which has fueled the surge in the amount of fentanyl entering the united states according to the breakdown as outlined in the report to illustrate a kilogram of heroin costs 80 000 at a distributor level compared with a 5 000 price tag for a kilogram of pure fentanyl the profits come in when the substance is broken down using cutting agents which turns one kilo of pure fentanyl into 16 24 kilograms of cut fentanyl which can then be sold for 80 000 per kilo at the wholesale level multiply that by 20 kilos the midrange and the end product can yield a profit of more than 1 3 million on what was originally a 5 000 investment the problem has only gotten worse in the five years since this report came out according to a 2022 report by the drug enforcement agency released last month which states that last year was an even deadlier year a trend the agency says has been exacerbated by the mexican cartels efforts to turn a quick profit to accomplish this the dea says these groups are using raw dangerous chemicals from china to cheaply manufacture the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl that is then sold to unsuspecting buyers according to a white house report drug overdose deaths have reached a historic high which has left families and communities devastated from the more than 104 000 americans who died from drug overdoses during the 12 month period ending in september 2021 following the arrest on saturday the suspect is scheduled to make an initial appearance in 5th district court on wednesday and remains in custody without bail this report is based on statements from court records police or other responders and may not contain the full scope of findings persons arrested or charged are presumed innocent until found guilty in a court of law or as otherwise decided by a trier of fact copyright st george news

under heavy scrutiny as opponents of the bill say it will harm lgbtq children while texas next legislative session doesn t start until january the issue will be addressed in education committee hearings before then patrick said in a campaign email i will make this law a top priority in the next session he said patrick s office did not immediately respond to a request late monday enforcing florida s law falls to parents much like texas restrictive abortion law senate bill 8 which empowers private citizens to sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy a parent can sue a school district for damages if they believe it has broken the law if they win parents will receive money and recoup attorney fees in florida the law s supporters portrayed it as a way to give more rights to parents gov greg abbott has similarly said parents should have more rights concerning their children s education as he campaigns for a third term val benavidez executive director of the texas freedom network said in a statement to the texas tribune that patrick s promise to bring similar legislation to the state is a stain on texas gender expression by children is not something that is scary or harmful what is scary is that political activists are grasping at power by overstepping into the lives of texas families and education of students benavidez said while politicians use hate speech that is far from center to harm our vulnerable youth we will continue to love our children and make sure that all families are uplifted in public life critics say that the florida measure s intent is to stifle and marginalize lgbtq people and their families a lawsuit filed by lgbtq groups in florida seeks to strike down the law there the lawsuit alleges that the law violates the constitutional rights of free speech equal protection and due process of students and families according to npr florida s law also requires school districts to notify parents about health services offered at the school and the option to decline such services schools must also inform parents of any health related questionnaires or health screening forms that may be given to any kindergarten through third grade student patrick s announcement comes on the heels of a republican led spree to limit what can be taught in schools about race and american history restrict what books about race and sexuality appear on library shelves and criminalize gender affirming health care for transgender children even treatment medical experts support texas republicans are following a national playbook of feeding off conservative parents fears that critical race theory is being taught in public schools and children are being exposed to obscene sexual content critical race theory is the study of how race has influenced not only human behavior but shaped laws and policies and educators say it is not taught in texas public schools as it is mostly a university level subject the gop often misapplies the term to any discussion about race legislation like texas so called critical race theory law and investigations into books about race and sexuality have put added pressure on teachers already feeling burnout caused by the pandemic texas teacher shortage has increased so much that abbott called for the creation of a taskforce that will look to fix the issue but education advocates say that the state s own laws are driving teachers out of the profession and scaring away potential teachers patrick vowed to prioritize texas legislation limiting lessons about lgbtq people in a campaign email monday with the subject i am done with disney patrick denounced the walt disney company for publicly promising to help repeal the controversial florida law after florida gov ron desantis signed the bill into law last week disney published a statement saying the law should have never passed and that the company would support organizations fighting to have it repealed according to a variety article about the company s stance disney s statement comes after employee backlash and a walkout in response to disney ceo bob chapek s initially soft public stance on the bill according to npr these employees called for chapek to better advocate for lgbtq people by publicly condemning the bill refusing funding from lawmakers who support anti lgbtq legislation and donating to organizations fighting for lgbtq rights and causes according to the employees walkout website in his email patrick links to a conservative news website purportedly exposing disney s gay agenda the site includes videos of an internal disney staff meeting held after the don t say gay bill passed in florida obtained by christopher rufo a conservative activist who in 2020 began using the term critical race theory publicly to denounce anti racist education efforts one recording shows a disney employee discussing adding more queer characters into company productions according to national review another shows an employee discussing the removal of gendered terms when greeting guests at disney parks according to fox news for example instead of saying hello ladies and gentlemen boys and girls the park employees may use hello friends or dreamers of all ages in his email patrick calls for parents to boycott disney and stop their children from interacting with disney products lest the company indoctrinate the children of america with their radical woke views he also said he sold his personal disney stock and encouraged his supporters to do the same

clay i wanted to update this story that we talked about yesterday elon musk bought 9 2 of the outstanding shares of twitter he is now by a substantial margin the largest individual shareholder in twitter stock this morning early it was announced that elon musk is now going to be on the board at twitter and this has provoked a pretty scared response from a lot of the twitter blue checks who have been arguing buck for years now what do they say anytime you criticize anything associated with twitter it s a private company if you don t like it leave and also sometimes they ll build on it and say just go ahead and build your own company if you don t like the rules that twitter is arbitrarily applying and oh man buck all of a sudden now that elon musk is stepping in and i hope he s going to be able to lead the charge on twitter being more of a fair place for discussion the marketplace of ideas there are a lot of blue checks who are suddenly troubled by the influence that a billionaire could have on what is allowed to be said in our country buck i have to say i really appreciated and had not heard maybe it was the babylon bee podcast because i know that the head of the babylon bee was in the video but on tucker s show last night which i was checking out the mono of they played video i should say of elon musk explaining wokeness did you see this cause it was one of the best one of the best explanations of wokeness i d ever seen which is people who are vicious and nasty and unkind creating an excuse for themselves and actually an armor of false virtue to go out and be vicious and nasty to other people and bully other people and act like they re the good guys and gals so to speak or whatever to me that is what wokeness is actually it s for people who are emotionally and morally compromised and fragile to run around and attack people and think they re good people for it it s like a lashing out it s a justification for lashing out anyway elon said it it s brilliant it s totally true clay it s almost like this guy is pretty smart chuckles buck pretty smart yeah clay you know my thing buck is i love elon musk right i m a capitalist but for him to think this is just what i love i love the pure balls on the idea of buck hey you know what i think i can send rockets to space better than nasa and he did it to say nothing of anything else that he s accomplished and tesla obviously has changed the dedicate in many ways as it pertains to cars but to look and the most brilliant thing i ever heard elon musk say buck i think this is good advice for anybody out there no matter what you re doing he said there s lots of people trying to get 10 better right if you work at a business every business every year you look at your goals hey let s get 10 better let s refine our profitability let s get 10 better so there s very few people think what can i do in 10 years because everybody has short term horizons and if you truly want to change the world you were talking about this earlier buck how you have to be willing to be a voice in the wilderness in order to challenge the existing dynamic a paradigm shift as it were think about how ballsy you have to be it s everything that represents what america should stand for to think i can build better rocket ships than nasa which has a 60 year head start on me i m gonna sending rocket ships and i m gonna return them and we re gonna do it more affordably than any country in the world has ever managed to do and he did it can spacex buck and he s actually made electric cars that are worth driving laughing clay yes buck is another thing clay yes buck the prius which was a hybrid obviously some of these you know earlier efforts these cars just stunk so there s some prius drivers out there send your hate to me on twitter and i ll still make fun of you for it but it s okay i do think it s the ugliest car design also i ve ever seen in my life but nonetheless i think that elon musk look he s doing here what remember toward the end of the year i played audio on this show of rush reading a twitter thread that i had written in june of 2020 on the air on his show about how a billionaire conservative billionaire basically need to save the country right now clay yeah buck you need to stop writing the occasional check to a boring think tank somewhere they need to actually step in and see where the conversation s happening and help us create the phrase i used was unsinkable aircraft carriers of freedom of speech clay yep buck elon is doing that right now possibly possibly it s earlier we gotta see what he actually does and everything else but he is taking the first steps toward it this could have huge implications even if twitter dials back the wokeness 30 clay i get dinged all the time for mask stuff still to this day i write about masks they say oh this is misleading and they throttle me down five percent of the people that follow me on twitter end up seeing anything that i now and this is what they do clay i ve been arguing for a while buck what s the point having fu money if you aren t willing to say fu buck a lot of people with fu money clay don t because they won t be invited to the country club clay we started this show talking about mitt romney and how much of a coward he is and how he s desperately concerned with what other people think about him maybe i have the wrong genes i don t know buck i really spend almost no time worried about what anybody thinks about me i care what my wife thinks i care what my three kids think they re in the house with me all day long every day i want to be a good partner obviously for the show that we do but i don t care what random people in my city or my state or my country think about me at all i m gonna do what i think is right and i don t really care whether there s people lining up behind me and what i would give credit to elon musk for is to your point buck i think you re a hundred percent right he s one of the few billionaires that seems to legitimately stand on principle over being concerned about what people are saying over his shoulder and even some of the billionaires you re talking about they hide right they hide their money they disguise where it s coming from just own what you believe america s a fabulous place stand up on principle what are you concerned about who cares if people get upset at you buck elon doesn t even just say the country is at stake over some of these issues which is true by the way when you have the deplatforming of a sitting president from the public digital town square the closest thing to a digital town square that exists when you have the suppression during a pandemic of accurate and truthful information like a lot of what we ve been saying here on the show in defiance of the fauciite consensus think of all the lives ruined because we aren t allowed to actually reach the full scope of the internet the way we could have if they hadn t had the suppression in place for two years clay elon says it s not even just america that s at stake it s civilization itself it s western civilization that s at stake over this and he s right i hope he follows through man could be a game changer for the national political conversation and culture clay i want him to walk in like ari on entourage with a paintball gun and just start firing at all the commies inside twitter headquarters

hey there time traveller this article was published 04 04 2022 741 days ago so information in it may no longer be current tesla ceo elon musk now has a 9 stake in twitter and a seat on its corporate board of directors raising questions about how the billionaire business magnate could reshape the social media platform he is now twitter s biggest shareholder and has the ear of top managers does musk have a history with twitter indeed he does musk s 80 5 million twitter followers make him one of the most popular figures on the platform rivaling pop stars like ariana grande and lady gaga but his prolific tweeting sometimes gets him into trouble when for instance he uses it to promote his business ventures rally tesla loyalists question pandemic measures and pick fights with those with whom he disagrees file in this april 26 2017 file photo is a twitter app icon on a mobile phone in philadelphia tesla ceo elon musk now has a 9 stake in twitter and a seat on its corporate board of directors raising questions about how the billionaire business magnate could reshape the social media platform he is now twitter s biggest shareholder and has the ear of top managers ap photo matt rourke file in one famous example musk apologized to a british cave explorer who alleged the tesla ceo had branded him a pedophile by referring to him as pedo guy in an angry and subsequently deleted tweet the explorer filed a defamation suit although a los angeles jury later cleared musk he s also been locked in a long running dispute with the u s securities and exchange commission over his twitter activity musk and tesla in 2018 agreed to pay 40 million in civil fines and for musk to have his tweets approved by a corporate lawyer after he tweeted about having the money to take tesla private at 420 per share which didn t happen but caused tesla s stock price to jump his lawyer has contended that the sec is infringing on musk s free speech rights what does musk plan to do at twitter musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist and has made clear that he doesn t think twitter is living up to free speech principles an opinion shared by followers of donald trump and several right wing political figures who ve had their accounts suspended for violating twitter content rules but what s really driving musk s twitter involvement isn t clear his preoccupations with the service include arguing to make twitter s algorithm viewable by the public widening the availability of verified twitter accounts and blasting a profile photo initiative involving non fungible tokens or nfts musk has also called crypto spam bots which search tweets for cryptocurrency related keywords then pose as customer support to empty user crypto wallets the most annoying problem on twitter we don t know what his goals are said jennifer grygiel a syracuse university communications professor and an expert on social media maybe elon musk secretly wants to blow twitter up maybe he wants to destroy it what can musk actually do as a board member musk s role as both a board member and twitter s largest shareholder certainly gives him an outsized voice in the company s future he s been publicly praised this week by the ceo and other board members a sign that twitter leadership is likely to take his ideas seriously but he s still just one member of a 12 person board that twitter says has an important advisory and feedback role but no responsibility over day to day operations and decisions that means musk won t have the authority to add an edit button or to restore donald trump s suspended account our policy decisions are not determined by the board or shareholders and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions said twitter spokesperson adrian zamora what do shareholders think several wall street analysts said they were encouraged by musk s new role at twitter this is a guy that does push for change that does i think refuse to have failure on his resume a perfect guy you need on the board of directors for them said cfra research analyst angelo zino that s true zino said even if what exactly his ideas are who the heck knows other investors aren t so sure meredith benton founder of the investment consulting firm whistle stop capital has been pushing for shareholders at both twitter and tesla to back stronger policies affecting workplace harassment and discrimination she describes musk s new role as a concerning development for twitter investors especially given accusations by california regulators that tesla has been discriminating against black employees at its san francisco bay area factory twitter s greatest current challenge is to navigate successfully through the societal implications of its platform s use benton said elon musk with his air of reckless bravado presents a risk of undermining thoughtful and strategic management of these topics winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings

been executive turnover since co founder jack dorsey s departure in november left twitter with a new ceo parag agrawal whose initial actions have involved reorganizing divisions wall street analysts had approved of the choice of agrawal as the new leader but there have been no major changes to the platform yet the company has long lagged behind its social media rivals and boasts far fewer users the mere fact of linking musk s high profile name to twitter could get people to spend more time on on the platform and help it make more money zino said calling musk the most important individual at twitter isn t musk a pretty busy guy you wouldn t know it from his prolific posts but he does hold several big roles including ceo and technoking of electric car company tesla and ceo of the rocket

we know from data from science that lead exposure generally happens through household related hazards said carin speidel who manages the state health department s lead services section it s the paint it s the dust it s the soil and it s the older plumbing related state officials aim to remove sources of lead from about 300 homes annually over the next several years speidel said they have 9 million available this year to start the job environmental and children s health advocates say the unprecedented effort to rid an entire city of lead service lines and lead based paint faucet fixtures and contaminated soil will reap dividends for benton harbor residents and the broader public lead is a toxic metal that can cause severe and permanent damage to children s developing brains from learning problems and stunted growth to lifelong behavioral issues studies show spending money to prevent lead exposure saves society money in the long run by avoiding future costs associated with health care and educational needs crime and lost productivity that result from lead poisoning but at an average cost of 30 000 to 40 000 per home ridding homes of lead is a financial impossibility for many michiganders particularly low income residents at a statewide level advocates say michigan s available dollars for home lead abatement are not enough to quickly realize those gains and policy gaps leave michigan residents in the dark about lead hazards in their own homes if the benton harbor program is successful which we think it will be then it s time to make this the standard of care from the u p down to the ohio border said tina wahl environmental health program director with the michigan environmental council in terms of potential public health gains abating in home lead hazards is arguably more crucial than removing lead service lines in a 2017 study the epa estimated that soil and dust which often come from chipping lead paint are the biggest culprits in lead exposure among 1 year olds food was next followed by water available data in berrien county where benton harbor is located is not granular enough to identify the region s leading sources of lead exposure said guy miller acting health officer for the county but in benton harbor with its glut of aging homes built before the u s government banned lead paint in 1978 many homes likely contain plenty of lead fifty five percent of benton harbor homes were built before 1960 statewide the figure is 35 9 percent that s a significant exposure for children miller said especially because children are the ones crawling around on their hands and knees and putting things in their mouth they like the texture they like the feeling and lead paint chips unfortunately taste sweet despite the risks from lead inside homes the state and federal government have dedicated proportionally few public dollars to removing it as compared to the massive recent investments in lead service line removal michigan s just passed 4 7 billion infrastructure spending plan includes 139 million for lead service line replacement statewide plus another 45 million for benton harbor lead lines and 75 million for detroit combined state and federal funding to abate lead in michigan homes by comparison has grown from about a million dollars a year in the 1990s to 35 million today that s enough to abate 900 homes this year seidel said at that rate we re looking at years and years and years of work to eliminate in home lead threats statewide the influx of money for benton harbor comes as regulators respond to a lead in water crisis that has entered its fourth year after community activists and environmental groups complained to the epa last summer that state and local leaders weren t taking the city s water crisis seriously michigan lawmakers and the whitmer administration rushed to eliminate the problem at its source so far construction crews have replaced 862 of the city s estimated 4 363 lead service lines overall michigan has seen vast improvements in childhood lead exposure rates in recent decades as bans on lead in paint 1978 service lines 1986 and gasoline 1996 tamped down key sources of exposure the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels has fallen from nearly a third in 2000 to just 2 4 percent in 2020 but hot spots remain in places with older housing stock where residents are more likely to live in homes with lead paint and draw their water from lead containing service lines urban homes often also have lingering soil contamination from construction industry and the legacy of leaded gasoline michigan s hot spots include grand rapids detroit saginaw and more rural places like the albion and white pigeon areas

denver global grain markets have been managing through a period of extreme price volatility following russia s military invasion of ukraine a situation that has reignited the grain price rally of 2020 21 the black sea region is a major producer and exporter of wheat in addition to being a critically important hub for global agricultural commodity trade regardless of when the war ends its impact on global grain trade will reverberate for some time as markets continually assess real and perceived grain supply shortages and re adjust risk premiums according to a new report from cobank s knowledge exchange the conflict will negatively affect global grain flows for at least two crop years and likely longer we expect a significant tightening in available stocks to use ratios for both corn and wheat said kenneth scott zuckerberg lead grain and farm supply economist with cobank grain prices will remain elevated and volatile for the foreseeable future it s an environment that will require u s grain cooperatives and exporters to maintain high capital levels and excess liquidity to fund operational and risk management activities russia and ukraine account for 14 of global wheat production and 29 of global wheat exports based on trailing five year averages while the two nations produce only 4 of global corn supplies they account for 17 of corn exports the war comes at a particularly tenuous time for ukraine given its normal planting calendar creating a risk for crop production and grain exports from the country reduced current year plantings of corn and wheat in ukraine combined with a smaller winter wheat harvest in july and august are expected to tighten available stocks to use ratios for both commodities zuckerberg added excluding ukraine and china due to its stock reserves held from trade cobank expects that global available stocks to use ratios will fall from 6 6 to 4 0 for corn and from 15 0 to 10 5 for wheat in the near term india europe and australia should be capable of backfilling some of the shortfalls in ukraine wheat exports to the middle east and north africa mena the u s brazil and argentina will likely have the ability to fill the gaps in corn export demand as grain prices rise u s elevators have opportunities to book profits on owned grain inventories purchased at lower cost basis however higher capital will be required for grain purchasing storage and hedging larger multinational grain exporters and traders will also require higher capital levels to fund their operations they will also need to carefully analyze and manage counterparty credit risk given the likely increase of grain trade with emerging market participants the war in ukraine could serve as a food security wake up call to mena countries which depend on grain imports from russia and ukraine should mena diversify its grain export partners north and south america europe and australia stand to benefit
recommended by christopher vecchio cfa get your free gold forecast get my guide there s no two ways about it gold prices outperformed our expectations in q1 22 our rationale for not taking a bullish outlook on gold was and still is well grounded central banks including the federal reserve have begun to winddown pandemic era stimulus efforts with rate hike cycles just getting started at least in the short term a potent catalyst arrived that trumped interest expectations russia s invasion of ukraine with global financial markets upended and commodity supply chains in disarray inflation expectations skyrocketed again instead of rising real yields we saw falling real yields from mid february through the end of march alas with the prospect of a russia ukraine ceasefire gathering steam towards the end of q1 22 it s possible that sanctions against russia are lifted thereby removing pressure on global commodity supply chains in turn inflation expectations could backoff and consistent with the longer term narrative of central banks raising interest rates real yields could start to rise again therein lies the challenge for gold prices in q2 22 unless there is a dramatic escalation in the conflict between russia and ukraine that ensnares the european union and the united states into a protracted dispute the catalyst that drove gold prices higher in recent months is likely to be short lived us real yields prove problematic despite the disruption created by the russian invasion of ukraine the same obstacles remain for gold prices henceforth with central banks acting to tamp down persistently higher realized inflation in the short term longer term inflation expectations should begin to ease back pushing down real yields and thus preventing gold prices from holding onto recent gains gold like other precious metals does not have a dividend yield or coupon thus rising us real yields remain problematic in other words when other assets are offering better risk adjusted returns or more importantly offering tangible cash flows during a time when inflation pressures are raging then assets that don t yield significant returns often fall out of favor gold behaves in effect like a long duration asset as measured by modified duration not macaulay duration a zero coupon bond gold futures vs us treasury nominal chart 1 source bloomberg the facts on the ground haven t changed and will become a greater influence should the russia invasion of ukraine stop monetary easing enacted by central banks and fiscal stimulus provided by governments are now firmly in the rearview mirror a ceasefire between russia and ukraine will relieve pressure in food and energy prices which in turn will help reduce inflation expectations but because of how high inflation readings are in economies like the eu the us and the uk central banks will still raise interest rates aggressively over the course of 2022 source bloomberg it thus stands to reason that rising real rates are a meaningful obstacle for gold prices over the next few months over the past five years gains by us real yields have been generally correlated with losses by gold prices a simple linear regression of the relationship between the weekly price change in gold prices and the weekly basis points change for the us 10 year real yield reveals a correlation of 0 34 as a rule of thumb rising real yields are bad for gold prices barring world war 3 it s difficult to envision how the environment becomes any more appealing for gold prices from a fundamental perspective yes there is chatter about how the eu and us sanctions against russia threaten us dollar hegemony which ultimately may provoke more countries to abandon usd denominated reserves and instead allocate more reserves to gold but that s a longer term story one that won t play out over the next quarter or even year particularly as over 40 of global trade continues to be denominated in usd and another 35 in eur in short gold prices have two likely paths forward sideways as the russian invasion of ukraine continues keeping inflation expectations elevated as central banks raise rates keeping the status quo in real yields or lower as the russian invasion of ukraine ends sinking inflation expectations as central banks raise rates pushing higher real yields
photo the canadian press a processing unit at suncor fort hills facility in fort mcmurray alta on september 10 2018 the canadian press jason franson suncor energy inc is getting out of the wind and solar business even as a new un report on climate change says wind and solar technologies are the two best avenues to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and limit the planet s warming to a critical 1 5c the calgary based energy giant which has been involved in renewable energy production for two decades announced monday its plans to divest its wind and solar assets to focus on hydrogen and renewable fuels instead in 2002 suncor partnered with enbridge to build one of the first renewable energy projects in canada since then suncor has developed eight wind power projects in three provinces saskatchewan alberta and ontario but in a news release the company which has set a goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 said it will sell those assets in order to bring more fit and focus to its portfolio by doing so we use our strengths competitive advantages and resources to drive shareholder returns and value over the long term and help us meet our emissions reduction targets said suncor chief executive mark little in a news release moving forward suncor plans to focus on targeted activities which include partnering with atco ltd on a project to build a hydrogen facility near fort saskatchewan alta the proposed project which was announced last spring and for which the partners expect to make a final investment decision in 2024 could produce more than 300 000 tonnes per year of clean hydrogen suncor said it is also focused on renewable fuel technologies the company is one of the founding investors in lanzajet a technology company that uses ethanol produced from corn or sugar cane as a feedstock to produce sustainable aviation fuel suncor has committed to building and operating a commercial production facility somewhere in north america for lanzajet it has also invested in enerkem inc which operates a plant near edmonton that turns non recyclable non compostable mixed municipal solid waste into cellulosic ethanol a popular biofuel the company said it wants to focus on areas that it believes are complementary to and help decarbonize its base business but greenpeace canada chief energy strategist keith stewart said the timing of suncor s announcement is akin to buying blockbuster stock the day netflix launches an ipo he pointed out that a new report from the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change report released monday identifies wind and solar as the two most essential technologies in the battle against global warming with the greatest potential for delivering the most extensive potential cuts to greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels the ipcc report also stated that the costs of wind solar and battery storage have come down so much in the last decade that the technologies are already commercially viable giving the world an achievable pathway to halve its carbon emissions by 2030 through rapid deployment stewart said hydrogen and biofuel technologies aren t anywhere near as advanced as wind and solar but oil and gas companies like them because they don t require as much change to their business models biofuels for example can be used in existing engines as a top up to regular gasoline and diesel while hydrogen can be delivered in a pipeline just like oil and gas can but that s not the future of energy stewart said the ipcc report was basically flashing a big red strobe light at suncor saying wind and solar are where we need to be investing and they just looked away put on their sunglasses and said no we re sticking with what we know canadian association of petroleum producers board chair and crescent point energy corp chief executive craig bryksa said the ultimate goal of the canadian energy sector is to advance production while reducing its overall emissions intensity some companies choose to do that by producing or purchasing renewable power while others focus on reducing carbon emissions directly from their oil business individual companies make individual decisions there are some other companies within our sector and within our membership that are picking up more renewables bryksa told reporters during the scotiabank capp energy symposium on tuesday but what i would say is the sector as a whole is very very good and very efficient at producing oil and natural gas and we do it in what we believe is the most environmentally friendly fashion that there is suncor said moving forward it will continue to participate in many aspects of the electricity value chain including producing power through its integrated cogeneration operations through power marketing and trading by providing customers with ev charging and potentially procuring renewable power through power purchase agreements monday s announced exit from wind and solar marks suncor s second major asset divestiture announcement in recent months last year the company announced plans to divest its norway exploration and production assets as well as the planned sale of its rosebank interest in u k north sea that disposition process is underway and expected to close later this year

photo the canadian press a processing unit at suncor fort hills facility in fort mcmurray alta on september 10 2018 the canadian press jason franson suncor energy inc is getting out of the wind and solar business even as a new un report on climate change says wind and solar technologies are the two best avenues to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and limit the planet s warming to a critical 1 5c the calgary based energy giant which has been involved in renewable energy production for two decades announced monday its plans to divest its wind and solar assets to focus on hydrogen and renewable fuels instead in 2002 suncor partnered with enbridge to build one of the first renewable energy projects in canada since then suncor has developed eight wind power projects in three provinces saskatchewan alberta and ontario but in a news release the company which has set a goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 said it will sell those assets in order to bring more fit and focus to its portfolio by doing so we use our strengths competitive advantages and resources to drive shareholder returns and value over the long term and help us meet our emissions reduction targets said suncor chief executive mark little in a news release moving forward suncor plans to focus on targeted activities which include partnering with atco ltd on a project to build a hydrogen facility near fort saskatchewan alta the proposed project which was announced last spring and for which the partners expect to make a final investment decision in 2024 could produce more than 300 000 tonnes per year of clean hydrogen suncor said it is also focused on renewable fuel technologies the company is one of the founding investors in lanzajet a technology company that uses ethanol produced from corn or sugar cane as a feedstock to produce sustainable aviation fuel suncor has committed to building and operating a commercial production facility somewhere in north america for lanzajet it has also invested in enerkem inc which operates a plant near edmonton that turns non recyclable non compostable mixed municipal solid waste into cellulosic ethanol a popular biofuel the company said it wants to focus on areas that it believes are complementary to and help decarbonize its base business but greenpeace canada chief energy strategist keith stewart said the timing of suncor s announcement is akin to buying blockbuster stock the day netflix launches an ipo he pointed out that a new report from the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change report released monday identifies wind and solar as the two most essential technologies in the battle against global warming with the greatest potential for delivering the most extensive potential cuts to greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels the ipcc report also stated that the costs of wind solar and battery storage have come down so much in the last decade that the technologies are already commercially viable giving the world an achievable pathway to halve its carbon emissions by 2030 through rapid deployment stewart said hydrogen and biofuel technologies aren t anywhere near as advanced as wind and solar but oil and gas companies like them because they don t require as much change to their business models biofuels for example can be used in existing engines as a top up to regular gasoline and diesel while hydrogen can be delivered in a pipeline just like oil and gas can but that s not the future of energy stewart said the ipcc report was basically flashing a big red strobe light at suncor saying wind and solar are where we need to be investing and they just looked away put on their sunglasses and said no we re sticking with what we know canadian association of petroleum producers board chair and crescent point energy corp chief executive craig bryksa said the ultimate goal of the canadian energy sector is to advance production while reducing its overall emissions intensity some companies choose to do that by producing or purchasing renewable power while others focus on reducing carbon emissions directly from their oil business individual companies make individual decisions there are some other companies within our sector and within our membership that are picking up more renewables bryksa told reporters during the scotiabank capp energy symposium on tuesday but what i would say is the sector as a whole is very very good and very efficient at producing oil and natural gas and we do it in what we believe is the most environmentally friendly fashion that there is suncor said moving forward it will continue to participate in many aspects of the electricity value chain including producing power through its integrated cogeneration operations through power marketing and trading by providing customers with ev charging and potentially procuring renewable power through power purchase agreements monday s announced exit from wind and solar marks suncor s second major asset divestiture announcement in recent months last year the company announced plans to divest its norway exploration and production assets as well as the planned sale of its rosebank interest in u k north sea that disposition process is underway and expected to close later this year

washington after years of mounting concern over the politicization of american finance the banking industry appears to be making a quiet retreat from the culture war trenches not historically known for their social activism prominent bankers had grown more comfortable taking political stands over the past decade since the mid 2010s banks and their ceos have waded into several high profile political fights ranging from firearm financing to immigration policy and climate change but today as several states pursue laws that will limit or ban medical procedures for women and the transgender community crack down on classroom discussion of woke topics like racism and sexuality and enact new restrictions of voting rights few banks or bank advocates have had anything to say supporters of abortion rights rally in new york city in september while some banks took strong positions on social issues in the past the banking industry has been on the sidelines of similar cultural flashpoints in recent years bloomberg news some observers say that a real transition is underway for banks and their relation to social issues julie a hill a professor of law at the university of alabama said that some banks appear more hesitant to issue broad political statements today than they had been even a few years ago there s been something of a shift to instead of saying we support black lives matter or we are concerned about climate change so that they re not completely accused of being hypocrites later they ll instead say we ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars in a black owned bank or we re committed to raising the minimum wage hill said rather than taking a position that is aspirational that they can later then be accused of not living up to hill added they try to roll out specific initiatives that can be judged on their own merits conservatives have long groused that too many large banks have embraced left leaning politics decisions made by some banks to limit business with certain firearm manufacturers or oil and gas firms for instance have resulted in fierce protest from republicans in 2018 one month after citigroup announced new limits on doing business with certain firearm companies former senate banking chair mike crapo r idaho wrote a letter to then ceo michael corbat chastising the bank for trying to cut off financial services for lawful businesses it is deeply concerning to me when large national banks like citigroup which receive significant forms of government support and benefits use their market power to manage social policy by withholding access to credit to customers and companies they disfavor crapo wrote late in the trump administration the acting comptroller of the currency went so far as to introduce and nearly finalize a rulemaking that would have punished large banks that withheld services to politically unpopular industries for nonfinancial reasons citing fossil fuel firms as one of the primary beneficiaries banks have typically defended such moves as either straightforward business decisions or just another form of reputational risk management reputational risk has been loosely defined as the risks that could result from banks decisions that could undercut customer trust whether through a phony accounts scandal or less than savory business partnerships but some political moves made by banks have gone beyond profit based decision making in the wake of george floyd s murder in 2020 many of corporate america s largest banks including jpmorgan chase bank of america wells fargo and citigroup expressed support for the black lives matter movement and unveiled billions in initiatives intended to address the nation s racial wealth gap in another high profile instance bank of america took a stand against republican lawmakers in north carolina in 2016 as they pushed for a bathroom bill which would have banned transgender individuals from using public bathrooms that didn t correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate the pursuit of social laws at the state level hasn t let up since then state legislatures controlled by republicans have introduced hundreds of bills aimed at undercutting socially progressive causes at the expense of marginalized communities across the country and some state legislatures controlled by democrats have pushed almost as hard in affirming progressive stances access to legal abortions is wavering in more than a dozen states today with severe restrictions under consideration by lawmakers in states including texas missouri oklahoma florida idaho and arizona in florida and georgia state lawmakers have received national attention for pushing what activists have labelled don t say gay legislation that would limit discussion of sexuality and gender in grade school classrooms other laws limiting the ability of transgender children to receive gender affirming care treatment supported by the american medical association american psychological association and the american academy of pediatrics have been introduced more than two dozen times in gop controlled legislatures according to a legislative tracker hosted by freedom for all americans a pro lgbtq advocacy group the rush of regressive lawmaking since 2021 was described by the human rights campaign earlier this year as historic for all the wrong reasons in its annual state equality index and some democratic led legislatures are pushing in the opposite direction colorado gov jared polis signed a bill into law on april 4 that affirms a woman s right to an abortion and a similar measure is being considered by maryland s general assembly which holds democratic supermajorities in both chambers but few banks have weighed in on these laws directly citigroup for one announced in mid march that the company would cover any travel costs incurred by employees seeking an abortion and on march 31 a handful of banks signed on to a statement drafted by the human rights campaign and freedom for all americans that condemned anti lgbtq law making across the u s including citi wells fargo bbva pnc and capital one but that limited advocacy appears to be somewhat exceptional among peers even or especially among banks with significant presences in states seeing the bulk of the backlash bank of america with the largest market share of customers deposits in the states of missouri and florida second largest in georgia and third largest in texas has issued no statement on republican anti woke laws the charlotte north carolina company did not respond to a request for comment for this story jpmorgan chase the top depositor holder in arizona and second largest in texas declined a request for comment and both truist the top bank by deposits in georgia and third largest in florida and u s bank the second largest holder of deposits in georgia and third largest in missouri declined to comment blending in with the crowd some observers say that banks face fewer incentives today to react to or push back against republican backlash politics and that public pressure to act while significant has been diffused in part by the piecemeal nature of state lawmaking when we talk about the bathroom bills of 2016 and 2017 compared to now my first response is well they haven t felt that the public pressure that they would be feeling to do something is worth more than the financial benefit they have from doing nothing said mandla deskins an advocacy manager for take on wall street an activist coalition that pushes for financial reform that is the calculation that i would assume banks are always making deskins added because it s not like they have some long standing position against hate others dispute the significance of banks prior political stands particularly when they ve taken place against the backdrop of broader corporate outrage at the peak of the george floyd uprisings lots of banks had their message with the black background and the white text that said that they stand in with black lives but really it was all corporations that were doing that said maurice bp weeks founder and co executive director of the action center on race and the economy it created this level of safety of sort of just blending in with the crowd banks quiet retreat from controversial issues has also been reflected in part in the spending of the american bankers association the industry s leading trade group and one of washington s top political contributors for decades according to the most recent data available from the federal election commission the aba s political action committee otherwise known as bankpac has spent fewer dollars in the 2022 election cycle so far than any comparable period in the previous decade between jan 1 2021 and the end of february 2022 the aba contributed 1 45 million to federal campaigns that s significantly less than what bankpac distributed to political candidates in the same period in the 2020 general election 2 59 million as well as the 2018 midterm s total of 1 58 million 1 65 million in 2016 from the same period none of the aforementioned figures have been adjusted for inflation which has accelerated significantly over the past year on the other hand accountable us a nonpartisan group that tracks political contributions says the aba is the top political contributor to the so called sedition caucus the group of republican lawmakers that voted not to certify the 2020 election even in the direct aftermath of the jan 6 riot inside the u s capitol building the aba has donated more than 327 000 to republicans who voted against the results of a lawful election since jan 1 2021 according to accountable us that figure would represent one fifth of bankpac s overall contribution in the 2022 cycle through the end of february some of the sedition caucus s highest profile members have not received bankpac funds in the current cycle despite previous donations from the trade group including sens ted cruz r tex josh hawley r mo and roger marshall r kansas and reps madison cawthorn r n c paul gosar r ariz and jim jordan r ohio representatives for the aba declined to comment for this story too eager to play regulator there are a number of reasons banks are inching away from social activism stances for one reputational risk has long been among the most nebulous supervisory areas banks are expected to track and its ambiguities have sometimes put financial institutions in the difficult position of managing the competing desires of dozens of stakeholders including investors activists politicians and their own employees the principle of reputational risk management has come under particular scrutiny in the near decade since the launch of operation choke point an obama era initiative that scrutinized banks business dealings with risky industries including firearm companies and payday lenders republicans particularly in congress still invoke operation choke point as evidence that democrats seek to politicize the banking industry and access to credit in general it sensitized voters legal scholars just a whole bunch of different people to this potential use of reputational risk as a tool that arguably goes beyond what it was originally designed to do said brian knight a director of innovation and governance at the mercatus center that growing conservative sensitivity to banks politics has helped fuel laws in republican controlled states punishing financial institutions that may be considering a pullback business with key industries in texas for instance lawmakers now require that banks that underwrite municipal bonds to certify they don t discriminate against firearms manufacturers a similar bill was introduced in arizona in february you re starting to see at the state level more conservative states starting to actually impose commercial penalties on banks that are seen as being too eager to play regulator knight said but there are also significant operational difficulties that emerge any time a bank attempts to change its approach to business in response to shifting political winds it is hard to implement that hill said even if in your heart of hearts you really want to these are behemoth organizations that have contractual commitments that require unwinding they re also behemoth companies that only act through thousands and thousands of employees that all make individual decisions at the same time however progressives say they don t expect or particularly want banks to intervene in politics i m not looking to banks to make change said bp weeks in fact we re often looking at things that banks do as areas where we need to make change part of that has to do with banks traditional relationship to the federal and state governments in general it s very difficult to find an industry that is really so closely linked to lawmakers and policymakers bp weeks said not to excuse our democratic friends but especially on the conservative side they re really really close allies who ultimately make the rules that make jobs leading the financial industry easier he said so i m not really expecting them to call out people by name or making a really strong ask of elected officials
article lt gov dan patrick said monday he will prioritize passing texas legislation that mimics the recently signed florida bill referred to as the don t say gay law that state s controversial law prohibits classroom lessons on sexual orientation or gender identity for kids below the fourth grade or any instruction that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for older students it has come under heavy scrutiny as opponents of the bill say it will harm lgbtq children related what is the don t say gay bill what supporters critics say about florida s house bill 1557 while texas next legislative session doesn t start until january the issue will be addressed in education committee hearings before then patrick said in a campaign email i will make this law a top priority in the next session he said patrick s office did not immediately respond to a request late monday enforcing florida s law falls to parents much like texas restrictive abortion law senate bill 8 which empowers private citizens to sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy related texas abortions fell 60 in 1st month under new limits a parent can sue a school district for damages if they believe it has broken the law if they win parents will receive money and recoup attorney fees in florida the law s supporters portrayed it as a way to give more rights to parents gov greg abbott has similarly said parents should have more rights concerning their children s education as he campaigns for a third term val benavidez executive director of the texas freedom network said in a statement to the texas tribune that patrick s promise to bring similar legislation to the state is a stain on texas gender expression by children is not something that is scary or harmful what is scary is that political activists are grasping at power by overstepping into the lives of texas families and education of students benavidez said while politicians use hate speech that is far from center to harm our vulnerable youth we will continue to love our children and make sure that all families are uplifted in public life critics say that the florida measure s intent is to stifle and marginalize lgbtq people and their families a lawsuit filed by lgbtq groups in florida seeks to strike down the law there the lawsuit alleges that the law violates the constitutional rights of free speech equal protection and due process of students and families according to npr florida s law also requires school districts to notify parents about health services offered at the school and the option to decline such services schools must also inform parents of any health related questionnaires or health screening forms that may be given to any kindergarten through third grade student patrick s announcement comes on the heels of a republican led spree to limit what can be taught in schools about race and american history restrict what books about race and sexuality appear on library shelves and criminalize gender affirming health care for transgender children even treatment medical experts support related legal battle heats up over gender affirming care for texas transgender children texas republicans are following a national playbook of feeding off conservative parents fears that critical race theory is being taught in public schools and children are being exposed to obscene sexual content critical race theory is the study of how race has influenced not only human behavior but shaped laws and policies and educators say it is not taught in texas public schools as it is mostly a university level subject the gop often misapplies the term to any discussion about race legislation like texas so called critical race theory law and investigations into books about race and sexuality have put added pressure on teachers already feeling burnout caused by the pandemic texas teacher shortage has increased so much that abbott called for the creation of a taskforce that will look to fix the issue but education advocates say that the state s own laws are driving teachers out of the profession and scaring away potential teachers related outgoing superintendents say critical race theory is not taught in schools patrick vowed to prioritize texas legislation limiting lessons about lgbtq people in a campaign email monday with the subject i am done with disney patrick denounced the walt disney company for publicly promising to help repeal the controversial florida law after florida gov ron desantis signed the bill into law last week disney published a statement saying the law should have never passed and that the company would support organizations fighting to have it repealed according to a variety article about the company s stance disney s statement comes after employee backlash and a walkout in response to disney ceo bob chapek s initially soft public stance on the bill according to npr these employees called for chapek to better advocate for lgbtq people by publicly condemning the bill refusing funding from lawmakers who support anti lgbtq legislation and donating to organizations fighting for lgbtq rights and causes according to the employees walkout website in his email patrick links to a conservative news website purportedly exposing disney s gay agenda the site includes videos of an internal disney staff meeting held after the don t say gay bill passed in florida obtained by christopher rufo a conservative activist who in 2020 began using the term critical race theory publicly to denounce anti racist education efforts one recording shows a disney employee discussing adding more queer characters into company productions according to national review another shows an employee discussing the removal of gendered terms when greeting guests at disney parks according to fox news for example instead of saying hello ladies and gentlemen boys and girls the park employees may use hello friends or dreamers of all ages related disney no longer saying boys and girls in park greetings to promote gender inclusion in his email patrick calls for parents to boycott disney and stop their children from interacting with disney products lest the company indoctrinate the children of america with their radical woke views he also said he sold his personal disney stock and encouraged his supporters to do

impact by more consultative engagement we spent nearly 1 billion or 1 5 billion a year on acquisitions around cloud digital engineering iot we have aligned m a with 100 per cent digital align by industry or align by geography q cognizant has one of the highest attrition numbers in the industry how are you arresting this there is a war to attract talent and the it services industry is at an elevated level of attrition we are in the same range when compared with our competitors efforts were put around career paths learning development and overhauling the promotion process traditionally promotions were based on tenure but today it is on the role if you are skilled and capable of taking a more senior role with a higher bill rate you would get promoted this creates constant upward mobility in the organisation and avoids going to the outside market as we often had historically last year we invested a lot more in compensation than at any stage in the history of the company and it was much more than the budgeted due to labour market dynamics the spending was in excess of 1 billion q will allowing employees to work from home help you to handle attrition much better employees today have the option of working from home in an office or hybrid environment most of them want a hybrid environment this is very good for cognizant and helps in employing more women this also goes well with our esg commitment q a number of senior people also left cognizant after you joined most of them left in the first 15 months of my joining but the company has been a lot stable in the last 18 months we had promoted many to senior leadership roles seven out of the eight industry leaders in north america are of indian origin and have been with the company for many years while the media has been writing that there was an exodus of senior people the fact is that there have been a lot of internal promotions like ge ibm and hp cognizant has become a sophisticated company with strong leadership practices and the next generation of talent emerging my ambition ahead is that of more promotions within the company and always having external hires is important to continue to have fresh leadership thinking
