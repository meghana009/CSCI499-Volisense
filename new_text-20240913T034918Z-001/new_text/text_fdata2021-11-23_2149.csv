despite seeing the strongest cash flow from operations since the second quarter of 2019 these shale producers capital expenditure was remarkably low reinvestment rates among us shale oil producers hit an all time low in the third quarter of 2021 resulting in a record free cash flow for the quarter and are projected to fall even lower by year end according to a rystad energy analysis the analysis focused on a peer group of 21 public us shale oil producers excluding majors that together account for 40 of the expected 2021 output the peer group s combined reinvestment rate in the third quarter of 2021 was 46 down from 53 over the same period in 2020 and way lower than the historical average of above 130 the reinvestment rate is calculated by comparing shale producers oil and gas capex against their cash flow from operations cfo the cfo of the last quarter was the strongest since the second quarter of 2019 the analysis shows 7 billion in underspending by shale producers over the third quarter of 2021 comparing oil and gas capex with cfo operators managed to slightly increase peer group quarterly capex in this year s third quarter to 5 9 billion up from 5 3 billion in the previous quarter while further increasing cfo to 12 8 billion all but one operator balanced spending in the third quarter of this year reaching a new level of industry wide cash balancing such a low reinvestment rate stands out for shale industry observers especially as the peer group reported a record breaking free cash flow fcf and earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda of 6 billion and 16 billion respectively but it s not the end of the reinvestment slide says alisa lukash vice president for north american shale at rystad energy rystad energy projections show that reinvestment will fall further to 40 in the fourth quarter of 2021 also for the first time since late 2018 the group s combined net debt dropped below the eight year average floor of 52 billion coming in at 51 billion for the third quarter additionally leverage ratios continued their consistent decline in keeping with the past three quarters third quarter results show several large independent operators ramped up spending in line with another financially robust quarter in part due to the strong recovery in west texas intermediate wti crude prices operators as expected started to communicate 7 to 15 cost inflation with much of the impact anticipated to come in early 2022 however this is expected to be absorbed by improved well productivity and capital efficiencies in most cases combined third quarter net income for the peer group amounted to 5 3 billion double the income earned in the second quarter of 2021 and significantly higher than the sizable losses of 6 billion and 2 1 billion in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 respectively ebitda meanwhile recovered to 16 3 billion in this year s third quarter a level not seen historically fcf across the peer group was 5 6 billion a rise of 500 million from the previous quarter and more than double the 2 5 billion seen in last year s final quarter dividend payments jumped by 70 for the peer group in this year s third quarter versus the second quarter in comparison the actual dividend to capex ratio increased to 26 compared to 17 in the preceding quarter further capital spending control by the industry was aimed at deleveraging and garnering stable shareholder support stock buybacks have predominantly been paused as the market recovered naturally with the wti price increase however a few companies clr fang pdce initiated buybacks amounting to 200 million for the first time since late 2018 the peer group dropped combined net debt below the eight year average floor of 52 billion reporting 51 billion for this year s third quarter many operators mentioned revised hedging plans for 2022 due to lower expected leverage both leverage ratios total debt to assets and total debt to equity have consistently declined during the last three quarters despite more robust stock prices driving total equity up in 2021 the decline in leverage ratios has been partly offset by consistent debt issuance flared by merger and acquisition opportunities in the shale sector advertisement by rystad energy for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

christopher rugaber the associated press washington ap president joe biden announced monday he s nominating jerome powell for a second four year term as federal reserve chair endorsing powell s stewardship of the economy through a brutal pandemic recession in which the fed s ultra low rate policies helped bolster confidence and revitalize the job market biden also said he would nominate lael brainard the lone democrat on the fed s board of governors and the preferred alternative to powell among many progressives as vice chair a separate position of vice chair for supervision a bank regulatory post remains vacant along with two other slots on the fed s board those positions will be filled in early december biden said his decision strikes a note of continuity and bipartisanship at a time when surging inflation is burdening households and raising risks to the economy s recovery in backing powell a republican who was first elevated to his post by president donald trump biden brushed aside complaints from progressives that the fed has weakened bank regulation and has been slow to take account of climate change in its supervision of banks if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the federal reserve and i have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that chair powell and dr brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs biden said in a statement in a second term to begin in february powell would face a difficult and high risk balancing act inflation has reached a three decade high causing hardships for millions of families clouding the recovery and undercutting the fed s mandate to keep prices stable but with the economy still 4 million plus jobs shy of its pre pandemic level the fed has yet to meet its other mandate of maximizing employment next year the fed is widely expected to begin raising its benchmark interest rate with financial markets pricing in two increases if the fed moves too slowly to raise rates inflation may accelerate further and force the central bank to take more draconian steps later to rein it in potentially causing a recession yet if the fed hikes rates too quickly it could choke off hiring and the recovery if confirmed powell would remain one of the world s most powerful economic officials by either raising or lowering its short term interest rate the fed seeks to either cool or stimulate growth and hiring and to keep prices stable its efforts to direct the u s economy the largest in the world typically have global consequences the fed s benchmark rate which has been pegged near zero since the pandemic hammered the economy in march 2020 influences a wide range of consumer and business borrowing costs including for mortgages and credit cards the fed also oversees the nation s largest banks powell s renomination must be approved by the senate banking committee and then confirmed by the full senate which is widely expected he has won support from some liberal democrats such as sen sherrod brown of ohio chair of the banking committee and moderate democrats such as jon tester of montana he was also endorsed monday by sen pat toomey r pennsylvania the senior republican on the banking panel and will likely receive widespread support from republicans i look forward to working with powell to stand up to wall street and stand up for workers so that they share in the prosperity they create brown said three democratic senators including sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts have said they will oppose powell s renomination warren called him a dangerous man because of his efforts to loosen bank regulations while sens jeff merkley of oregon and sheldon whitehouse of rhode island said he was insufficiently committed to using the fed s oversight of the financial system to combat climate change biden and his staff have been consulting members of congress on powell s appointment a white house source said insisting on anonymity to discuss private conversations in the administration biden recently met with warren at the white house for her input the source said and the president talked with both brainard and powell on friday wall street cheered the renomination with stock prices rallying and measures of fear in the market easing immediately after the announcement the s p 500 is on pace to close at another record powell a 68 year old lawyer by training was nominated for the fed s board of governors in 2011 by president barack obama after a lucrative career in private equity and having served in a number of federal government roles unlike his three immediate predecessors powell lacks a ph d in economics yet he has earned generally high marks for managing perhaps the most important financial position in the world especially in his response to the coronavirus induced recession still this year s spike in inflation has forced the powell fed to dial back its economic stimulus sooner than it had envisioned at its latest meeting in early november the central bank said it would start reducing this month its 120 billion monthly bond purchases and likely end them by mid 2022 those purchases have been intended to keep longer term borrowing costs low to spur borrowing and spending powell has avoided much of the blame for inflation at least on capitol hill even though one of the fed s mandates is to maintain stable prices through its control of interest rates republicans in congress have instead pointed to biden s economic policies as the main culprit most economists blame a surge in demand for goods like cars furniture and appliances along with supply shortages for pushing up prices for months powell characterized inflation as transitory but more recently the fed chair conceded that higher prices have persisted longer than he had expected at a news conference this month powell acknowledged that high inflation could last into late summer 2022 brainard s elevation to the fed s no 2 position follows the key role she played in the fed s emergency response to the pandemic recession she is part of a troika of top policymakers that includes powell and richard clarida whom she will replace as vice chair in february brainard was also an architect of the fed s new policy framework adopted in august 2020 under which it said it would no longer raise rates simply because the unemployment rate had fallen to a low level that could spur inflation instead the fed said it would await actual evidence that prices are rising that reflects a view among some fed officials that low unemployment and even rising wages no longer necessarily accelerate inflation yet that new policy approach which was crafted in an atmosphere of persistently low inflation has come under heavy pressure brainard also played a key role in the fed s re definition of its maximum employment goal as broad and inclusive that means it now takes into account such measures as the unemployment rate for african americans and not just for americans as a whole in its policy decisions she has also carved out a distinct role as an opponent of the fed s moves in the past four years to loosen banking regulations that had been tightened after the 2008 financial crisis since 2018 she has been the lone dissenter on 20 votes related to financial rules in march 2020 for example she opposed a regulatory change that she said would reduce the amount of reserve s large banks were required to hold to guard against losses brainard also has taken a leading role in assessing how the fed could more directly take account of climate change in its supervision of banks in a speech last month brainard said the fed would likely provide guidance to the banks it supervises on how they can better assess the risks that climate change poses to their loan portfolios though she did not provide a timeline many environmental groups say loans to oil and gas companies as well as to commercial real estate developers could default and cause large losses at banks should environmental damage worsen or renewable energy provide a greater share of power generation climate change she said is projected to have profound effects on the economy and the financial system and it is already inflicting damage associated press writer josh boak contributed

when italy s new populist government formed by the far right lega nord and the far left cinque stelle came into being at the end of last may it was an important date in the history of the euro it is the day when the unthinkable happened the myth of the unbreakable nature of the common currency collapsed for the first time markets speculated openly that italy could exit the monetary union this had previously been considered only a very remote possibility accordingly the yields on italian government bonds shot up within a few hours with 10 year maturities above 3 professor john burton of leeds university stated that this was not just an industrial accident it is rather the beginning of a new era perhaps the best way to put it is that trumpism has come to europe the united states president donald trump stands for a populist economic policy he questions everything he does not abide by the rules he also feels no longer bound by long standing alliances he cherishes the fact that he is unpredictable in his actions now it is clear that this playing out in europe for the first time to a greater extent all of a sudden the pro european orientation of italian politics above all the affiliation to the euro is under serious doubt according to professor john burton the same applies to the maastricht treaty which prioritizes price stability and sound public finances italy s apparent turn is all the more stunning indeed self defeating as the country has made extraordinary efforts in recent years it managed to reduce the public budget deficit to below 3pct and to achieve a current account surplus now one could say that the lega cinque stelle coalition government of italy plans are all unreal and should not be taken so seriously professor william welsh of michigan university argued that after all according to surveys the italian population is still in favor of the euro however because the current ruling parties as in the case of the american president are democratically legitimized this changes the equation considerably true they may change their opinion over time according to professor william welsh there may also be new elections however as long as that is not the case it is acceptable the way it is professor william welsh further noted that from now on europeans from the european union member countries will no longer live in the orderly world of the maastricht treaties but in the world of a populist monetary union if they will the euro and european banks are becoming more vulnerable to crises of confidence and international capital movements the advantage of the euro over the former fixed income system of bretton woods is gone the new populism in the european union will have rather direct effects on interest rates in the euro area one could even speak of a direct populism penalty research studies indicated the fact that before monetary union italy s interest rates were very high they were one of the reasons why italy joined the euro then after the introduction of the common currency there was almost complete synchronization of interest rates the spread was minimal indeed it was far too low and did not sufficiently reflect the risk differences in this respect everyone was happy that the spreads rose again after the financial crisis 2008 2009 now comes a new phase the spread now shows not only the different economic conditions but also the degree of populism in the individual countries this means that the greater the likelihood that a country will not stick to the rules or question the euro the higher the spread beyond italy this also applies to other countries if and when populism takes hold there

or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story washington u s president joe biden on monday nominated federal reserve chair jerome powell for a second four year term positioning the former investment banker to continue the most consequential revamp of monetary policy since the 1970s and finish guiding the economy out of the pandemic crisis lael brainard the federal reserve board member who was the other top candidate for the job will be vice chair the white house said combined the nominations pair two monetary policy veterans and collaborators on a recent overhaul of fed policy which shifted the emphasis to jobs from the preeminent focus on inflation established some four decades ago to keep u s job growth underway while also ensuring recent strong inflation doesn t become entrenched biden a democrat credited his own economic agenda and the decisive action that the federal reserve has taken for helping to get americans back to work over the last 10 months during the pandemic powell 68 and brainard 59 will both need to be confirmed in their fed leadership roles by the senate currently controlled by biden s democratic party but closely divided the president has for now left open several other fed positions including that of vice chair for supervision that he may fill as soon as next month and that could be used to toughen bank regulation improve diversity and make other changes his supporters have urged for the fed but for the fed s core monetary policy managing inflation and setting interest rates as the economy reopens from the pandemic biden opted for continuity they are veterans and mature public servants and there has been very little difference between them on monetary policy said adam posen president of the peterson institute for international economics together powell a moderate republican and brainard who served in prior democratic administrations gives potentially non partisan credibility to a more realistic assessment of inflation risks the united states faces that reassessment could mean interest rate increases coming sooner than later if inflation proves more persistent than expected u s stocks hit record highs after the news treasury bond yields also rose and the dollar strengthened powell s reappointment had been encouraged by a cross section of investors and economists with both conservative and liberal leanings federal reserve board governor lael brainard speaks at the john f kennedy school of government at harvard university in cambridge mass on march 1 2017 president joe biden on monday nominated brainard to serve as vice chair photo brian snyder reuters the fed s aggressive actions at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 were hailed as staving off a potential depression later some lauded his focus on jobs in the new policy framework launched just over a year ago and others argued it would be too risky to oust the fed chair during a sensitive transition from the emergency measures taken during the health crisis a recent run of inflation has added to the uncertainty and the political risks that the white house might have taken on in switching gears we need stability and independence at the federal reserve and i have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that chair powell and dr brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs biden said in a statement the current recovery has produced risks of persistent inflation even with 4 2 million jobs still missing because of the pandemic a potential conflict between the fed s twin goals of maintaining maximum employment and stable prices chance to cement a legacy powell s second term would begin in early february and the coming months will be crucial in determining whether his legacy will be as the fed chair who elevated employment to the center of fed policy or as the one who let inflation surge and reestablish itself as a chronic problem powell who joined the fed as a governor in 2012 did not anticipate being named chair when donald trump was elected with a pre fed career that had included eight years as a partner at the carlyle group one of the world s largest private equity firms and no formal economics training he had instead eyed the vice chair for supervision position eventually filled by randal quarles he was confirmed as fed chair on an 84 13 vote with warren and kamala harris now biden s vice president among those opposing him he soon ran afoul of trump who hurled unprecedented public broadsides against powell over twitter and in frequent media appearances at one point trump labeled powell an enemy of the united states for raising interest rates and explored whether he could fire him powell not only survived but arguably grew in the job initially hawkish as a governor upon assuming the helm for u s monetary policy he considered himself a student at first paying particular attention to arguments over whether the fed s focus on inflation had disadvantaged workers the years since the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis had convinced many that was the case in november 2018 powell launched a policy review that culminated in august 2020 with the adoption of an approach allowing economic expansions to run longer and hotter with temporarily higher rates of inflation ideally that would lead to job gains that reach broadly into society and narrow the gaps in unemployment among different demographic groups it was an approach that conformed to what seemed then to be the changing nature of the u s economy with embedded low inflation and low interest rates and adapted as well to the demands of a pandemic crisis that threatened a permanent hole in the u s job market just over a year into that new approach however inflation is running at levels not seen in decades as resurgent demand for goods and services outstrips the supply of materials and labor in an economy still shaking off the rust of pandemic shutdowns the new leadership team faces some very tough calls in the period ahead wrote evercore isi vice chair krishna guha

municipals were lightly traded and outperformed a large sell off in u s treasuries while equities were mixed following president biden s decision to renominate jerome powell as federal reserve chairman since powell is seen as slightly less dovish than brainard more rate hikes and more immediacy of those hikes is making its way into the yield curve said jake remley senior portfolio manager at institutional investment manager income research and management while rising rates will hurt bonds mark to market higher yields both nominal and real will attract new capital into the asset class triple a benchmark scales were mostly left unchanged save for a basis point cut in spots on some yield curves the ust 2 and 5 year hit year highs at 0 59 and 1 313 with the 10 20 and 30 year yields climbing seven to eight basis points from friday ratios fell as a result with the municipal to treasury ratios at 47 in five years at 67 in 10 years and 78 in 30 years according to refinitiv mmd s 3 p m read ice data services had the five year at 47 the 10 at 70 and the 30 at 79 the upcoming december 1 coupon payments should make secondary offerings look attractive according to a nuveen market comment inflation had been dismissed as transitory until now but the new buzzword for inflation is sticky we expect prices will remain range bound through the end of this calendar year but in 2022 the fed must show it is committed to snuffing out inflation nuveen said otherwise rates may begin to increase we expect municipal bonds to remain well bid through the rest of this year the market survived the outsized new issue supply and now we await the dec 1 and jan 1 coupon payments this week will be mostly about secondary flows given that the majority of larger issuance was advanced earlier in the month said kim olsan senior vice president at fhn financial with just a few remaining weeks in the year the market will be more focused on fundamentals as planning for 2022 begins she said olsan outlined various factors the market faces including redemptions fund flows and bids wanted secondary volumes which she said will be the primary focus december estimates for calls and maturities total 32 billion about 10 less than this year s average monthly volume in the months when the redemption figure reached 35 billion or more june july and august generic index performance reached an aggregate 0 70 she said a usual two to three week lull in supply at year end and into early january can create a strong december return the caveat is in those years when a tangential event occurred election 2016 legislation 2017 or credit 2010 at the turn of the year to throw caution into the mix she said with the build back better plan set to go to the senate for debate any resolution that involves a change in tax rates would have likely consequences for the market fund flows have seen an uptick in november historically she said during the fourth quarter the weekly average has fallen to about 622 million the inherent demand built into the tax exempt side of the market that originates from mutual funds is an integral piece to the balance of supply and demand however recent performance in the ust market is indicative of an increase in taxable muni issuance i e refundings and a potential drop in tax exempt new money financings she said if that trend develops fund flows could be held to smaller totals and not negatively impact generic rates the interplay of higher selling into year end and absorption levels has a direct bearing on yield direction olsan said daily bid list figures have grown 13 this month from the 2021 average and current secondary offering totals are running about 10 above the yearly number she said a corollary number is dealer inventory carry which has also increased by 37 from the prior 10 months level 13 billion as nov 10 just how much supply develops during december will have a direct bearing on these metrics and ultimately yield direction one aspect to higher current rates is that issuance from january february and july august of this year would suggest tax loss swap opportunities secondary trading washington suburban sanitation district 5s of

establishes continuity for now although the likelihood is the fed will become more dovish as president biden fills vacant seats on the board the most significant impact from today s announcement in our view comes from the likely loss of governor clarida from the fomc who is one of only two career economists along with chris waller on the board said wilmington trust economist luke tilley the loss of clarida elevation of brainard and three open seats for biden to fill likely tilts slightly dovish for monetary policy in 2022 he continued and with clarida gone it probably elevates the voices of waller the board staff and reserve bank presidents on the fomc while formally brainard s only responsibility as vice chair is to fill in if powell is absent informally the position likely carries some weight and stature with the staff of the board and members of the fomc tilley said this was the right move said john luke tyner fixed income analyst at aptus capital advisors markets made their statement of wanting to see the fed do its job i e focusing on addressing monetary policy employment and inflation rather than political agendas such as climate change and income inequality with powell remaining in charge data will determine the pace of taper he said with a speed up if inflation remains elevated and liftoff in june the market believes this action will keep the fed in control of inflation tyner said while the market is expecting a more hawkish response to current inflation time will tell if it will be enough as powell is well established in the dovish camp of fomc policy but more aggressive progressives could be chosen for the three open seats he said john farawell manager of municipal trading at roosevelt cross said the choice seems prudent with the current economic challenges of surging inflation supply chain backups worker participation and recent covid resurgence in europe the financial market s reaction suggested their approval he said with powell and brainard likely to win senate confirmation jordan jackson global market strategist at j p morgan asset management said this removes a layer of uncertainty at a time when the fed is just beginning to normalize policy and while markets cheered the president s decision jackson said given it seemingly preserves the status quo however it should be recognized that fed leadership is still likely to be reshaped in the next year nominees are expected to push diversity and tougher bank regulation he said as a result we would expect the yield curve to steepen as rate hikes are pushed out with that said policy is arguably already too dovish and it s highly unlikely the committee will deviate from its tapering timeline outlined at its last policy meeting with the market focused on inflation brainard would have been more difficult for the market to digest as chair said jeff klingelhofer co head of investments thornburg investment management her appointment to vice chair offers democrats a ballast to powell and a likely regulatory win the two nominations morgan stanley researchers said provides like minded leadership over the next four years biden plans to name nominees for the vacant spots in december turnover at the board of governors will also be matched with a reshuffling of fomc voters and regional fed presidents such as with the incoming leadership replacements at the dallas and boston fed morgan stanley said in all we expect fomc voters to skew more dovish in 2022 they said taper should continue on schedule with a ramp up if needed they see liftoff in the first quarter of 2023 norbert michel cato vice president and director of the center for monetary and financial alternatives said it wouldn t have mattered which of those two biden chose to lead the fed the fed moves slowly and deliberately rarely changing course without broad agreement among the board and the rest of the open market committee any impact of choosing powell over brainard is likely in the field of climate change he said but it s not as though the choice of powell over brainard will stop the fed from pursuing this approach the market will need to decide how these and other changes will alter the taper and liftoff said phil orlando chief equity market strategist at federated hermes given the surge in sustainable inflation will the new board follow through on the old fed s policy decision to taper bond buying now and eventually raise interest rates or will they allow the fed to get further behind the inflation curve which may require a potentially more draconian volckeresque policy response somewhere down the road to get the raging inflation genie back in the bottle in data released monday existing home sales grew 0 8 in october to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 34

elon musk threatens to give jp morgan a one star review on yelp if they don t withdraw lawsuit against tesla claiming the ev manufacturer owes them 162m elon musk was sued by jpmorgan last week over his 2018 tweets about taking tesla private which caused intense volatility on the share price the bank had an agreement over warrants which give the holder the right to buy a company s stock at a set strike price and date they accuse musk of violating the terms of their agreement with the pricing of the shares after his tweets on monday musk responded to jpmorgan s suit telling the wall street journal he would give the bank a one star review on yelp musk in october 2020 fired his pr team and now responds directly to requests for comment when contacted by vanity fair for an article last year he replied to the journalist vanity fair sucks and made sure the quote was attributable to him elon musk has threatened to give jpmorgan a one star review on yelp unless the bank withdraw a 162 million lawsuit against him accusing him of violating their agreements with his erratic and provocative tweets musk and jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon have been feuding for years but the fight recently became public after the bank filed a lawsuit against tesla claiming it owes 162 million from a trade they helped arrange in 2014 we have provided tesla multiple opportunities to fulfill its contractual obligations so it is unfortunate that they have forced this issue into litigation jpmorgan told the wall street journal last week musk fired back threatening if jpm doesn t withdraw their lawsuit i will give them a one star review on yelp this is my final warning elon musk the head of tesla has clashed repeatedly with the chief executive of jpmorgan jamie dimon jamie dimon 65 is said to have decided that dealing with tesla is more trouble than it is worth according to a report on monday the south african born billionaire added on sunday night i aspire to comedy it is unusual for a major wall street bank to sue such a high profile client although jpmorgan has done relatively little business with the electric carmaker over the past seven years according to tesla s filings and refinitiv data the bank accused the electric car company of flagrantly breaching a contract the two corporate giants agreed in 2014 relating to warrants tesla sold to the bank warrants give the holder the right to buy a company s stock at a set strike price and date the suit filed in a manhattan federal court centers on a dispute over how jpmorgan re priced its tesla warrants as a result of musk s notorious 2018 tweet that he was considering taking the carmaker private according to the complaint tesla in 2014 sold warrants to jpmorgan that would pay off if their strike price was below tesla s share price when the warrants expired in june and july 2021 jpmorgan said the warrants contained standard provisions that allowed it to adjust their price to protect both parties against the economic effects of significant corporate transactions involving tesla such as an announcement the company was going private dimon who has headed the largest bank in the u s since 2005 has been unimpressed by musk s antics the mercurial musk fired his press team in october 2020 and now deals with the media himself tesla s share price rose approximately 10 fold by the time the warrants expired this year and jpmorgan said this required tesla under its contract to hand over shares of its stock or cash the bank said tesla s failure to do that amounted to a default though jpmorgan s adjustments were appropriate and contractually required the complaint said tesla has flagrantly ignored its clear contractual obligation to pay jpmorgan in full the bank said tesla in february 2019 complained that the bank s adjustments were an opportunistic attempt to take advantage of changes in volatility in tesla s stock but did not challenge the underlying calculations jpmorgan said musk who turned 50 in june has gradually become more and more unhinged since the summer of 2018 what tesla staffers call the summer of 420 when he tweeted about taking his company private with no real information about it smoked a joint on the joe rogan podcast and called a british diver who rescued thai school boys from a cave a pedo on november 6 musk asked his 60 million twitter followers if he should sell some of his tesla stock much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance so i propose selling 10 of my stock he wrote according to musk 58 per cent of those who responded said yes musk also conceded his wealth is tied up in stock tweeting that he doesn t get a cash salary or bonus from anywhere i have only stock thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock he wrote his erratic behavior has staff so worried that they wake up in the morning and check his twitter to see if anything he may have posted overnight can damage his companies according to one former staffer quoted by vanity fair in an article in november 2020 we all wake up and look at it every day thinking oh god now what you really had no idea what you were going to see the anonymous staffer said elon musk at the tesla factory in berlin on september 3 2020 while they all hail him as a genius his unhinged behavior over the last year has revealed to the public a side of him they claim they always knew about the thing about elon is that right now everyone else is finally seeing the way he has always been he s being the same elon he has always been in private he s just being elon a lot more publicly a former tesla employee said on the launch days at spacex his rocket company they say they worry about whether or not a mission is successful because it will impact his mood other sources described his behavior as degenerate one example was that he was angry that a girlfriend had tiny hairs on her face and asked her why as they were leaving a nightclub musk was reportedly angry because the bright lights of the club s awning made the hair more visible when he asked her why she had hairs on her face she replied because i m a mammal which the source said enraged him there is a high level of degenerate behavior with elon there s a paranoia are you with me or against me i genuinely want to leave the room sometimes when he walks in the person said musk appeared on rogan s podcast in 2018 and smoked marijuana that same summer he tweeted he was taking tesla private at 420 a share a reference to marijuana musk also tweeted that summer calling a british diver a pedo guy he went on to say that musk was similar to zuck facebook s mark zuckerberg and others all of these guys i ve spent time with them musk zuck all of them they all exhibit tendencies of total and complete pathological sociopathy they don t at their core give a flying f k about you or me as individuals musk has fired the pr teams he works with in october 2020 and now represents himself in the media when contacted by vanity fair for their piece he replied to the journalist vanity fair sucks and made sure the quote was attributable to him elon is his own communications director now one person said musk turned on the media in november 2019 after defending himself at trial against british diver vernon unsworth who he called a pedo the trial revealed the extreme lengths musk went to to prove his claims after tweeting it without evidence he hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on unsworth and sought to find some proof that he was an unsavory character he also tried to tell journalists about unsworth but in an off the record capacity when a buzzfeed journalist published his comments he was furious advertisement after the trial he started blocking journalists on twitter a judge sided with musk

the lithium stock continues to face the heat from a short seller what happened standard lithium sli 6 50 continued its rocky ride crashing on monday after a choppy last week as of 2 30 p m et nov 22 standard lithium stock was trading down 10 as the spat between the company and a short seller got even uglier so what on nov 18 blue orca announced it was short standard lithium stock and went on to release a short seller report containing some nerve wracking points against the company standard lithium was quick to respond and refuted most of blue orca s claims the very next day helping the lithium stock rebound after its sharp drop following blue orca s report blue orca is back at it again through a series of tweets on nov 22 it claimed standard lithium not only failed to address the firm s investment thesis in its response but also contradicted its own previous disclosures for example in response to blue orca s claims that standard lithium s regulatory filings with the arkansas oil and gas commission aogc revealed only a fraction of its claimed recovery rate of 90 at its demonstration plant in south arkansas standard lithium said it reported only the volumes stored at site as per aogc requirements and not necessarily the volumes it recovered blue orca dismissed the explanation today as nonsense saying aogc asks for separate reporting of output and stored lithium moreover standard lithium said it only reported the stored portion but was continuously sending lithium chloride solution for reinjection into the brine formation again blue orca rebuffed the claim 3 the aogc permit which any investor can review plainly requires the reporting of output of lithium chloride and carbonate in a separate category 2 c from the volumes stored onsite 2 e the data we used 2 c is plainly labelled as the output data pic twitter com covdboqwty blue orca capital blueorcainvest november 22 2021 blue orca also questioned standard lithium s silence on a couple of other points it raised in its report including the reasons its demonstration plant was operating below nameplate capacity despite standard lithium s claim to have produced large volumes of lithium and why it claimed to have reached proof of concept when a key partner germany based lanxess hinted otherwise now what there s some merit in blue orca s arguments especially the last point as i also recently pointed out hitting proof of concept would pave the way for standard lithium to raise funds from lanxess to construct its first commercial plant but while standard lithium claimed to have completed proof of concept in december 2020 lanxess stated during its earnings call in august 2021 that it will inject money only once the proof of concept from its perspective is fully there in all aspects so how far has standard lithium actually come in the research and testing of its brine to lithium technology and more importantly when can it prove its commercial viability unless standard lithium can come up with a clearer picture of its business potential to persuade investors the stock could remain volatile especially when investors have the option to look at other lithium stocks already exploiting opportunities in the ev industry to full potential

after a rocky few months in which president biden sometimes seemed captive of the progressive wing of his own party he took a solid step back toward the center monday in renominating jerome h powell as federal reserve chair the decision to retain powell a republican and appoint democrat lael brainard powell s chief rival for the top job as vice chair could refurbish biden s basic promise to make orderly government work again despite the intensely partisan era it was as a senior white house official put it to me shortly after the announcement a very joe biden decision biden s tweet announcing his choice had a pragmatic down the middle tone america needs steady independent and effective leadership at the federal reserve the senior white house official explained the powell choice this way at a time of churn and unease about the economy stable and steady seemed like a good way to go so keep powell in his seat and keep lael as the leading democrat on the fed the fed decision this biden insider continued offered a bipartisan set of picks to try to advance the idea that not everything in america should be a partisan throwdown advertisement powell isn t perfect he badly underestimated the inflationary impact of the more than 5 trillion in stimulus spending in 2020 and 2021 to deal with the pandemic but he has demonstrated the two qualities most essential in a fed chair he creatively used the central bank s powers to maintain liquidity in global financial markets during the first crisis months of covid 19 and he defied political pressure by president donald trump who had appointed him in 2017 to cut interest rates to help trump s electoral prospects follow this author david ignatius s opinions follow the noisiest clamor against powell had come from the left led by sen elizabeth warren d mass who called him a dangerous man in september and said she would oppose his renomination warren reiterated monday that she would vote against him biden talked with republican senators before announcing the powell choice and presumably has enough votes to confirm him even if warren defects powell is a double edged sword for the white house he s respected on wall street and the benchmark standard poor s 500 index initially rose after news of his nomination though it closed down slightly for the day but in a second term at the fed he must check the inflationary pressures that built during his first term that could lead to a gradual monetary tightening that by 2023 may slow the economy s growth advertisement former treasury secretary lawrence h summers who has been warning for months that inflationary pressures weren t as transitory as powell predicted appeared content with biden s decision the institution is in good hands he said in a tweet brainard a former undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs and a fed governor since 2014 is respected by moderates and progressives alike powell will guide monetary policy with his eye on the fed s core targets employment and inflation but he had assured biden that he would be more attentive to climate change in making monetary policy and that he would delegate broad supervisory powers to the person chosen as vice chair for supervision both moves will appeal to liberal democrats powell s renomination is a rare setback for warren in financial oversight since biden s election she has helped place progressive allies in key sub cabinet and regulatory posts and derailed the chances of those she regarded as overly friendly to wall street advertisement for example biden initially favored michael barr an aide to former treasury secretary tim geithner as comptroller of the currency when warren and other progressives objected biden instead nominated saule omarova a vocal critic of wall street whose confirmation is in jeopardy warren has also said she has very serious problems with neil macbride biden s nominee for treasury general counsel who has represented exxon and other corporate clients biden s fed decision came after months of haggling with progressives over his 1 2 trillion infrastructure bill and his 1 9 trillion build back better social spending bill protracted bickering over that package was accompanied by a sharp drop in biden s standing in the polls the white house insisted through the president s months of travail that he would eventually get a win on both infrastructure and social spending the senate is yet to approve the second half of the package but the biden team argues that its plan for child care elder care and preschool represents broadly popular mainstream ideas and can be financed by rolling back trump tax cuts for the wealthy
investors seemed generally pleased but made a notable shift investors have gotten used to seeing mixed stock market performance lately and that was once again the case on monday afternoon big gains for the dow jones industrial average dji 1 24 amounted to 323 points as of just after 2 p m et bringing the average to 35 834 the s p 500 gspc 1 46 also climbed higher rising 20 points to 4 718 and heading for a potential new record yet the nasdaq composite ixic 1 62 lost ground falling 68 points to 15 990 the big news on wall street monday was that president biden renominated current federal reserve chair jerome powell to another term leading the central bank many had speculated that biden might choose to go with lael brainard who instead got the nod as biden s choice for fed vice chair below we ll take a look at why the stock market had a mixed response and what investors seem to expect from the pair leading the fed much ado about nothing before the white house decision few of those following the fed chair appointment news seemed to have strong views about any major differences in policy between powell and brainard some saw brainard as potentially being less prone to raise interest rates in response to inflationary pressures and a recovering economy while powell might be more apt to pull back on accommodative monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating yet those differences were slight at most in the stock market investors have tried to figure out exactly what impact a tighter monetary policy might have on valuations the lack of viable investment alternatives have arguably pushed stock prices higher than they d otherwise go so there s fear that if interest rates rise money might leave the stock market to pursue more attractive fixed income assets yet with even the more hawkish members of the fed still foreseeing a long drawn out process of pulling back from bond purchases nervousness about an immediate and substantial downward move seems premature big gains in cyclical stocks a closer look at monday s stock market moves reveals some signs of what investors seem to expect after the powell reappointment performing most strongly were stocks in the energy and financials sectors both of which have significant sensitivity to economic strength and interest rates banks and other financial services companies tend to do better when long term rates are substantially higher than short term rates and investors seem to believe that the sooner the fed starts normalizing its monetary policy the faster banks will return to historical levels of profitability meanwhile if economic growth remains robust in the current recovery demand for energy products will remain high conversely many of the technology and communication services companies that have performed so well over the past year were the weakest parts of the market on monday afternoon higher interest rates have a disproportionately large impact on the intrinsic value of small companies whose biggest growth prospects are far in the future moreover growth companies stand to lose the most if access to capital becomes constrained due to higher interest rates to be clear few market watchers expect interest rates to soar skyward in a rapid and uncontrolled manner no matter who leads it the fed is likely to continue to telegraph its probable future moves as much as it can with the goal of avoiding surprises that could cause market disruptions there may come a time when such attempts become counterproductive for now though investors seem to appreciate the efforts and that s a big part of why even today s crosscurrents aren t causing big moves lower for any segment of the stock market as a whole
federal reserve chair jerome powell was nominated for a second four year term by president joe biden on monday extending a tenure that began somewhat by chance survived blistering criticism from former president donald trump and now positions the ex investment banker to finish the most consequential revamp of monetary policy since the 1970s lael brainard the federal reserve board member who was the other top candidate for the job will be vice chair the white house said while there s still more to be done we ve made remarkable progress over the last 10 months in getting americans back to work and getting our economy moving again biden a democrat said in comments emailed to reporters that success is a testament to the economic agenda i ve pursued and to the decisive action that the federal reserve has taken he said powell 68 will need to be confirmed by the senate currently controlled by biden s democratic party but closely divided the decision to stick with powell a republican and former private equity lawyer elevated to the fed s top job by trump rejuvenates what in recent decades had been a bipartisan approach to filling the position and several republican senators have already endorsed the reappointment despite powell s rocky relationship with trump u s equity index futures edged higher in pre market trading after the news treasury bond yields also rose and the dollar strengthened powell s reappointment had been encouraged by a cross section of investors and economists with both conservative and liberal leanings but controversy over stock trading during the pandemic by two former regional federal reserve bank presidents roiled the renomination process with calls for broader reform powell pivoted fast quickly rolling out new ethics rules for top fed officials far stricter even than the ones his critics in congress apply to themselves ultimately continuity and powell s command of monetary policy through the coronavirus crisis proved decisive his swift and aggressive actions at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 were widely hailed as staving off a potential depression later some lauded his focus on jobs in the new policy framework he launched just over a year ago and others argued it would be too risky to oust the fed chair during a sensitive transition from the emergency measures taken during the health crisis fundamentally if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the federal reserve and i have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that chair powell and dr brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs biden said in a statement the current recovery somewhat unexpectedly has produced risks of persistent inflation even with 4 2 million jobs still missing because of the pandemic a potential conflict between the fed s twin goals of maintaining maximum employment and stable prices source reuters reporting by howard schneider and jeff mason editing by dan burns and andrea ricci
relatives of jeffrey epstein s former girlfriend ghislaine maxwell who goes on trial in the us next week have complained to the un that her detention is illegal lawyers have said the 59 year old british socialite could spend the rest of her life in jail if convicted in new york of trafficking underage girls for us financier epstein who killed himself in prison more than two years ago human rights lawyers francois zimeray and jessica finelle who are not representing maxwell said they had filed a complaint with a panel of un experts today alleging serious violations of her defence rights and presumption of innocence in the complaint maxwell s siblings said she had been subject to unfit and degrading treatment maxwell was arrested in july 2020 as prosecutors vowed to pursue epstein s co conspirators following the multimillion dollar money manager s death a year earlier she has since been held at the metropolitan detention center in brooklyn where she has repeatedly complained of unsanitary and inhumane conditions prosecutors say maxwell befriended girls with shopping and cinema trips later coaxing them into giving epstein nude massages during which he would engage in sex acts before giving them money she has pleaded not guilty to all six counts and faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted on all charges advertisement presumption of innocence zimeray and finelle said she should be able to respond to the charges in a fair trial where respect for the presumption of innocence is guaranteed but they questioned in a statement whether a fair trial would be possible pointing to the documentaries podcasts and books produced about the case hundreds of millions of people have already been able to convince themselves of her guilt they said the petition insisted there was no justification for maxwell s lengthy pre trial detention it is as if ghislaine maxwell is suffering the consequences of the failure of the us administration to preserve the life of jeffrey epstein and secure his appearance at trial the lawyers said there is a narrow line between justice and revenge we are not fighting against the complainants but against arbitrariness they said she maxwell had been forced to undergo several body searches a day and had been woken up with a torch in her face every 15 minutes after being put on suicide watch the petition urged the un working group on arbitrary detention to find that her detention was arbitrary and asked the experts to call for the us to release her without delay the un did not immediately respond to a query from afp about whether the working group had received the petition and when it might be considered the group is made up of five independent experts who do not speak on behalf of the un and whose opinions are not binding although they do carry reputational weight afp 2021

you angela and good morning everyone fiscal 2021 was a defining year for twist we diversified our synthetic biology business and expanded our customer base while accelerating our ngs revenue in parallel we leaned into biopharma evolving the company from solely a service provider in this business segment to a partner of choice in data storage we continued our enduring progress and are working within the dna data storage alliance to build market awareness of this novel storage solution overall we ve moved from a product specific focus toward moving applications across large and growing end markets we have made some important announcements over the last two weeks and will take some time today to talk through the strategic directions of the company as well as the individual pieces fit within our overarching plan against the backdrop of a global pandemic we reported record revenue of 132 3 million for the year an increase of 47 over fiscal 2020 and we reported 159 5 million in orders an increase of 37 over fiscal 2020 for the fourth quarter with a tough comp against last year where we had a single large order of 9 million we reported revenue of 38 million and orders of 45 2 million an increase of 17 and 6 respectively diving into the specific businesses i ll start with biopharma as we announced a definitive agreement to acquire abveris this morning abveris is a privately held antibody design and discovery company focused on individual discovery using a novel mouse platform that conducted many discovery campaigns for partners with about a 70 rate of they currently are 90 customers operating today on a fee for service model we see abveris complementing our synthetic antibody discovery capabilities very nicely following the acquisition the animal based antibody discovery method and antibody screening technologies will augment our own antibody discovery and optimization capabilities importantly they have an established customer base with six of their discovered antibodies in clinical trials the company has 35 employees and will continue to operate in the headquarters in boston following the acquisition and we believe that in fiscal 2023 the abveris business would be cash flow positive taking a step back to look at our overarching biopharma capabilities following the integration of abveris we will have three complementary discovery approaches under one umbrella in the first approach we have synthetic discovery libraries where twist has a competitive advantage through our dna synthesis platform technology we synthesize and screening targets against these libraries can generate robust antibody leads second our proceeds to generate antibodies from an annual immunized with the target and then harvesting and sequencing the resulting antibodies that is the specialty of abveris platform third we have entered into technology cooperation s with several companies to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to screen through antibody needs and refine antibody levels with the acquisition twist will have all three approaches offering a unique and comprehensive antibody discovery and optimization capability to our partners as well as while internal antibody generation in addition we have products that support the total discovery process our oligo pools can be used to identify targets and our ngs tools can be used to twist provide tools to develop the lead further through our synbio offerings stopping with gene sensing and moving all the way through the resulting igg proteins biopharma as you know we ve been working toward covid 19 specific biopharma process we ve been working hard to put together a team with clinical development and commercialization expertise and last week we launched revelar biotherapeutics an independent biopharmaceutical company we license our lead bispecific antibody to treat covid 19 to revelar and have committed to provide up to 10 million of initial funding in addition revelar can license up up to five additional targets over the course of the next four years each program is subject to additional milestones payments and royalties for twist while the covid antibody will not be first in class we do see the opportunity for and two could be delivered subcutaneously which may offer overall best in class molecule we know that we made the need for therapeutics that effectively treat non covid as well as antibody therapeutic with a broad neutralizing capabilities among the emerging science as global vaccination is far from complete and vaccine effectiveness unfortunately appears to be declining over time the recent data on oral therapeutics although promise though they typically need to taken within five days of onset and could have safety concern that may not be seen until more widely taken on a peer reviewed publication recently noted that antibody therapeutics also promise to provide long term protection for immunocompromised patients who don t generate a robust immune response with vaccines we believe this lead space for antibody therapeutics in the treatment regimen we expect covid will become an endemic disease and certainly that it is here to stay we need the best test to watch for covid antibodies to put it in the hands of a team experience in clinical development and commercialization and participate in the upside through equity appreciation potential milestone payments of over 100 million and mid single digit royalties on any commercial sales revelar expects to begin clinical trial for this antibody in 22 subject to receiving regulatory approvals including other development hurdles this spin off fits our internal biopharma philosophy of minimizing biology risk and quickly developing antibody with an improved pharmacological profile that hits the validated target we expect that revelar would be a way to for development of up to five additional non covid targets emerging from our biopharma platform each of which come with additional upfront milestone and royalty payments this allows twist to participate in the upside of any of the five additional licensed antibodies while sneak hitting the risk of delinquent through external funding and an experienced management team strategically for biopharma we have a vision of what are the initiatives this platform can add to this industry we have now built to date of 34 partners with 41 active and 32 completed program of the 73 total programs 35 at milestones and or royalties efficiencies them we are completing the acquisition of abveris we will have more customers and programs coming on board and through revelar we expect to have a treatment within the clinic in 22 pending the required approvals turning to synthetic biology we reported 14 million in revenues and 20 1 million in orders for the fourth quarter over the course of fiscal 21 and looking into fiscal 22 we have evolved our program to enable us to capture more pharmaceutical requirements for the large number of customers who make their own dna we believe the largest and most impactful application of synthetic biology from both a financial and perspective will be healthier and we have seen that within our customer base we have a growing number of customers needing our genes oligo pools and libraries our customers use these products to link phenotype and genotype and ultimately to gain a deeper understanding of biology for the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics during the quarter we saw some impact from an extraordinary event where we needed to shutdown production for a short period of time during we determined an unwanted dna sequences were included in our genes none of the genes were sold to customers but we did extensive delay in some gene orders we were able to successfully troubleshoot this issue clear the resulting backlog within three weeks and still reported robust order and synbio for synbio in the quarter we did extensive resequencing that we were able to do much more quickly and we believe we have now identified the root cause and do not expect further interruptions in production our need for additional capacity and dedicated machines which we are building currently in effect for the future out side of portland at the same time we have a path to currently increase capacity at our headquarters in the bay area to ensure we can meet the increasing demand from our customers for the next 12 to 18 months we recognize that we not only need to meet the ongoing increasing demand but also any surge in demand when large in order arise today we have capacity to make approximately 45 000 genes per month plus fragment ngs products and we are building capacity in of 8 000 clonal genes per month by december and then 90 000 genes per month by april of 22 to ensure that we continue to meet the need of our customers as as well will bring the factor of th future future online in 2022 turning to ngs we reported revenue of 21 4 million a record quarter even against the comp in 2020 where we shipped a single 9 million order we launched several products to build both to our offering including the exome 2 0 the most comprehensive exome offering with best in class performance in addition we introduced our alliance panel products which are kits with security content from key opinion leader in their respective fields sold through twist this quarter we have launched a robust clinical exome from the broad and a pan cancer panel from anchordx building on our first alliance panel with panel with content from the regeneron genetics center we also announced plans to launch panels with centogene focused on rare diseases for data storage we achieved a significant milestone under iarpa s molecular information storage or mist program iarpa s evaluation team came to twist in october and provided us with a set of dna sequence to be sensitized on the 1 micron proof of concept chip in a single day the sequences were not shared in advance and we passed the test with flying colors in addition we confirmed that we can synthesize dna as individual size on the 1 micron proof of concept chip with no crosstalk or spillover into adjacent sites this was the critical technology demonstration that validates our ability to achieve smaller dimensions we are currently in the design phase for the alpha chip which would be our first full commercial release chip in the meantime we will lay the groundwork to sign early access customers to that end in october we hired steffen hellmold previously at western digital with the significant technology advances that we ve made in data storage we are now focused on preparing for early access product launch laying the foundation for commercialization of the disrupted and important storage solution steffen will help define our clinical strategy and leverage relationship build a carrier in storage to ensure we offer the right product at this time i d like to turn the call over to jim to review our financial results for the quarter jim thorburn chief financial officer all right thank you emily as emily noted we had another exciting and dynamic year as we continue to scale our platform and we closed out the year on a strong note revenue for the quarter was 38 million a new record for twist which is sequential growth of 9 and year on year growth of 17 and this brings our fy 21 revenue to 132 3 million a 47 increase from fy 20 and slightly above the top end of our guidance of 129 million to 132 million for the year orders were 45 2 million for the quarter a sequential increase of 16 and 6 year over year this takes our total orders for the year to approximately 159 million gross margin for the fourth quarter was 40 7 and our total year gross margin was 39 as compared to 32 in fy 20 we shipped to approximately 2 900 customers for the year and that s up from 2 200 in fy 20 and we ended the year with cash and short term investments of approximately 478 million healthcare is now our largest segment and accounts for 54 of our business with revenue of 71 2 million in fy 21 versus 40 million in fy 20 and that s a 78 growth year on year reflecting growth in ngs biopharma and growing demand for our synbio products industrial chemicals revenue was 34 5 million in fy 21 versus 29 1 million in fy 20 even though we are operating in a pandemic where many academic labs were impacted globally our academic revenue was 25 3 million versus 19 6 million in fy 20 reflecting our continued focus on growing the long tail agriculture revenue was 1 3 million essentially flat with fy 20 now i will provide more color on orders we ended on a very strong note with ngs orders for the fourth quarter of 21 8 million which brings our total ngs orders for the year to approximately 76 million as compared to 53 million in fiscal 20 which is approximately 43 growth year on year from a high comp base we referenced earlier this growth reinforces the robust and growing market opportunity our expanding product portfolio investment in our commercial organization expanding the customer base with increase adoption and increasing ngs applications including liquid biopsy mrd rna controls and clinical applications during the quarter we received orders from approximately 670 ngs customers and the top 10 accounts placed orders were approximately 10 million as compared to approximately 7 million for the top 10 with previous quarter confirming we re seeing continued debt diversification of our customer footprint our pipeline for larger opportunities continues to scale and we re now tracking 199 accounts and that s up from 182 and noted in our last earnings call 88 have adopted twist and that s an increase from 79 on our we noted in our last quarter now turning to synbio we saw robust growth in our synbio which includes genes dna preps igg libraries and oligo pools which rose to 20 1 million in the fourth quarter up from 15 7 million in the third quarter of fy 21 which is a sequential growth of 28 and up from 16 1 million in the last quarter of fiscal 20 with healthcare segment being the major driver to growth now to biopharma we continue to scale our biopharma antibody discovery business as orders rose 11 6 million for the year which is a growth of 123 compared to 5 2 million in fiscal 20 orders in the fourth quarter was 3 4 million as we continued to build our pipeline of new and repeat customers as noted earlier we have 34 partners with 41 active programs of which 35 are milestones and royalties please note orders may not translate into revenue but do provide a trend line for each product group now moving from orders to revenue as noted earlier revenue for the quarter was 38 million and brings our cumulative revenue for fiscal 21 to 132 3 million versus 90 1 million in fiscal 20 representing approximately 47 year over year growth ngs product revenue scaled to 21 4 million in quarter four a sequential growth of 14 and is notable that we exceeded the 20 2 million for the same quarter of fy 20 which included the 9 million we mentioned earlier in q4 the top four customers accounted for approximately 50 of our revenue for the year ngs revenue grew from 44 million in fy 20 to 72 7 million which is 65 growth year on year our synbio product revenues for the quarter was approximately 14 million and that s down sequentially from 14 3 million in the previous quarter due to the aforementioned production issue and seasonality in europe total annual synbio is revenue 53 million compared to approximately 44 million or 20 growth year on year some of the highlights include shipping to 1 900 synbio customers in fy 21 up from 1 590 in fy 20 our genes revenue is 39 million and that s an increase from 35 2 million in fy 20 we also shipped a record number of genes of approximately 372 000 and that s an increase from 330 000 we shipped in fy 20 now to biopharma revenue for the quarter was approximately 2 6 million and full year revenue was 7 million as compared to 2 4 million in fy 20 and during the year we serviced approximately 43 customers demonstrating the progress we re making in this platform i will now briefly cover our regional progress for fy 21 our investments in building out our global commercial organization is reflected in our strong international growth emea had another terrific year with fy 21 revenue of 44 1 million versus 25 8 million and that s 71 growth year on year and emea now accounts for 33 of our worldwide business apac had a great year and fy 21 revenue grew about 100 to 10 3 million from 5 1 million in fy 20 the u s which includes revenue of 77 9 million for fy 21 as compared to 59 2 million for fy 20 now moving down the p l our gross margin for the quarter was approximately 15 5 million or 40 7 of revenue up from 40 in the prior quarter total year margin was approximately 51 7 million or 39 of revenues up from 32 in fy 20 now to operating expenses our quarter four operating expenses which includes r d and sg a was 57 7 million r d for the quarter of 19 4 million which brings our total investments in r d to 69 1 million for fy 21 and that s up from 43 million in fy 20 the major contributors to our investments in r d were compensation due to higher headcount and external services primarily associated with our investments in dna storage and also increased investment in biopharma our sg a in quarter four was 38 2 million which brings our sg a for the year to 135 9 million as compared to 103 3 million in fy 20 the increases are primarily higher compensation as we continue to build out a commercial organization increased stock based compensation higher fees associated with the orders and investments and addressing our material weaknesses and increased lease expenses as we expanded our footprint in san francisco and the factory of the future importance in the portland area our net loss before tax is 41 million for quarter quarter and a the total loss for the year was 152 million which includes stock based compensation of 37 million and depreciation and amortization of 10 million capex for the year was 27 million including 13 million for wilsonville mostly for equipment to process and facility improvements given the supply global supply chain challenges we have strategically increased our inventory to 32 million compared to 12 million at the end of fiscal 2020 we ended the year with cash and short term investments of approximately 478 million now to give some updates on our fy 22 guidance as we noted we saw strong bookings in quarter four and are optimistic on our opportunities and at the same time there remains uncertainty associated with the pandemic for fy 22 our revenue guidance in the range of 173 million to 181 million and including the expected completion of the abveris acquisition in quarter one of fiscal 22 and revenue guidance increases to 183 million to 193 million synbio revenue is estimated to be in the range of 67 million to 70 million as compared to approximately 53 million in fiscal 21 our ngs guidance is estimated to be in the range of 94 million to 96 million as compared to approximately 73 million in fiscal 21 biopharma revenue including our anticipated abveris acquisition is estimated to be approximately 22 million to 27 million as compared to approximately 7 million for fiscal 21 for the first quarter we re projecting revenue in a range of 37 to 39 which we believe is prudent guidance reflecting the upcoming holiday shutdowns in europe covid pressures and the impact of the production issue we discussed earlier on the call our fiscal 22 gross margin projection ranges 35 to 37 which reflects the costs associated with our wilsonville wrap up excluding these costs gross margin will be 42 to 44 operating expenses which includes r d and sg a are expected to be approximately 315 million for fiscal 22 as compared to 205 million in fiscal 21 reflecting increased investments in biopharma of approximately 40 million data storage 20 million our commercial organization 20 million and portland opex start up costs of 10 million versus those higher stock based comp and higher depreciation our r d expenses for the year is projected to be approximately 130 million up from 69 million primarily due to investments in digitalization and biopharma our net loss guidance for the year is expected to be approximately 215 million stock based comp is projected to be approximately 47 million and depreciation is expected to be 13 million our capex for fy 22 is projected to be 80 to 90 million with approximately 75 million investment in roseville in summary we d like to all the twisters for delivering another terrific quarter and record growth we had another exceptional year to execute on our strategy and join broad demand from our customer base and we re significantly stepping up our investment as we continue to tap into new revenue streams and with that i ll now turn the call back to emily emily leproust chief executive officer and co founder thank you thank you jim we are accomplishing tremendous amount in fiscal 2021 with execution across all areas of the business the execution resulted in significant revenue growth and customer acquisition for synthetic biology and ngs and we continue to see huge opportunities ahead for both markets with the recent strategic transactions of abveris we are well positioned to accelerate our biopharma vertical and in data storage the engineering accomplishments we have achieved to date set the stage for commercial planning and market introduction while these four business areas very different market opportunities each relies on our silicon based dna synthesis platform which remains at the core of our competitive differentiation and success looking ahead fiscal 2022 will be a year focused on growing market share as well as investing for future success in synthetic biology we plan to continue to build our business and extend our customer base we expect to launch commercially for pharmaceutical and retail customer base building on positive feedback from our early access customers we remain focused on bringing our the factor of the future to reduce turnaround time especially for genes we re beginning to see the benefit of and adoption for synbio customers who currently make their own dna in fiscal year 2023 plunge for ngs we expect to continue to grow revenues from our existing products while expanding our capabilities around rna and library preparation we expect to launch a twist product we acquired with the transaction this calendar year and we intend to expand our customer base for both snp microarray conversions and alliance panels for biopharma we look forward to seeing our first company in the clinic in 2022 subject to receiving the appropriate clearances in addition we intend to sign additional partnerships and add programs as well as pursue opportunities to participate in a greater share of wallet and rapid clinical advancement we expect to out license at least one twist discovered by mid calendar 2022 for dna data storage we intend to continue to drive to early access customers and pilot production we will continue to execute on iarpa s mist program milestones and actively advance market resolution for this new storage medium in concert with the dna data storage aligned with that let s open the call for questions operator questions and answers operator our first question comes from dan brennan with cowen your line is open dan brennan cowen analyst hey thanks thanks for the questions guys maybe just first one just to start on the impact from the problem cited for synbio in the quarter did you quantify how much that contributed and is there anything baked in within your fiscal 22 guidance from that emily leproust chief executive officer and co founder i ll jump in and maybe jim will reference here no no we didn t quantify the impact in 2021 we did notice that we did that we actually finished very strong both in revenue and order for the fourth quarter and the headwinds from this issue were included in the q1 guidance and the fiscal 22 guidance dan brennan cowen analyst okay and then maybe on the acquisition looks like around 10 million of 12 million of revenue kind of baked in i guess maybe first question is how do we think about kind of the can you can you give us a sense of the growth rate of that business in particular how do we think about the go forward i know you ve kind of given the sense for fiscal 22 but any sense on could you give a little more color on the customers that they have and the outlook beyond fiscal 22 and then related to that is there any conflict as you internalize your technology given that twist is looking to develop its own antibodies is there any risk from their own customer is that they view adverse now competing with them emily leproust chief executive officer and co founder i ll start with the first part of your question and then i ll let i ll start with the second part and i ll let jim answer the first half as far as the competition no actually its very synergistic they approach which generates antibody that needs to be humanized and so that goes directly to the twist platform there are some targets that don t have don t generate immune response even in the hyperimmune so that s perfect for the twist approach that want to maximize their heat rate and so if we do both approaches in parallel it really it really adds its very complementary and it will enable both platform to build on each other and be synergistic jim you want to comment on the financial question jim thorburn chief financial officer yeah so dan yeah the 12 million reflects roughly about 10 months revenue this year we obviously are working through the integration obviously optimistic we anticipate seeing significant revenue growth in that business so right now we re estimating roughly 30 annualized growth from that base but obviously update that as we continue to develop the business with the terrific team from abveris one of the advantages we re adding customers roughly 90 customers which is the expanded footprint for synbio organization as well and in this world where it s tough to get talent we re bringing in some some terrific abveris team highly talented and really complements what we re doing with our biopharma and synbio business dan brennan cowen analyst great and then maybe a final one just on ngs could you speak through the fiscal 2022 guidance maybe some puts and takes if we were to look back in four months and that number would be higher what are the key levers included in that i d be into to find out kind of how liquid biopsy is kind of impacting the ngs outlook for 2022 jim thorburn chief financial officer yeah i mean we ended on a strong note bookings were nearly 22 million number of customers we re tracking large number of customers in our pipeline to grow us almost under 200 now definitely seeing opportunity in liquid biopsy definitely seeing opportunity in mrd we launched our exome as emily mentioned so we re expanding our product portfolio and then right now we feel we re making prudent guidance for the fiscal 22 where our goal is to continue to invest in commercial organization to continue to get service continue to expand the product portfolio with increase in r d so we re optimistic in terms of the long term opportunity here i m sure we re well positioned working with the lot of of customers dan brennan cowen analyst great great thank you jim thorburn chief financial officer okay operator our next question comes from tycho peterson with j p morgan your line is open tycho peterson j p morgan analyst hey good morning i m going to start with wilsonville i just want to confirm you re reaffirming the kind of mid year 22 target to open it up to slides 2022 and then as we think about capacity there i guess i mean you re generally short cycle you re not necessarily pre booking capacity at this point but how do we think about your ability to kind of scale that capacity and jim on margins i know you re talking about 35 to 37 corporate overall how do we think about the margin impact as the year progresses around wilsonville as that capacity gets up and running jim thorburn chief financial officer yeah so good question i m bringing out wilsonville we re starting the initial ramp around our fourth quarter maybe step back the overall impact for wilsonville i m estimating dollar impact for the year is 25 million roughly about 10 million is in our opex with g a estimating toward the back end of the year we can have both approximately 15 million adapting to 15 million as we ramp up the facility so that s been an impact q4 but if you step back and you just normalize the margin in the 42 to 44 range i mean our goal is for wilsonville to see the opportunity to be able to leverage pricing as well as we address the faster genes so our goal is to scale that business as quickly as possible that s why we re investing in the commercial organization we ve made a lot of our investments in terms of the capital tools we re starting to hire and as you can as you can tell from the conference call we are bidding also additional capacity in san francisco we re very bullish in terms of numbers and bio customers and also the there is uncertainty around the pandemic prudent with our outlook tycho peterson j p morgan analyst okay that s helpful emily on data storage nicely hitting the milestone proof of concept as you get ready for early access launch can you just talk about what s left from a technical perspective before commercial launch and then are there milestones we should be tracking for that business for 2022 emily leproust chief executive officer and co founder yeah from a technical perspective the next step is to keep going down in dimension so last year we guided that this year we will have the one working and we do so the next step is to keep going down crosstalk as we mentioned is the key the key technology issue and now we ve we ve been able to make it grow from 5 micron and 1 micron and so we are very confident that we understand the physics and the chemistry and how we did to each other and so that s why we have we have the confidence to mention that the next super alpha chip will be also a commercial chip so we re in the design phase of the alpha chip next phase would be the production next phase after that will be the debugging development of the chip and when that is done we ll be able to use it with customer in a way similar to what happened this quarter with the mist program coming to us those are the sequence i d like to make the same thing will happen with our first customer in terms of milestones it s about getting the chip to work signing early access customers and as we mentioned in the past the customers that will we focus on for the alpha release will be customers that are very desperate frankly to get onto a new storage medium and just to note we know that now it s going to be the fourth platform we launched ngs and biopharma we know that it s important for the first few customer interactions to work in an environment where there is room for back and forth and optimization of the process and to that extent the funnel mold is a great executive addition to the team to make that happen tycho peterson j p morgan analyst great last one just on some of the business development updates i guess first on add risk did they get downstream economics you mentioned six antibodies in the clinic so should we think about that as being additive to kind of the milestones and royalties emily leproust chief executive officer and co founder no at this point at this point the platform is entirely fee for service as we we combine integrated businesses i think we ll have opportunities potentially to upsize the economic share that we re able to gain tycho peterson j p morgan analyst and then how are you thinking about the opportunity for revelar with the spin i mean obviously the antiviral data from pfizer and merck was pretty good around covid so how do you think about that in context of your monoclonal antibody opportunity and that you mentioned i think five non covid programs is the risk longer term that revelar could ultimately compete with some of your own development efforts on the therapeutic side emily leproust chief executive officer and co founder not the way we structure the business it s unlikely that revelar will be working on the same targets as we are and they were will definitely have the advantage of having starting first so it s based on logistic and the covid to be in the clinic in 2022 which is great for twist first antibody and we have a great experienced team and the idea is to syndicate the risk by i think that the worked done at revelar are supported based on funding at the same time as we keep the upside opportunity through equity appreciation and nice upfront milestones and royalties so it s it s very much additive and there is very little risk of working on issues of that it is structured tycho peterson j p morgan analyst okay one last one for jim before i hop off you got 465 million or so in cash in the balance sheet now the burn this year is going to be about 300 million i think with net loss and capex can you just talk on how you re thinking about the balance sheet and potential need to raise more capital jim thorburn chief financial officer yeah want to keep a strong balance sheet we see lots of opportunity for the company going forward and as always i m conservative and we re bringing up wilsonville here we re investing data storage we do see upside in terms of the growth in the business and as we evaluate our opportunities i ll be making sure we have a strong balance sheet to finance the growth in 23 and 24 tycho peterson j p morgan analyst sounds good thank you operator our next question comes from catherine schulte with baird your line is open catherine schulte baird analyst hey thanks for the questions i guess first maybe just going back to the production issue that you mentioned what was the root cause there did it impact all of your production and then you mentioned clearing the backlog in three weeks but also called out that there would be an impact to synbio revenue both in the fourth and first quarter so when did the disruption occur and do you think you lost any customers due to the delays there emily leproust chief executive officer and co founder yeah thank you for the question so the issue happened in august as you know synthesizing gene is actually very difficult it s many steps with chemistry steps enzymatic steps steps and there was an issue in the combination of regions and hardware and frankly the issue was compounded by the fact that the fed was absolutely full and so part of the issue is when you add capacity there is no extra hours in the day 24 7 that you can use and when you actually takes longer than it should to clear the backlog so that s one of the reason why we are adding capacity in first fiscal in the meantime to make sure that when problems do happen we re able to catch it very quickly and make it basically transparent on the customer on the customer side in terms of losing customers long term i don t i don t think that is necessarily a long term impact but it does puts us on the backside as we as we start and see the conservative guide for q1 now that we actually saw the second time very briefly in october and that really helped us solidify our understanding of the root cause and we believe now that is totally eliminated it s hard to prove a negative and so only time will tell but we re very confident in the understanding of scientist getting in assuming what happened and making sure it won t happen again catherine schulte baird analyst okay got it thank you for that color and then you talked about expecting to have the first twist discovered antibody in the clinic in 22 with the covid treatment from revelar what about on the partner side do you have any indication of how many of those 32 completed programs are advancing and when any of those could advance to the clinic emily leproust chief executive officer and co founder so we don t have a lot of flexibility a lot of visibility on where they are we have no indication that any of them is not doing for as far as we know they will and so we are due in the the notes with this in future for a twist antibody to be in the clinic and so i don t know if the covid antibodies will be the first ones but definitely the covid antibodies are the ones that we have excellent visibility in them but at the same time you can see that we report every quarter how many antibodies how many programs are completed the number is increasing quite quite nicely and so we re just increasing the sort of short term goals for more twist antibodies in the clinic catherine schulte baird analyst okay and then last one for me if we could just maybe go back to dan s question on ngs revenue guidance for 22 came in a little bit higher than where we were so that was great can you just parse out what you expect from existing customers ramping their business with you versus new customer wins just as we try to think about the visibility into that number jim thorburn chief financial officer so good question most most the revenue ramp is going to come from new customers ramping as their assets increase in volume the tests we do track the pilots and validation or revenues but the bulk of our revenue comes from those in production and will expect that to be the same for fiscal 22 and that s what s baked into your forecast we don t break that as how much is pilot how much validation as yet but with the growth and the number of customers q4 bookings q4 orders and the types of assays were designed into we re feeling good about our revenue forecast for the year catherine schulte baird analyst okay great thank you operator our next question comes from vijay kumar with evercore isi your line is open vijay kumar evercore isi analyst hey guys congrats on the print and thanks for taking my question let me see if i can ask 800 questions on the call to jim maybe starting with your revenue guidance here ex the acquisition that you guys did i think the base revenues were 173 to 181 that s about 30 to 38 considering you guys just add 1 north of 45 organic against the tough comp in fiscal 21 is that mid 30s or low to mid 30s perhaps conservative out and it seems like ngs growth of 30 against a 65 growth in fiscal 21 seems to be slowing down how much of this is conservatism versus versus any factors that perhaps you might be seeing in the business jim thorburn chief financial officer yeah so in terms of the business business is going well we are grousely still in pandemic you re seeing lockdowns begin to reappear in europe we re always and vijay we re all fit in our guidance and i want to be thoughtful the ngs business is going extremely well the number of large customers continues to scale order scale we re investing our commercial organization we re launching new products and at the same time we want to be thoughtful in terms of the guidance yes there is some major wins in our sales in terms of the market opportunities with liquid biopsy mrd as an example we re an extremely talented team at twist in terms of innovative new products so i think the we will obviously update the guidance through the year but right now we feel good about the and in addition to that i mean the ngs market does continue to improve and as you see sequencing costs coming down so i think there is good opportunity for us in fy 22 and fy 23 vijay kumar evercore isi analyst sticking on to guidance the q1 of 38 that s sequentially flattish historically you guys have sequentially last year in fiscal 21 if you adjust for the comps timing of orders again you were up sequentially why is q1 sequentially flattish and what kind of impact are you baking in from the manufacturing issue is that a factor in q1 and should those revenues to be recognized in the back half jim thorburn chief financial officer while this is three issues first of all europe is higher proportion of our business revenue for the year it was about 44 million so it scaled significantly from 25 million previous year so the european christmas vacations and shutdowns has got higher impact and also we got to be realistic we are seeing spikes in covid pressures around the globe we re seeing some of that in asia we re were reading what s going on in europe right now and we re trying to calibrate the impacts of production issue and the relief is the guidance is prudent in the 37 million to 39 million range vijay kumar evercore isi analyst understood then one on the free cash flows your guidance for net loss of 250 million that s a massive step up from 150 million in fiscal 21 what is driving this jim i mean that s a really big step up clearly it looks like you guys have about 470 ish of cash on hand is that enough for you guys to breakeven on the cash flow side jim thorburn chief financial officer we re a couple of things we re stepping up our investments in biopharma the overall opex is increasing from 205 million this year to 315 million we we re out investment of biopharma by roughly 40 million stepping up investments in data storage by 20 million and we continuing to invest on commercial organization ahead of bringing on wilsonville and the wilsonville investment in terms of capex is coming near is about 75 million yes we re deploying capital we re deploying capital because we really see the customer demand coming in the future we ve got a great team from innovating customer base continues to scale so we are looking at this as a long term opportunity to invest and scale up in the marketplace vijay kumar evercore isi analyst got you and then one last one you re biopharma guidance of 22 to 27 ex the acquisition rate we re looking at somewhere between 44 to 50 ishfor the year that s a pretty healthy doubling up of biopharma revenues jim is revelar biotherapeutics a customer of yours i know you have the equity stake and if it is how much of a contributor is that what is driving biopharma strength jim thorburn chief financial officer yeah there s nothing in that step up assumed for revelar we have built up the investment in biopharma over the last year we re seeing a lot of customers come back we invested 70 odd percent return rate and this is just based on our continuing to invest in the commercial organization invest in biopharma and you re seeing that step up in growth there is enormous for antibodies and we ve got the platform and they re leveraging our dna platform our synthesis platform so we are seeing significant opportunity hence that s filed with the step up there vijay kumar evercore isi analyst understood thanks guys jim thorburn chief financial officer okay operator our next question comes from puneet souda with svb leerink your line is open puneet souda svb leerink analyst yeah hi emily jim and thanks for taking the question so i have a bigger question here on biopharma first we saw revelar obviously prior to that you have invested into twist biopharma and now abveris so just wondering given that you have all oligos and in libraries you have now diversimab model with mouse model you have seems like abveris is using berkeley lights for clone selection and maybe getting some throughput there but if you could maybe just elaborate at this point in time what else do you need for your biopharma capabilities and essentially antibody discovery capabilities immunization high throughput screening repertoire validation maybe an expression scale up maybe just walk us through what you need at this point or do you have all the components that you are seeking here to build a stronger biopharma antibody discovery business emily leproust chief executive officer and co founder it s a great question i think we are pretty much as what we need as i mentioned the three big avenues to discover on the antibodies are the twist approach using synthetic libraries the approach now we have with abveris and then the machine learning ai approach which we have a number of collaborations ongoing so we have access to all three tools and we internally we ve already optimized depending the sequencing of the head the reformatting of the antibody so we are pretty much set and i think the combination that we have is going to be very powerful and we kind of with comprehensive set of suite to our customer puneet souda svb leerink analyst okay that s helpful and then just i ll keep it to two on supply chain jim mentioned a couple of things that things seem to be holding well so far but just wanted to understand in terms of we re hearing quite a bit about plastic plates and pipette tips and other products that might be used in twist products and delivery of products with multichannel type it i mean multi well plates and multichannel pipette and things like that so maybe just help us understand is there anything that we need to keep in mind there and broadly across supply chains what are some of the things that you re looking at for thank you jim thorburn chief financial officer well we entered into the pandemic last year we had the strategy of building into supply chain and we got ahead of the curve obviously we re vigilant in terms of any potential bottlenecks we did increase our image back to 2 million and it s interesting we did a tour of the facility recently and the feedback was wow you guys get lots of tips sitting around so we ve done so far we ve done a good job on keeping ahead of the issues obviously we re seeing demand increase we ve got terrific team in the supply chain that have been delivered in terms of materials so it s just a matter of keep training through this and executing puneet souda svb leerink analyst got it thanks guys jim thorburn chief financial officer okay operator our next question comes from matt larew with william blair your line is open matt larew william blair analyst yeah hi good morning i just wanted to ask again on gross margins in terms of pacing throughout the year so i guess just contemplating coming back from the backlog here in the fiscal first quarter and then factory of the future ramping later in the year can you maybe help us with pacing for gross margins throughout the year jim thorburn chief financial officer yeah i mean the i mean as we bring on the factory of the future we are going to see increased fixed costs so we re looking at a total total spend for the factor of the future it s is roughly around 25 million of that about 10 million is opex g a that 14 million to 15 million about 14 million actually is going to impact us in the second half of the year with the i think in terms of break it out between q3 and q4 is about 30 impact in q3 of that 14 million and the rest hitting in q4 so you can build those numbers into your models but it is just by excluding the factory the feature we re targeting roughly or we re seeing margins range from 42 to 44 as we get into the first half of the calendar year we ll give you more updates on what that cost looks like so you can normalize the margins matt larew william blair analyst okay and then you mentioned some growing interest within healthcare segment for synthetic biology sort of just curious if you could discuss that a bit more and then maybe somewhat relatedly just give us a sense for what you re seeing in terms of longer and more complex genes in terms of the demand there jim thorburn chief financial officer yeah so in terms of the health0care segment yeah so we ve grown significantly in healthcare i mean it s been been the area that we ve seen was growth so what s driving that so the three factors on the healthcare side you ve got the growth in terms of ngs you got growth in terms of biopharma and then on the synbio side i mean so we had lots of questions on the last earnings call that booking sequential bookings declined from q2 to q3 the bookings did increase from q3 to q4 that s driven by predominantly the segment within synbio in terms of what does that mean in terms of genes and the gene length those tend to be shorter genes so we ve seen switch of our gene activity from last year we had higher percentage what was longer genes i e more than 1 8 kb this year maybe we re looking at 1 8 kb non clonal genes that are accounting for in the last two quarters roughly 70 of our gene volume what s driving that is the pharma business is driving that matt larew william blair analyst okay i ll leave it there thanks jim thorburn chief financial officer okay operator our next question comes from luke sergott with barclays your line is open luke sergott barclays analyst hi everybody thank you for taking my questions here just real quick did you guys call out the actual dollar value impact from the shutdown in synbio in 4q and what s expected in 1q jim thorburn chief financial officer look no we didn t i can tell you just from a sort of cost point of view it was roughly at just under 1 million the impact of this and that s due to mostly having to do reruns and waste in qi i mean obviously we re still working through q1 the big issues in q1 is just europe s a higher share of business we had shutdowns european vacations coming around christmas and we re seeing some hotspots in asia in terms of covid and at the same time we re seeing significant demands coming in in terms of we had really strong caution in orders and we d rather be prudent at this time of year we feel good about the growth rates and the annual guidance and want to make sure that we calibrate well for quarter one luke sergott barclays analyst okay that s helpful and i guess as i m thinking about 22 and we re thinking about the ngs tools business major upside driver i think is a lot of the way their investors are thinking is going to come from the liquid biopsy can you give us a sense of how big that business is for you how we should think about either gardens new test coming in the early 22 or the anchordx in china how those kinds of feed through jim thorburn chief financial officer look we don t we don t break liquid biopsy liquid biopsy is a contributor mainly we ve got close to 200 large customers who we re tracking we continue to do well in terms of the number of adopted those have adopted do include liquid biopsy i mean our goal here is to build a broad platform because we re seeing more than just liquid biopsy as well mrd your seeing other ngs type classifications we had the genomics acquisition going we got the microarray to ngs conversion we have potential regeneron coming back so our goal here is to keep building the business and count the number of customers number of applications but obviously liquid biopsy will contribute but we re not breaking out the liquid biopsy impact luke sergott barclays analyst yeah ok so i just try to get it out here lastly on the r d step up this is more of just kind of a longer term idea here so you guys have the biopharma business the dna storage and then the rest of your core business that s looked at there s kind of the cash driver here so is there give us a sense of how you bucket out that r d step up is that mostly go into the clinical trial work from biopharma how is that also keeping abreast of the r d spend for ngs tools so that you guys can continue to accelerate that growth given is smaller business but can be a lot bigger jim thorburn chief financial officer yeah i mean so your just stepping back looking looking at the business i mean we are we are stepping up overall r d and in the biopharma roughly it will be we re increasing an additional 40 million biopharma and 20 million in data storage so that s about 60 million of the total 130 million so in terms of the core business and we are investing substantially more than 20 of revenue in that core business and we ll continue to keep keep investing in our core business because we are seeing terrific opportunities in terms of ngs as you ve outlined also we re seeing good opportunities in terms of investing and expanding the synbio platform as we start to launch our igg so i think i think we re really balanced in terms of our overall investment being a 130 million r d with biopharma opportunities and is highlighted and data storage yes longer term but it s becoming more real luke sergott barclays analyst all right thank you operator there are no further questions i will turn the call back over to emily leproust for any closing remarks emily leproust chief executive officer and co founder thank you very much for joining us today to close the call i want to personally wish you a wonderful thanksgiving we are especially grateful for all the twisters fiscal 21 and now already enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead for twist in fiscal 2022

president joe biden announced that jerome powell would be reappointed as federal reserve chairman sending most bank stocks up this morning what happened shares of wells fargo wfc 0 39 were trading nearly 4 higher as of 10 45 a m et today for no obvious reason although i suspect it is likely because of president joe biden s decision to reappoint jerome powell as the chairman of the federal reserve so what holders of bank stocks in general appear to be pleased with the powell news as the kbw nasdaq bank index which tracks the largest bank stocks in the country traded more than 2 higher this morning as well wells fargo is likely trading higher than the group as a whole because the bank is more captive to the federal reserve right now it remains under a federal reserve imposed asset cap limiting the bank from growing its balance sheet the asset cap is a result of the bank s infamous phony accounts scandal and has caused the loss of billions of dollars in profits now i don t think this means that powell will make it easy to get the asset cap removed as he has made public statements suggesting that wells still has a good deal of work to do but he is likely a far better pick for the bank than the other top candidate dr lael brainard who biden announced will become vice chairwoman of the federal reserve board of governors brainard is favored by democrats who would prefer stricter banking regulation including massachusetts sen elizabeth warren who earlier this year called for wells fargo to be broken up now what while i am not sure that this necessarily speeds up the removal of wells fargo s asset cap i would agree that the process certainly could have been more difficult under brainard s regime so this is a victory for the bank
japanese officials are working on ways to get around restrictions on releasing national reserves of crude oil in tandem with other major economies to dampen prices four government sources with knowledge of the plans told reuters while prime minister fumio kishida signalled his readiness over the weekend following a request from washington the world s fourth biggest oil buyer is restricted on how it can act with its reserves made up of both private and public stocks which typically can only be used in times of shortage one of the sources said the government was looking into releasing from the portion of the state held stocks outside the minimum amount required as a legal workaround officials are also looking at private stocks that are part of the national reserve which some advisers argue can be released without restrictions a second source said we have no choice but to come up with something after a request from the united states a third source told reuters all of the sources declined to be identified because the plan has not been made public chief cabinet secretary hirokazu matsuno said on monday nothing had been decided while kishida said on saturday the government was in the process of considering what it could do legally we would have to change our law and that would take time but some are arguing that private stockpiles can be released said the second source we need to expand the definition so they can be released the official said adding that no tender is imminent traders said they had received no notifications of a tender japanese private companies including refiners hold about 175 million barrels of crude and oil products as part of the strategic petroleum reserve spr enough for around 90 days consumption according to state agency jogmec which administers the spr and handles releases after policies are decided oil companies reserves have been tapped during the 1991 gulf war and following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disasters the state s portion in the spr has never been used and japan has an absurd level of petroleum stocks on hand according to fereidun fesharaki chairman of facts global energy there is no way the japanese government will do anything unless the u s asked fesharaki said in a phone interview the resource poor country s excessive attention to maintaining reserves comes from a mindset among bureaucrats who were around during the oil crises of the 1970s and 1980s fesharaki said until that group dies off there won t be any change brent crude recovered from earlier losses and was up around 0 5 after prices plunged on friday a decline that was largely attributed to impending lockdowns in europe rather than plans to release oil the biden administration made the unusual request here to other major economies to consider releasing oil from their strategic reserves as high prices are starting to produced unwanted inflation and undermine recovery from the covid 19 pandemic citing government sources the yomiuri newspaper said japan and the united states would coordinate an announcement of the release of oil reserves as early as this week japan s oil reserve held 145 days worth of daily petroleum consumption at the end of september according to official data well above the minimum 90 days required by law private sector reserves total 90 days worth also exceeding the minimum 70 days requirement source reuters reporting by yoshifumi takemoto ritsuko shimizu and aaron sheldrick writing and additional reporting by kantaro komiya editing by chang ran kim jacqueline wong and louise heavens
investors appear to like several developments related to its covid 19 booster shots what happened shares of moderna mrna 1 75 were up by 5 4 as of 11 45 a m et on monday the gain appears to be the result of several factors some investors could be feeling more bullish about the vaccine maker after the food and drug administration authorized its covid 19 booster for all adults on friday others could be more focused on the german government s decision to promote moderna s booster shot to its citizens in addition singapore s health minister stated publicly that people who initially received two doses of the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine should consider getting the moderna shot as their booster so what over the short term the biotech might not actually benefit financially from these latest developments that s certainly true when it comes to the domestic market the federal government has already agreed to buy 500 million doses of moderna s vaccine washington probably won t need to acquire additional doses to meet near term demand even with boosters available to all adults however it s possible that moderna could be helped over the long term countries that promote its boosters could be more likely to place advanced purchase vaccine agreements with it for 2023 and beyond perhaps more than anything investors are simply relieved that moderna has good news to share over the last several weeks the company has had plenty of bad news moderna lowered its full year 2021 revenue outlook also the food and drug administration extended its review of the company s vaccine for use in adolescents that prompted moderna to delay submitting its request for emergency use authorization for its vaccine to be administered to younger children now what the most important thing to watch with moderna will be how successful it is at securing additional supply deals the company has already signed agreements worth around 17 billion for delivery in 2022

the world s most popular theme park resort is suspending most of its annual pass sales theme park enthusiasts cheered when walt disney s dis 2 68 flagship florida resort resumed sales of its annual passes in early september that window was mostly closed over the weekend without any advance warning disney world has temporarily stopped selling three of the four annual passes that it began selling two months ago only the cheapest option the 399 pixie dust pass for florida residents that is only good on weekdays during non peak and non holiday periods is currently available holders of the three discontinued passes will be able to keep renewing them it s an odd move at first glance why would disney only keep its cheapest annual pass around why would the house of mouse want to keep higher paying regulars away it s a move that won t make disney very popular in social media circles but there s a financial method to the madness it s a small world suspending annual pass sales is a new move in florida but disneyland fans in california know the drill the world s leading theme park operator routinely stops and starts annual pass sales on the west coast to regulate the flow of locals who are loyal but also spend less than visitors on one day tickets disney has made it clear that it s prioritizing quality over quantity when it comes to guest counts preferring to make more money with fewer guests the controversial rollout of genie and lightning lane in disney world last month where guests have to pay more for access to expedited queues was an outrageous notion to disney fans but a common practice with other theme park operators keeping just the pixie pass going will help flesh out park traffic during the slow times of the year when it wants more annual pass holders around pixie pass holders will likely forgo premium access to expedited queues so they ll wait in standby lines more people in the standby queue in turn will encourage the less frequent visitors to pay up for genie and lightning lane to milk more out of their day at one of disney world s four gated theme park attractions the math is different during peak travel periods where it would prefer to fill the park with one time visitors and tourists who are going to pay premium prices over annual pass holders paying between 1 and 4 a day for year round access it s cruel math for the resort s biggest fans who don t have the means to spring for daily premium upgrades but if disney world wants to position itself as a more exclusive and premium experience it s an obvious move as a bellwether for travel and tourism stocks all eyes will be on disney the move to cut off big ticket annual pass sales as a way to increase revenue may to be a hard concept to wrap your head around at first however it s clear once you size up the limited capacity with the easing of international travel restrictions and robust crowds since disney world kicked off its 18 month celebration of the resort turning 50 it s the new reality the passes will likely return at some point next year if and when crowds start to thin out and just as we learned now it probably won t stick around for long
president biden is suffering badly from a problem over which he has little control inflation inflation reached its highest level in more than 30 years in october and as it has risen biden s approval rating has fallen precipitously biden renominated jerome powell as the chairman of the federal reserve on monday making the announcement the president acknowledged the problems caused by rising prices even as he boasted of the overall strength of the economy for all the progress we ve made we know we still face challenges serious challenges biden said from the white house s south court auditorium we know there is a lot of fear and uncertainty in the country we know it s tough for families to keep up with the rising costs of gasoline food housing and other essentials biden expressly linked the decision to give powell another term with the battle against inflation the president maintained that powell s patience skill and independence would help meet the fed s traditional objectives of achieving maximum employment and keeping inflation low and stable but political complications abound in addition to the fed s independence from the white house powell has frequently said that he views the current inflation as transitory many experts believe the chairman will be proved right the general thesis is that rising prices are being caused principally by supply chain clogs that will ease and by the statistical oddity whereby prices now are being compared to the first year of the pandemic when they were artificially low but there are several problems first powell could simply be wrong and even if inflation is transitory it ticking up rapidly in the near term could cause biden serious damage further expectations of high inflation have a nasty habit of becoming a self fulfilling prophecy if the population at large believes inflation is going to run hot for a while people seek wage increases and rush to buy things right away to lock in prices two factors that themselves add to inflationary pressure if the inflation train keeps barreling down the tracks the only obvious way to stop it is by raising interest rates which is the fed s decision not biden s and which would by its nature throw cold water on economic growth mark zandi the chief economist at moody s analytics said that the dreaded cycle of inflation is fairly simple and very painful workers demand a bigger wage increase because they think prices are going up businesses say fine no problem and pass the costs on to the consumer then the consumer says fine no problem because they are going to get a pay increase and that cycle is very hard to break he explained the only way to break it is by breaking the economy and obviously nobody wants to do that the scale of the political problem for biden was captured by a cbs news yougov poll released on sunday it made grim reading for the white house the poll indicated that 82 percent of americans are finding that items they usually buy are costing more than they did while 64 percent say those items are often not in stock a startling 67 percent of americans disapprove of biden s handling of inflation more than twice as many as the 33 percent who approve and the share of the population saying the economy is in a good state stands at the lowest of biden s presidency just 30 percent meanwhile republicans are taking every opportunity to highlight the problem and to connect it as directly as possible to americans day to day lives on monday the republican national committee rnc emailed reporters with a clip from nbc s today show in which a consumer affairs reporter suggested that one way to save money at thanksgiving would be to perhaps forgo the turkey the rnc email added how can you afford thanksgiving in biden s america skipping it altogether earlier this month sen kevin cramer r n d tweeted that inflation is not transitory it s big and it s because of the biden administration s terrible economic policies biden s defenders argue this view asserting that the current inflation spike is fueled by government spending is unfair again they cite the effects of the pandemic as well as the supply chain disruptions but political attacks that weaponize inflation tend to be potent even when their fairness is debatable according to julian zelizer a professor of history and public affairs at princeton university regardless of how bad is it can be used very effectively zelizer told this column inflation famously dogged former president carter in the late 1970s but zelizer noted that republicans also used it to attack former president lyndon b johnson and the democrats in the 1966 midterm elections democrats suffered a net loss of 47 house seats that year any kind of consumer price increase is something many americans will see whether it is gas prices or the price of meat zelizer said when the latest data was released showing year on year inflation hit 6 2 percent in october the highest figure since 1990 it also showed gas prices having risen 49 percent and the average price of a pound of chuck roast rising 29 percent biden is determined not to seem dismissive of the problem earlier this month he declared that reversing this trend is a top priority for me even as he grappled with fraught legislative negotiations on capitol hill on tuesday afternoon biden will deliver remarks on the economy and lowering prices for the american people according to the white house his last scheduled speech before heading to nantucket for the holiday all is far from lost for biden experts such as zandi believe inflation will take care of itself more or less in the medium term i think the november and december figures are going to look pretty ugly but by the start of next year we will start to see much better inflation statistics and by this time next year we will no longer be talking about inflation he predicted but by this time next year the midterm elections will already be over if high inflation sticks around for even a few more months it will fuel voter perceptions going into that contest if prices keep going higher for americans the cost for the president and his party is likely to be just as steep the memo is a reported column by niall stanage

a choppy day of trading on wall street ended with stocks mostly lower monday as a late afternoon burst of selling derailed the market from another all time high the s p 500 fell 0 3 after having been up as much as 1 earlier in the day and on pace to eclipse the record high it set last thursday the dow jones industrial average eked out a 0 1 gain while the nasdaq shed an early gain and slid 1 3 below the all time high it set on friday bond yields moved solidly higher gold prices fell and energy futures mostly rose the market was higher for much of the day as traders were relieved to learn that president joe biden would nominate jerome powell for a second four year term at the helm of the federal reserve a vote of confidence in powell s handling of central bank policies during the brutal disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic while stocks initially rallied on the news bonds sold off pushing yields broadly higher the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 1 63 from 1 54 late friday higher treasury yields make the more expensive areas of the market like technology stocks less attractive which may explain why there was more selling in stocks toward the end of the day as the bond market shifted brand connections growth areas of the stock market do not like higher bond yields said willie delwiche investment strategist at all star charts energy and financials however loved them the s p 500 fell 15 02 points to 4 682 94 the dow gained 17 27 points to 35 619 25 the tech heavy nasdaq gave up 202 68 points to 15 854 76 small company stocks also fell the russell 2000 index dropped 11 81 points or 0 5 to 2 331 35 u s stocks have been mostly pushing higher since early october as companies reported much stronger profits for the summer than analysts expected the benchmark s p 500 has posted a weekly gain in eight out of the last nine weeks notching successive record highs along the way still investors are seeking reassurance about how companies will fare in coming months as they grapple with higher raw materials costs and supply chain problems that could crimp future profits consumers have so far absorbed higher prices but analysts fear they could eventually rein in their spending if higher prices persist too long the federal reserve is starting to trim bond purchases that have helped maintain low interest rates in an effort to support the economy and markets as rising inflation hangs over the economic recovery investors are closely watching the fed to see whether pressure from rising inflation prompts it to speed up its plans for trimming bond purchases and raising its benchmark interest rate powell getting the nod is a sign that biden is staying the course on monetary policy and the fed is steadily moving toward normalizing policy said brad mcmillan chief investment officer for commonwealth financial network on the whole the fed is going to continue to be a force for monetary stability more than 55 of the stocks in the s p 500 rose monday but losses by big technology and communication companies outweighed gains elsewhere in the benchmark index chipmaker nvidia slid 3 1 and netflix fell 2 9 rising bond yields helped boost banks which rely on higher yields to charge more lucrative interest on loans bank of america rose 1 9 energy companies were among the gainers getting a bump as u s crude oil prices rose 0 9 chevron closed 1 8 higher companies that make household and personal care products made solid gains walmart rose 1 7 and supermarket operator kroger rose 4 8 companies that rely on consumer spending also weighed on the market led by a pullback in shares of target which fell 2 5 and amazon which lost 2 8 those retailers are on the cusp of the busy holiday shopping season which traditionally kicks off right after the thanksgiving holiday the dollar also strengthened against other currencies the price of gold a haven for when investors feel anxious fell 2 4 markets in europe and asia closed mixed as a resurgence of coronavirus outbreaks prompted some countries to look to stricter precautions to curb yet another wave of the pandemic investors face a relatively light schedule of economic updates during this holiday shortened week the national association of realtors reported surprisingly good sales for previously occupied homes in october on monday the commerce department will report october data for new home sales on wednesday along with data on third quarter gross domestic product markets in the u s will be closed on thursday for the thanksgiving holiday they will also close early on friday
president joe biden announced monday he s nominating jerome powell for a second four year term as federal reserve chair endorsing powell s stewardship of the economy through a brutal pandemic recession in which the fed s ultra low rate policies helped bolster confidence and revitalize the job market biden also said he would nominate lael brainard the lone democrat on the fed s board of governors and the preferred alternative to powell among many progressives as vice chair a separate position of vice chair for supervision a bank regulatory post remains vacant along with two other slots on the fed s board those positions will be filled in early december biden said his decision strikes a note of continuity and bipartisanship at a time when surging inflation is burdening households and raising risks to the economy s recovery in backing powell a republican who was first elevated to his post by president donald trump biden brushed aside complaints from progressives that the fed has weakened bank regulation and has been slow to take account of climate change in its supervision of banks washington dc september 30 federal reserve chairman jerome powell testifies at a house financial services committee hearing on oversight of the treasury department and federal reserve coronavirus pandemic response on capitol hill on september 30 expand if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the federal reserve and i have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that chair powell and dr brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs biden said in a statement in a second term to begin in february powell would face a difficult and high risk balancing act inflation has reached a three decade high causing hardships for millions of families clouding the recovery and undercutting the fed s mandate to keep prices stable but with the economy still 4 million plus jobs shy of its pre pandemic level the fed has yet to meet its other mandate of maximizing employment next year the fed is widely expected to begin raising its benchmark interest rate with financial markets pricing in two increases if the fed moves too slowly to raise rates inflation may accelerate further and force the central bank to take more draconian steps later to rein it in potentially causing a recession yet if the fed hikes rates too quickly it could choke off hiring and the recovery if confirmed powell would remain one of the world s most powerful economic officials by either raising or lowering its short term interest rate the fed seeks to either cool or stimulate growth and hiring and to keep prices stable its efforts to direct the u s economy the largest in the world typically have global consequences the fed s benchmark rate which has been pegged near zero since the pandemic hammered the economy in march 2020 influences a wide range of consumer and business borrowing costs including for mortgages and credit cards the fed also oversees the nation s largest banks powell s renomination must be approved by the senate banking committee and then confirmed by the full senate which is widely expected he has won support from some liberal democrats such as sen sherrod brown of ohio chair of the banking committee and moderate democrats such as jon tester of montana he was also endorsed monday by sen pat toomey r pennsylvania the senior republican on the banking panel and will likely receive widespread support from republicans i look forward to working with powell to stand up to wall street and stand up for workers so that they share in the prosperity they create brown said three democratic senators including sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts have said they will oppose powell s renomination warren called him a dangerous man because of his efforts to loosen bank regulations while sens jeff merkley of oregon and sheldon whitehouse of rhode island said he was insufficiently committed to using the fed s oversight of the financial system to combat climate change biden and his staff have been consulting members of congress on powell s appointment a white house source said insisting on anonymity to discuss private conversations in the administration biden recently met with warren at the white house for her input the source said and the president talked with both brainard and powell on friday wall street cheered the renomination with stock prices rallying and measures of fear in the market easing immediately after the announcement the s p 500 is on pace to close at another record powell a 68 year old lawyer by training was nominated for the fed s board of governors in 2011 by president barack obama after a lucrative career in private equity and having served in a number of federal government roles unlike his three immediate predecessors powell lacks a ph d in economics yet he has earned generally high marks for managing perhaps the most important financial position in the world especially in his response to the coronavirus induced recession still this year s spike in inflation has forced the powell fed to dial back its economic stimulus sooner than it had envisioned at its latest meeting in early november the central bank said it would start reducing this month its 120 billion monthly bond purchases and likely end them by mid 2022 those purchases have been intended to keep longer term borrowing costs low to spur borrowing and spending powell has avoided much of the blame for inflation at least on capitol hill even though one of the fed s mandates is to maintain stable prices through its control of interest rates republicans in congress have instead pointed to biden s economic policies as the main culprit most economists blame a surge in demand for goods like cars furniture and appliances along with supply shortages for pushing up prices for months powell characterized inflation as transitory but more recently the fed chair conceded that higher prices have persisted longer than he had expected at a news conference this month powell acknowledged that high inflation could last into late summer 2022 brainard s elevation to the fed s no 2 position follows the key role she played in the fed s emergency response to the pandemic recession she is part of a troika of top policymakers that includes powell and richard clarida whom she will replace as vice chair in february brainard was also an architect of the fed s new policy framework adopted in august 2020 under which it said it would no longer raise rates simply because the unemployment rate had fallen to a low level that could spur inflation instead the fed said it would await actual evidence that prices are rising that reflects a view among some fed officials that low unemployment and even rising wages no longer necessarily accelerate inflation yet that new policy approach which was crafted in an atmosphere of persistently low inflation has come under heavy pressure brainard also played a key role in the fed s re definition of its maximum employment goal as broad and inclusive that means it now takes into account such measures as the unemployment rate for african americans and not just for americans as a whole in its policy decisions she has also carved out a distinct role as an opponent of the fed s moves in the past four years to loosen banking regulations that had been tightened after the 2008 financial crisis since 2018 she has been the lone dissenter on 20 votes related to financial rules in march 2020 for example she opposed a regulatory change that she said would reduce the amount of reserves large banks were required to hold to guard against losses brainard also has taken a leading role in assessing how the fed could more directly take account of climate change in its supervision of banks in a speech last month brainard said the fed would likely provide guidance to the banks it supervises on how they can better assess the risks that climate change poses to their loan portfolios though she did not provide a timeline many environmental groups say loans to oil and gas companies as well as to commercial real estate developers could default and cause large losses at banks should environmental damage worsen or renewable energy provide a greater share of power generation climate change she said is projected to have profound effects on the economy and the financial system and it is already inflicting damage ___ associated press writer josh boak contributed
