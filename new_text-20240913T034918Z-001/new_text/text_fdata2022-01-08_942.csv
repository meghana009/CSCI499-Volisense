more 1 the problem with tightening policy is interest rate sensitivity says ray dalio 2 part i 3 part ii showthe problem with tightening policy is interest rate sensitivity says ray dalio part i sara eisen the money printing and debt binge that the world s governments and central banks have embarked on to prop up their economies is one of the three main themes that ray dalio takes on in his study of the last 500 years in his new book principles for dealing with the changing world order i sat down with him earlier today to discuss it and asked how concerned investors should be today about the fed removing all that stimulus as we ve seen play out in the market in recent days ray dalio here s how the machine works we ve created a lot of money and debt a lot of buying power everybody received all that but you don t create more wealth when you create more money and we re at the part of the cycle where all those checks went out and all that money came in and and yet before we re just at the beginning of the phase that all that money is being spent and building increasing the inflation and with it throughout history it causes goods services and financial asset prices to rise and it s and so we re in the part of the cycle we re in the third year this next year will be the third year in the cycle and naturally there will be a tightening of monetary policy and the problem with that tightening of monetary policy is that there s a great deal of interest rate sensitivity and because it s gotten so far and so extreme just the pulling back of that is a very delicate thing we re in a situation that the raising of interest rates and the tightening of monetary policy begins the process in the third year of a cycle as we re in that normally is not enough to send the cycle down it can send financial asset prices lower but i would expect that if you understand the short term cycle this typically seven year type of cycle in terms of expansions and recessions it s the beginning of the testing of the brakes eisen so not necessarily a recession but could see some some increased volatility you ve said you don t want to be in cash right now and you don t want to be in bonds but if the fed does embark on this tightening and slows the economy and the markets that that feels like it would be a pretty turbulent time for equities dalio the important thing to realize i think is that the federal reserve and all central banks will have to keep a negative interest rate a negative real interest rate right now bond yields and have you know a negative real interest rate of you know nearly 1 5 2 depending on where and the cash rate is minus 4 so that all investors will be in a position where the value of their money in cash or in bonds will not keep up with inflation i think investors need to think about think about returns differently i think they look at the amount of the returns in nominal dollars how many dollars do i have and they don t look at the amount that they have in relation to real dollars in other words adjusted for inflation and while there can be somewhat of a tightening it can t be enough of a tightening to raise those returns on cash and bonds to be good enough to compensate for inflation because if it is if you had that would require a very large rise in interest rates that would first set the economy down so when we look at the circumstances today just imagine with the political polarity that we have as we re coming into the 2022 elections and then the 2024 elections if the federal reserve tightened the monetary policy enough to cause a downturn if we re at each other s throats when these are the everybody s received so much money and this is about as good as you re going to get just imagine the consequences that that would have so the federal reserve i don t believe even though they re behind the curve by a lot i don t believe they re going to be able to catch up and make cash and bonds an attractive investment eisen it sounds like you don t see very many hikes this year do you think they can get three done as expected dalio i think that the i think that the the expected three rate hike is a reasonable thing but they re going to be testing and because of the duration of assets is long in other words when interest rates come down sensitivity to markets is greater even modest changes are going to have an effect and so you re going to see a monetary tightening taking place also where the rate of fiscal spending and what will come down both will be very large the fiscal deficit will be very large and the monetary stimulation by level basis will be very large but it ll be coming down so they ll have to be testing those brakes and finding out we all will find out you know exactly how much they can handle it s a risky situation eisen no doubt and you ve said for investors to be diversified in this situation within the equity market what do you do with tech stocks which seem in the direct crossfire here when it comes to fed tightening dalio well again tech stocks have a very long duration meaning they re sensitive to interest rate changes because the earnings and the payoff of tech stocks is very much in the future so they re particularly sensitive to interest rate changes and also they ve experienced in many cases a bubble type of behavior and so they re more sensitive than you know the meat and potato guy of basic company type stock so that type of behavior this is not an environment that s particularly conducive to those types of investments eisen as we ve seen so you just put out a warning just moving on to your second big theme around the wealth gap and the political gap about some key elections coming up including in this country 2024 where you say it s plausible that we might not have a clear result or disputed result how would that manifest do you think in the markets what should investors be doing with that type of situation dalio well i think that investors look at their whole position you know they re they re people they think about many things you know where they live and so on so let me just describe that environment i think we re coming into an environment we are in an environment in which there might be irreconcilable differences and that people are just adjusting people are moving not just for taxes but they re moving to places that they feel might be more hospitable that causes a dynamic sometimes it causes a hollowing out as people take richer people leave to go to places that they feel more comfortable in causing them loss of a tax base and more more conflict and so also this dynamic in which there s maybe a question of rule of law or the constitution resolving these types of things has implications in terms of the locations or the ways that people diversify so i think that investors and in the broader sense people s you know seeking their wellbeing have to be aware of those things it could to some extent it could be state taxes the financial conditions of the places that they re in i think they have to be aware of those and i think they have to be aware of that in the broader sense so it also moves in a direction that is very questionable you know what opens the pandora s box to what it means when we don t have the same rule of law working in the same way you know that opens a lot of questions we ll have to see how that transpires but there s that issue that that wealth gap will be between you know increasingly more and more extreme left and right and more and more and that ll have implications for taxes locally and federal taxes and the like part ii eisen conflict between the world s two biggest economies is only heating up and the tension over taiwan certainly a risk factor for investors this year it s one of the other big issues ray dalio takes on in his new book principles for dealing with the changing world order which is a study of the last 500 years including the ascendancy of china as a global superpower as far as us china tensions go i did ask dalio when i spoke to him earlier whether he thinks investors are understanding the risks and ramifications of this brewing battle dalio there are five types of wars basically there s a trade war a technology war a geopolitical influence war a capital war and could be a military war all of those five have implications we re seeing all of those intensified they have investment implications they have geopolitical implications and i don t think that they re well understood so i think they need to be better understood and that s why i wrote the book eisen what do you think investors should do about that for instance there are a lot of us multinational companies that do a lot of business in china are they at risk or or are you talking about something bigger and broader around the markets dalio right now our economies are so interlinked everybody is involved right every time you buy nike sneakers or you buy a you know an apple product buy so much more than a fifth of our imports of manufactured goods come from china all of that general motors sells more cars in china than they sell in the united states there s an inter connectedness there that you know on i think unavoidable and the separation of those things would be catastrophic so i don t believe that either side wants to produce that kind of separation i think that would just be terrible for everybody so i don t think that that s going to be as much of an issue there are geopolitical issues such as the taiwan issue and so on so but i don t think that these will be allowed to get out of control because the consequences would be so bad so i think it ll be more like a competition and the most important thing is where will there be strengths and capabilities in other words on each side and in this competition the main thing is be strong be capable and you want to invest and in the places that are strong and capable and i think you want to be diversified to some extent of course in the united states to some extent elsewhere perhaps some in china but some places around the world i think from an investor perspective the important thing the most important things are to longer term not be very much in cash or bonds as we have this tightening there ll be of course some corrections but we re in a new paradigm in which those will be bad assets and that too it s important to have a well diversified portfolio and that diversification includes not just sectors or an asset classes but countries eisen the other factor of competition here between the us and china which which really spoke to me in your book and you look at the world a lot through this lens is the the competition for reserve currency status and the rise and fall of reserve currencies which you ve looked at the dutch the british and now america and how we go into this new world order do you see ultimately the competition between the us dollar and the chinese renminbi and do you see china taking over that reserve currency status at some point dalio changes in reserve currency status are evolutionary it s almost like speaking a language you know if everybody if the world language is english most everyone will learn english and then it evolves over a period of time but it also has supply demand issues i think it s an evolutionary type of change i think the united states is testing the limits because when there s a production of a lot of debt that is money it s promised to receive money that is then has to be sold and the world right now is overweighted has a lot of us dollar denominated debt therefore promises to receive dollars and as and it s going to receive a lot more because there ll be large deficits lots of bonds that have to be sold and as a result of that the world is also underweighted in china and assets it s diversifying more not china today is the largest trading country in the world and also large larger than the united states in terms of the important capital flows for lending and and such and so there is an evolution in favor of china having a larger share of the reserve currency status i think that is our greatest strength right now the reserve currency status because it s that which allows us to print money and print the world s currency wow that s a great power and and to have it accepted it is being taken for granted and it s being challenged should the united states lose that because of the supply demand issue that i m referring to that would be very bad i think what you re seeing right now is that all currencies are going down in value relative to goods and services because i think we re in a situation where all countries are producing more debt and money and not so much relative to each other and that s having the effects on the markets and the economies that we re seeing eisen so how do you diversify away if all the major currencies are devaluing themselves even if we get little blips like a 6 rise in the dollar last year how ultimately do you see it playing out dalio i think currency is a medium of exchange and a store hold of wealth i think one has to realize that it s an ineffective store hold of wealth in other words when you hold a an interest rate an asset that depreciates in relationship to the purchasing power and so what that means is that the most monies it s not going to be an effective store hold of wealth and that s why one should look at other store holds as well that means a well diversified portfolio of assets that don t depreciate depreciate in the kind of paradigm that we re now in this is a paradigm in which there will be more depreciation of the value of money not not every day not every month not every six months but over the period that over an extended period of time so we should look at other sources of store hold of wealth eisen like what is bitcoin in that category because it seems to me that regulators can just regulate it out of existence dalio i think we re entering an era where the question will be what are the monies what are the store holds of wealth what are those items that you can globally take from move from one country to another to buy things some that the governments will not be able to influence such as gold and bitcoin and so on but there ll be other currencies i think that you ll start to see the renminbi china s currency become more internationalized and the range of choices will be increasing you know and we re entering a new era of what is the money that is the store hold of wealth so that kind of competition i think we ll have to see bitcoin has accomplished a lot over the last 11 years it s shown that it s not been hacked and it s still operative but there s constant evolution there s things like nfts and so many different things that are new i don t think that they re nearly as likely to be supported as other investments and those other investments to some extent might be gold they can be inflation index bonds which haven t been given nearly enough attention by investors so i would expect you know there will be an interesting redefinition of what the popular monies are and you re correct no country wants to have an alternative currency because controlling the currency is one of the most valuable important powers for a government to have and certainly history has shown that there s the risk of outlawing those that compete with the regular currency so i think it ll be interesting times in the years ahead particularly as we get into you know 2023 and 2024 with the political situations and all that s going on even globally with the competition from china and other places it s going to be interesting eisen no question so just to wrap it all up i mean the main theme from you and your studies and this and these takeaways are investors should be diversified but not in bonds and not in cash so so it sounds like gold is definitely on your list stocks but not necessarily tech stocks just just give us a sense of what you do think is safe in this increasingly scary environment dalio well to think about for example also including inflation index bonds as a possibility in the portfolio to be thinking about other countries and when thinking about other countries to think about them differently like i have just a few basic criteria and looking at almost every country as well as companies are they earning more than they re spending so do they have good finances good income statement and balance sheet do they have internal order do they have civility so do their populations behave well with each other so they have internal order and do they have a risk or not of external order and so when i look at different places that s kind of a checklist that i keep in mind in terms of finding out in this kind of an environment what will be the safer assets updated on jan 7 2022 10 27 am
economists have cautioned that job growth may slow in january and possibly february because of the spike in omicron cases washington the nation s unemployment rate fell in december to a healthy 3 9 a pandemic low even as employers added a modest 199 000 jobs evidence that they are struggling to fill jobs with many americans still reluctant to return to the workforce the drop in the jobless rate from 4 2 in november indicated that many more americans found work last month indeed despite the slight hiring gain reported by businesses 651 000 more people said they were employed in december compared with november still the data reported friday by the labor department reflected the state of the job market in early december before the spike in covid 19 infections began to disrupt the economy economists have cautioned that job growth may slow in january and possibly february because of the spike in omicron cases which have forced millions of newly infected workers to stay home and quarantine for now steady hiring is being driven by strong consumer demand that has remained resilient despite chronic supply shortages consumer spending and business purchases of machinery are likely propelling the economy to a robust annual growth rate of roughly 7 in the final three months of 2021 americans confidence in the economy rose slightly in december according to the conference board suggesting that spending probably was healthy for much of last month wages also rose sharply in december with average hourly pay jumping 4 7 compared with a year ago that pay increase is a sign that companies are competing fiercely to fill their open jobs a record high wave of quitting as many workers seek better jobs is helping fuel pay raises low unemployment and rapid pay increases could further heighten inflation as companies raise prices to cover higher labor costs price increases have already surged to a four decade high prompting a sharp pivot by the federal reserve from keeping rates low to support hiring to moving toward raising interest rates to combat inflation most economists expect the fed to raise its benchmark short term rate now pegged near zero in march and to do so two or three additional times this year companies are paying up for workers said neil dutta an economist at renaissance macro research this is consistent with inflation well above 2 which keeps the pressure on the fed to raise interest rates among those benefiting from the intense competition for workers is patrick freeman a custodian at a furniture factory in hickory north carolina in late november freeman 57 was given a permanent job after having spent two years as a temp freeman got the good news at a time when many of his colleagues have found other jobs elsewhere leaving the company short staffed they ve scattered he said referring to his fellow employees they re really short in a lot of areas i m sticking around having come on board permanently freeman enjoyed a pay jump from 12 to 16 an hour after a 60 day probation period he will also receive health dental and vision benefits and he s eligible for the company s employee stock ownership program more broadly through the economy though job growth will likely take a big hit this month from the omicron variant which has sickened millions of americans forced airlines to cancel thousands of flights reduced traffic at restaurants and bars and caused some major school systems to close potentially keeping some parents at home with children and unable to work that could make it even harder for companies to remain fully staffed and could slow the economy too michael pearce an economist at capital economics notes that millions of workers will likely be quarantining at home next week for those who aren t paid about one fifth of the u s workforce lacks sick leave their jobs won t be counted by the government that would lower the employment gain reported by businesses for january omicron has forced so many workers to call in sick it s disrupting businesses ranging from ski resorts to airlines to hospitals alaska airlines said it s cutting 10 of its flights in january because of an unprecedented number of employees calling in sick the wave of infections is also likely weighing on jobs at restaurants and bars the number of americans willing to eat at restaurants started to slip in late december according to the reservations website opentable restaurant traffic was nearly at pre pandemic levels for much of november but had fallen nearly 25 below those levels by dec 30 based on a weekly average of opentable data but because omicron is less virulent than previous covid 19 variants and few states or localities have moved to limit business operations economists say they believe its economic impact will be short lived many companies are looking past the omicron wave and still adding workers angie podolak director of human capital at beneficial state bank based in oakland california said the company which employs about 195 people is enjoying strong growth in auto lending and is seeking to fill 12 jobs though some of its front line workers have called in sick podolak said the bank hasn t had to reduce hours or lose business because of omicron nor has it had to slow its recruiting efforts beneficial already conducts job interviews by video it s really just been business as usual for us podolak said i m knocking on wood and crossing my fingers right now but we haven t seen a significant impact on our recruiting the aftermath of the pandemic has made the government s survey of company payrolls more volatile with one month s data often followed by a sharply different trend a month or two later on friday for example november s job gain of 210 000 was revised up to 249 000 and october s gain originally reported at 531 000 was upgraded to a strong 648 000 december s report also reflects a divergence in two surveys that the government conducts each month the unemployment rate is calculated from a survey of households for last month this survey found that 651 000 more people reported that they were employed a separate survey of employers called the payroll survey reported just 199 000 added jobs though the results of the two surveys typically match up over the long run they can differ sharply in any one month

history the first time the unemployment rate has been under 4 percent in the first year of a presidential term in 50 years 3 9 percent unemployment rate years faster than experts said we d be able do it and we have added 6 4 million new jobs since january of last year in one year and that s one of the most that s the most jobs in any calendar year by any president in history how how how did that happen well the american rescue plan got the economy off its back and moving again back on its feet getting over 20 200 million americans fully vaccinated got people out of their homes and back to work even in the face of wave after wave of covid we got schools open we got booster shots we brought down the poverty rate and went from 20 million people on unemployment rolls a year ago to under 2 million on the unemployment rolls today america is back to work and there are more historical accomplishments the increase in americans joining the labor force was the fastest this year of any year since 1996 and among prime age workers ages 25 to 54 their increase in labor force participation was the biggest in 43 years record job creation record unemployment declines record increases in the people in the labor force i would argue the biden economic plan is working and it s getting america back to work back on its feet but the record doesn t stop there today s report also tells us that record wage gains especially for workers in some of america s toughest jobs women and men who work in the frontline jobs in restaurants hotels travel tourism desk clerks line cooks wait staff bellmen they all saw their wages at a historic high the highest in history their pay went up almost 16 percent this year far ahead of inflation which is still a concern overall wage gains for all workers who were not supervisors went up more in 2021 than any year in four decades there s been a lot of press coverage about people quitting their jobs well today s report tells you why americans are moving up to better jobs with better pay with better benefits that s why they re quitting their jobs this isn t about workers walking away and refusing to work it s about workers able to take a step up to provide for themselves and their families this is the kind of recovery i promised and hope for for the american people where the biggest benefits go to the people who work the hardest and are more often left behind the people who have been ignored before the people who just want a decent chance to build a decent life for their families just given a clear shot for them wages are up job opportunities are up layoffs are down to the lowest levels in decades and there are more chances than ever to get ahead no wonder one leading economic a excuse me analyst described what we ve accomplished in 2021 as the strongest first year economic track record of any president in the last 50 years today america is the only leading economy in the world where the economy as a whole is stronger than before the pandemic now you ll hear republicans say today that my talking about this strong record shows that i don t understand i don t understand a lot of people are still suffering they say well they are or that i m not focused on inflation malarkey they want to talk down the recovery because they voted against the legislation that made it happen they voted against the tax cuts for middle class families they voted against the funds we needed to reopen our schools to keep police officers and firefighters on the job to lower healthcare premiums they voted against the funds we re now using to buy covid booster shots and more antiviral pills i refuse to let them stand in the way of this recovery and now my focus is on keeping this recovery strong and durable notwithstanding republican obstructionism because you know i know that even as jobs and families incomes have recovered families are still feeling the pinch of prices and costs so we re taking that on as well and that s and the way to do that is not to step back from the economic progress we ve made but to build on it i ve laid out a three part plan to address costs families are facing one the first part of that plan fixing the supply chain two protecting consumers and promoting competition three lowering kitchen table costs including with my build back better act first the supply chain a couple of months ago we heard a lot of dire warnings about supply chain problems leading to a crisis around the holidays thanksgiving and christmas we acted we brought together business and labor to solve the problems the much predicted crisis didn t occur the grinch did not steal christmas nor any votes laughs look the number of containers sitting on docks for more than eight days is now down by nearly 40 percent the number of packages delivered on time was nearly 99 percent workers stayed on the job and did the job to bring goods to consumers we re continuing our work to speed up every step of this process the ports trains trucking my bipartisan infrastructure plan law included significant investments in each of these areas and i want to thank the 19 republicans in the senate and the 13 in the house who stepped in to help pass it so we didn t have to face another filibuster and lose a very badly needed plan the second area protecting american consumers in the last few decades in too many industries a handful of giant companies dominated the market in meat processing railroads shipping too often they use their power to squeeze out smaller competitors stifle new entrepreneurs and raise the prices reducing options for consumers and exploiting workers to keep wages unfairly low you see that in your own life just look at your grocery bill and the cost of meat it s not because the cattle farmers are getting rich matter of fact it s the exact opposite it s because fewer processors can charge grocery stores much more money for their ground beef for example you ve heard me say it before capitalism without competition isn t capitalism it s exploitation and i m determined to end the exploitation later this month i ll be meeting with my competition council which includes key economic leaders from across my administration to keep pushing for more broad action and increase competition across our economy because healthy competition produces lower prices higher wages and more dynamic and innovative economies that makes everybody better off third i m working to reduce the largest cost burden of household budgets costs that don t need to be such a burden and the biggest weapon in our arsenal is my build back better act which will reduce what families have to pay for basic necessities to live a life raise a family from prescription drugs to healthcare to childcare and more help so families can cover the costs of raising their children and caring for their loved ones their older loved ones as we ve seen over and over and over again throughout this pandemic if people can t find affordable childcare they can t work right now there are 2 million extremely qualified women who have not been able to return to work because they can t find or can t afford childcare on healthcare we ve made quality coverage through the aca more affordable than ever before with families saving an average of 2 400 on their annual premiums and four out of five consumers finding quality coverage for under 10 a month and the result when you reduce the cost of healthcare more people can afford to get it over 4 million people have gained coverage since i became president you ve heard me say it a million times having healthcare is also about peace of mind for example we re going to make it so nobody will pay more than 35 a month for insulin imagine you re a parent and the one of the 200 000 children in this country have type 1 diabetes insulin can cost on average it s averaged 650 bucks a month but can not cost as much as a 1 000 a month even though a vial of that insulin costs about 10 bucks to manufacture we can do all of this and we can do it without increasing inflation without increasing the deficit nobody making more than 400 000 a year less than 400 000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes so we re going to keep working on these fronts some of them have components that are immediate like unsticking the supply chain some will show their benefits over time like investments in infrastructure but all will help america fam america s families and it s urgent we get moving on all of it without delay because at this moment as a country we face an important choice do we take the steps to create an economy with strong sustainable growth higher wages and more opportunity for all americans or do we settle for an economy that wasn t working for our middle class even before the pandemic began an economy that delivered sluggish growth stagnant wages and limited opportunities i m not an economist but i ve been doing this a long time but here s the way to look at it if car prices are too high right now there are two solutions you increase the supply of cars by making more of them or you reduce demand for cars by making americans poorer that s the choice believe it or not there s a lot of people in the second camp you ll hear them complain that wages are rising too fast among the very middle class and working class people who have endured decades of stalled incomes their view of the economy says the only solution to our current and future challenges is to make the working families that are the backbone in our country poorer or keep them in the state they re in it s a pessimistic vision and i reject it i reject the idea that we should somehow punish people because they finally have a little more breathing room america doesn t need to settle for less we need an economy that has the capacity to generate more growth more jobs and more opportunity for all americans that s why we re going to keep doing everything we can to one unstick the bottlenecks that are keeping goods from getting to consumers two build better infrastructure so that we can get parts and goods to factory floors quicker and cheaper three bring more of that production back here to the united states to make our supply chain more secure let s make america let s make what we re selling in america made in america so we aren t at risk of foreign supply chains and shipping delays and in doing so get more americans working in jobs with rising wages now i want to be clear i m confident that the federal reserve will act to achieve their dual goals of full employment at stable prices and make sure that price increases do not become entrenched over a long term with the independence that they need but the best way that i as president and that congress as a legislature can tackle high prices is by building a more productive economy with greater capacity to deliver for the american people a growing economy where people have more opportunities more small businesses opening and i might add parenthetically there s 30 percent increase in the application for new small businesses and goods get to market faster an economy where we don t just grow the economic pie to make sure people who bake the pie get a fair slice of it as well for too long republicans have thrown around terms like pro growth and supply side economics to drive an economic agenda that didn t deliver enough growth and supplied more wealth to those who were already were very well off from day one my economic agenda has been different it has been about taking a fundamentally new approach to our economy one that sees the prosperity of working families as the solution not the problem there s never been a time i can think of when the middle class and working class have done well that the wealthy haven t done very well working families need to get a fighting chance and by the way the stock market the last guy s measure of everything is about 20 percent higher than it was when my predecessor was there it has hit record after record after record on my watch while making things more equitable for working class people at the same time we ve created jobs reduced unemployment raised wages as i ve always said when working people do well everybody benefits i m determined to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out because when we do we get more growth higher wages more jobs and over time lower prices but don t take my word for it just look at the results historical results revults results for working americans economists call this increase to productive capacity of our economy i call it building back better that s what we re going to keep doing we re going to keep building i thank you all very much and i ll get a chance to talk to all of you on tuesday when i am down in georgia talking about voting rights but thank you q mr president should americans prepare to live with covid forever sir mr president should americans prepare to live with covid forever sir q is covid here to stay sir should americans be prepared that covid is here to stay the president no i don t think covid is here to stay having covid in the environment here and in the world is probably here to stay but covid as we re dealing with it now is not here to stay the new normal doesn t have to be we have so many more tools we re developing and continue to develop that can contain covid and other strains of covid so i don t believe this is that if you take a look we re very different today than we were a year ago even though we still have problems but 90 percent of the schools are open now it was 98 it s down to 90 but is open now because we spent the time and the money in the recovery act to provide for the ability of schools to remain open and you know what we re doing now is we talked about you know how we re dealing with with testing well you know we have been doing now we ve had 300 million tests per month so far and that s 11 million tests a day in addition to that we ve we re in the process of ordering 500 000 new tests and so we re going to be able to control this the new normal is not going to be what it is now it s going to be better thank you very much 11 55 a m est
when democratic senator joe manchin announced that he would not support us president joe biden s build back better act effectively dooming the president s signature legislative initiative he cited america s staggering debt his concerns echoed those of biden s republican opponents who insist that all that spending would expand the deficit and leave future generations groaning under the weight of a heavy tax burden but would it proponents of modern monetary theory would beg to differ the build back better act s detractors subscribe to the conventional ricardian assumption that over time a government must balance its budget just like a private firm but mmt holds that as long as debt is denominated in a country s own currency its government cannot default excessive government spending can fuel inflation but as long as prices are stable governments can spend away using fiscal deficits rather than tax revenues to support employment and finance public goods while mmt is not new it has been gaining traction in recent years and a significant share of its following nowadays comes across almost as zealots unwilling to brook any dissent meanwhile mainstream economists largely regard mmt as tantamount to professional heresy with some avoiding so much as uttering its name needless to say the rigid stances of mmt s devotees and detractors have not lent themselves to productive discussion this is a serious loss for policymakers because mmt includes both problematic propositions and perfectly reasonable even highly useful positions in the latter category the idea that stands out is essentially functional finance theory proposed by abba lerner in 1943 fft holds that because governments borrowing in their own currency can always print money to service their debts but still face inflation risks they should aim to balance supply and demand at full employment rather than fret about balancing the budget in lerner s view well targeted deficit spending is an effective way for governments to maintain prosperity fft supports the case for build back better which includes spending on goods like education infrastructure and the green transition the biden administration claims that the act would be financed entirely with tax revenues but even if that turned out not to be the case as his detractors predict wouldn t inadequate infrastructure depleted human capital and a planet ravaged by climate change hurt future generations more to be sure us policymakers broadly recognise the importance of such investments especially in infrastructure the us congress recently passed with bipartisan support a 1tn spending plan that aims to advance objectives like overhauling the electricity grid upgrading railways and expanding access to high speed internet but even some democrats demanded that the new funds contained in the package be entirely offset by new tax revenue a development that highlights enduring resistance to the logic of mmt or fft and yet as the wall street journal s james mackintosh recently argued this may be largely a rhetorical issue after all he notes the infrastructure act is in fact debt financed anyway and it may well be that many of build back better s supporters are not convinced by biden s claims that tax revenues will offset the new spending but are not that concerned about it but mmt and fft are not synonymous mmt includes two additional propositions that in my view are unsound the first is that monetary policy should be conducted in such a way that it facilitates fiscal policy decisions such as by maintaining a constant very low interest rate this expresses a crucial feature of post keynesian economics interest rates rather than money supply are the key variables this defies conventional economic thinking which focuses on the interaction of stock and flow variables and the role of expectations more important if interest rates are held constant and prices start to rise inflation could snowball mmt proponents would advocate tax hikes as a way to manage aggregate demand and control inflation but given what we know about asset dynamics this would be a hard sell mmt s second problematic proposition that governments should provide a job guarantee in order to maintain full employment while mitigating inflationary pressures is even harder to defend it simply moves too far in the direction of socialist labour allocation and enables governments to wield excessive control over workers wages when i explained mmt to former japanese prime minister shinzo abe he compared it to preparing fugu if done correctly the puffer fish is a sublime delicacy but if the chef makes even a minor mistake the diner could suffer a rapid and painful death it is an apt metaphor if policymakers adopt the positive elements of mmt essentially fft they will gain new options for bolstering prosperity for current and future generations but one wrong cut and the results could be fatal project syndicate koichi hamada professor emeritus at yale university was a special adviser to former japanese prime minister shinzo abe

another giant jobs miss our fathomless disfaith in experts is validated yet again the united states department of labor issued december s unemployment figures this morning a dow jones survey of economic wiseacres soothsaid that december would register 422 000 fresh jobs how many fresh jobs did december register 199 000 under half the projected figure here mr nick bunker economic research director with indeed wrings his trembling hands the new year is off to a rocky start these less than stellar numbers were recorded before the omicron variant started to spread significantly in the united states hopefully the current wave of the pandemic will lead to limited labor market damage the labor market is still recovering but a more sustainable comeback is only possible in a post pandemic environment when can you expect a post pandemic environment perhaps summer the summer of which year we do not pretend to know perhaps the summer of 2031 when each american all 330 million has endured his 81st vaccination at the mercy of the pandemic by way of understatement here is daniel zhao senior economist with glassdoor today s jobs report is a disappointing bookend to a historic year in the job market he continues the year ended on a sour note with job gains slowing even more than in november new and unpredictable waves of covid 19 variants threaten to throw the recovery into reverse showing that we re still at the mercy of the pandemic just so but hadn t the economists who had forecast 422 000 december jobs read the newspapers authentic experts might have mixed them into their mathematics why have experts and so we wonder why have experts at all would you trust the weatherman who had forecast a roasting 100 degrees when the next day s temperature came in at 48 would you trust the stockjobber who told you stock x would scale 100 when stock x plunged to 48 why then should you trust an economist mob who had forecast the economy would add 422 000 december jobs when the economy added only 199 000 december jobs where is their amour propre their self respect as a professional body decent men might scurry off gushing apologies and pledging to flee the forecasting business forevermore but these same men will return next month with january s number plucking most likely with an identical accuracy as they will in february march april may june july august september october november december january and february again might these wrong way charlies occasionally strike bull s eye they may yes but we would remind you even the inert grandfather clock gives accurate time every 12 hours the luxury of ignorance yet we sympathize with these professional men they are experts men of dignity secular clergymen the world hangs upon their guesswork they are under considerable pressure to near the target and so they approach their prognostications with all the weight afforded somber men when they botch the job which is nearly always they are in for a terrible razzing the daily reckoning carries no such burden upon its slender rather hunched shoulders that is because we enjoy the luxury of ignorance mr milton friedman once claimed he could give you a number or a date but not both but your editor is rather more modest he can give you neither nor does he try we do not claim to know next month s unemployment rate no one requests it of us and who would listen if we did as well consult a bowling champion a gravedigger a justice of the supreme court indeed as well consult an economist nor do we pretend to know this year s gdp or how the dow jones will trade on dec 10 2022 or on jan 10 2022 we are far more adept at raising questions than answering questions we pull noses and bite ankles we pick nits we point our finger and put out our tongue we laugh again we enjoy the luxury of ignorance the damndest of all damnable lies the unemployment rate is but a statistic and statistics are the damndest of all damnable lies you have a nation divided equally between 11 foot giants and 3 foot dwarfs does the average citizen stand 7 feet in height half the population is black half the population is white is the average citizen gray half are male half are female is the average citizen hermaphroditic or consider a man age 23 unknowingly hosts the coronavirus he manifests no symptoms of sickness one blue day a steamroller drives over him was it the virus that made a hotcake of him or the roller the centers for disease control might claim it was the virus here is our tort against statistics as we have argued before statistics are the bureaucrat s sharpest weapon the government s goons it is the government statistician who collects sorts analyzes worries tortures and weaponizes economic data the mangled data is then conscripted into the service of government policy x or government policy y that is the statistician is the government s roughneck its henchman its goon as we have also written before without his statistics the government is a plodding doofus it is a blinded fumbling cyclops speared through its one and only eye but this graspless senseless sightless beast in fact presents a reduced menace than a sighted one more statistics less liberty explains the late economist murray rothbard certainly only by statistics can the federal government make even a fitful attempt to plan regulate control or reform various industries or impose central planning on the entire economic system if the government received no railroad statistics for example how in the world could it even start to regulate railroad rates finances and other affairs how could the government impose price controls if it didn t even know what goods have been sold on the market and what prices were prevailing indeed in the absence of labor statistics how would the government know when to stimulate the economy and how would its central bank plot the famously false phillips curve statistics form the very eyes and ears of government says mr rothbard statistics are the eyes and ears of the interventionists of the intellectual reformer the politician and the government bureaucrat cut off those eyes and ears destroy those crucial guidelines to knowledge and the whole threat of government intervention is almost completely eliminated we would add that statistics are likewise the nose of government statistics let government sniff around statistics enable government to be so intolerably nosy that is without statistics the government could not govern us as it would government tracks statistics as the train robber tracks railroad schedules and for much the same purpose goodbye to the bill of rights we trust government statistics no further than we trust a dog with our dinner or a politician with our vote and the fellow who manufactures them is often a scoundrel a traitor to truth a menace to american peace and happiness he would tell you twice two is five if his bosses wished you to believe twice two is five the only good bureaucrat is one with a pistol at his head said the irreplaceable mencken adding put it in his hand and it s goodbye to the bill of rights statistics show him where to aim his gun yet we conclude in high spirits we are pleased to report that the bureaucrat threat is exaggerated vastly as we have argued before the bill of rights faces no bureaucratic threat from the current or any other administration none that is with the mere exceptions of its first second third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth and 10th amendments regards brian maher managing editor the daily

file people wear face masks at an outdoor mall with closed business amid the covid 19 pandemic in los angeles on june 11 2021 during earlier surges of the covid 19 pandemic some governors ordered business closures issued mask mandates and required vaccines in certain settings some even required quarantines for out of state travelers no more the record shattering caseload of the omicron surge has been met with a collective shrug by most governors who are displaying little appetite for widespread public orders or shutdowns associated press file photo by damian dovarganes st george news columbia s c ap governors took sweeping actions during earlier surges of the covid 19 pandemic many closed schools and ordered businesses shut down they issued mask mandates vaccine requirements and even quarantines in some places for people who had traveled to out of state hot spots not this time even as the exponential spread of the super contagious omicron variant shatters covid 19 infection records while governors are sending help to hospitals they are displaying little appetite for widespread public orders or shutdowns in utah pandemic fatigue among the public has led gov spencer cox to suggest covid 19 and its variants could be treated more like the flu or any other contagious disease the focus he said should be on reducing the effects of the illness through vaccines and medicines not government mandates on thursday he encouraged people to wear masks as cases hit record levels and the state was running out of monoclonal antibody treatments but stopped short of calling for new rules we have lots of illnesses that spread very quickly he said last month but if they re not filling up hospitals and killing people you know we go about our business if they are filling up hospitals and killing people then obviously it becomes much more concerning even democratic governors who passed strict mandates early on are now relying more on persuasion than dictates they largely are leaving it up to local officials to make the tough calls on decisions such as whether to limit capacity in restaurants and theaters or keep schools open south carolina set a record for positive tests over the new year s weekend and covid 19 hospitalizations are up 67 from the week before but gov henry mcmaster a republican urged everyone to carry on as if everything s fine if you get real sick there will be room in the hospitals he promised this week there s no need to panic be calm be happy mcmaster said we just had a great christmas season business is booming mcmaster has consistently urged people to get vaccinated and in the earliest days of the pandemic he directed k 12 schools and colleges to move to distance learning but students are back in classrooms across the state and he continues to resist imposing any statewide business shutdowns california is grappling with an astonishing spike in infections and the state health department extended an indoor mask mandate to feb 15 but the state s democratic leaders included no mechanism to enforce it i think a lot of people will self enforce and do the right thing gov gavin newsom told reporters last month the sentiment seems familiar to maryland gov larry hogan the republican announced a 30 day state of emergency to fight the omicron variant surge but it doesn t include the same statewide mask mandate ordered earlier in the pandemic i m not sure the people that are refusing to wear a mask are going to wear one anyway and we don t have the ability to enforce it hogan said so we re just strongly encouraging people to wear the damn mask new jersey has had the second largest u s caseload during this surge after new york and democratic gov phil murphy asked the legislature to renew his emergency powers so he can continue a mask mandate in schools but renewed business shutdowns and near universal mask mandates appear to be off the table and instead of issuing new executive orders he s urging people to follow public health recommendations here is what we need everyone to really take to heart the need to mask up to get boosted and to just practice common sense murphy said even governors who pushed the hardest for restrictions during earlier outbreaks have settled on appealing for people to take personal responsibility oregon removed its mask requirement from outdoor crowds in november and hasn t reinstated it schools and businesses remain open and democratic gov kate brown has urged booster shots as the best way to combat the virus our focus right now is on making sure our most vulnerable oregonians have access to booster shots and ensuring we are ready to support our hospital systems the governor s spokesman charles boyle said in an email ohio gov mike dewine a republican was one of the first to close schools in march 2020 as the virus began spreading rapidly through the u s but his desire to take aggressive measures has waned and since the summer he has focused on voluntary mask wearing and vaccinations we don t have the practical ability to really put on a statewide mask order at this point dewine said in late december i don t think it s appropriate at this point we have the vaccine we have the tools montana gov greg gianforte while listing his accomplishments during his first year in office tuesday said that through previous covid 19 surges there was little differences in case counts between states run by republicans that tended to take fewer precautions and those run by democrats which generally took stronger actions heavy handed one size fits all mandates don t work gianforte said in north carolina democratic gov roy cooper is still leaving it to local governments to decide whether masks should be required in stores or government buildings rather than ordering them statewide and encouraging but not requiring local school boards to retain mask mandates for students and staff cooper has taken this tack even though the republican controlled legislature has lacked veto proof majorities necessary to overturn his previous statewide covid 19 mandates we re going to have to learn how to live with it and continue to keep our kids in school and our businesses open and all of our government operations running effectively and efficiently cooper said written by jeffrey collins associated press associated press writers mike catalini

on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance for k 12 schools but even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all it was the first such briefing in months despite the ongoing pandemic crisis that lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more often and more clearly an unmet promise in fact the biden administration has repeatedly promised to put career scientists front and center in its covid communications but such experts have generally not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a briefing by subject matter experts sharing what they know with the press and the public the fact is there are dedicated scientists at cdc who are the world s experts in a lot of these issues and they need to be speaking directly to the public along with dr walensky says dr tom frieden cdc director during the obama administration who now runs resolve to save lives an initiative to help governments and outside groups prevent epidemics cdc is responding to these charges of inadequate communication the agency decided to hold friday s briefing walensky told reporters on the call because we had heard clearly over the last week that there was interest in hearing from us independently this is hard and i am committed to continue to improve she said i anticipate that this will be the first of many briefings and i very much look forward to them frieden is on board i hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in cdc he says the more cdc can speak directly to the public following its own principles of communication in a health emergency the better off we ll all be for cdc covid 19 briefings have been unusually sparse the idea of speaking out during a public health crisis is hardly new cdc literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency says frieden it has clear principles to uphold he says be first be right be credible be empathetic and give people practical proven things to do to protect themselves their families and their communities glen nowak who used to run media relations for the agency says press briefings are an important part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask tough questions and we d realize oh we didn t say that as clearly as we intended or we didn t think of that we d better address that issue when sars cov 2 was identified in china cdc seemed to follow that playbook in mid january 2020 dr nancy messonnier then director of cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases led the first cdc telebriefing on the subject she was joined by another career scientist dr marty cetron director of cdc s division of global migration and quarantine since the outbreaks of mers and sars we have made improvements in our capacity in the united states and around the world messonnier told reporters we re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively these briefings continued every few days until one of them jolted america to attention on feb 25 2020 messonnier warned this could be bad i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said after her comments financial markets crashed president donald trump whose message was that the pandemic was of little concern and under control was so angry at messonnier that he reportedly wanted her fired the next day he put vice president mike pence in charge of the white house coronavirus task force televised covid 19 briefings became a white house affair the cdc director was not usually present the cdc telebriefings did continue for a while although only occasionally under biden cdc still seems sidelined president biden came into office promising to beat the pandemic by restoring public trust scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you that s why you re going to be hearing a lot more from dr fauci again not from the president but from the real genuine experts and scientists biden pledged the day after his inauguration certainly americans have heard a lot from dr anthony fauci of nih the president s chief medical adviser and cdc s walensky both are frequent guests on tv news shows and in white house covid 19 response briefings which are usually held several times a week but under biden cdc and its career scientists seem to still be sidelined cdc has actually done fewer telebriefings on the pandemic under biden in 2020 under trump there were around two dozen cdc telebriefings in 2021 under biden there were two dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at nyu who considers dr walensky a mentor says she has been hoping to hear more from cdc s career scientists in the new administration i would love to hear more from them just about what is the science that they re doing how do they go about it what is their process she says i think there is something to be said for also just putting a human face on some of this she adds which the public does not get when guidance changes happen via the cdc website she calls walensky s promise to bring back regular briefings good news politics and a pandemic aren t necessarily good bedfellows the administration seems to be treating the pandemic as a political problem that has to be managed in a political way says gregg gonsalves an epidemiologist at yale there needs to be a lot more openness and transparency from the white house and they need to let their scientists off the leash he says one overriding issue may be a clash between politics and public health political messages need to be simple but that doesn t work for infectious disease messaging says nowak the situation is much more dynamic viruses change a lot and can change in ways that render your recommendations not so effective he says with infectious disease communications you really have to acknowledge uncertainty yet over the 14 years he worked at cdc across democratic and republican administrations he says the trend seemed to be for the white house to exert more and more strict control over messaging you have to be willing to trust that the scientists and the experts who are doing those briefings are going to do what needs to be done he says and this administration is not unique not by any stretch of imagination in terms of their willingness to trust career scientists which is to say they don t seem to trust them very much he adds walensky s pledge to hold more briefings is a helpful development he says the question is going to be the frequency that they commit to holding regular press briefings what the topics are what the messages are cdc didn t respond to npr s question about how often the agency plans to hold agency led briefings frieden hopes that cdc will live up to its promise and speak directly to the public more often it s better for everyone he says it s better for cdc because they can explain themselves it s better for the administration because you re better off if you have a cdc that people trust and it s better for the public because you can understand the guidance copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
three men who chased and killed a 25 year old innocent man in the us state of georgia have been sentenced to life in prison a judge ruled out any chance of parole for the father and son who armed themselves and initiated the deadly pursuit of ahmaud arbery greg and travis mcmichael grabbed guns and chased arbery in a pick up truck after spotting him running in their neighbourhood outside the port city of brunswick neighbour william roddie bryan joined the pursuit and recorded mobile phone video of travis mcmichael blasting arbery with a shotgun in november a jury convicted all three defendants of murder aggravated assault false imprisonment and attempted false imprisonment murder carries a mandatory life sentence under georgia law the trial judge ordered both mcmichaels to serve life without parole bryan was granted a chance of parole but must first serve at least 30 years in prison the killing on 23 february 2020 became part of a larger national reckoning on racial injustice when the video was posted online two months later arbery s family asked a judge to show no lenience on friday in sentencing the three men during the sentencing hearing mr arbery s sister recalled her brother s humour describing him as a positive thinker with a big personality she told the judge her brother had dark skin that glistened in the sunlight thick curly hair and an athletic build factors that made him a target to the men who pursued him advertisement these are the qualities that made these men assume that ahmaud was a dangerous criminal and chase them with guns drawn to me those qualities reflect a young man full of life and energy who looked like me and the people i loved jasmine arbery said intense loss arbery s mother asked for the maximum sentence saying she suffered a personal intense loss made worse by a trial where the men s defence was that arbery made bad choices that led to his death this wasn t a case of mistaken identity or mistaken fact they chose to target my son because they didn t want him in their community they chose to treat him differently than other people who frequently visited their community wanda cooper jones said and when they couldn t sufficiently scare or intimidate him they killed him prosecutor linda dunikoski asked the judge for life without parole for travis and greg mcmichael and the possibility of parole for bryan but she said all deserved that mandatory life sentence for showing no empathy for the trapped and terrified ahmaud arbery contending the mcmichaels still believed they did not do anything wrong dunikoski disclosed on friday that greg mcmichael gave bryan s mobile phone video of the shooting to an attorney who leaked it he believed it was going to exonerate him the prosecutor said for travis mcmichael 35 the possibility for parole could mean hope for release from prison in his 60s said robert rubin one of his defence attorneys he argued that travis mcmichael opened fire only after mr arbery came at him and grabbed the gun but rubin also acknowledged his client s decisions to arm himself and chase arbery were reckless and thoughtless they are not evidence of a soul so blackened as to deserve to spend the rest of his life in prison rubin said this was not a planned murder this was a fight over a gun that led to arbery s death greg mcmichael recently turned 66 and bryan is 52 raising the chances that they would spend the remainder of their lives in prison even if granted a chance of parole
phase one was retail phase two was distribution phase three was the space between processing manufacturing and distribution phase four was raw material supply to manufacturing phase five is consumer packaging capacity and bulk storage inventories most americans were not aware food consumption in the u s was a 60 40 proposition approximately 60 of all food was consumed outside the home or food away from home and 40 of all food consumed was food inside the home grocery shoppers food outside the home included restaurants fast food locales schools corporate cafeterias university lunchrooms manufacturing cafeterias hotels food trucks park and amusement food sellers and many more many of those venues are not thought about when people evaluate the overall u s food delivery system however this network was approximately 60 percent of all food consumption on a daily basis the food away from home sector has its own supply chain very few restaurants and venues cited above purchase food products from retail grocery outlets as a result of the coronavirus mitigation effort the food away from home sector has been reduced by 75 of daily food delivery operations however people still need to eat that means retail food outlets grocers are seeing sales increases of 25 to 50 percent depending on the area phase five the retail consumer supply chain for manufactured and processed food products includes bulk storage to compensate for seasonality as agriculture secretary sonny perdue recently noted there are over 800 commercial and public warehouses in the continental 48 states that store frozen products here is a snapshot of the food we had in storage at the end of february over 302 million pounds of frozen butter 1 36 billion pounds of frozen cheese 925 million pounds of frozen chicken over 1 billion pounds of frozen fruit nearly 2 04 billion pounds of frozen vegetables 491 million pounds of frozen beef and nearly 662 million pounds of frozen pork this bulk food storage is how the total u s consumer food supply ensures consistent availability even with weather impacts as a nation we essentially stay one harvest ahead of demand by storing it and smoothing out any peak valley shortfalls there are a total of 175 642 commercial facilities involved in this supply chain across the country few americans are aware of this however that stored food supply is the supply chain for food manufacturers who process the ingredients into a variety of branded food products and distribute to your local supermarket that bulk stored food and the subsequent supply chain is entirely separate from the fresh food supply chain used by restaurants hotels cafeterias etc for almost 8 weeks the retail supply chain has been operating beyond capacity and the burn rate of raw food products is up a stunning 40 percent those bulk warehouses the feeder pools for retail consumer manufactured food products are starting to run low believe me 1 we don t want to find out what happens when those 800 mass storage facilities run out and 2 the food supply chain will be a big part of president trump s decision making on reopening the economy thereby re opening restaurants cafeterias etc and switching consumption back to fresh supply this bigger picture is not being considered by politically minded governors dc politicians and public health centric advisors who focus exclusively on the virus additionally there are very specific issues within each supply chain commercial and consumer it is not as easy as people think to move the commercial supply chain restaurants etc into the consumer supply chain grocers first there are simply packaging capacity issues additionally there s an entirely different set of regulations on the processing side for the consumer supply chain one dairy farmer helps explain are we dumping milk because of greed or low demand no it s the supply chain there are only so many jug fillers all were running 24 7 before this cluster you know what now demand for jug milk has almost doubled however restaurant demand is almost gone no one is eating out restaurant milk is distributed in 2 5 gal bags or pint chugs further almost 75 percent of milk is processed into hard products in this country cheese and butter mozzarella is almost a third of total cheese production how s pizza sales going right now a bit of history years ago 40 every town had a bottler they ran one shift a day could ramp up production easily now with all the corporate takeovers wall street over main street we are left with regional high efficiency milk plants that ran jug lines 24 7 before this mess no excess capacity jug machines cost millions and are made in china only so many jugs can be blown at a jug plant we farmers don t make the jugs damn hard to ramp up production i m a dairy farmer believe me no dairyman likes dumping milk and so far there is no guarantee they will get paid milk must be processed within 48 hours of production and 24 hours of receipt in the plant or it goes bad same with making it into cheese and butter and neither stores well for long the same supply line problems exists where restaurants are supplied with bulk 1 pound blocks of butter or single serv packs or pats and cheese is sold in 10 to 20 pound bags think shredded mozzarella for pizza furthermore it is not legal for this end of the supply chain to sell direct to consumers in most states take cheddar cheese for instance it goes from mild to sharp to crap in storage butter frozen only stores for so long and then must be slowly thawed and processed into other uses as it gets strong at organic valley we cook it down into butter oil or ghee for cooking we are headed for the same problem with canned veggies the vast majority of produce comes off and is processed in season canned or frozen the supply is already in cans for the season restaurants use gallon cans or bulk bags of frozen produce at some point we will run out of consumer sized cans in stock because home size sales are up 40 and restaurant sales are almost nonexistent fresh produce out of u s season comes from mexico different climate i m talking sweet corn green beans peas tomatoes all veggies are seasonal in the usa fresh out of season row crops are imported there are exceptions like hydroponic grown but small amount of total someone mentioned time to raid all those bins of corn those bins on the farm contain yellow corn cattle feed and totally unfit for human consumption now or at harvest eggs same problem bakeries and restaurants of any size use pullman egg cases 30 dozen at a pop 30 eggs to a flat 12 flats to a case there are only so many 1 dozen egg cartons available and only so many packing machines industrial bakeries and processors of packaged food buy bulk liquid eggs no carton at all also in many states it is illegal to sell this supply chain directly to consumers on your standard buffet of any size do you really think they boil eggs and peel them they come in a bag boiled and diced those nice uniform slices of boiled egg you see on your salad a lot of them come in tubes boiled and extruded at the same time just unwrap and slice your scrambled eggs come in a homogenized bag on most buffets another example of main street being gutted and improved by wall street no local egg processors available or many small egg producers either all corporate and huge contracted to sell to the corporate masters this is a warning the same problems exist in all supply chains the supply chain is farked david osterloh 61 year old dairy farmer

this article provides information for educational purposes nerdwallet does not offer advisory or brokerage services nor does it recommend specific investments including stocks securities or cryptocurrencies investing your money can be an emotional affair on one hand you might be excited about creating financial stability and building wealth on the other hand you might feel some anxiety and fear the latter can have long term effects according to a 2021 study by the financial industry regulatory authority the study financial anxiety and stress among u s households says people who experience long term financial anxiety and stress are less likely to plan for retirement for those who have fears around investing the new year might be a good time to explore what s driving those fears financial therapy can help with this what is financial therapy financial therapy combines behavioral therapy and financial coaching to help improve your thoughts feelings and behaviors around money celia hughes a certified financial therapist based in los angeles says financial therapy marries the two disciplines there s this real gap between emotional health and financial health and money she says if you ve never heard of financial therapy before that could be because it s a relatively new discipline the financial therapy association was established in 2010 so it s just shy of a decade old what is a financial therapist a certified financial therapist is an individual who meets specific requirements in the areas of financial therapy financial planning and financial counseling and therapeutic competencies the certification from the financial therapy association is one that both financial and mental health professionals can pursue financial therapists can help investors understand their worries and fears around money guiding them to that lightbulb moment the difference between a financial therapist and a financial advisor is that a financial therapist explores the feelings and beliefs behind your financial habits while financial advisors focus on helping you reach your financial goals for example if you have 50 000 saved in cash and fear of going broke is keeping you from investing some of that money in the stock market you might speak to a financial therapist however if you have 50 000 and want to know the best strategies for investing the money a financial advisor would probably be a better fit it s important to note that not everyone who calls themselves a financial therapist is a certified financial therapist some behavioral therapists focus on finance and don t have financial qualifications likewise hughes says some financial professionals aren t credentialed therapists but they help you explore the emotions behind money what financial therapists can help you with financial therapists can help with any negative feelings and limiting beliefs you have around your finances for example you might be terrified of starting your investing journey or despite being a high earner you might not invest much because you don t believe you ll be fortunate enough to see positive returns if you re curious about what working with a financial therapist could look like hughes explains her approach with clients struggling to kick start their investing journey we would do some digging and see if we could get to the root cause of that fear is it a lack of belief in your own worth and belief that you re worthy of having a financially stable future is it fear of the unknown or you don t understand investment and how it works so you re afraid to give your money to something you don t understand so we would try to get into some of that root work and then work on setting small goals she says how to choose a financial therapist hiring a financial therapist can be a big decision so you want to choose the right one you should look for some of the same things you would when seeking a behavioral therapist that means finding someone who specializes in your problem area and who you feel comfortable being vulnerable with if you think a financial therapist is what you need and you re ready to get started you can search the financial therapy association to find one strategies for overcoming your money fears limiting beliefs can stall your investing journey and keep you from reaching your financial goals the therapists we talked to said in some cases fears can keep you from enjoying the fruits of your labor too how do you move forward despite fears here are a few tips the therapists shared with us 1 identify your limiting beliefs and emotions some people including those who grew up in marginalized communities have money stories they tell themselves that are developed in childhood these stories can either push you toward your goals or hold you back the financial therapists say perhaps you grew up watching your parents struggle to make ends meet and now you think money is scarce and shouldn t be spent maybe you re afraid to invest because nobody in your family owned assets or maybe you invest but are afraid of losing money so you always play it safe according to the wells fargo gallup investor and retirement optimism index black investors are less likely than white investors to feel comfortable taking on a lot of risk they re also more likely to give frequent financial help to relatives evans encourages people to ask themselves hard questions about their money beliefs feel your emotions identify them and then make a plan with your money and then you can move forward she says 2 envision retirement retirement planning might seem like a low priority for some investors especially if retirement is decades away recurring expenses may take priority or maybe you want to use your money to live in the moment hughes says sometimes people struggle to begin investing because they struggle to focus on the future some reasons are a lack of education and understanding how compound interest works and why it s so important to start investing at a young age she says to shift your thoughts and beliefs about investing for retirement hughes recommends thinking about a person you know who is at retirement age and how they re currently living this can help create a connection to the future so you can envision what you want for yourself and then put a plan together 3 start small it might be good to take baby steps when trying to change your financial habits this could look like doing research about whatever is creating uncomfortable feelings take the time to say hey where can i get some information to understand what a roth ira is or a 401 k then decide what your goals are so you can move forward in a way that feels good says evans 4 consider passive investing passive investing is a way to take pressure off yourself especially if you re struggling to understand the sometimes complex finance world it s a hands off form of investing for those who don t want to learn the more complicated stuff or who don t want to take on investments with greater risk examples of passive investing include using robo advisors or investment vehicles such as etfs index funds or mutual funds you don t need to be a finance expert just let compound interest do its work hughes says even if you put a small amount of money into a mutual fund when you start to see it grow that feeling can be really energizing and that can enable someone to move forward with a financial plan elizabeth ayoola writes for nerdwallet email eayoola nerdwallet com the article how a financial therapist can help shift your money

every high civilization decays by forgetting obvious things every high civilization wrote chesterton decays by forgetting obvious things we begin to suspect american civilization is down with a hard amnesia it has forgotten such obvious things we fear it is decaying beyond hope it has forgotten for example that the free lunch has no existence a nation hopelessly indebted is a nation hopelessly enchained money and wealth are not synonyms savings form the granite foundations of wealth and a man must produce before he can consume the true drivers of economic growth mr john tamny editor of realclearmarkets savings and investment not consumption are the true drivers of economic growth entrepreneurs cannot innovate and companies can t grow or be founded without savings first there s no getting around this truth just don t expect to hear this simple truth from most any economist deep believers in the religion that is consumption they can t see that the latter is the easy part that what really powers growth is the capacity to save the fruits of one s production so that workers can produce and ultimately consume even more it is obvious yet it is forgotten nonetheless as the gentleman states there s no getting around this truth let us recall then we believe it is necessary say s law supply creates its own demand say s law is the iron law of economics demonstrating that supply creates its own demand products are paid for with products argued jean baptiste say over two centuries ago his law has yet to be overturned despite the fevered efforts of lord keynes and his countless disciples who even today burn incense at his altar consider one man produces bread another produces shoes let us assume the baker bakes a baker s dozen 13 loaves of bread three of them go upon his dinner table then into his family s bellies consumed the remaining 10 loaves represent his savings he can hold them out against other goods he needs shoes in our little example meantime the cobbler cobbles together 13 pairs of shoes he places one new pair upon his blistered and aching feet he places two additional pairs upon his children s growing feet this fellow consumes three pairs of shoes that is the remaining 10 constitute his savings like our baker he can exchange his shoes his savings for other goods he requires in our example he requires bread the illusory veil of money each exchanges money to fetch him his goods direct barter is primitive but lean in for a closer examination squint your eyes a bit concentrate your attention you will now see the transaction in its true aspect you will see that money merely throws an illusory veil across the exchange you will see that the baker ultimately purchases his shoes with the bread he has baked and that the cobbler ultimately purchases his bread with the shoes he has cobbled concludes monsieur say money performs but a momentary function in this double exchange and when the transaction is finally closed it will always be found that one kind of commodity has been exchanged for another we must conclude that there can be no excess of savings savings equal stored wealth to argue that savings injure society is to argue that wealth injures society only an ivy league economist can argue it and savings spring from production as the fruit springs from the seed outlawing say s law yet the consumptionists would turn say s law upon its head they sob not about a lack of production but a lack of demand they insist that government race the printing press to make the shortage good to furnish the lack but no new production accompanies the blitz of money the additional money merely chases the existing stock of goods it represents the attempted outlawing of say s law that is the money printers place the wagon cart of consumption before the draft horse of production yet the horse must go in front the cart does not tug the horse consider the thought experiment of another 18th century thinker david hume false wealth and true wealth imagine a benevolent fairy slips money into all the nation s pockets overnight and so the money supply doubles at a stroke is this nation doubly rich alas it is not doubly rich the money supply has been doubled yes the nation s pockets are doubly deep men feel flush and are eager to spend but no additional goods have entered existence where is the gain except in prices explains the late austrian economist murray rothbard what makes us rich is an abundance of goods and what limits that abundance is a scarcity of resources namely land labor and capital multiplying coin will not whisk these resources into being we may feel twice as rich for the moment but clearly all we are doing is diluting the money supply as the public rushes out to spend its newfound wealth prices will very roughly double or at least rise until the demand is satisfied and money no longer bids against itself for the existing goods there you have the wisdom of classical economics the forgotten wisdom of classical economics we would refresh the memory savings equal investment and as we would remind the consumptionists there can be no investment without savings as there can be no bread without grain again rothbard savings and investment are indissolubly linked it is impossible to encourage one and discourage the other aside from bank credit investments can come from no other source than savings in order to invest resources in the future he must first restrict his consumption and save funds this restricting is his savings and so saving and investment are always equivalent the two terms may be used almost interchangeably the more accumulated savings in the economy the more potential investment a nice point to put somewhere an economy built atop a sturdy foundation of savings is therefore a rugged economy a durable economy no passing gale will knock it over saving is spending and as we have argued before when society saves it is not eliminating consumption it is merely delaying it it is a future bird in a future hand the demand that is supposedly lost is not lost at all it is simply shifted away from the present and toward the bountiful future today s savings are therefore tomorrow s spending tomorrow s consumption by reducing consumption today society consumes more tomorrow by increasing consumption today society consumes less tomorrow it devours the seed corn or according to henry hazlitt author of the classic economics in one lesson saving in short in the modern world is only another form of spending more from whom from time immemorial proverbial wisdom has taught the virtues of saving and warned against the consequences of prodigality and waste we have forgotten this immemorial proverbial wisdom yet it echoes deep within the heart it echoes deep within the soul it is time to remember regards brian maher managing editor the daily reckoning

dairy economist 2022 should be profitable for milk producers published friday january 7 2022 the following is from lee mielke author of a dairy market column known as mielke market weekly we attempted to take a look at what lies ahead in the new year in the jan 3 dairy radio now broadcast with bill brooks dairy economist at stoneheart consulting in deerborn mo brooks predicted it should be a better profitability year for dairy farmers but warned that s contingent on the weather and how that impacts our main input prices as far as feed costs feed costs finished 2021 strong he said but milk prices finished 2021 fairly strong as well the agriculture department has made changes to the risk management dairy margin coverage dmc program with respect to previous year eligible milk marketings as well as the feed price calculation which will now be based on 100 percent premium alfalfa hay instead of the 50 50 hay blend many of the changes will be retroactive according to brooks and result in additional benefits to dairy producers so it behooves them to check with their local farm service agency office for complete details brooks says international dairy prices look strong and that is helping firm u s prices especially on butter where 3 per pound plus is a global reality and could potentially move our price higher cheese prices will hopefully remain strong he said as economies open more so we re looking at a better price year than what we experienced in 2021 and it should be a better profitability year for us meanwhile a higher november all milk price offset higher corn and soybean prices to nudge the november milk feed ratio higher for the third month in a row the usda s latest ag prices report has the ratio at 1 94 up from 1 87 in october but well below last year s 2 58 the index is based on the current milk price in relationship to feed prices for a ration consisting of 51 percent corn 8 percent soybeans and 41 percent alfalfa hay in other words 1 pound of milk would purchase 1 94 pounds of dairy feed of that blend the u s all milk price averaged 20 80 per hundredweight up 1 10 from october but was 30 cents below november 2020 the national average corn price jumped 25 cents to 5 27 per bushel after dropping 45 cents in october and is 1 48 per bushel above november 2020 soybeans averaged 12 20 per bushel up 30 cents from october and 1 90 per bushel above november 2020 alfalfa hay averaged 210 per ton down 3 from october but is a hefty 46 per ton above a year ago looking at the cow side of the ledger the november cull price for beef and dairy combined averaged 69 20 per hundredweight down 1 40 from october 9 90 above november 2020 but is 2 40 below the 2011 base average of 71 60 per hundredweight bill brooks said a dmc payment is expected for the 11th time in 2021 and 12th straight month when the fsa announces the november 2021 milk margin above feed costs the milk margin above feed costs is expected to be 9 14 per hundredweight for november a gain of 60 cents over october s level and the highest since november 2020 when the margin was 11 64 dairy producers with coverage at the 9 50 per hundredweight level would expect to see a payment on eligible november milk production according to brooks in the week ending dec 18 61 700 dairy cows were sent to slaughter down 600 from the previous week and 1 500 head or 2 4 percent below a year ago the stonex dairy group stated in its dec 27 early morning update that the second half of 2021 was marked by an increased willingness or need for producers to cull animals that said the four week rolling total of dairy cows slaughtered has been trending down over the last three months week to week the majority of slaughter levels have been higher than year ago levels but the surplus over last year has been declining the contraction seems to be slowing down stonex concluded as higher milk prices encourage farmers to keep animals in the herd cash dairy prices finished 2021 mostly higher and it was a full week of trading the 40 pound cheddar blocks closed the last day of the year at 1 98 per pound up 10 75 cents on the week highest since nov 12 2020 12 25 cents above where they were on dec 1 and 33 cents above that week a year ago the 500 pound cheddar barrels finished last friday at 1 71 per pound up 6 cents on the week highest since nov 1 2021 16 75 cents above a year ago but a

and 88 for the month down from 98 in november some midwest cheesemakers were very busy during the holiday according to dairy market news spot milk prices were falling at somewhat strong discounts and ranged from 4 to 2 under at mid new year s week although discounted dmn says they were somewhat pricey compared to the final week in 2020 when milk prices reached 10 under class iii cheese demand maintained strength coming into the holiday season but questions have arisen as to how cheese stocks will hold up once customers come back to the table in early 2022 dmn says there are some near term bullish market undertones according to market traders despite the large block barrel price gap western cheese demand is steady in retail markets while food service sales are declining rising covid cases and winter school closures are contributing to a decline in food service purchasing however international demand remains strong the ongoing shortage of truck drivers was exacerbated by the holidays and poor weather increasing delays to deliveries export loads of cheese face further delays due to port congestion milk is available for cheese production in the region but difficult in areas hit with bad weather end of year holidays staffing shortages and shipping delays are contributing to reduced cheese production throughout the west according to dmn butter had a great week after jumping 15 75 cents the previous week and soared to a friday close at 2 4525 per pound 20 25 cents higher on the week highest since sept 21 2017 47 25 cents above its dec 1 perch and 1 0325 above a

are running churns as much as possible says dmn bulk butter is very tight as the final weeks of 2021 brought increasing interest from customers in all varieties of butter from salted 80 percent to unsalted 82 percent butterfat cream is available in the west though some contacts reported that severe weather and a shortage of truck drivers was limiting their ability to deliver loads to production facilities cream demand is steady to lower as some class ii producers in the region were running lighter year end holiday schedules steady demand is present for butter in both retail and food service markets grade a nonfat dry milk fell to 1 6475 per pound last wednesday then reversed direction but closed last friday at 1 6550 down 1 50 cents on the week up 10 75 cents on the month and 51 25 cents

75 cents above a year ago there were no sales for the week and four for the month of december down from eight in november high feed costs ahead looking ahead to the first global dairy trade auction of 2022 highground dairy stated in its pre gdt analysis high feed costs strong global demand a lack of production growth and general commodity inflation are the key drivers that will likely keep global dairy product prices elevated into the first half of 2022 while dairy producers in key exporting regions are being given signals to expand raw milk prices are quickly on the rise in the u s and europe the first high feed cost environment since 2013 14 may prevent farmers from aggressive growth plans for the coming months the national milk producers federation s final market report of 2021 stated the rapid evaporation of growth in dairy cows milk and milk solids production dropped all three into negative territory during october these supply side effects have dominated the dairy situation recently and will continue to do so well into the coming year domestic consumption growth of all milk and dairy products has been somewhat sluggish in recent months but u s dairy exports during the first 10 months of 2021 have set a new volume record of 17 6 percent of u s milk solids production well above this measure s second highest year 2020 at 16 3 percent the drop in production is being felt most in dry skim milk products and to a lesser extent in butter and dry whey production cheese production remains the preferred channel for available milk product stocks are being drawn down and prices rising as production trends change the report stated dairy imports into japan in november were not as positive as those to china but still moving japan imported 50 5 million pounds of cheese down 5 5 percent from november 2020 and year to date imports were off 1 3 percent highground dairy blamed a loss of volumes from the eu and reported that germany posted the largest decrease in volumes out of all suppliers the u s market share at 11 8 percent was up from 10 5 percent a year ago butter imports totaled just 1 9 million pounds down 30 7 percent from a year ago with ytd down 38 percent last of all as i finish my final column of 2021 i m not sure that i can remember the last time we had a white christmas here in whatcom county wash but we sure did this year unfortunately it also brought us frigid temperatures that got down to single digits in some cases strong gusty winds served to bring those temperatures even lower considering wind chill factor all of which brought back many memories of my growing up days in wisconsin i have often reminisced of days it was so cold i d stand in front of an open refrigerator just to warm my hands this is where you laugh and snicker the frigid cold was no laughing matter for those who had to be out in it especially dairy farmers emergency services personnel line workers and furnace repair people guess it was a fitting end to 2021 my hope and prayer is that we all have a less dramatic and happier 2022 return to top of page

on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance for k 12 schools but even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all it was the first such briefing in months despite the ongoing pandemic crisis that lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more often and more clearly an unmet promise in fact the biden administration has repeatedly promised to put career scientists front and center in its covid communications but such experts have generally not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a briefing by subject matter experts sharing what they know with the press and the public the fact is there are dedicated scientists at cdc who are the world s experts in a lot of these issues and they need to be speaking directly to the public along with dr walensky says dr tom frieden cdc director during the obama administration who now runs resolve to save lives an initiative to help governments and outside groups prevent epidemics cdc is responding to these charges of inadequate communication the agency decided to hold friday s briefing walensky told reporters on the call because we had heard clearly over the last week that there was interest in hearing from us independently this is hard and i am committed to continue to improve she said i anticipate that this will be the first of many briefings and i very much look forward to them frieden is on board i hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in cdc he says the more cdc can speak directly to the public following its own principles of communication in a health emergency the better off we ll all be for cdc covid 19 briefings have been unusually sparse the idea of speaking out during a public health crisis is hardly new cdc literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency says frieden it has clear principles to uphold he says be first be right be credible be empathetic and give people practical proven things to do to protect themselves their families and their communities glen nowak who used to run media relations for the agency says press briefings are an important part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask tough questions and we d realize oh we didn t say that as clearly as we intended or we didn t think of that we d better address that issue when sars cov 2 was identified in china cdc seemed to follow that playbook in mid january 2020 dr nancy messonnier then director of cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases led the first cdc telebriefing on the subject she was joined by another career scientist dr marty cetron director of cdc s division of global migration and quarantine since the outbreaks of mers and sars we have made improvements in our capacity in the united states and around the world messonnier told reporters we re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively these briefings continued every few days until one of them jolted america to attention on feb 25 2020 messonnier warned this could be bad i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said after her comments financial markets crashed president donald trump whose message was that the pandemic was of little concern and under control was so angry at messonnier that he reportedly wanted her fired the next day he put vice president mike pence in charge of the white house coronavirus task force televised covid 19 briefings became a white house affair the cdc director was not usually present the cdc telebriefings did continue for a while although only occasionally under biden cdc still seems sidelined president biden came into office promising to beat the pandemic by restoring public trust scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you that s why you re going to be hearing a lot more from dr fauci again not from the president but from the real genuine experts and scientists biden pledged the day after his inauguration certainly americans have heard a lot from dr anthony fauci of nih the president s chief medical adviser and cdc s walensky both are frequent guests on tv news shows and in white house covid 19 response briefings which are usually held several times a week but under biden cdc and its career scientists seem to still be sidelined cdc has actually done fewer telebriefings on the pandemic under biden in 2020 under trump there were around two dozen cdc telebriefings in 2021 under biden there were two dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at nyu who considers dr walensky a mentor says she has been hoping to hear more from cdc s career scientists in the new administration i would love to hear more from them just about what is the science that they re doing how do they go about it what is their process she says i think there is something to be said for also just putting a human face on some of this she adds which the public does not get when guidance changes happen via the cdc website she calls walensky s promise to bring back regular briefings good news politics and a pandemic aren t necessarily good bedfellows the administration seems to be treating the pandemic as a political problem that has to be managed in a political way says gregg gonsalves an epidemiologist at yale there needs to be a lot more openness and transparency from the white house and they need to let their scientists off the leash he says one overriding issue may be a clash between politics and public health political messages need to be simple but that doesn t work for infectious disease messaging says nowak the situation is much more dynamic viruses change a lot and can change in ways that render your recommendations not so effective he says with infectious disease communications you really have to acknowledge uncertainty yet over the 14 years he worked at cdc across democratic and republican administrations he says the trend seemed to be for the white house to exert more and more strict control over messaging you have to be willing to trust that the scientists and the experts who are doing those briefings are going to do what needs to be done he says and this administration is not unique not by any stretch of imagination in terms of their willingness to trust career scientists which is to say they don t seem to trust them very much he adds walensky s pledge to hold more briefings is a helpful development he says the question is going to be the frequency that they commit to holding regular press briefings what the topics are what the messages are cdc didn t respond to npr s question about how often the agency plans to hold agency led briefings frieden hopes that cdc will live up to its promise and speak directly to the public more often it s better for everyone he says it s better for cdc because they can explain themselves it s better for the administration because you re better off if you have a cdc that people trust and it s better for the public because you

cowboys and cowgirls make their way down the slope at the base of the steamboat ski area duriing the stampede event at the 2020 bud light cowboy downhill one of steamboat springs s longest running traditions will climb back into the saddle this january after last year s event was canceled for the first time since the bud light cowboy downhill first rode into town 48 years ago it goes hand in hand with what we do in the summer of keeping the western tradition alive in steamboat springs said john shipley of steamboat pro rodeo fame who co announces the event with bob feist a member of the pro rodeo hall of fame it s a signature event for sure and i think the people at the steamboat resort will tell you it s a bigger spectator event than anything else they do this year the bud light cowboy downhill will take place monday jan 17 which is martin luther king jr day the festivities leading up to the start of the 47th annual bud light cowboy downhill will begin at 11 a m and include a western celebration in the base area featuring 4 h farm animals food and refreshments at timber torch grill a learn to rope clinic and appearances by the denver broncos cheerleaders steamboat resort officials encourage folks to come out early if they want to find a good spot along the dual slalom race course or secure a spot on the deck of the timber torch which offers a view of the entire course the racers will take to the course at 1 p m as 90 to 100 cowboys and cowgirls ski down a dual slalom course and go over a jump before they lasso a person saddle a horse and cross the finish line in a timed event the dual slalom will be followed by the stampede event which is a mass start free for all where the first cowboy or cowgirl to the bottom wins then at 2 30 p m the events will draw to a close with a free concert in steamboat square featuring high energy bluegrass ensemble the lil smokies a cowboy tests his roping skills during the 2020 bud light cowboy downhill at the steamboat resort john f russell steamboat pilot today the very first cowboy downhill was created by six time world champion cowboy larry mahan and former world champion and olympic silver medalist alpine ski racer billy kidd the idea was to get rodeo stars who were in colorado for the national western stock show to come to steamboat where they would spend the morning learning to ski and the afternoon racing down the slopes in this one of a kind event i would say to be honest with you that the cowboy downhill has been big time for 40 years out of the 47 years it has taken place said barb shipley who is married to john and has been part of the cowboy downhill since the first cowboys flew into steamboat on a frontier airlines flight the very first year tucker miller a bull rider from denton montana does his best to hang on after landing the jump at the 45th annual bud light cowboy downhill at the steamboat ski area john f russell steamboat pilot today last year covid 19 got in the way and when the organizers of the national western stock show elected not to hold the event in denver it just didn t make any sense to have the downhill at the steamboat resort this year s stock show is slated to begin saturday jan 8 and continue through jan 23 shipley said that the cowboy downhill has only missed one go round since kidd and mahan started rounding up cowboys and this year everyone involved is thrilled to have them back barb shipley said the first years of the event the cowboys simply had to ski down the course but very early on the organizers made it more difficult by adding roping and saddling portions before the cowboys could cross the finish line and they also added a pro jump in the middle of the course that seems to get bigger with every year a few years back organizers moved the event from its traditional tuesday slot to monday so it would line up with martin luther king jr day organizers said the move allowed more people to attend the event and visitors would be in town i don t ever see it going away because the cowboys love to come and now the cowgirls come as well barb shipley said when you re in the rodeo world everybody knows about steamboat cowboy downhill and a lot of them have it on their bucket list
on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance for k 12 schools but even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all it was the first such briefing in months despite the ongoing pandemic crisis that lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more often and more clearly an unmet promise in fact the biden administration has repeatedly promised to put career scientists front and center in its covid communications but such experts have generally not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a briefing by subject matter experts sharing what they know with the press and the public the fact is there are dedicated scientists at cdc who are the world s experts in a lot of these issues and they need to be speaking directly to the public along with dr walensky says dr tom frieden cdc director during the obama administration who now runs resolve to save lives an initiative to help governments and outside groups prevent epidemics cdc is responding to these charges of inadequate communication the agency decided to hold friday s briefing walensky told reporters on the call because we had heard clearly over the last week that there was interest in hearing from us independently this is hard and i am committed to continue to improve she said i anticipate that this will be the first of many briefings and i very much look forward to them frieden is on board i hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in cdc he says the more cdc can speak directly to the public following its own principles of communication in a health emergency the better off we ll all be for cdc covid 19 briefings have been unusually sparse the idea of speaking out during a public health crisis is hardly new cdc literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency says frieden it has clear principles to uphold he says be first be right be credible be empathetic and give people practical proven things to do to protect themselves their families and their communities glen nowak who used to run media relations for the agency says press briefings are an important part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask tough questions and we d realize oh we didn t say that as clearly as we intended or we didn t think of that we d better address that issue when sars cov 2 was identified in china cdc seemed to follow that playbook in mid january 2020 dr nancy messonnier then director of cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases led the first cdc telebriefing on the subject she was joined by another career scientist dr marty cetron director of cdc s division of global migration and quarantine since the outbreaks of mers and sars we have made improvements in our capacity in the united states and around the world messonnier told reporters we re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively these briefings continued every few days until one of them jolted america to attention on feb 25 2020 messonnier warned this could be bad i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said after her comments financial markets crashed president donald trump whose message was that the pandemic was of little concern and under control was so angry at messonnier that he reportedly wanted her fired the next day he put vice president mike pence in charge of the white house coronavirus task force televised covid 19 briefings became a white house affair the cdc director was not usually present the cdc telebriefings did continue for a while although only occasionally under biden cdc still seems sidelined president biden came into office promising to beat the pandemic by restoring public trust scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you that s why you re going to be hearing a lot more from dr fauci again not from the president but from the real genuine experts and scientists biden pledged the day after his inauguration certainly americans have heard a lot from dr anthony fauci of nih the president s chief medical adviser and cdc s walensky both are frequent guests on tv news shows and in white house covid 19 response briefings which are usually held several times a week but under biden cdc and its career scientists seem to still be sidelined cdc has actually done fewer telebriefings on the pandemic under biden in 2020 under trump there were around two dozen cdc telebriefings in 2021 under biden there were two dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at nyu who considers dr walensky a mentor says she has been hoping to hear more from cdc s career scientists in the new administration i would love to hear more from them just about what is the science that they re doing how do they go about it what is their process she says i think there is something to be said for also just putting a human face on some of this she adds which the public does not get when guidance changes happen via the cdc website she calls walensky s promise to bring back regular briefings good news politics and a pandemic aren t necessarily good bedfellows the administration seems to be treating the pandemic as a political problem that has to be managed in a political way says gregg gonsalves an epidemiologist at yale there needs to be a lot more openness and transparency from the white house and they need to let their scientists off the leash he says one overriding issue may be a clash between politics and public health political messages need to be simple but that doesn t work for infectious disease messaging says nowak the situation is much more dynamic viruses change a lot and can change in ways that render your recommendations not so effective he says with infectious disease communications you really have to acknowledge uncertainty yet over the 14 years he worked at cdc across democratic and republican administrations he says the trend seemed to be for the white house to exert more and more strict control over messaging you have to be willing to trust that the scientists and the experts who are doing those briefings are going to do what needs to be done he says and this administration is not unique not by any stretch of imagination in terms of their willingness to trust career scientists which is to say they don t seem to trust them very much he adds walensky s pledge to hold more briefings is a helpful development he says the question is going to be the frequency that they commit to holding regular press briefings what the topics are what the messages are cdc didn t respond to npr s question about how often the agency plans to hold agency led briefings frieden hopes that cdc will live up to its promise and speak directly to the public more often it s better for everyone he says it s better for cdc because they can explain themselves it s better for the administration because you re better off if you have a cdc that people trust and it s better for the public because you can understand the guidance copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

a group of scripps ranch residents has filed a lawsuit seeking to block construction of a 264 unit apartment complex that the residents say will damage community character the developer says it s a model project that will help solve the city s housing crisis and provide apartments in an area where they are rare in addition 20 percent of the units 53 will be reserved for low income residents similar debates are popping up all across san diego as city officials try to solve a shortage of affordable housing by approving dense new residential projects on the outer edges of mostly single family neighborhoods advertisement san diego rancho peñasquitos emerging as new battleground for local housing crisis residents fight plans for three projects totaling 1 400 residential units on a single corner five local planning or civic groups strongly oppose the project including the scripps ranch planning group miramar ranch north planning committee scripps ranch civic association scripps ranch recreation council and scripps ranch schools committee critics say the project which has been dubbed scripps mesa would be similar to a las vegas resort or some of the dense projects that have been constructed in mission valley in recent years it will be four stories tall in a neighborhood where most structures are much lower and it will have a large parking structure it s very very out of place said lisa croner leader of an organization called voice of scripps ranch which filed the lawsuit there s a blatant discrepancy between this project and what s nearby the lawsuit filed in late january seeks an injunction the suit claims the project violates the community plan or growth blueprint for the area the developer monarch group is characterizing the residents in opposition as nimbys which stands for not in my back yard and says it s too late to block the project amid san diego s housing crisis scripps mesa s 211 market rate and 53 affordable rental units are a much needed community investment in a neighborhood with zero apartments said sarah kruer jager a monarch partner after a rigorous years long approval process with numerous community meetings this merit less lawsuit is just the latest tactic by a handful of individuals desperate to stop much needed housing stock from being built because the project would be built on a 7 acre site at scripps poway parkway and spring canyon road that is owned by the san diego unified school district the district and the city are co defendants in the litigation and the district s ownership of the site makes the dispute different than most efforts to block new development projects the defendants say superior court judge joel wohlfeil should dismiss the lawsuit because the school district has the land use authority over the site instead of the city and the school district already approved the project in summer 2018 they claim the city has no discretion to enforce the community plan for the area which dates back to 1988 and that allowing the city to do so would be redundant wohlfeil has scheduled a march 27 hearing on the motion to dismiss the lawsuit which was filed by attorney craig sherman for voice of scripps ranch contends that the community plan is still important despite school district ownership of the site a community plan governs any further development within a city s specified geographic area such that any and all development must be consistent with the community plan the suit says the community plan doesn t contemplate such bulky and dense projects and requires that whatever is built at the scripps mesa site to have a significant commercial component which the proposed project lacks the suit says the defendants in their motion to dismiss say that a community plan should be considered flexible based partly on changing times and priorities the residents also balked at being called nimbys saying a more appropriate description of what they want on the site would be rumby for reasonable use of my back yard they say they would support a dense project with low income units if it was designed differently laura fink a spokeswoman for the developer says monarch has spent more than five years working with community leaders to make scripps mesa a better project that includes doubling the number of low income units adding a community garden and including an instruction lab for young students the site was previously occupied by innovations academy charter school which moved to 5454 ruffin road in kearny mesa some residents have questioned the school district s use of bond money to relocate the academy and make way for the scripps mesa project the project would include 53 subsidized units with rents below 1 000 18 one bedroom units 29 two bedroom units and six three bedroom units the 211 market rate units are expected to rent for more than 2 000 a month
on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance for k 12 schools but even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all it was the first such briefing in months despite the ongoing pandemic crisis that lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more often and more clearly an unmet promise in fact the biden administration has repeatedly promised to put career scientists front and center in its covid communications but such experts have generally not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a briefing by subject matter experts sharing what they know with the press and the public the fact is there are dedicated scientists at cdc who are the world s experts in a lot of these issues and they need to be speaking directly to the public along with dr walensky says dr tom frieden cdc director during the obama administration who now runs resolve to save lives an initiative to help governments and outside groups prevent epidemics cdc is responding to these charges of inadequate communication the agency decided to hold friday s briefing walensky told reporters on the call because we had heard clearly over the last week that there was interest in hearing from us independently this is hard and i am committed to continue to improve she said i anticipate that this will be the first of many briefings and i very much look forward to them frieden is on board i hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in cdc he says the more cdc can speak directly to the public following its own principles of communication in a health emergency the better off we ll all be for cdc covid 19 briefings have been unusually sparse the idea of speaking out during a public health crisis is hardly new cdc literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency says frieden it has clear principles to uphold he says be first be right be credible be empathetic and give people practical proven things to do to protect themselves their families and their communities glen nowak who used to run media relations for the agency says press briefings are an important part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask tough questions and we d realize oh we didn t say that as clearly as we intended or we didn t think of that we d better address that issue when sars cov 2 was identified in china cdc seemed to follow that playbook in mid january 2020 dr nancy messonnier then director of cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases led the first cdc telebriefing on the subject she was joined by another career scientist dr marty cetron director of cdc s division of global migration and quarantine since the outbreaks of mers and sars we have made improvements in our capacity in the united states and around the world messonnier told reporters we re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively these briefings continued every few days until one of them jolted america to attention on feb 25 2020 messonnier warned this could be bad i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said after her comments financial markets crashed president donald trump whose message was that the pandemic was of little concern and under control was so angry at messonnier that he reportedly wanted her fired the next day he put vice president mike pence in charge of the white house coronavirus task force televised covid 19 briefings became a white house affair the cdc director was not usually present the cdc telebriefings did continue for a while although only occasionally under biden cdc still seems sidelined president biden came into office promising to beat the pandemic by restoring public trust scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you that s why you re going to be hearing a lot more from dr fauci again not from the president but from the real genuine experts and scientists biden pledged the day after his inauguration certainly americans have heard a lot from dr anthony fauci of nih the president s chief medical adviser and cdc s walensky both are frequent guests on tv news shows and in white house covid 19 response briefings which are usually held several times a week but under biden cdc and its career scientists seem to still be sidelined cdc has actually done fewer telebriefings on the pandemic under biden in 2020 under trump there were around two dozen cdc telebriefings in 2021 under biden there were two dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at nyu who considers dr walensky a mentor says she has been hoping to hear more from cdc s career scientists in the new administration i would love to hear more from them just about what is the science that they re doing how do they go about it what is their process she says i think there is something to be said for also just putting a human face on some of this she adds which the public does not get when guidance changes happen via the cdc website she calls walensky s promise to bring back regular briefings good news politics and a pandemic aren t necessarily good bedfellows the administration seems to be treating the pandemic as a political problem that has to be managed in a political way says gregg gonsalves an epidemiologist at yale there needs to be a lot more openness and transparency from the white house and they need to let their scientists off the leash he says one overriding issue may be a clash between politics and public health political messages need to be simple but that doesn t work for infectious disease messaging says nowak the situation is much more dynamic viruses change a lot and can change in ways that render your recommendations not so effective he says with infectious disease communications you really have to acknowledge uncertainty yet over the 14 years he worked at cdc across democratic and republican administrations he says the trend seemed to be for the white house to exert more and more strict control over messaging you have to be willing to trust that the scientists and the experts who are doing those briefings are going to do what needs to be done he says and this administration is not unique not by any stretch of imagination in terms of their willingness to trust career scientists which is to say they don t seem to trust them very much he adds walensky s pledge to hold more briefings is a helpful development he says the question is going to be the frequency that they commit to holding regular press briefings what the topics are what the messages are cdc didn t respond to npr s question about how often the agency plans to hold agency led briefings frieden hopes that cdc will live up to its promise and speak directly to the public more often it s better for everyone he says it s better for cdc because they can explain themselves it s better for the administration because you re better off if you have a cdc that people trust and it s better for the public because you can understand the guidance copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

dreams of graduating were put on hold kakaie and her family stayed in their home at the behest of azim who warned that it was too dangerous to leave confined to the airport he would guide them to the gates in the following days but eventually the u s military took over air traffic control and told azim he could either guide them over the phone from the airport and risk getting left behind or he

in a crowd numbering in the thousands outside a roadblock guarded by the taliban people were desperately trying to crawl under the makeshift gate or pleading with taliban soldiers to let them through who would often respond with a beating despite the chaos they were able to push to the front of the gate you go to speak with taliban kakaie told her mother hawa sultani because she is old the taliban

the taliban only to find themselves in front of another gate this time guarded by zero one soldiers a cia backed special forces unit of the afghan army that kakaie says was just as ruthless as the taliban we know the taliban they are very brutal but these afghan forces that were working with the americans they were also very brutal kicking ladies and kids everyone firing guns shazia said through wali s translation it was hard to breathe and the soldiers routinely threw canisters of tear gas into the crowd or hit kakaie and her family with the stock of their rifles if they got too close to the gate they didn t seem to be letting anyone in kakaie s family maintains they were only letting afghan soldiers and their families through tired their lungs and eyes burning and bodies

broken i saw in front of my eyes a person lost his finger because of a sound bomb that directly exploded and his finger went into the air and because of this i see nightmares every night wali kakaie said as shazia nodded in agreement flashing a wary tired smile but the family was unwavering in their determination they tried another roadblock this time guarded by the taliban and were let through

on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance for k 12 schools but even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all it was the first such briefing in months despite the ongoing pandemic crisis that lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more often and more clearly an unmet promise in fact the biden administration has repeatedly promised to put career scientists front and center in its covid communications but such experts have generally not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a briefing by subject matter experts sharing what they know with the press and the public the fact is there are dedicated scientists at cdc who are the world s experts in a lot of these issues and they need to be speaking directly to the public along with dr walensky says dr tom frieden cdc director during the obama administration who now runs resolve to save lives an initiative to help governments and outside groups prevent epidemics cdc is responding to these charges of inadequate communication the agency decided to hold friday s briefing walensky told reporters on the call because we had heard clearly over the last week that there was interest in hearing from us independently this is hard and i am committed to continue to improve she said i anticipate that this will be the first of many briefings and i very much look forward to them frieden is on board i hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in cdc he says the more cdc can speak directly to the public following its own principles of communication in a health emergency the better off we ll all be for cdc covid 19 briefings have been unusually sparse the idea of speaking out during a public health crisis is hardly new cdc literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency says frieden it has clear principles to uphold he says be first be right be credible be empathetic and give people practical proven things to do to protect themselves their families and their communities glen nowak who used to run media relations for the agency says press briefings are an important part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask tough questions and we d realize oh we didn t say that as clearly as we intended or we didn t think of that we d better address that issue when sars cov 2 was identified in china cdc seemed to follow that playbook in mid january 2020 dr nancy messonnier then director of cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases led the first cdc telebriefing on the subject she was joined by another career scientist dr marty cetron director of cdc s division of global migration and quarantine since the outbreaks of mers and sars we have made improvements in our capacity in the united states and around the world messonnier told reporters we re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively these briefings continued every few days until one of them jolted america to attention on feb 25 2020 messonnier warned this could be bad i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said after her comments financial markets crashed president donald trump whose message was that the pandemic was of little concern and under control was so angry at messonnier that he reportedly wanted her fired the next day he put vice president mike pence in charge of the white house coronavirus task force televised covid 19 briefings became a white house affair the cdc director was not usually present the cdc telebriefings did continue for a while although only occasionally under biden cdc still seems sidelined president biden came into office promising to beat the pandemic by restoring public trust scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you that s why you re going to be hearing a lot more from dr fauci again not from the president but from the real genuine experts and scientists biden pledged the day after his inauguration certainly americans have heard a lot from dr anthony fauci of nih the president s chief medical adviser and cdc s walensky both are frequent guests on tv news shows and in white house covid 19 response briefings which are usually held several times a week but under biden cdc and its career scientists seem to still be sidelined cdc has actually done fewer telebriefings on the pandemic under biden in 2020 under trump there were around two dozen cdc telebriefings in 2021 under biden there were two dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at nyu who considers dr walensky a mentor says she has been hoping to hear more from cdc s career scientists in the new administration i would love to hear more from them just about what is the science that they re doing how do they go about it what is their process she says i think there is something to be said for also just putting a human face on some of this she adds which the public does not get when guidance changes happen via the cdc website she calls walensky s promise to bring back regular briefings good news politics and a pandemic aren t necessarily good bedfellows the administration seems to be treating the pandemic as a political problem that has to be managed in a political way says gregg gonsalves an epidemiologist at yale there needs to be a lot more openness and transparency from the white house and they need to let their scientists off the leash he says one overriding issue may be a clash between politics and public health political messages need to be simple but that doesn t work for infectious disease messaging says nowak the situation is much more dynamic viruses change a lot and can change in ways that render your recommendations not so effective he says with infectious disease communications you really have to acknowledge uncertainty yet over the 14 years he worked at cdc across democratic and republican administrations he says the trend seemed to be for the white house to exert more and more strict control over messaging you have to be willing to trust that the scientists and the experts who are doing those briefings are going to do what needs to be done he says and this administration is not unique not by any stretch of imagination in terms of their willingness to trust career scientists which is to say they don t seem to trust them very much he adds walensky s pledge to hold more briefings is a helpful development he says the question is going to be the frequency that they commit to holding regular press briefings what the topics are what the messages are cdc didn t respond to npr s question about how often the agency plans to hold agency led briefings frieden hopes that cdc will live up to its promise and speak directly to the public more often it s better for everyone he says it s better for cdc because they can explain themselves it s better for the administration because you re better off if you have a cdc that people trust and it s better for the public because you can understand the guidance copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
the nation s unemployment rate fell in december to a healthy 3 9 a pandemic low even as employers added a modest 199 000 jobs evidence that they are struggling to fill jobs with many americans reluctant to return to the workforce the drop in the jobless rate from 4 2 in november indicated that many more people found work last month indeed despite the slight hiring gain reported by businesses 651 000 more workers said they were employed in december compared with november still the data reported friday by the labor department reflected the state of the job market in early december before the spike in covid 19 infections began to disrupt the economy economists have cautioned that job growth may slow in january and possibly february because of omicron cases which have forced millions of newly infected workers to stay home and quarantine the economy is still about 3 6 million jobs short of its pre pandemic level for now steady hiring is being driven by strong consumer demand that has remained resilient despite chronic supply shortages consumer spending and business purchases of equipment are likely propelling the economy to a robust annual growth rate of roughly 7 in the final three months of 2021 americans confidence in the economy rose slightly in december according to the conference board suggesting that spending was probably healthy for much of last month wages also rose sharply in december with average hourly pay jumping 4 7 compared with a year ago that pay increase is a sign that companies are competing fiercely to fill their open jobs a record high wave of quitting as many workers seek better jobs is helping fuel pay raises low unemployment and rapid wage gains though could further heighten inflation as companies raise prices to cover rising labor costs price increases have already surged to a four decade high prompting a sharp pivot by the federal reserve from keeping rates low to support hiring to moving toward raising interest rates to combat inflation most economists expect the fed to raise its benchmark short term rate now pegged near zero in march and to do so two or three additional times this year companies are paying up for workers said neil dutta an economist at renaissance macro research this is consistent with inflation well above 2 which keeps the pressure on the fed to raise interest rates file a now hiring sign hangs in front of a winn dixie grocery store on dec 3 2021 in miami florida photo by joe raedle getty images among those benefiting from the intense competition for workers is patrick freeman a custodian at a furniture factory in hickory north carolina in late november freeman 57 was given a permanent job after having spent two years as a temp freeman got the good news at a time when many of his colleagues have found other jobs elsewhere leaving the company short staffed they ve scattered he said referring to his fellow employees they re really short in a lot of areas i m sticking around having come on board permanently freeman enjoyed a pay jump from 12 to 16 an hour after a 60 day probation period he will also receive health dental and vision benefits and he s eligible for the company s employee stock ownership program becky frankiewicz president of the staffing giant manpowergroup north america said that many of manpower s clients are shifting employees from temporary to permanent status because with workers scarce they want to lock people up frankiewicz said manpower has calculated that because of omicron absenteeism is running at three times its peak in 2021 yet there has been no slowdown in demand for workers she said more broadly through the economy though job growth will likely take a big hit this month from the omicron variant which has sickened millions of americans forced airlines to cancel thousands of flights reduced traffic at restaurants and bars and caused some major school systems to close potentially keeping some parents at home with children and unable to work that could make it even harder for companies to remain fully staffed and could slow the economy too michael pearce an economist at capital economics notes that millions of workers will likely be quarantining at home next week for those who aren t paid about one fifth of the u s workforce lacks sick leave their jobs won t be counted by the government that would lower the employment gain reported by businesses for january omicron has forced so many workers to call in sick it s disrupting businesses ranging from ski resorts to airlines to hospitals alaska airlines said it s cutting 10 of its flights in january because of an unprecedented number of employees calling in sick the wave of infections is also likely weighing on jobs at restaurants and bars the number of americans willing to eat at restaurants started to slip in late december according to the reservations website opentable restaurant traffic was nearly at pre pandemic levels for much of november but had fallen nearly 25 below those levels by dec 30 based on a weekly average of opentable data but because omicron is less virulent than previous covid 19 variants and few states or localities have moved to limit business operations economists say they believe its economic impact will be short lived omicron might have had some impact on december s data with the 199 000 added jobs having fallen well short of what economists had expected a category that includes restaurants bars hotels and casinos gained just 53 000 positions down from the several hundred thousand a month that were added earlier this year even with december s modest gain 2021 was one of the best years for american workers in decades though one that followed 2020 the job market s worst year since records began in 1939 a consequence of the pandemic recession companies posted a record number of open jobs last year and offered sharply higher pay to try to find and keep workers the number of jobs rose 4 5 in 2021 the largest such gain since 1978 that partly reflected a bounce back from the steep losses of 2020 when the nation shed 6 2 of its jobs many companies are looking past the omicron wave and still adding workers angie podolak director of human capital at beneficial state bank based in oakland california said the company which employs about 195 people is enjoying strong growth in auto lending and is seeking to fill 12 jobs though some of its front line workers have called in sick podolak said the bank hasn t had to reduce hours or lose business because of omicron nor has it had to slow its recruiting efforts beneficial already conducts job interviews by video it s really just been business as usual for us podolak said i m knocking on wood and crossing my fingers right now but we haven t seen a significant impact on our recruiting the aftermath of the pandemic has made the government s survey of company payrolls more volatile with one month s data often followed by a sharply different trend a month or two later on friday for example november s job gain of 210 000 was revised up to 249 000 and october s gain originally reported at 531 000 was upgraded to a strong 648 000 december s report also reflects a divergence in two surveys that the government conducts each month the unemployment rate is calculated from a survey of households for last month this survey found that 651 000 more people reported that they were employed a separate survey of employers called the payroll survey reported just 199 000 added jobs though the results of the two surveys typically match up over the long run they can differ sharply in any one month

not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a

press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask

the new york times 550 million purchase of the athletic is a gamble for the old school media giant dwarfing other recent acquisitions like the 30 million deal for the product review site the wirecutter in 2016 and the 25 million buy of podcast producer serial productions two years ago wall street s reaction was initially negative the times stock price dropped nearly 11 on friday the steepest drop in nearly two years with fears that the company s profits may take a hit in the short term still many experts are calling the purchase a smart move allowing the company to expand into local markets and speed up its goal of hitting 10 million subscribers at a moment when investors are placing a premium on subscriber based business models for content producers the athletic s 1 2 million subscribers will join the paper s existing stable of 8 3 million subscribers the ny times decision to acquire the athletic is a solid financial maneuver mike woosley coo of data company lotame told thewrap noting that the purchase price may be a bargain given the company s current 7 13 billion market cap they ll spend 6 of their market cap for a 12 overnight increase in paid subscriptions with its reach portfolio and brand recognition the new york times will inevitably make those subscribers much more valuable the athletic a six year old sports site that provides national and local coverage on more than 200 clubs and teams has been a huge success story in 2021 according to web analytics firm similarweb visits to the subscription sports news site grew by 70 as did total unique visitors when compared to the previous year moreover the site s bounce rate or the number of people who left after being on one page fell in 2020 and again in 2021 they grew significantly faster than the rest of the group seema shah senior director of research and analytics at similarweb told thewrap while the athletic saw growth of over 70 the next best site was sports illustrated which saw 37 growth meanwhile another sports site bleacher report declined 12 in unique visitors compared to 2020 further the athletic had the greatest amount of year over year visitor growth in 2021 when compared with peers like sports illustrated and barstool sports shah attributes the low bounce rate and significant traffic growth of the athletic to its specialized coverage of unique teams which appeals to diehard fans more than the wider sports coverage of big name outlets like the new york times the athletic acquisition then could be a move to diversify sports coverage and appeal to a wider audience overall by bringing in a bunch of smaller more dedicated audiences the 550 million pricetag is also notably less than the 750 million plus deal that the athletic had been seeking last year after talks with both the times and axios broke down for what it s worth the times own sports coverage saw a traffic increase of 30 in 2021 and a unique visitor increase of 20 shah said but also reported an increased bounce rate so that was sort of a negative sign she said they also looked like they were gaining some traffic share and this will probably accelerate that which is obviously what they want to do she said adding that the times would benefit from the athletic s international sports coverage in addition to its news operations the times also has developed other products including new york times cooking games wirecutter and the news audio app audm with this acquisition the paper not only expands its news offerings to subscribers but is able to penetrate into more local markets in sports loving regions where the times has less news coverage and as levien noted while the athletic will remain a standalone brand it will eventually become a part of the times bundle of offerings giving readers more value to their subscriptions media companies are increasingly strategizing around consolidated subscription models much like video streaming services have done anthony gonsalves senior vice president of publisher development at video platform connatix explained similar to the way hulu espn and disney are bundling their subscriptions this deal brings together diverse audiences across verticals to cross promote and grow loyalty gonsalves said as the industry continues to shift toward subscription based strategies we can expect to see more bundled offerings and acquisitions like this but the publishers who foster trusted relationships with readers through enriching quality content across verticals will see the most success while discounted and bundled subscription options will continue to trend there may be good reason the times will wait to add the athletic to that mix don t expect the athletic to be included in your unescalated ny times subscription right away woosley said conveying a distinct subscription decision and value proposition is the smartest way for the times to discipline itself in unlocking the value of these subscribers and this transaction

ambulance minutes later they get on facebook and see rumors of a suicide bombing there are reports of multiple deaths but it s still too early to know exactly what happened the marines accompanying

pursuing bachelor s degrees in business administration shazia had hopes of getting her degree then moving to the u s to open her own business even as the taliban drove into kabul she tried to convince her family to stay she had one more final exam to take but as the taliban tightened its grip on the city with little resistance it became clear that life would never return to normal within hours her dreams of graduating were put on hold kakaie and her family stayed in their home at the behest of azim who warned that it was too dangerous to leave confined to the airport he would guide them to the gates in the following days but eventually the u s military took over air traffic control and told azim he could either guide them over the phone from the airport and risk getting left behind or he could guide them over the phone from a military base in qatar or germany he chose the latter azim kakaie would bounce around u s military bases for the next week on sept 1 his journey ended in salt

they thought it would be easy the entire family already had the documents they needed plus azim was already inside the airport they figured he would meet them at the gate instead they found themselves in a crowd numbering in the thousands outside a roadblock guarded by the taliban people were desperately trying to crawl under the makeshift gate or pleading with taliban soldiers to let them through who would often respond with a beating despite the chaos they were able to push to the front of the gate you go to speak with taliban kakaie told her mother hawa sultani because she is old the taliban wouldn t let them through when she persisted they pointed their guns at her undeterred she continued to press the soldiers one of them put his gun in the air and fired several shots before lowering the rifle at sultani s head kakaie grabbed her mother s hand and yanked her away they wanted to kill my mother she recalled they would eventually make it through a different roadblock also guarded by the taliban only to find themselves in front of another gate this time guarded by zero one soldiers a cia backed special forces unit of the afghan army that kakaie says was just as ruthless as the taliban we know the taliban they are very brutal but these afghan forces that were working with the americans they were also very brutal kicking ladies and kids everyone firing guns shazia said through wali s translation it was hard to breathe and the soldiers routinely threw canisters of tear gas into the crowd or hit kakaie and her family with the stock of their rifles if they got too close to the gate they didn t seem to be letting anyone in kakaie s family maintains they were only letting afghan soldiers and their families through tired their lungs and eyes burning and bodies aching they returned home the next day they walked to a different gate but kakaie says the crowd had doubled in size they tried to push through but they couldn t get close and kakaie pregnant kept

sleepless nights outside a gate guarded by afghan forces kept awake by the sound of gunfire and clouds of tear gas the soldiers would throw flash grenades into the increasingly unruly crowd sometimes it would trigger a stampede i saw in front of my eyes many people die like small babies maybe a month or three months they were just smashed and also i saw many old people their hands their feet broken i saw in front of my eyes a person lost his finger because of a sound bomb that directly exploded and his finger went into the air and because of this i see nightmares every night wali kakaie said as shazia nodded in agreement flashing a wary tired smile but the family was unwavering in their determination they tried another roadblock this time guarded by the taliban and were let through expecting to see more afghan forces kakaie and her family were cautiously optimistic when they arrived at a gate bearing the australian and english flags it was 6 p m the family was nearing 32 hours on foot with almost no food just water if we find it kakaie said if we don t find we don t drink water they stayed in front of the gate for the night with kakaie s brother arif muradi standing in a

heard clearly over the last week that there was interest in hearing from us independently this is hard and i am committed to continue to improve she said i anticipate that this will be the first of many briefings and i very much look forward to them frieden is on board i hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in cdc he says the more cdc can speak directly to the public following its own principles of communication in a health emergency the better off we ll all be for cdc covid 19 briefings have been unusually sparse the idea of speaking out during a public health crisis is hardly new cdc literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency says frieden it has clear principles to uphold he says be first be right be credible be empathetic and give people practical proven things to do to protect themselves their families and their communities glen nowak who used to run media relations for the agency says press briefings are an important part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask tough questions and we d realize oh we didn t say that as clearly as we intended or we didn t think of that we d better address that issue when sars cov 2 was identified in china cdc seemed to follow that playbook in mid january 2020 dr nancy messonnier then director of cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases led the first cdc telebriefing on the subject she was joined by another career scientist dr marty cetron director of cdc s division of global migration and quarantine since the outbreaks of mers and sars we have made improvements in our capacity in the united states and around the world messonnier told reporters we re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively these briefings continued every few days until one of them jolted america to attention on feb 25 2020 messonnier warned this could be bad i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said after her comments financial markets crashed president donald trump whose message was that the pandemic was of little concern and under control was so angry at messonnier that he reportedly wanted her fired the next day he put vice president mike pence in charge of the white house coronavirus task force televised covid 19 briefings became a white house affair the cdc director was not usually present the cdc telebriefings did continue for a while although only occasionally under biden cdc still seems sidelined president biden came into office promising to beat the pandemic by restoring public trust scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you that s why you re going to be hearing a lot more from dr fauci again not from the president but from the real genuine experts and scientists biden pledged the day after his inauguration certainly americans have heard a lot from dr anthony fauci of nih the president s chief medical adviser and cdc s walensky both are frequent guests on tv news shows and in white house covid 19 response briefings which are usually held several times a week but under biden cdc and its career scientists seem to still be sidelined cdc has actually done fewer telebriefings on the pandemic under biden in 2020 under trump there were around two dozen cdc telebriefings in 2021 under biden there were two dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at nyu who considers dr walensky a mentor says she has been hoping to hear more from cdc s career scientists in the new administration i would love to hear more from them just about what is the science that they re doing how do they go about it what is their process she says i think there is something to be said for also just putting a human face on some of this she adds which the public does not get when guidance changes happen via the cdc website she calls walensky s promise to bring back regular briefings good news politics and a pandemic aren t necessarily good bedfellows the administration seems to be treating the pandemic as a political problem that has to be managed in a political way says gregg gonsalves an epidemiologist at yale there needs to be a lot more openness and transparency from the white house and they need to let their scientists off the leash he says one overriding issue may be a clash between politics and public health political messages need to be simple but that doesn t work for infectious disease messaging says nowak the situation is much more dynamic viruses change a lot and can change in ways that render your recommendations not so effective he says with infectious disease communications you really have to acknowledge uncertainty yet over the 14 years he worked at cdc across democratic and republican administrations he says the trend seemed to be for the white house to exert more and more strict control over messaging you have to be willing to trust that the scientists and the experts who are doing those briefings are going to do what needs to be done he says and this administration is not unique not by any stretch of imagination in terms of their willingness to trust career scientists which is to say they don t seem to trust them very much he adds walensky s pledge to hold more briefings is a helpful development he says the question is going to be the frequency that they commit to holding regular press briefings what the topics are what the messages are cdc didn t respond to npr s question about how often the agency plans to hold agency led briefings frieden hopes that cdc will live up to its promise and speak directly to the public more often it s better for everyone he says it s better for cdc because they can explain themselves it s better for the administration because you re better off if you have a cdc that people trust and it s better for the public because you can understand the guidance copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

teachers says the district isn t ready to return to in person learning dekalb county schools joined atlanta public schools and other districts in reverting to virtual learning for the first week of the spring semester the decision was made due to the rising number of covid 19 cases while many online commenters have encouraged school districts to extend virtual learning both aps and dekalb county schools plan to return to in person learning on monday superintendent cheryl watson harris published a welcome back letter for families on jan 7 as you prepare for the return to face to face instruction on monday january 10 i want you to know that we are fully committed to taking the necessary steps to mitigate the spread of covid 19 in the dekalb county school district she wrote to ensure the safety and well being of our students and staff we will continue to consistently clean and sanitize our facilities while strictly adhering to the guidance issued by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc by properly wearing masks and following mitigation strategies our students can receive the instruction they need to learn thrive and reach their fullest potential but the coalition for a safe dcsd return says there are still many issues the district needs to work through before returning students to the classroom we are disheartened and concerned to learn that superintendent watson harris has decided to return students to face to face learning next week the group said in a statement to decaturish seven days ago the district announcement cited rising number of positive cases within dekalb county and metro atlanta as the reason for virtual instruction this week the number of positive cases continues to rise was the decision making faulty last week or this week in fact according to the new york times the total reported for the past week was the highest of the pandemic and the number of hospitalized young children who ve tested positive is jumping other metro atlanta districts have increased the amount of mitigation measures they re taking to protect their communities the safe return group noted that aps is conducting twice weekly surveillance testing but many district schools haven t started any surveillance testing families are concerned that they re unable to sign up for surveillance testing and know when to expect the surveillance testing to occur the statement from the safe return group says aps will also be implementing test to stay which is a mitigation recommended by dr fauci and the cdc clayton county is requiring all staff to show a negative covid test in order to return to school dcsd did offer testing this past monday and tuesday our coalition is hearing from teachers who were the very first to get tested that they have yet to receive their results rockdale county will stay virtual next week masks are also a concern the group says many schools across dcsd do not have properly fitting masks to hand out to younger students as the district is only providing adult sized masks it s not uncommon for our young scholars to need a new mask during the school day the group says and a child wearing a face mask made for an adult is pretty much useless mrs watson harris states that they are strictly adhering to the guidance issued by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc by properly wearing masks and following mitigation strategies they re not students are walking around in masks that do not protect because they don t fit properly many schools also don t have good ventilation due to non functioning hvac units the group added schools are asking for hand soap donations from their community because the district isn t providing enough hand soap for students the statement says while there are many schools in dcsd that have very active pta organizations and foundations to provide necessary ppe and cleaning supplies the majority of our schools simply do not have that luxury since dcsd can t even keep hand soap in stock at our schools how are we supposed to trust the statement that mrs watson harris made about them strictly adhering to their mask mandate and other mitigations they

stating that they don t have working hvac air purifiers in their rooms extra masks their covid test results from 5 days ago hand soap and sanitizing wipes i can understand the frustration from families that have vaccinated their children and donate to their local school to fill the gap dcsd has left many schools lack the resources to fill in the gaps left by dcsd we re all frustrated here s a handful of comments provided to our coalition from teachers that would like to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from dcsd anonymous for dunaire es mask that are too big for the students they did pass out wipes today 2 packs paper towels for bathrooms not classrooms no hand soap provided no heat druid hills high school doesn t have heat in most of the rooms of the main building and we were out of paper towels wipes water bottles since around november dhhs we had no air conditioning for the entire summer they finally are finishing the access way that has been ripped up since august it s

supplies we seem to have soap paper towels wipes and hand sanitizer masks have been difficult to get though huntley hills several rooms with out heat and ac always breaking in some rooms in the summer months flat shoals not enough soap and hand towels good morning i m a staff member at redan elementary we do not have paper towels masks for students hand soap or partitions for students and teachers thank you i would like to be anonymous dcsd needs to provide testing and vaccination sites at various locations across our district instead they re providing testing at their central office during school hours how teachers and students suppose to access this while they re expected to be in school all expectations point to the increase in cases continuing just a little longer followed by a steep drop in about a month why would we take such a drastic risk when a reprieve is just around the corner amber schmidtke phd is an expert in public health she has been closely monitoring and providing an analysis of the covid data her in georgia recently she tweeted the following in response to the outcries proclaiming that all schools are safe we can do school safely but not when only 33 of k 12 aged kids are fully vaccinated without ventilation masks etc it s one thing to say we have the tools to do this safely but we aren t using those tools yet hospitals are overwhelmed why add to the burden

on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance for k 12 schools but even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all it was the first such briefing in months despite the ongoing pandemic crisis that lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more

not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a briefing by subject matter experts sharing what they know with the press and the public the fact is there are dedicated scientists at cdc who are the world s experts in a lot of these issues and they

part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask

on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance

communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more often and more clearly an unmet promise in fact the biden administration has repeatedly promised to put career scientists front and center in its covid communications but such experts have generally not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a

tired of making offers on homes only to get turned down again and again you re not alone over the last year as home prices soared and available homes dwindled aspiring home buyers faced new headwinds that left many of them struggling to compete today even an above asking price offer isn t necessarily going to win the home instead the power has shifted to cash buyers this has created a seemingly insurmountable problem for many first time home buyers young professionals and growing families who are well qualified for a mortgage but don t have the savings or equity to make all cash offers a recent opendoor survey found that nearly 60 of first time homebuyers had to make five or more offers before purchasing their home averaging 10 offers apiece and frustration has been mounting it s stressful when buyers begin their search most believe it might only take a couple of months until they re in their next home says houwzer buyer agent lisa armellino this is not the case for many buyers today imagine the stress when a buyer puts very strong offers on more than 10 houses over the course of one year there is a sense of hopelessness loss and uncertainty but now that might be changing houwzer a top rated all in one real estate company is giving qualified home buyers a way to make all cash offers so they can win the home they want through what they re calling the cash advantage the power of cash in a competitive market in a competitive marketplace cash gives buyers the advantage the data shows that those who can offer cash have a better chance of getting their offer accepted all cash offers are highly preferred by home sellers because they can close faster come with fewer contingencies and are less likely to fall through than mortgage financed offers in fact cash is so alluring that sellers will often accept a lower offer if the offer is in cash many sellers in this market are looking for the easiest path to settlement so a cash buyer truly speaks to them explains armellino the money is already prepared sitting in a bank account and there is no mortgage company to potentially complicate anything the reality is that financed buyers just can t compete against cash offers and that s a problem since cash offers are becoming more prevalent according to the national association of realtors nar all cash sales rose sharply to comprise 25 of all home sales in april 2021 up from 15 the previous year this influx of cash buyers stems from what the washington post calls the uneven economic impact of the pandemic high paid workers relocating to less expensive areas a drop in discretionary spending allowing some consumers to ramp up savings a booming stock market driving massive gains for investors and existing homeowners taking advantage of surging home prices to sell their home for top dollar if buyers want to land a home in this market what they really need is cash and that s what houwzer s cash advantage gives them all too often single family homes are purchased by developers or wall street who have the unfair advantage of cash on hand says houwzer s ceo mike maher with cash advantage our buyers will now have the same opportunity that has always been limited to those with liquidity they get the power of a cash offer without actually having to pay cash here s how cash advantage works first the buyer will get pre approved through houwzer mortgage so they know what they can afford they then work with a houwzer buyer agent to find the home they want to buy as soon as the buyer decides on a home their agent will use houwzer s money to make a strong cash offer on their behalf giving them a better shot at winning the home after the seller accepts the offer their in house mortgage advisor will help the buyer set up a loan with a competitive interest rate to finance the home at the closing the cash offer will be replaced with the mortgage without affecting the deal at all it s pretty simple says maher we let our buyers use houwzer s money to make an all cash offer and then help them finance the home later with a regular mortgage now home buyers may finally have what they need to stop writing offers and start winning their dream homes

another career scientist dr marty cetron director of cdc s division of global migration and quarantine since the outbreaks of mers and sars we have made improvements in our capacity in the united states and around the world messonnier told reporters we re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively these briefings continued every few days until one of them jolted america to attention on feb 25 2020 messonnier warned this could be bad i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said after her comments financial markets crashed president donald trump whose message was that the pandemic was of little concern and under control was so angry at messonnier that he reportedly wanted her fired the next day he put vice president mike pence in charge of the white house coronavirus task force televised covid 19 briefings became a white house affair the cdc director was not usually present the cdc telebriefings did continue for a while although only occasionally under biden cdc still seems sidelined president biden came into office promising to beat the pandemic by restoring public trust scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you that s why you re going to be hearing a lot more from dr fauci again not from the president but from the real genuine experts and scientists biden pledged the day after his inauguration certainly americans have heard a lot from dr anthony fauci of nih the president s chief medical adviser and cdc s walensky both are frequent guests on tv news shows and in white house covid 19 response briefings which are usually held several times a week but under biden cdc and its career scientists seem to still be sidelined cdc has actually done fewer telebriefings on the pandemic under biden in 2020 under trump there were around two dozen cdc telebriefings in 2021 under biden there were two dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at nyu who considers dr walensky a mentor says she has been hoping to hear more from cdc s career scientists in the new administration i would love to hear more from them just about what is the science that they re doing how do they go about it what is their process she says i think there is something to be said for also just putting a human face on some of this she adds which the public does not get when guidance changes happen via the cdc website she calls walensky s promise to bring back regular briefings good news politics and a pandemic aren t necessarily good bedfellows the administration seems to be treating the pandemic as a political problem that has to be managed in a political way says gregg gonsalves an epidemiologist at yale there needs to be a lot more openness and transparency from the white house and they need to let their scientists off the leash he says one overriding issue may be a clash between politics and public health political messages need to be simple but that doesn t work for infectious disease messaging says nowak the situation is much more dynamic viruses change a lot and can change in ways that render your recommendations not so effective he says with infectious disease communications you really have to acknowledge uncertainty yet over the 14 years he worked at cdc across democratic and republican administrations he says the trend seemed to be for the white house to exert more and more strict control over messaging you have to be willing to trust that the scientists and the experts who are doing those briefings are going to do what needs to be done he says and this administration is not unique not by any stretch of imagination in terms of their willingness to trust career scientists which is to say they don t seem to trust them very much he adds walensky s pledge to hold more briefings is a helpful development he says the question is going to be the frequency that they commit to holding regular press briefings what the topics are what the messages are cdc didn t respond to npr s question about how often the agency plans to hold agency led briefings frieden hopes that cdc will live up to its promise and speak directly to the public more often it s better for everyone he says it s better for cdc because they can explain themselves it s better for the administration because you re better off if you have a cdc that people trust and it s better for the public because you

on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance for k 12 schools but even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all it was the first such briefing in months despite the ongoing pandemic crisis that lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more often and more clearly an unmet promise in fact the biden administration has repeatedly promised to put career scientists front and center in its covid communications but such experts have generally not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a briefing by subject matter experts sharing what they know with the press and the public the fact is there are dedicated scientists at cdc who are the world s experts in a lot of these issues and they need to be speaking directly to the public along with dr walensky says dr tom frieden cdc director during the obama administration who now runs resolve to save lives an initiative to help governments and outside groups prevent epidemics cdc is responding to these charges of inadequate communication the agency decided to hold friday s briefing walensky told reporters on the call because we had heard clearly over the last week that there was interest in hearing from us independently this is hard and i am committed to continue to improve she said i anticipate that this will be the first of many briefings and i very much look forward to them frieden is on board i hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in cdc he says the more cdc can speak directly to the public following its own principles of communication in a health emergency the better off we ll all be for cdc covid 19 briefings have been unusually sparse the idea of speaking out during a public health crisis is hardly new cdc literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency says frieden it has clear principles to uphold he says be first be right be credible be empathetic and give people practical proven things to do to protect themselves their families and their communities glen nowak who used to run media relations for the agency says press briefings are an important part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask

on january 3 2022 the delaware court of chancery issued a novel decision arising from a challenge to a transaction involving a special purpose acquisition company commonly referred to as a spac in in re multiplan corp stockholders litigation applying well worn fiduciary principles under delaware law to the claims raised by stockholder plaintiffs the court denied a motion to dismiss allowing claims to proceed against a spac s sponsor and its directors as well as an aiding and abetting claim against its financial advisor given the scope of the ruling and the fact that the challenges raised in multiplan arise from common spac structures practices and disclosures the decision is a must read for anyone focused on spacs background according to the decision churchill was a spac founded and controlled by michael klein through a sponsor entity the sponsor the spac s directors were allegedly hand picked by mr klein and given economic interests in the sponsor churchill s 2020 initial public offering ipo was priced at 10 per unit consisting of one share of class a stock and a quarter of a warrant with an exercise price of 11 50 after the ipo churchill s equity structure consisted of class a shares held by public stockholders and class b founder shares purchased by the sponsor for a nominal capital contribution and convertible to class a shares if the spac closed a transaction the class a and class b shares represented 80 and 20 respectively of the spac s outstanding equity the spac also made a private placement of 23 million warrants to the sponsor at 1 each with an exercise price of 11 50 in the event that a transaction was not accomplished within 24 months the spac would liquidate and class a shareholders would receive their pro rata share of the amount from the ipo plus interest equal to 10 04 in contrast the sponsor s class b shares would expire as worthless absent a deal the warrants held by both class a and class b stockholders would also be worthless if there were no deal however if the spac proposed a business combination class a stockholders could choose to exercise a redemption right for their class a shares for 10 04 and would retain their warrants regardless of whether they voted in favor of the deal the spac identified multiplan as its acquisition target and retained the klein group llc an entity controlled by michael klein as its financial advisor the spac did not obtain an independent third party valuation of multiplan or a fairness opinion the merger proxy statement sought stockholder approval and also informed class a stockholders about their ability to redeem their shares stockholders overwhelmingly approved the deal and less than 10 of the class a stockholders opted to exercise their redemption rights after the merger closed the newly public multiplan s stock dropped significantly based on a report from an equity research firm about multiplan s largest customer forming a competitor entity which was not disclosed in the proxy the complaint followed asserting class claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the spac directors mr klein the spac s cfo and the klein group court s analysis on the motion to dismiss preliminary defenses the complaint at its core generally challenged the structure of the spac as creating a divergence of interests between class a and class b stockholders and specifically alleged that the defendants prioritized their personal interests above the class a stockholder interests in completing the merger and issued a false and misleading proxy that harmed class a stockholders when making their redemption decision as an initial matter the court held that the claims raised were direct not derivative as they involved the redemption right not a right that belonged to the spac and impacted the class a stockholders right to redeem the court also rejected the argument that fiduciary duty claims were foreclosed because the redemption rights arose contractually from the company s charter and that the claim was a holder claim that could not be asserted on behalf of a class under delaware law entire fairness review the court then turned to the substance of the claims concluding that the entire fairness standard of review applied for two reasons first the court held that it was reasonably conceivable that the de spac merger was a conflicted controller transaction the parties agreed that mr klein through the sponsor controlled the spac and the court concluded that he well pleaded allegations in the complaint highlight a benefit unique to klein emphasizing that on the date the merger closed the sponsor s investment was worth 356 million representing a 1 219 900 gain on the sponsor s 25 000 investment however hese figures would have dropped to zero absent a deal in contrast class a stockholders would have received 10 04 per share if the spac failed to consummate a transaction and liquidated or if they had redeemed their shares thus the court concluded that there was a potential conflict between klein and public stockholders resulting from their different incentives in a bad deal versus no deal at all according to the court the class b stockholders were incentivized to support any deal even if the resulting post merger entity proved less valuable for class a stockholders than if churchill had liquidated the court also dismissed concerns about this ruling s impact on other spacs concluding hat this structure has been utilized by other spacs does not cure it of its conflicts nor does the technical legality of the de spac mechanics under delaware law orporate acts must be twice tested once by the law and again in equity second the court held that there were reasonably conceivable allegations that the spac board was conflicted because the spac s directors through their economic interests in the sponsor would benefit from virtually any merger even one that was value diminishing for class a stockholders because a merger would convert their otherwise valueless interests in class b shares into shares of public multiplan the court also held that a majority of the board was conflicted because they were not independent from mr klein notably he had appointed many of them to other spac boards in some cases at least five other spacs and it was therefore conceivable that those directors would expect to be considered for directorships in future klein sponsored spacs and that the founder shares they would receive from those positions were material to them disclosure claims the court then held that the proxy contained false and misleading disclosures the proxy did not disclose that multiplan s largest customer was uhc and that uhc was developing an in house alternative to multiplan that would both eliminate its need for multiplan s services and compete with multiplan based on the plaintiffs allegations it is reasonably conceivable that a class a stockholder would have been substantially likely to find this information important when deciding whether to redeem her churchill shares claims against defendants finally the court held that the complaint alleged nonexculpated claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the spac s directors in doing so the court stated critically i note the plaintiffs claims are viable not simply because of the nature of the transaction or resulting conflicts they are reasonably conceivable because the complaint alleges that the director defendants failed disloyally to disclose information necessary for the plaintiffs to knowledgably exercise their redemption rights this conclusion does not address the validity of a hypothetical claim where the disclosure is adequate and the allegations rest solely on the premise that fiduciaries were necessarily interested given the spac s structure the core direct harm presented in this case concerns the impairment of stockholder redemption rights if public stockholders in possession of all material information about the target had chosen to invest rather than redeem one can imagine a different outcome emphasis added the court also sustained claims against mr klein in his capacity as the spac s controlling stockholder and as ceo of the spac however the court dismissed claims against the spac s cfo the court also sustained an aiding and abetting allegation against the klein group the spac s financial advisor takeaways the case involves a novel application of traditional fiduciary duty principles in the spac context and as such it will generate a significant amount of discussion and debate among spac participants and their advisors the multiplan opinion is a pleadings stage decision and the court s consideration of the facts was limited essentially to the complaint s allegations factual developments in the case going forward may provide additional guidance about the merits and invite a more refined analysis from the court it remains to be seen whether the decision will spur

on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance for k 12 schools but even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all it was the first such briefing in months despite the ongoing pandemic crisis that lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more often and more clearly an unmet promise in fact the biden administration has repeatedly promised to put career scientists front and center in its covid communications but such experts have generally not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a briefing by subject matter experts sharing what they know with the press and the public the fact is there are dedicated scientists at cdc who are the world s experts in a lot of these issues and they need to be speaking directly to the public along with dr walensky says dr tom frieden cdc director during the obama administration who now runs resolve to save lives an initiative to help governments and outside groups prevent epidemics cdc is responding to these charges of inadequate communication the agency decided to hold friday s briefing walensky told reporters on the call because we had heard clearly over the last week that there was interest in hearing from us independently this is hard and i am committed to continue to improve she said i anticipate that this will be the first of many briefings and i very much look forward to them frieden is on board i hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in cdc he says the more cdc can speak directly to the public following its own principles of communication in a health emergency the better off we ll all be for cdc covid 19 briefings have been unusually sparse the idea of speaking out during a public health crisis is hardly new cdc literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency says frieden it has clear principles to uphold he says be first be right be credible be empathetic and give people practical proven things to do to protect themselves their families and their communities glen nowak who used to run media relations for the agency says press briefings are an important part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask tough questions and we d realize oh we didn t say that as clearly as we intended or we didn t think of that we d better address that issue when sars cov 2 was identified in china cdc seemed to follow that playbook in mid january 2020 dr nancy messonnier then director of cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases led the first cdc telebriefing on the subject she was joined by another career scientist dr marty cetron director of cdc s division of global migration and quarantine since the outbreaks of mers and sars we have made improvements in our capacity in the united states and around the world messonnier told reporters we re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively these briefings continued every few days until one of them jolted america to attention on feb 25 2020 messonnier warned this could be bad i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said after her comments financial markets crashed president donald trump whose message was that the pandemic was of little concern and under control was so angry at messonnier that he reportedly wanted her fired the next day he put vice president mike pence in charge of the white house coronavirus task force televised covid 19 briefings became a white house affair the cdc director was not usually present the cdc telebriefings did continue for a while although only occasionally under biden cdc still seems sidelined president biden came into office promising to beat the pandemic by restoring public trust scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you that s why you re going to be hearing a lot more from dr fauci again not from the president but from the real genuine experts and scientists biden pledged the day after his inauguration certainly americans have heard a lot from dr anthony fauci of nih the president s chief medical adviser and cdc s walensky both are frequent guests on tv news shows and in white house covid 19 response briefings which are usually held several times a week but under biden cdc and its career scientists seem to still be sidelined cdc has actually done fewer telebriefings on the pandemic under biden in 2020 under trump there were around two dozen cdc telebriefings in 2021 under biden there were two dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at nyu who considers dr walensky a mentor says she has been hoping to hear more from cdc s career scientists in the new administration i would love to hear more from them just about what is the science that they re doing how do they go about it what is their process she says i think there is something to be said for also just putting a human face on some of this she adds which the public does not get when guidance changes happen via the cdc website she calls walensky s promise to bring back regular briefings good news politics and a pandemic aren t necessarily good bedfellows the administration seems to be treating the pandemic as a political problem that has to be managed in a political way says gregg gonsalves an epidemiologist at yale there needs to be a lot more openness and transparency from the white house and they need to let their scientists off the leash he says one overriding issue may be a clash between politics and public health political messages need to be simple but that doesn t work for infectious disease messaging says nowak the situation is much more dynamic viruses change a lot and can change in ways that render your recommendations not so effective he says with infectious disease communications you really have to acknowledge uncertainty yet over the 14 years he worked at cdc across democratic and republican administrations he says the trend seemed to be for the white house to exert more and more strict control over messaging you have to be willing to trust that the scientists and the experts who are doing those briefings are going to do what needs to be done he says and this administration is not unique not by any stretch of imagination in terms of their willingness to trust career scientists which is to say they don t seem to trust them very much he adds walensky s pledge to hold more briefings is a helpful development he says the question is going to be the frequency that they commit to holding regular press briefings what the topics are what the messages are cdc didn t respond to npr s question about how often the agency plans to hold agency led briefings frieden hopes that cdc will live up to its promise and speak directly to the public more often it s better for everyone he says it s better for cdc because they can explain themselves it s better for the administration because you re better off if you have a cdc that people trust and it s better for the public because you
