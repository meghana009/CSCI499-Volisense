by now most people know that stress can take a serious toll on mental and physical health and when that stress is prolonged studies suggest it can increase the risk of certain health conditions like asthma ulcers heart attack and stroke now new research suggests that certain types of stress can even age your immune system using an existing body of data researchers looked at survey responses from a nationally representative sample of more than 5 700 adults in the united states aged 50 and over and cross referenced them with immune cell counts from participants blood the survey asked respondents about their experiences with social stressors like job strain chronic stress stressful life events everyday or lifetime discrimination including sexism or ageism and traumatic life events the team found that higher levels of reported stress were associated with older immune system profiles the findings were published monday in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences what the findings suggest as your immune system ages your body has a less coordinated response to new threats because it produces different types of immune cells in different proportions than it does when you are younger said eric klopack the lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher of gerontology at the university of southern california at the same time older more worn out immune cells tend to dominate over newer more agile ones resulting in a less robust immune response
as the highest quality stocks continue to get cheaper here are two of the best that canadian dividend investors can buy now earning cash from your investments is always a pleasant feeling but when you can earn that cash every month it can also help you to compound that money quicker that s why some of the best canadian dividend stocks to buy are ones that pay cash every month for most stocks dividends are paid four times a year once every quarter however there are a select few stocks usually ones that are made for dividend investors that return a handsome amount of cash every single month if you re looking to boost your passive income stream here are two of the best canadian dividend stocks to consider in this highly opportune market environment a top canadian green energy stock there s no doubt that green energy is an industry that has decades of growth potential that s why finding high quality dividend stocks like northland power tsx npi which you can buy and hold for years is so ideal northland power is a monthly dividend stock that has green energy assets in north america asia and europe a quick glance at the stock shows that its dividend even after it s sold off recently offers a yield of 3 2 that s certainly not too shabby however it s also not that high either but what s positive about northland is that much of the company s cash flow goes towards investing in growth rather than back to investors so in addition to being a high quality monthly dividend stock northland is also an attractive long term growth stock plus with the stock now trading nearly 20 off its high and clearly undervalued given how resilient its operations are it s one of the best canadian dividend stocks to buy now one of the best canadian dividend stocks to buy in the energy sector in addition to northland if you re looking for a stock that offers a higher yield freehold royalties tsx fru is one of the best canadian dividend stocks to buy now despite the fact that freehold has been one of the best performers this year and is still positive for the year in recent weeks freehold stock has sold off significantly this significant selloff has made the stock much cheaper and more attractive in addition the selloff has also helped push its dividend yield even higher now standing at roughly 7 4 typically when stocks have high dividend yields it can be a sign that it s at risk of being cut however currently freehold s payout ratio is actually below its target as the company has been conservative coming off of the pandemic therefore while it trades so cheaply and offers such a significant monthly dividend it has to be one of the best canadian stocks to buy freehold is one of the lower risk energy stocks you can buy considering that it receives a royalty from other producers operating on its land rather than it having to produce oil and gas itself therefore while freehold is trading undervalued and offering a significant dividend yield there s no question it s one of the best monthly dividend stocks that canadian investors can buy today
peter bradley american renaissance june 17 2022 if america continues to decline it will be one of the most amazing and depressing stories ever told the united states will have gone from almost absolute leadership of the world in the 20th century to just another mediocrity in a very short time future chinese historians will ponder the rapid collapse of such a dynamic nation and wonder what it may mean for their own civilization for that they can find no better guide than the dispossessed majority tdm written by wilmot robertson in 1972 the author described his book as an elegy for a great nation that no longer existed but much more than that he explained in detail how and why dispossession happened and even proposed an idea for a renewal not only for america but for whites worldwide even in 1972 conservatives knew something was wrong with america and were sounding the alarm high taxes too much regulation lack of religion in schools marxism unions political corruption and loose morals their nostrums cut taxes and government strengthen the military and promote family values had no effect on halting america s descent tdm offered one reason for decline whites america s founders and sustainers were no longer in charge of the nation they had built they were also being submerged by racially conscious non whites who could never assimilate into american life and would never put country before race let us not forget that robertson started writing tdm in the early 1960s when the us was still about 90 percent white the rot had set in decades before the us was colonized by the third world prelude to dispossession robertson argues that already by 1972 whites had lost their country and that his book records the sorry chronicle of majority reverses on all the important battlegrounds cultural religious political economic and diplomatic since the liberal minority coalition has emerged victorious on all fronts it is not an overstatement to describe the losers as the dispossessed majority tdm has 39 chapters in 10 sections that go into detail about how whites were dispossessed robertson names names cites dates and includes an amazing number of little known facts often in footnotes that he did this alone and in pre internet days is a testament to the author s knowledge research and dedication you can hardly get a better lesson in real american history nor is this dry history robertson makes the story of america come alive the first section of tdm is called racial dynamics though we all belong to the same species humans belong to races tdm cites hard data on biology and race but robertson writes that race sometimes hard to define with precision can also be sensed it is an essential element of being human because men can give up religion country or culture but cannot give up race it is trendy to say that race doesn t exist or that whites made it up to justify colonization yet racial classification goes back to at least the bible which divided mankind into three races egyptian depictions show clear racial division with light skinned rulers tanned workers and black slaves the indian caste system was set up 2 500 years ago and was determined by color and nose shape the ancient greeks tried to understand racial differences hippocrates thought climate and geography might have caused different racial temperaments but it was not until the early 20th century that a comprehensive theory of racial equality was developed columbia anthropology professor franz boas theorized that culture not biology explained racial differences and even claimed head shape could be changed by environment in one or two generations despite flimsy evidence and reasoning racial egalitarians came to dominate anthropology by the 1960s their claims happily touted by the mass media influenced public policy scientists who offered genetic reasons for racial differences had the facts on their side but were ignored silenced harassed or censored for robertson the civil war marked the start of white decline as it split the nation and caused the death of over 600 000 whites weakening america s founding stock only revitalized nationalism during both world wars helped cool the bitterness that conflict caused particularly among southerners a desire for cheap labor brought blacks to the south this same desire prompted mass white immigration to the north starting in the 1840s first from ireland and then from other parts of europe many of these whites became assimilated minorities but robertson counts even some white ethnicities as unassimilable particularly jews this is perhaps why he uses the term majority instead of whites the tdm put great importance on the of the role of jews in white dispossession indeed a central theme of the book is that a hostile jewish elite had displaced the old wasp elite starting in the 1930s robertson s discussion of the boazian school s takeover of anthropology for example emphasizes the number of jews who were part of that movement many members of the old wasp establishment went along with and enabled new elites robertson even has terms for them gracchites are rich whites who advance their careers and fortunes by catering to minorities an example being franklin roosevelt pussyfooters are whites often lawyers scientists professors or small newspaper editors who know the score but keep quiet instead of speaking up for their people old believers believed or pretended to believe in old fashioned american liberalism in the jeffersonian sense non whites and jews each have their sections in tdm and robertson summarizes their history and presence in the us the chapter on the negroes is particularly interesting and highly recommended in light of current propaganda the clash perhaps the heart of tdm is what the author calls the clash of whites against minorities in every facet of american life the cultural clash is the battle for the soul of the white man and includes art religion and education robertson names the majority artist as the greatest casualty of dispossession that is because great art comes from aristocracies within a dominant and homogenous group he cites homeric greece augustan rome elizabethan england and mozart s vienna as a few such examples in contrast art stagnates in multiracial and multicultural societies what great art has polyglot new york city or rio de janeiro produced in modern times what does this mean for the majority artist the communications media and principal academic forums being largely closed to him the majority artist has no adequate defense against the blistering minority assaults on his culture he must avoid praising his own people as a people and he must avoid castigating other peoples particularly the more dynamic minorities the minority artist on the other hand wears no such cultural straitjacket he freely praises who he likes and freely damns whom he dislikes both as individuals and as groups the majority artist with a narrower choice of heroes and villains has a narrower choice of theme lacking the drive and brute force of minority racism majority art tends to become bland innocuous emotionless sterile and boring in the political clash robertson examines democracy conservatism and liberalism he calls democracy the most utopian and most quixotic of political forms and notes that it works only when it is the rule of a people not several different peoples liberalism was the means by which minorities took power in the us but if liberals are hypocrites robertson calls them the bigoted enemy of bigotry what are conservatives conservatives in the 1970s and now were classical liberals robertson calls them probably the most effective of all americans in keeping the majority in the deep freeze of racial apathy tdm claims that america does have a legitimate conservative tradition even in the realm of race men such as lothrop stoddard and madison grant world war ii and the great depression nearly wiped out all authentic american conservatism resulting in conservatism inc see if this doesn t sound familiar before he was allowed a national platform the modern conservative had to demonstrate that he was a member of the loyal opposition that on the sensitive issues he was of one mind with the liberal himself no public manifestation of classical conservatism i e no forthright attack against democracy and minority racism would be tolerated if the fires of minority illiberalism and minority racism could not be quenched by modest low decibel appeals for decorum they were to be left raging the only notes of dissention permitted the modern conservative were the safe ones he could be more reverent toward big business property patriotism religion government decentralization and law and order he could be more critical of socialism marxism castro overregulation labor unions and budget deficits but the permissible differences were differences in degree not in kind on the larger issues the issues behind the issues modern liberalism and modern conservatism were often becoming synonymous robertson discusses economic and fiscal policy in ways that are certainly relevant today he believed that the only way to measure an economy is by how it provides for its people race is an indispensable part of economics fiscal policies are not the expressions of or trademarks of an economic system they are the expressions of how different peoples measure the input they expect to give society and the output they expect to receive when the workforce in detroit was of european descent the american automobile industry led the world in motor car production as the workforce darkened as accountants attorneys and government regulators replaced entrepreneurs and engineers as ceos the lead passed to the germans and japanese a fascinating footnote in the economic section mentions the french anthropologist vacher de lapouge in 1899 he predicted the rise and fall of a third reich absolute socialism in russia and a contest for world supremacy between russia and america that would be won by the us due to a higher percentage of nordics the section on the legal clash examines how whites have been dispossessed through the justice system minorities make up an increasing percentage of both law makers and law breakers trials by jury particularly if they involve black jurors deciding on crimes between blacks and whites have shown the weakness of the us legal system since at least the 1960s and continue to make a mockery of the rule of law today robertson writes that the judiciary is most responsible for white dispossession because it was easier to infiltrate the nine seats on the supreme court than to out vote or out legislate a 90 percent white electorate robertson has particular contempt for justices earl warren hugo black and william douglas who split in the ranks of the majority what was once the most respected american institutions had fallen by 1972 tdm s section on the legal clash is so full of shady dealings and unethical behavior of supreme court justices that you probably won t look at our legal system the same way after reading it court rulings against whites in all the civil rights cases have massively reordered american life for the majority but so has crime as robertson writes criminal justice was originally intended to protect society from the lawbreaker by the time the warren court had finished with it its chief function was to protect the lawbreaker from society needless to say the court s exaggerated magnification of criminal rights worked directly to the advantage of minorities that shelter criminal castes within their ranks he recounts statistics and horrifying examples of whites killed by black criminals and notes that blacks often do not think they are criminals but soldiers in a race war the section on the racial clash ends with a discussion of foreign policy which no longer serves whites robertson gives an overview of american foreign policy disasters through the 20th century and writes not only america but most of the world has lived to regret the day the majority lost control of american foreign policy the concluding section of tdm offers a possible solution whites must reject all aspects of liberalism it was through this ideology that the laboriously accumulated privileges of majority institutions were distributed gratis to members of other races and cultures who accepted them as a matter of course often with a show of ingratitude and then used them for purposes entirely different from those for which they had been intended some prominent whites had spoken out but were brushed aside as cranks because racially aware whites controlled no institutions and had no nationwide forums of expression the author offers a somewhat vague idea of a northern european ingathering as a way to stop white dispossession worldwide this would be not merely a political and economic clustering cemented by military alliances but an ingathering of race consciousness the most lasting and tenacious of all social binding forces robertson admits it would be a huge task not even the british or roman empires achieved this but it would be powerful enough to advance the interests of whites as a race what if our dispossession were not halted history is insistent on pointing out that when the dominant population group goes the country goes as is daily becoming more apparent the dying fall of the american majority is the dying fall of america itself the censorship of silence the book jacket biography of wilmot robertson notes that the author waited for decades for a qualified majority scholar to write this book having waited in vain he decided to take on this project himself and devoted ten years to it but he also took on printing promotion and distribution even in 1972 no mainstream publisher would touch such a dissident work in 1974 robertson published a second book called ventilations which has a chapter on the hoops he had to jump through to get tdm into the hands of readers the author sent out 483 review copies but netted only three reviews one newspaper the charleston evening post one academic journal mankind quarterly and one conservative publication modern age which offered an ambivalent review libraries often rejected free copies book stores refused to stock tdm even on consignment conservative outlets were as useless 50 years ago as they are today human events and national review refused ads as did american rifleman and the john birch society s american opinion despite censorship tdm managed to sell 16 000 copies in its first two years the author went on to start an underground newsletter on race called instauration 1975 2000 which occasionally gave updates on tdm by 1976 over 25 000 copies had been sold the following is from the may 1977 issue of instauration bloomington indiana the alternative is a small circulation publication that prides itself on its independence recently it received a very friendly write up in time crossing our fingers we ordered a full page ad in the alternative for the dispossessed majority a few days later we received the following communication from ronald e burr a member of the magazine s staff we are offended by the racist nature of the howard allen advertisement and we will not run it in our publication mentioning tdm was dangerous even for top rated talk radio hosts the following is a dispatch from the march 1979 issue bob grant who read some paragraphs from the dispossessed majority over radio station wor some time ago was suddenly fired from his job last november he was informed that the cause was economic this is hard to believe since grant s was the top rated late night show in the new york metropolitan area maybe someday i ll find out it was some particular group that did me in said the fallen microphone idol instauration subscribers often sent the book to students at top private schools which invariably provoked panicked newspaper articles and local tv news reports the author encouraged this sort of guerrilla advertising and it no doubt helped spread the word surprisingly amazon sells tdm the promotional page says the book sold 150 000 copies though i have been unable to confirm this it appears that tdm is more popular than ever the unz review offers a free copy of the e book on its website there have been several recent podcasts devoted to tdm and wilmot robertson see here and here popular dissident right podcaster scott greer recently announced that he is dedicating an upcoming episode to an analysis of tdm how many underground books are still being sold discussed and debated 50 years after they were first published f roger devlin says that none other than sam francis called the work his own generation s authoritative statement of racial nationalism it is fortunate for us that wilmot robertson undertook such a massive undertaking instead of waiting for a more established scholar to write a book defending the american majority the dispossessed majority is a classic work that pulls no punches about america s decline the author would no doubt be proud that so many whites are waking up to the disaster we face and are starting to speak and act against our dispossession especially since so few did so in his own lifetime if whites are able to salvage something of the historic american nation we will owe a huge debt of gratitude to wilmot robertson
you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel the world s central bankers are unleashing what may prove to be the most aggressive tightening of monetary policy since the 1980s risking recessions and roiling financial markets as they rush to tackle the surge in inflation they didn t see coming the week began with a sudden shift on wall street to price in a 75 basis point interest rate increase by the federal reserve the us central bank delivered that on wednesday the biggest move since 1994 as chairman jerome powell declared himself strongly committed to bringing inflation back down switzerland unexpectedly raised rates the next day while the bank of england hiked shortly after by 25 basis points for a fifth time and signaled it will soon double the pace the bond market s reaction to the concerted withdrawal of stimulus proved so violent the european central bank wednesday held an emergency meeting to address surging yields in some euro zone members emerging markets from brazil to taiwan to hungary also lifted borrowing costs while australia south korea india new zealand and canada are among those preparing more action only the bank of japan bucked the trend maintaining its ultra easy settings on friday despite fierce market pressure to leap on the global bandwagon increase in us inflation expectations helped galvanize 75 bp fed rate hikechina also stands out as an exception but traders around the world are bracing for a series of rate hikes many will not have witnessed in their entire careers fed officials alone are projecting they will take their benchmark to 3 8 by the end of 2023 from the 1 5 2 range it hit this week and several wall street banks see an even higher peak policy makers are being forced to act in part because they failed to spot the sticking power of inflation s rise to multi decade highs they were then slow to respond even when they accepted the price pressures weren t transitory 2022 began with us rates still near zero and the fed sucking in treasuries and mortgage backed securities the scramble to regain control raises the threat of unintended consequences including recessions and higher unemployment its also a recipe for volatile financial markets it is looking pretty chaotic in terms of the economy and the challenges facing central banks said nathan sheets global chief economist at citigroup inc and a former fed official the defining feature of this hiking cycle relative to others we ve seen over the last 30 years is that central banks are not just incrementally behind the curve they are significantly behind the latest drama began with last friday s news of another jump in us inflation when media reports emerged monday that the fed would actively consider a three quarter point rate move government bond yields surged anew and the s p 500 tumbled into a bear market ten year us yields were around 3 2 thursday more than double the start of the year global shocks to demand and supply over the past two years caused by the pandemic switching in and out of lockdowns historic stimulus packages and russia s invasion of ukraine have all contributed to a sea change for monetary policy after spending recent decades assuming they had tamed prices perhaps too much officials are now having to clamp down on growth and hiring inflation is more than triple the fed s target and heading into double figures in the uk what we have to understand and markets are coming to terms with this the more aggressive you focus on inflation the more you re going to have output volatility and stress in financial markets former snb president philipp hildebrand now a vice chairman at blackrock inc told bloomberg television the fed s increasing hawkishness also puts pressure on its peers by driving up the dollar and contributing to a global selloff in bonds italian 10 year yields hit their highest since 2014 on tuesday and the yen is at its weakest in 24 years the ecb is now crafting a tool it hopes will insulate its vulnerable economies from higher yields while the bank of japan on friday added exchange rates to its list of risks some are talking of reverse currency wars the mirror image of the early 2010s when key nations were accused of preventing currency appreciation in order to stoke growth today a strong exchange rate is popular we are in an integrated global capital market said julia coronado co founder of macropolicy perspectives llc if the fed goes a lot faster that s going to strain the currencies and make the jobs of the other central banks a lot harder hildebrand said it s unlikely the fed can engineer a soft landing bloomberg economics pegs the chance of a us recession at 72 by the end of next year which will challenge the re election hopes of president joe biden those on the front lines of the world economy are also picking up on the new reality things have changed dramatically said suren fernando chief executive officer of mas holdings which makes items including sportswear performance wear and swimwear american and european customers are now warning of a weakening market for the second half of this year and probably for a good part of 2023 said fernando whose firm employs 115 000 people across 16 countries we are hoping the central banks are right that it s going to be a soft landing

there is lead water piping in tens of thousands of homes in brooklyn but the process of replacing them is slow and expensive brooklyn is riddled with lead water piping that could take years to fix putting residents especially children at risk environmental advocates say right now new york city is in the process of completing a pilot program to replace lead water service lines in 300 homes across the five boroughs including some in brooklyn however replacing tens of thousands more lead pipes in the borough could take a decade or more and action needs to be taken now advocates say in 2020 new york city began replacing its lead service lines lsls in 300 homes citywide after being awarded a 5 3 million lead service line replacement program grant the new york state department of health told bk reader the addresses selected for the pilot came from a pool of low income homeowners who qualify for financial assistance for heat and water bills through the nys home energy assistance program and nyc home water assistance programs nyc department of environmental protection dep spokesperson edward timbers told bk reader water service lines are private property so much be maintained by the property owner but replacing lead pipes can be expensive despite the initial 300 homes pipes being fixed in the city water utilities estimate more than 37 000 water lines are potentially made of of lead in brooklyn another 93 027 are made of unknown material in december last year the biden administration announced a plan to remove lead pipes nationwide with a goal to do it within 10 years however he also said the pipes are a clear and present danger to our children s health dangers of lead piping service lines are pipes that carry drinking water from the water mains under city streets to the internal plumbing in homes and other buildings when they are made of lead popular in housing constructed before 1945 the lead in the pipes can leach into the drinking water even low levels of exposure to the harmful neurotoxin can cause permanent damage to the human body including decreased cognitive function developmental delays and behavioral problems for kids heart and kidney disease fetal miscarriages and premature birth in 2018 more than 500 000 children in the u s had elevated levels of lead in their blood 4 717 of whom live in nyc although timbers said this is mostly due to lead paint new york is estimated to have one of the highest totals of lsls in the nation 360 000 and brooklyn is estimated to have some of the highest numbers of lead service lines in the city it is difficult to calculate a precise figure because many utilities do not know how many lsls are in their system or where they are located environmental advocates ny said however the high numbers are unsurprising given new york s older housing stock plus because most urban cores have high numbers of lsls low income communities and communities of color are more likely to have an lsl serving their homes despite this timbers said there are very few or possibly no cases of children with elevated levels of lead in their blood that is connected to the consumption of water in new york city here the dep takes deliberate steps to protect the water from lead in private plumbing he said we maintain a ph level in the water that is not corrosive and we add orthophosphate to the water to coat the inside of pipes so if there is lead present it won t leach out those worried about lead pipes should run the water for 30 seconds before drinking it he said to flush out water sitting in lead pipes brooklyn homeowners and residents who are unsure whether their water service lines contain lead can look up their property on this map slow rollout of solutions the process of replacing water piping to so many homes will take time and hundreds of millions of dollars first a homeowner must determine whether their piping is made of lead and what specific parts are lead then the lead pipes need to be replaced either through making a trench to replace old pipes or through drilling in new pipes the cost of replacement of a full lsl from the public main to the residence is between 5 000 and 10 000 the state estimates if the replacement plan takes many years thousands more children could be put at risk of lead poisoning in brooklyn that s why some companies are coming up with short term solutions to the problem brita is a water filtration company that partners with municipalities to provide residents living with lead piping in the meantime with pitchers that remove 99 of lead from drinking water to replace all the lead pipes and service lines in our drinking water systems it s estimated to take at least 15 years brita director of innovation new business ventures elana rosenthal said municipalities should utilize federal funding from the infrastructure investment and jobs act to provide the filters to lead affected residents while they wait for replacement pipes rosenthal said the continued lead issues across the country have saddled municipalities to address the issue for their citizens and businesses clean drinking water is a fundamental human right and we re committed to helping our nation s water utilities navigate solutions for delivering lead reduced drinking water as they wait on the long term infrastructure fixes many of our communities so desperately need in december last year the federal environmental protection agency said it will send 2 9 billion in 2022 to states territories and tribes to replace lead pipes meanwhile timbers said the dep was anticipating a much larger lsl replacement program with federal guidelines and funding coming soon although he did not have details on how much funding the city might get we re hoping to have more on that at some point this year we are awaiting guidance from our partners at the federal level
by nancy lapid new york reuters people infected with the earliest version of the omicron variant of the coronavirus first identified in south africa in november may be vulnerable to reinfection with later versions of omicron even if they have been vaccinated and boosted new findings suggest vaccinated patients with omicron ba 1 breakthrough infections developed antibodies that could neutralize that virus plus the original sars cov 2 virus but the omicron sublineages circulating now have mutations that allow them to evade those antibodies researchers from china reported on friday in nature omicron ba 2 12 1 which is presently causing most infections in the united states and omicron ba 5 and ba 4 which now account for more than 21 of new u s cases contain mutations not present in the ba 1 and ba 2 versions of omicron those newer sublineages notably evade the neutralizing antibodies elicited by sars cov 2 infection and vaccination the researchers found in test tube experiments the monoclonal antibody drugs bebtelovimab from eli lilly nyse and cilgavimab a component of astrazeneca nasdaq s evusheld can still effectively neutralize ba 2 12 1 and ba 4 ba 5 the experiments also showed but vaccine boosters based on the ba 1 virus such as those in development by pfizer biontech and moderna nasdaq may not achieve broad spectrum protection against new omicron variants the researchers warned previous research that has not yet undergone peer review has suggested that unvaccinated people infected with omicron are unlikely to develop immune responses that will protect them against other variants of the coronavirus my personal bias is that while there may be some advantage to having an omicron specific vaccine i think it will be of marginal benefit over staying current with the existing vaccines and boosters said dr onyema ogbuagu and infectious diseases researcher at yale school of medicine in new haven connecticut who was not involved in the new study despite immune evasion the expectation can be that vaccines will still protect against serious disease ogbuagu said if you re due for a booster get a booster what we ve learned clinically is that it s most important to stay up to date with vaccines to maintain high levels of covid 19 antibodies circulating in the blood adolfo garcia sastre a microbiology and infectious diseases researcher at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai in new york city suggested that better protection might be seen with vaccines that target multiple strains of the virus or with intranasal vaccines that would increase protection from infection and transmission by generating immunity in the lining of the nose where the virus first enters garcia sastre who was not involved in the research said by the time one variant specific vaccine becomes available a new variant may well have taken over

at the end of last month rate volatility prior to the spiked to an extreme and had a rather dramatic spillover effect into the municipal market and the already weak market environment has become extremely challenging said barclays strategists mikhail foux clare pickering and mayur patel nevertheless they think an even keel approach is probably most appropriate this year we have not put much faith in the furious rally that started in late may but we are also not panicking right now they said clearly summer months will be quite choppy but rather than trimming exposure we will be looking for opportunities to add on weakness as tax exempts have a lot of value at current yields fund outflows though saw some of the largest in recent history this week barclays strategists said refinitiv lipper reported thursday 5 6 billion of outflows the highest figure of outflows for 2022 outflows will likely continue for some time although not at such a rapid pace as this week much will depend on how well new supply is received by investors when the pipeline starts growing later this summer according to barclays plc so far issuance has been rather subdued in june with the 30 day visible pipeline rather benign for taxables and tax exempts total issuance for the month as of thursday was 13 billion down 118 2 from 28 37 billion over the same time period in 2021 bond buyer 30 day visible supply sits at 11 81 billion however they believe this lull won t last muni ust ratios for shorter maturities and even the belly of the curve are still well below their fair values not even talking about the highs reached in mid may they said however they noted the long end is getting much more attractive with the 10s30s curve at one of its steepest points in recent history and this week investors are finally starting to take notice investors though should not rush barclays strategists aren t sure the highs in ratios reached in may 105 for 10 year and 110 for the 30 year will be revisited again even though tax exempts might still underperform near term more so for shorter and medium term maturities moreover high quality fixed income investments like munis present opportunities going forward as they suddenly look very attractive christian hoffmann portfolio manager at thornburg investment management based in santa fe with 42 billion in client assets said in a written statement following the fomc meeting on wednesday hoffmann who called the fomc meeting one of the most consequential in recent memory said the firm has its sights set on the long end of the fixed income market in our municipal bond portfolios we are taking advantage of dislocations as well hoffmann told the bond buyer flows have been exceptionally brutal this year but at many points this has provided remarkable relative value in fixed income including municipals he said the fomc decision arrived with little surprise and repositioning hoffmann said in his written comments while we are aware of the headline risks they do not drive our investment decisions hoffmann wrote a sky high inflation report last week and ensuing violent market reaction forced the fed s hand to wager more on a larger rate hike the media flurry foreshadowing 75 basis points suggests the biggest risk is doing less and underwhelming the market he wrote the market has had an outsized reaction to cpi last week with reasonable potential to bounce from here in the short term or simply digest the large moves that have taken place hoffmann added in his statement hoffmann said the market needs to appreciate the invisible hand at work the two year u s treasury has moved by more than 300 bps in eight months a huge move in housing affordability and mortgage rates wealth destruction and bubbles popping an erosion of ceo and consumer confidence all of these measures perhaps not fully appreciated by the market he said so much as the fed wants to help the market it may be hurting the market he noted unfortunately the fed s precision with creating inflation appears to mirror its ability to tame inflation weak lagging and variable hoffmann added the last financial crisis was caused by investment banks and the next one will be caused by central banks he said still hoffmann s base case is still for a recession going forward i think the recession will be a mild variety of six to 10 months but

new york ny the long running saga otherwise known as much ado around kim kardashian s decision to borrow marilyn monroe s happy birthday mr president dress for her met gala entrance continues more than six weeks after the event itself on thursday ripley s believe it or not the organization that owns the dress posted a statement on its website denying allegations on social media that kardashian s appearance in the gown had damaged the dress stretching it out of shape around the zipper close and shedding some of the rhinestones kardashian s entrance in the dress did not in any way damage the garment the statement said noting that after ripley s had purchased the gown in a 2016 auction a report on the gown s condition stated that a number of the seams are pulled and worn and there is puckering at the back by the hooks and eyes among other damage whether that will put the controversy to rest remains to be seen indeed the only thing that is certain amid all the conspiracies that have sprung up around the reappearance of the dress is that it has become a potent symbol of celebrity past and present as a result almost everybody feels they should have a say in the matter rarely has one dress elicited such strong opinions for those who haven t been following the brouhaha here is a quick primer about what happened and why remind me what is the big deal about this dress the dress was worn by monroe for her appearance at president john f kennedy s birthday bash at madison square garden in 1962 there she sang a very breathy suggestive happy birthday to the leader of the free world while wearing a dress that reportedly was designed to make her look naked under the lights at the time she was rumored to be having an affair with the president so the gown combined with the rendition set the gossip mongers aflame three months later monroe was found dead who designed the dress and how was it made jean louis the designer responsible for monroe s garb in the misfits and who was working with her on the film something s got to give it was never finished made the dress which had been sketched by his assistant bob mackie made from souffle a sheer fabric that is no longer in use because it was highly flammable in a shade chosen to match the color of monroe s skin and covered in a few thousand rhinestones to refract the light it was sleeveless backless and rumor had it intended to be so body conscious that marilyn was sewn into the dress before performing and couldn t wear any underwear beneath there are no pictures of that sewing actually taking place so it s hard to know how literally that was meant but the account is repeated in pretty much every story about the night wait if the dress was that tight how did marilyn get out of it without breaking it well there was a hidden zipper in the back but that s a good question so what happened to the dress after marilyn died monroe left her estate to her acting teacher lee strasberg who died in 1982 who in turn left his estate to his second wife and widow anna in 1999 anna commissioned christie s to auction off 510 lots of monroe memorabilia including plaster floor lamps jeans and the happy birthday mr president dress the new york times reported that it sold for 1 15 million before commission to bob schagrin one of the owners of gotta have it collectibles a store on east 57th street in new york its next owner was martin zweig a financier famous for predicting the 1987 stock market crash and kept in a climate controlled display case in his penthouse atop the pierre hotel zweig died in 2013 and three years later his estate contracted with julien s auctions in beverly hills california to sell the dress as part of a wider monroe sale estimated to go for about 2 million it ultimately sold for 4 8 million to ripley s believe it or not which later advertised it as the world s most expensive dress and kept it in a vault in its museum in orlando florida also on artdaily on view through july 9th at cue art foundation in the shadows by fereidoun ghaffari so how did kim kardashian get hold of it she asked seriously as she recalled in an interview with vogue while musing about the theme of the met gala which was american fashion she thought what s the most american thing you can think of and that s marilyn monroe and for her the most marilyn thing was the dress so she went to ripley s and it agreed to let her try it subject to some stringent requirements some charitable donations and her actually being able to physically get into the dress presumably both sides understood the publicity power of the combination but aren t kim kardashian and marilyn monroe pretty different body types it would seem so but kardashian said she shed 16 pounds to fit into the dress she still couldn t zip up the hidden zip at the back so she draped a white fur stole around herself to hide the fact that the two sides were held together with a tie also unlike monroe kardashian did wear what looked like skims underneath the dress so how did she wear the dress while sitting for the dinner portion of the met party she didn t she changed into a replica dress as soon as she got up the met steps did it have the intended effect and how first kardashian s entrance in the marilyn dress inspired the kind of breathless excitement that accompanies most of what she does thus connecting kardashian forevermore to her sex symbol celebrity forebear that this particular forebear met a tragic end not long after wearing the dress and hence it may have some pretty complicated implications does not seem to have occurred to most shortly thereafter however came the backlash to her extreme weight loss at a time when health and wellness is prized above crash diets and to the idea that a garment that had come to symbolize a classic moment in political and pop culture history should be worn as a party stunt a number of experts and conservators and mackie himself criticized the risks inherent with exposing a vintage dress to the elements no matter how briefly as well as the unavoidable human wear and tear questions were even raised about whether the dress was authentic at all it didn t look exactly the same in the pictures did it then came the charges of damage of course if you subscribe to the theory that all publicity is good publicity none of this matters certainly this seems to be the case for ripley s for her part kardashian has remained mum and declined to comment for this article after denying any further damage to the dress the ripley s statement added our mission is to both entertain and educate visitors and fans and sparking conversations like the discourse around marilyn monroe s dress does just that assuming you consider social media screeds and memes discourse

would you believe it printing copious amounts of cash doesn t solve everything after all would you believe it printing copious amounts of cash doesn t solve everything after all after more than a decade of qe the markets are in complete chaos once again and the economy is almost as bad worst of all the value of our money is plunging as well this time actually worst of all the basic building blocks of life are all in a mess we ll start with shelter a home is absurdly unaffordable and in short supply in much of the developed world building a new home is even worse so bad that even builders are going bust like dominos so shelter is out what about energy the basic building block of life well we re short on gas and coal after vilifying the companies and countries that produce them nuclear power plants were never built or shut down and take time to revive and so we re short on electricity we re short on oil after claiming we won t need it in 10 years time anyway causing oil producers to cut investment we re short on refineries after shutting them down we re short on diesel after subsidising it because of pollution and then discouraging it because of pollution but don t worry we re short on petrol cars after plans to ban them in the future so the petrol crisis isn t a big problem after all what about food well we re short on fertiliser for sanctioning the world s producer and grain because of an attempt to expand nato to its borders then there s the supply chain issue how we actually get what we need well we re short on truckers after hiking their fuel costs and we re short on ships after blocking trade with lockdowns all around the world it s an almighty mess and the central banks solution to all these problems let them eat cash even marie antoinette would ve been embarrassed by the suggestion that printing money would save us from everything unlike cake you can t even eat cash but wait a minute it s no wonder the toilet paper shortage is the one thing that has been alleviated it s the one thing you can substitute cash for and at the rate inflation is going but enough humour actually laughing is the only thing you can do these days the world s consumers would be burning effigies of their politicians and central bankers if only enough fuel could be found and if you can find it it s too expensive to waste on political symbolism at least that s how i feel here in australia i left the country about four years ago this week i filled my new car for the first time the same 60 litres cost almost double what i remember from four years ago as for property prices don t get me started at least the rba does seem to be doing its best to solve that problem lately electricity i m in the blackout prone zone of eastern australia where energy companies refuse to produce power unless they can do so at a profit outrageous no power no home and food and fuel disruptions what more is the mob waiting for a few years ago a storage company began advertising spaces with the sign the french aristocracy never saw it coming either it s a reminder that when things get drastic people go looking for someone to blame sure enough the top story on bloomberg a few days ago was about central bankers getting the blame for inflation and in australia the head of the rba was hauled in front of the cameras to explain himself he claimed that his promise to keep interest rates at zero until 2024 was a conditional statement great enter your email address in the box below and you ll get fat tail daily every day absolutely free targeting central bankers for blame is an interesting new twist until now the same policies were heralded as saving the world literally actually the twist in fortunes of central bankers is an old one but it hasn t been around for a long time the last central banker to be burned in effigy was paul volcker in the 70s and he s the one that our new federal reserve chair is supposedly imitating but it s not the american central bank i want to tell you about today consider what s going on in japan last week a japanese tax accountant messaged me i m afraid of the collapse of the japanese economy the message wasn t entirely random i d asked him about the crashing yen and the latest outbreak of insanity at the bank of japan while the rest of the world is busy trying to bring down inflation thanks to a global energy crisis the country which is famously dependent on importing energy is busily loosening monetary policy even more but back to the japanese tax accountant for a moment our conversation about japanese monetary policy started a few months ago as these things do when we were out drinking in small town japan i asked my friend whose name means three rounds in japanese about kuroda san the head of japan s central bank is a household name in japan and being a household name is never a good thing for the head of a central bank but in this case kuroda san is quite famous globally too which is really really bad what makes kuroda san so special internationally as far as i can tell is a typical japanese behaviour it is usually misinterpreted by westerners leading to severe misunderstandings and occasionally marriage in japan laughter is about dealing with awkwardness japanese people laugh when they re embarrassed which only ever happens when they try to speak english of course now kuroda san has a habit of laughing like a maniac whenever he tries to speak english which usually happens when he s on western tv making comments about japanese monetary policy he thinks the laughter is making light of his broken english a way to defuse any misunderstanding excuse any miscommunication or avoid any unintended misinterpretation unfortunately laughing like a maniac while discussing your own monetary policy for the world s most indebted government is interpreted very differently by western people cue the collapse in the yen as the bank of japan tries to pin down japanese bond yields we ll get to how bad this crash is in a moment and why it should scare you first consider the situation the bank of japan is in it s certainly no laughing matter as awkward as it may be japan s government debt is terrifyingly high if interest rates rise the cost of paying interest will be downright dangerous and so the bank of japan is trying to cap government bond yields at 0 25 it s buying however many government bonds it needs to in order to keep yields that low it s both funding the government and keeping the government s borrowing costs down in one fell qe but financial markets aren t buying it literally in this case they don t think the bank of japan can keep yields that low with energy prices triggering high inflation worldwide even in places that export the energy japan imports even the japanese tax accountant doesn t believe the inflation statistics anymore he told me and so investors are selling out of japanese bonds in anticipation of the bank of japan having to raise interest rates and crash their own bond market as the us uk eurozone and australia have for now fighting the speculative attack on their government bond market is forcing the bank of japan to create vast amounts of yen to buy japanese government bonds and that increase in the amount of yen is causing its value to crash on foreign exchange markets the problem here is highlighted in the headline from markets insider the japanese yen used to be a safe haven but it has just crashed to a 20 year low this causes a lot of different problems the yen s crash disrupts trade because japan is an export powerhouse for example but there are more interesting angles japan lends a lot of money to the world it s been the world s top creditor for 31 years in a row so instability in japan is a major problem for anyone around the world trying to finance themselves which is anyone at this point thanks to crashing bond markets just about everywhere what if japan is currently revealing that when push comes to shove central bankers will always back their mates at the treasury over those of us who need our money to maintain its purchasing power that is after all what tends to happen historically not many currency systems opted for government insolvency when faced with a crisis they prefer to print and trash the value of the currency instead japan might be signalling where we re all headed in the end

sorry sriracha fans your favorite hot sauce is running out nationwide the company that makes sriracha huy fong foods wrote in an email to customers in late april that it will have to stop making the sauce for the next few months due to severe weather conditions affecting the quality of chili peppers the spicy sauce has something of a cult following and so when the news filtered through some fans took to social media to express their dismay and post about panic buying with varying degrees of irony sriracha shortage panic spotted in brooklyn pic twitter com 12prmepja6 ruth weissmann _ruthbetold june 16 2022 i was told today that theres a sriracha shortage please god tell me thats not true waffle wafflestwitch june 17 2022 grocery stores in some parts of the country have already started running low on stock and restaurant owners have been facing higher prices michael csau co owner of the restaurant pho viet in washington d c has been paying much more in recent weeks for his sriracha orders usually when i bought one case it was roughly around 30 to 32 now it s up to 50 almost double the price if it keeps going up we cannot afford it csau said if the price gets much higher csau said he would probably have to switch to a different brand but people they are used to the taste right now so when they taste it they ll know right away he said ashish valentine npr npr michael csau says he may have no choice but to move away from sriracha florence lee who was at csau s restaurant waiting for a bowl of pho summed up her thoughts on a sriracha swap out a little bummed out because this is where i m like you have to have the hoisin sauce and the sriracha together she said other food could be affected too the shortage is due to a failed chili pepper harvest in northern mexico where all of the chilies used in sriracha come from according to national autonomous university of mexico s guillermo murray tortarolo who studies climate and ecosystems sriracha is actually made from a very special type of pepper that only grows in the southern u s and northern mexico murray tortarolo said these red jalapeños are only grown during the first four months of the year and they need very controlled conditions particularly constant irrigation irrigation of course requires lots of water but northern mexico is in its second year of a drought the already difficult conditions were pushed over the limit by two consecutive la niña events and the dry season has not only been intense but also remarkably long murray tortarolo said as a result the spring chili harvest was almost nonexistent this year murray tortarolo thinks it s very likely that climate change is a factor although it requires further study to confirm he said that if the drought continued it was likely that prices for other foods from the region like avocados tomatoes and meat would rise as well julio cesar aguilar afp via getty images afp via getty images this is the view of la boca dam in santiago mexico in march the lack of rain has reduced the dam capacity to 10 the lowest in the last 40 years on top of these conditions the entire region that includes the southwestern u s and northern mexico is suffering a megadrought and it s also connected to climate change this has been the driest 22 years in the last 1 200 years ucla hydroclimatologist park williams said williams recently led a study of the megadrought published in nature climate change he said the megadrought conditions drying up water reservoirs in the u s made it harder for mexico to deal with its water shortages we share some of the same climate but we also share some of the same water williams said so over the last 23 years as we ve seen our largest reservoirs get drained this puts mexico and mexican agriculture at a risk of being even more water limited than it would be already it s hard to say climate change caused the drought williams said but it s certainly made it worse his research estimates that about 40 of the drought can be attributed to human caused climate change still williams said we can make a huge difference by limiting how bad climate change gets limiting global warming to below 2 degree celsius puts us in a much better situation than if we let global warming go to 3 degrees or 4 degrees celsius so keeping sriracha hot may depend on keeping the planet cool copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

over the course of two weeks this month i will have flown in three different general aviation airplanes with garmin s nasdaq grmn integrated flight decks installed in the panel a cessna 182 with the g1000 nxi factory installed a piston single that represents the next generation of garmin s first oem installations in the 2004 skylane a cessna citation m2 with the standard g3000 avionics suite a light jet with a flight deck optimized for single pilot operation a beechcraft king air 350 with a g1000 nxi aftermarket installation a workhorse turboprop twin taking on a new life you could count a fourth airplane too a socata tb 30 epsilon that i regularly get to fly that hosts a garmin g3x touch in an experimental exhibition application turning a french military trainer into a solid ifr traveling machine it s becoming more and more likely that the transition you make between airplanes moves you from one garmin display and navigation engine to another and you learn the airplane around them the point is you can t swing a dead cat without hitting a garmin flight deck these days not that you would want to hurt a kitty or an airplane in the process garmin aviation can take a bow for creating a relatively user friendly product backed up by solid oem development on the front end and support on the back end this week the company is celebrating a milestone that illustrates why we re now finding its flight decks everywhere it has delivered more than 25 000 total since the first g1000 left the plant in olathe kansas a nod to gary burrell gary burrell garmin s late co founder gary burrell had the concept in his mind of what the original g1000 avionics suite would look like the original installation consisted of a primary flight display and multifunction display two gdu 1040s driven by two garmin integrated avionics units gia 63s and a garmin gma 1347 audio panel internally other components included the air data computer gdc74a attitude heading and reference system grs 77 ahrs and a magnetometer gmu 44 these parts in their subsequent evolutions still form the basis of the flight decks garmin has debuted since march 2003 when cessna aircraft company announced it had selected the g1000 for its new citation mustang aimed originally at the very light jet vlj market pilots around the world have spent millions of hours flying behind a garmin flight deck and it s a true privilege to know that our avionics help them safely reach their destinations time and time again said phil straub garmin executive vice president and managing director aviation in a release this week as the leading provider of integrated cockpit systems we are very proud to celebrate this extraordinary achievement and we wish to extend our sincerest gratitude to our aircraft manufacturers as well as the aircraft owners who have selected and trusted garmin over the years the g1000 was a vision of our late co founder gary burrell straub continued and he would be deeply honored to be celebrating this milestone with the thousands of talented garmin associates who made it possible we ve delivered 25 000 integrated flight decks thanks to our customers and partners for helping us reach this milestone which garmin ifds have you flown behind g1000 nxi g2000 g3000 g5000 pic twitter com skelhd5lg0 garmin aviation garminaviation june 15 2022 what it means to pilots turn the clock back 30 years and life wasn t all that different in terms of consistency from a flight instrument perspective you could train in a basic airplane such as a cessna 152 and learn attitude instrument flight and transfer that skill and your scan to a new airplane with just a few adjustments to make that is if you consider the standard six pack of analog gauges attitude indicator airspeed indicator heading indicator vertical speed indicator turn coordinator and altimeter to be essentially the same between single engine airplanes which they are not really but they were straightforward and wysiwyg what you see is what you get applied the radio stack had similar nav coms and if you were lucky there was a king autopilot or a loran receiver to learn and that was it we went through a phase and we re still there really where the fleet s panels were truly mixed with airplanes equipped with glass pfds sitting on the ramp next to those with six packs even within a flight school s fleet with garmin s market penetration it s becoming more and more likely that the transition you make between airplanes moves you from one garmin display and navigation engine to another and you learn the airplane around them and think too of the power behind those displays and the sheer amount of information now at our fingertips that has had an impact on safety to which straub justifiably refers if only it were that simple though the similarities are deceptive and can catch you unaware if you stick to the idea that one g3000 installation mirrors exactly the one next to it many things will be the same but there are still nuances to learn between say the g3000 in the tbm 960 and the one in the m2 as murphy would have it those details will catch you when you re in the weather bouncing around into a missed approach and running into your reserve fuel more competition in the space might drive more user friendly system architecture as well a common lament from those transitioning from sophisticated flight management systems such as the collins pro line series is that the garmins do it almost right but there are strange gaps in the transfer of data where values must be entered manually into fields that would populate automatically in the collins fms but kudos to garmin for making a product line with the iterations to fit a wide range of general aviation applications and we can only anticipate how they ll improve on that success

imaginable as an investor both on screen and off but industry analysts were surprised to hear the news that cuban unveiled his fully realized mark cuban cost plus drug company mccpdc in january 2022 as it involves a business model that flips the current model of the pharmaceutical industry and ends up offering a service that could help americans save significantly on necessary treatment cuban recently appeared on pbs news weekend program to explain the concept evolved from a former nonprofit and how the venture works which he says is an opportunity to disrupt the prescription drug industry our approach at cost plus drugs which is we ll show you our actual cost we ll mark it up 15 we ll add 3 pharmacy handling fee and 5 shipping and that s all you ever pay that simplification and transparency has really had an impact cuban told pbs geoff bennett and many of the new brand s first customers have taken to social media to share that new fangled approach to selling drugs is actually helping them i just got a three month supply of two of my prescriptions with shipping for a total of 20 one twitter user recently shared with insurance copay i was paying 200 for before my mom s monthly prescription is only 14 on there down from 270 another tweeted there are hundreds of similar tweets directly shared to mark cuban s account where the shark tank investor has shared more on why he started costplus drugs in the first place of course cuban s cost plus drugs is far from perfect there are valid criticisms on how the prescription drug distributor doesn t accept any forms of insurance meaning some americans may still be better off utilizing their comprehensive coverage at a conventional pharmacy as noted in early forbes coverage but more importantly cost plus drugs has faced some challenges in that it s limited in how many generic prescription drugs it can offer currently read on below to learn more about how cost plus drugs works for customers and which kinds of drugs you may find at a budget friendly rate what kinds of medication are available at cost plus drugs at launch cost plus had carried around 100 medications all of which are generic in nature and not brand names that patients may be familiar with critics noted that offerings were extremely limited compared to traditional pharmacies and even digital services like goodrx but cuban s service is adding new low cost generic drugs to its roster periodically and have shared they are continuously adding new options as they become available per its website cost plus currently stocks over 700 generic drugs made by its network of suppliers designed to provide treatment for a myriad of chronic conditions from diabetes to multiple forms of cancer hypertension and high cholesterol and even complications stemming from arthritis to allergies cost plus maintains a full list of the conditions they serve as well as a searchable database for generic versions of name brand medications you may be currently taking according to forbes initial review of cuban s medication service the price points of the prescription drugs sold by cost plus were often 10 times less compared to traditional offerings a particular talking point was the leukemia treatment drug imatinib which is usually sold at 9 657 for a month s supply but is available via cost plus for just 47 a month how is cost plus able to offer drugs at these prices it hinges on the fact that cuban s pharmaceutical brand doesn t rely on insurance plans and what s known as pharmacy benefit managers to determine a supply chain and thus its prices read more a guide to every kind of doctor and specialist an in depth analysis published by medpagetoday suggests that there may be some drugs that end up costing an individual more from cost plus if they have low healthcare insurance deductibles or if they quickly meet these deductibles early in the year if someone has a chronic illness that requires frequent clinic visits for example a low deductible healthcare plan may begin covering 100 of prescription drug costs soon those who are uninsured will certainly find these medications less costly as well as patients who have high deductibles that aren t met and rarely use healthcare services as foregoing paying out insurance deductibles means you ll spend less overall how to buy discounted prescriptions at cost plus drugs before you sign up to buy medication from cost plus you should take a look to ensure your prescription is one of the options currently available on the site if your medication isn t listed you can submit a request for the brand to consider adding the supplier to their network on the same webpage and just as you would with any other prescription provider or pharmacy you ll need to have your primary healthcare provider fill out a prescription and submit it directly to get started with cost plus

a family outing turned into a frightening situation when a black bear started to take interest in the hikers whistler bc it s not every day you come face to face with a bear and live to tell about it but that s exactly what happened for one american family hiking through a trail in whistler canada in a video uploaded to instagram brighton peachy a former healthcare worker turned outdoor lifestyle influencer shared the moments a black bear started following her husband michael hofer and their three children aged between one and six ok he s following you babe peachy can be heard telling hofer as he carries one of his children in a backpack and holds the hand of another with the bear slowly approaching from behind peachy then starts shouting loudly in an attempt to scare off the curious critter with no success and the bear creeping closer hofer appears to throw a shoe at the animal while peachy calms the children and instructs them not to run at one point one of the children who appears unfazed by the situation asks can we play dead yet the following video contains language that some viewers might find offensive peachy wrote in the comments that the bear followed them for over half a mile before losing interest and scurrying away the family of five eventually ran into another group of hikers who decided to head back together in case the bear decided to reappear we later learned they ve had to close this area multiple times because of this bear s increasing aggressive behavior she wrote the bear was not intimidated by us at all he just kept following us peachy also included some tips for her followers to prevent a bear attack some of these include properly storing all food and scented products like lotion and to always hike in groups making sure to make plenty of noise throughout the hike to deter bears from approaching should a bear approach peachy said it is important to never get closer to the bear or make sudden movements using bear repellant if available she added to try to make yourself as large as possible so that the bear knows you re human and not dinner

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox washington the wreckage of watergate and jan 6 are a half century apart yet rooted in the same ancient thirst for power at any cost two presidents wily and profane tried an end run around democracy mysteries from both affairs endure as the house inquiry into the jan 6 2021 uprising at the capitol intersects with this week s watergate 50th anniversary is there a smoking gun to be found in donald trump s deceptions or did we already see it when he summoned angry supporters to a wild time in washington called for them to fight like hell and mused that perhaps his vice president one of the few no men in his compliant cabal should be hanged like the insurrectionists demanded trump had lost the election and sought to cling to power but nixon a key question may be why he even bothered to go rogue nixon was on a comfortable path to reelection when bumbling burglars tied to his campaign committee broke into democratic party headquarters at the watergate office building 50 years ago friday and got caught the chapter upon chapter exposure of his cover up and efforts to obstruct justice drove him from office nearly two years later when he quit rather than face a likely conviction in an impeachment trial three republican leaders from congress went to the white house and helped convince him that he was doomed in contrast trump was desperate having convincingly lost the 2020 election when he dispatched his own bumblers lawyers aides hangers on as well as the violent mob at the capitol on a quest to upend the results and keep him in office few in his party publicly urged him to accept defeat watergate is the american presidential scandal by which all others are measured it brought down a president yet jan 6 was the one that spilled blood watergate had a powerful afterburn leading to republicans being tossed out of congress by the dozens in 1974 this time there is near unanimity that the party will make gains michael dobbs author of king richard nixon and watergate an american tragedy from 2021 said the system worked in watergate because congress the courts and the press did their job in establishing a chain of criminal activity that led nixon to resign the system was under stress then he said but is under much greater stress today when the senate watergate committee conducted its landmark hearings starting in may 1973 inflation was heading toward 9 by year s end about where it is now the stock market crashed then as now people had pressing distractions but americans were riveted by the spectacle of a president sinking slowly into disgrace more than 70 told a gallup poll they watched the televised hearings that spread over nearly three months of that summer the jan 6 hearings to date are less about investigators discovering new facts than about showing and telling what they ve already found out in months of methodical work to dobbs evidence of trump s direct involvement in planning or inciting the riot with the intention of overturning the election would constitute a nixonian smoking gun the challenge for the jan 6 inquiry and any prosecution that may follow is the ambiguous nature of trump s statements from a legal point of view he said fight like hell can be interpreted in different ways in releasing previously recorded testimony from close associates of trump the panel has exposed the extent to which trump s circle knew his case about a stolen election was a sham even his daughter ivanka trump wasn t buying it trump s attorney general william barr testified that the president s arguments were detached from reality if he really believes them harsh words but to what effect trump s election denialism courses through the campaigns of far right republicans in the 2022 midterm election season some prevailing in their primaries the hearings will in no way be the last word on trump s lies trump is constitutionally unable to let criticism pass said southern methodist university political scholar cal jillson so expect a rising tide of recriminations a lengthening enemies list and a program of retribution stretching out into the future other republican leaders will ponder the damage this might do to the party he added but as yet there are no howard bakers on the horizon baker personified the politics of the time in congress partisan but not poisonous he was the rep liz cheney of the day but on his way up in the republican party not an outcast from it like the endangered wyoming congresswoman who is fierce in her disdain for trump and fellow republicans who won t cross him baker expressed instinctive loyalty to nixon at first i m your friend he recalled telling him face to face when the hearings started but as the top republican on the watergate panel he listened questioned dug in over the hundreds of hours of hearings and saw the corruption his famous question what did the president know and when did he know it was actually posed as a tentative defense of the president because baker expected the answer to be not much i believed that it was a political ploy of the democrats that it would come to nothing baker told the associated press in 1992 but a few weeks into that it began to dawn on me that there was more to it than i thought and more to it than i liked the persistence and gravity of his questioning made the mild mannered tennessee senator an unlikely heartthrob love letters poured into his office a women s magazine called him studly the watergate committee of four democrats and three republicans was formed by a unanimous vote in the senate unheard of today on almost any issue of substance it was charged with probing the watergate affair and all other illegal improper or unethical conduct in the 1972 campaign the house jan 6 committee in contrast was formed on a 222 190 vote the only two republicans who voted for the committee cheney and retiring rep adam kinzinger of illinois were put on it where trump loudly proclaimed his grievances and provocations nixon sounded off in private or what he thought was private it was the white house taping system that nixon had installed for posterity that damned him when the supreme court forced him to turn over the tapes in a june 23 1972 conversation six days after the burglary nixon s chief of staff h r haldeman is heard recommending to nixon that the fbi be told to drop its investigation of the break in before the bureau could trace the crime to the white house or nixon himself there s some business here we don t want you going any further on haldeman suggested the fbi chief be told mm hmm nixon said mm hmm alright fine nixon concluded play it tough that s the way they play it and that s the way we re going to play it that was the smoking gun a bullet flying for the purpose of obstructing justice a day after the break in the ap reported that one of the burglars was a paid security official of the nixon campaign the first tentative tie to the president and one that surprised police and prosecutors bob woodward and carl bernstein later confirmed the report for the washington post before going on to bulldoze everyone else with their blockbuster watergate exclusives pinning the cover up directly on the president the heroes of watergate bernstein now says were not primarily the journalists who exposed nixon s misdeeds or the democrats who led the charge but republicans who had the courage to say this is not about ideology this is about illegality all these years later it remains unknown who ordered the break in there is no evidence that nixon did so directly though there is no ambiguity over the fact he mounted a coverup and otherwise played dirty nixon created the paranoid culture that spawned watergate dobbs said the conspiracy took on a life of its own driven forward by crazy operators like gordon liddy anticipating the president s wishes fifty years from now what will americans say about jan 6 historian michael beschloss in twitter commentary about the hearings said the answer depends on whether america by then is a democracy or autocracy if the latter the nation s authoritarian leaders might celebrate january 6 as one of great days in u s history as trump has described it now he also asked a question that can never be definitively answered what would have happened to our country if the january 6 coup had succeeded

at www bengalenergy ca business overview bengal s producing and non producing assets are situated in australia s cooper basin a region featuring large accumulations of very light and high quality crude oil and natural gas the company s core australian assets pl 303 cuisinier atp 934 barrolka atp 732 tookoonooka and four petroleum licenses acquired in calendar 2019 are situated within an area of the cooper basin that is well served with production infrastructure and take away capacity for produced crude oil and natural gas still in early stages in terms of appraisal and development bengal believes these assets offer attractive upside potential for both oil and gas australia presents a stable political fiscal and economic environment in which to operate and a favourable royalty regime for oil and gas production under the state of queensland regulatory process atps are granted by the state generally for a period of twelve years with one third of the original grant area expiring every four years at the end of the final term of the atp and under certain conditions relative to exploration success an application can be made to continue a portion of the permit in the form of a pca potential commercial area pcas have a life span of five to fifteen years pca applications include a commercial viability report that indicates that the area is likely to be commercially viable within the applied term this allows for extra time to commercialize the resource these pca s remain a part of the atp until expiry if a discovery of oil or gas is made an application for a pl is made to allow for production pls are granted for up to a thirty year term bengal has two pls on the former atp 752 barta block pl 303 and pl 1028 in addition to three pcas pca 206 pca 207 barta west and pca 155 wompi block nubba yilgarn bengal also holds four pls pl 114 wareena pl 157 ghina pl 188 ramses pl 411 karnak including a pipeline license ppl 138 adjacent to atp 934 australia cooper basin queensland pl303 and pl 1028 cuisinier controlling permit atp 752 30 357 wi a pilot reservoir pressure maintenance scheme was initiated during the prior fiscal year and after resolving mechanical issues water injection activities resumed during calendar q4 2021 the location of this pilot is in the southeast quadrant of the cuisinier pool with injection of water taking place at the cuisinier 24 well the broad nature of the cuisinier structure combined with variable flank aquifer pressure support has resulted in pressure depletion within the central portion of the cuisinier pool the injection of produced formation water is anticipated to both increase production in up to four offsetting wells and reduce water handling charges the cuisinier water injection pilot has continued to face a range of surface facility related operational issues resulting in downtimes which have not allowed the significant subsurface success potential of this pilot to be realized as yet bengal energy personnel are now working with the operator s onshore operations and development leadership to work collaboratively towards rectifying the surface facility design challenges upon establishing success of the pilot the joint venture jv expects to begin a multi phase water injection scheme targeted fracture stimulation and more commercially efficient development drilling since inception of the pilot 33 500 barrels of water have been injected into the c24 well at an average rate of approximately 275 barrels of water per day over 115 operating days since december 2021 currently the water injection rate into c24 is approximately 300 bpd at a wellhead pressure of 9 600 kilopascals nearby wells are being monitored for total fluid produced and water cut to help to determine which wells are being affected by the pilot program in december 2021 bengal participated in the chef exploration drilling project following a review of the well logs the atp 752 jv parties have decided to plug and abandon the well this exploration well is located outside of the producing cuisinier field pl 303 in a location 4 km to the northeast with primary targets in the jurassic birkhead formation and hutton sandstone and secondary targets within the triassic nappamerri group the well encountered multiple oil shows in the primary and secondary targets however no commercial pay was identified at this location while not a commercial success the identified oil shows may support continued exploration targeting both the jurassic birkhead and newly discovered oil bearing triassic nappamerri formations pl 114 wareena pl 157 ghina pl 188 ramses pl 411 karnak ppl 138 pipeline 100 wi the company acquired a 100 working interest in four pls and a natural gas pipeline connected to transportation infrastructure into the eastern australia gas market collectively the assets these non productive pls are highly compatible with and in close proximity to atp 934 bengal continues to integrate subsurface data from the pls to enhance the company s understanding of atp 934 and to finalize the selection of exploration and appraisal drilling locations included in this program is the reinstatement of two gas wells wareena 1 and wareena 5 and an existing gas pipeline to produce raw gas into existing infrastructure planning and execution of the project continued through q4 fiscal 2022 including performing a deeper zone water shut off on wareena 5 negotiations regarding natural gas processing and sales are ongoing with santos as the owner of the processing infrastructure the company is evaluating various options for commercialization of expected natural gas production including connection through a third party gathering system existing processing infrastructure and an innovative proof of concept for alternative monetization the 100 ownership of the acquired assets presents an appraisal and development opportunity that will be operated by the company and is seen to be not only complementary to our proven producing non operated cuisinier asset but also as a key steppingstone for bengal s natural gas platform upon which future exploration growth through atp 934 can be undertaken atp 732 tookoonooka 100 wi the company has conducted preliminary stimulation workover and stimulation program at the caracal 1 well a 53 api oil discovery in the wyandra zone the well produced oil to surface although at lower than expected rates and is currently being assessed to determine capacity for commercial production this would allow the company to progress towards a pl or pca on the block in june 2019 the company applied for an amendment to the lwp for the third term of atp 732 permit on october 22 2019 the company received approval from the queensland regulatory authority for an amended lwp for the third four year term commencing april 1 2019 to march 31 2023 the approved lwp was revised to minimum activities of reprocessing seismic and inversion work with an estimated cost of 0 05 million and geological and geophysical investigation at an estimated cost of 0 05 million during the four year term atp 934 durham downs east farmout block 40 wi bengal entered into an agreement with santos in july of 2020 to farm in on a portion of the atp 934 block santos carried the drilling costs of one well to earn a 60 operated interest in the atp 934 southern farm out block which represents 57 8 of the total block acreage post april 2020 relinquishment on october 14 2021 santos completed the drilling of the legbar 1 exploration well santos paid 100 of the costs to drill plug and abandon the well and has accordingly earned a 60 working interest in 103 760 km2 gross exploration land while the legbar 1 well did not indicate commercial quantities of hydrocarbons thick high quality reservoir sands were encountered in the primary permian toolachee formation and in the jurassic birkhead zone with evidence of residual hydrocarbon saturation in both zones in addition fluorescence shows and elevated gas readings through the jurassic birkhead fm top hutton sandstone indicate oil has passed through the reservoir supporting the search for a valid closure to test this play the findings from the legbar 1 well will help bengal refine its exploration targets going forward both with santos in the santos farm out block and across the balance of atp 934 which is 100 owned by bengal business development the company is in discussions with potential industry and financial partners to fund some of these oil and gas related activities non ifrs and other

florida doctors and hospitals began ordering covid 19 vaccines for children under 5 directly from the federal government friday as white house officials and gov ron desantis administration feuded over whether that amounted to a reversal by state health officials the desantis administration declined to pre order the vaccines for young children making florida the only state not to secure an early supply by neglecting to pre order florida won t get the first shipments of vaccines that began going out friday to pediatricians and children s hospitals said dr ashish jha white house coronavirus response coordinator who called the state s decision not to pre order unconscionable elected officials deliberately chose to delay taking action to deny florida parents the choice of whether to vaccinate their children or not jha said friday because of the fda s decision this morning we have begun shipping vaccines to children s hospitals and pediatricians in every state in the country except florida no masks facing 27 5 million fine from desantis special olympics drops vaccine requirement no pre order as fda authorizes covid vaccines for young kids florida is only state not to pre order supply while the florida department of health has declined to place orders for the under 5 vaccines because the state doesn t recommend them for young children florida doctors and hospitals could start ordering them directly on friday the day the food and drug administration authorized their use jha and other white house officials said this amounted to a retreat by desantis with white house press secretary karine jean pierre saying the governor had reversed course and is now ordering vaccines desantis spokeswoman christina pushaw and the doh disputed that claim nothing has reversed or changed about florida s policy pushaw said in an email a doh alert stated that contrary to disinformation circulating the vaccine ordering process has not changed in florida the alert went on to say that florida health care providers are able to order the vaccine directly because the fda approved them friday by not securing a vaccine pre order florida won t be included in the first two waves of vaccine shipments delaying the arrival of the shots at pediatrician offices and hospitals jha said the pre ordered shots are expected to arrive as soon as monday june 20 however pharmacies that participate in a federal program including cvs and walgreens will still get their vaccines in the first wave of shipments the federal pharmacy channel has been open so federal pharmacy partners like cvs and walgreens have pre ordered and those vaccines are going out no delays there at all jha said florida s county health departments which are state agencies won t be getting any shipments of the covid 19 vaccine for children under 5 because state health officials aren t recommending them our department of health has been very clear desantis said at a press conference in miami the risks outweigh the benefits and we recommend against asked about the governor s assertion that the risk outweighs the benefits jha said people should trust the experts who reviewed the vaccines and approved them they poured over the data and they voted and they voted unanimously i m not going to substitute my judgement for these experts jha said desantis refusal to stock the vaccine at health departments around florida will specifically leave the most vulnerable underserved children of florida behind jha said the florida chapter of the american academy of pediatrics in a statement issued friday said the state s decision will cause a delay for parents wanting the vaccine for their kids the vaccine is the best resource we have for combatting covid 19 and right now we will not be able to offer this vaccine to our youngest eligible patients when it becomes available said the academy s florida chapter president lisa gwynn our phones are ringing off the hook with concerned parents eager to know where they can get the vaccine right now we don t have a good answer she said gwynn explained that the vaccine distribution system is state based and not designed to allow individual doctors or institutions to order directly from the manufacturer the state s decision to obstruct access to covid 19 vaccines is anti science an affront to parental rights and an intrusion into the relationship between doctors patients and the families they serve she said the fda s vaccine advisers on wednesday gave a thumbs up to vaccines from moderna and pfizer for the littlest kids on friday the fda followed up by authorizing the first covid 19 shots for infants and preschoolers there s one step left the centers for disease control and prevention recommends how to use vaccines its independent advisers began debating the two dose moderna and the three dose pfizer vaccines on friday and will make its recommendation saturday a final signoff is expected soon after from cdc director dr rochelle walensky if the cdc signs off shots could be available as soon as monday or tuesday at doctor s offices hospitals and pharmacies pfizer s vaccine is for children 6 months through 4 years moderna s vaccine is for 6 months through 5 years the outside experts commissioned by the fda had voted unanimously earlier this week that the benefits of the shots outweigh any risks for children under 5 that s roughly 18 million youngsters nationwide they are the last age group in the u s without access to covid 19 vaccines and many parents have been eager to protect their little children the vaccine is the best resource we have for combatting covid 19 and right now we will not be able to offer this vaccine to our youngest eligible patients when it becomes available said fcaap president lisa gwynn do mba msph faap parents of young children have been through so much during this pandemic and they have waited a long time to offer their children this protection our phones are ringing off the hook with concerned parents eager to know where they can get the vaccine right now we don t have a good answer this is a long awaited vaccine said fda panel member dr jay portnoy there are so many parents who are absolutely desperate to get this vaccine and i think we owe it to them to give them a choice to have the vaccine if they want to dr peter marks fda s vaccine chief offered data showing a quite troubling surge in young children s hospitalizations during the omicron wave and noted 442 children under 4 have died during the pandemic that s far fewer than adult deaths but should not be dismissed in considering the need for vaccinating the youngest kids he said each child that s lost essentially fractures a family marks said follow herald tribune political editor zac anderson on twitter at

than attacking working people with higher interest rates a deafening silence defines debates among us leaders about stopping or slowing today s inflation alternatives to the federal reserve s raising of interest rates and curtailing money supply growth are ignored it s as if there were no other ways to rein in price increases except to add more interest costs to the already excess debts of workers and small and medium businesses were the last two and a half years of the deadly covid 19 pandemic plus the economic crash of 2020 not sufficient enough burdens on americans without piling on the additional burden of inflation that has been imposed by us capitalism as usual the profit driven concerns of big business and their result a remarkably selective historical amnesia fuel the silence about alternative anti inflation policies so too do the right wing ideological blinders that now constrict us politics yet policy alternatives always exist no matter how desperately partisans promoting one policy seek to obliterate debate and discussion of others the narrow dogmatism of us politics these days is on full display around the issue of an anti inflation policy focused on raising interest rates i will present three other anti inflation policies that do not entail interest rate increases there are many more that could and should be part of today s policy discussions all have precedents in us history for the first we return briefly to world war ii us president franklin delano roosevelt s administration grasped the risk of inflation during this period as the supply of many consumer goods shrank relative to the demand for them the war effort was diverting many productive resources away from consumer goods and toward munitions and other defense products had the government allowed the market to handle the prospective shortage of consumer goods an inflation of their prices would have resulted rich americans would have bid up the prices of scarce consumer goods rendering them unaffordable for middle and lower income people that is how markets work they favor the rich who return the favor by funding economists and others to promote markets as marvels of efficiency for roosevelt s government the war effort required a national unity that the market threatened to replace with bitterness envy and division pitting the poor and the middle class against the rich the us government thus substituted rationing for the market mechanism it printed ration books containing ration stamps and distributed them across the us population rationed goods could only be sold to those with ration stamps no small irony at least for those familiar with marxism and socialism attaches to the following 1 the us government distributed ration books according to people s needs and 2 the us government s explicit goal was to render the distribution of rationed goods and especially food more fairly than what the market would have done rationing forestalled the looming inflation it could work equally well now to slow or stop inflation another anti inflation policy other than raising interest rates came in august 1971 from republican president richard m nixon responding to serious inflation nixon declared a 90 day wage price freeze he and his advisers knew that us wage and price controls had also been deployed during world war ii some had even read john kenneth galbraith s 1952 book a theory of price control which showed how well such controls had worked during the war as a result of nixon s action employers on one side and employees on the other were formally denied the right to raise prices or wages respectively any move to the contrary was seen as a criminal act rendering the perpetrator subject to police arrest in response to these measures the inflation shrank the stock market rose and nixon was reelected in 1972 for him the policy worked other countries have also imposed wage price freezes to similar effects each alternative policy to control inflation raising interest rates included has its particular strengths and weaknesses virtues and flaws honest discussions of how to respond to inflation would involve comparing the strengths and weaknesses of all or at least many different policy options honest national leaders would not pretend only one policy exists that approach dominant in the united states today yields both policy mistakes and leads to crucial opportunities being lost it does however serve the interests of those who advocate for that one policy there is a third alternative policy to controlling inflation as an inherent risk recurringly faced by a private enterprise capitalist system if profit is the bottom line if the system s mantra is charge whatever the market will bear and if rewards and punishments follow the rise and fall of profits that depend on prices we can hardly be surprised when capitalists raise prices nor can we be surprised that when they do it it both provokes and excuses others following suit inflation results from private capitalists pricing decisions they are driven chiefly by their private profit calculations they need not and do not generally take into account those decisions larger consequences social as well as economic such as inflation the socialization of private capitalist enterprises is thus another anti inflation policy a government for example will generally consider the inflationary consequences of any set of price increases on that basis it can either limit or reject them to the extent that the government is held accountable politically for inflation and its effects it has an incentive to control them the fed is at best held accountable only indirectly that helps explain why the fed has repeatedly failed to prevent or control recessions and inflations across the last century of course such socialization of private capitalist enterprises raises the question of how genuinely democratic the government is yet the degree of genuine democracy the government upholds will influence all alternative anti inflation policies across the united states insurance utility and other public commissions limit private capitalist enterprises freedom to raise their prices in the markets they regulate private capitalists in such markets cannot raise prices without the permission of those commissions to do so a government could establish all sorts of commissions in all sorts of markets with criteria for granting or refusing such permissions suppose for example that some or all food items were socially democratically deemed to be basic goods such that no producer or seller could raise its prices without approval by a federal food commission fighting inflation could be among the approval criteria in this case just as that is a criterion now for the fed s monetary policies in most capitalist economies the tiny class of employers perhaps 1 percent of the total population has enormous powers that class 1 shapes wage and salary levels of their hired workers 2 determines the quantities of all purchased inputs and all outputs and 3 sets outputs prices that tiny class includes many employers who justify their price increases by blaming them on input prices raised by other employers throughout the supply chain more shrewdly the employer class s wiser members refocus blame instead on workers and wages blaming them for the price increases even when as now wage inflation is far lower than price inflation of course commissions to govern prices can be and have been captured by the industries they were established to control private capitalists have thus been able to weaken render toothless or even eliminate controls over them while that is indeed true of the many state level utility and insurance commissions for example it is no less true of the fed vis a vis the nation s major banks rationing systems and wage price freezes can likewise be captured historically the price gouging by and corruption of private capitalist industries have led to public demands that their businesses be transferred to government responsibilities capitalism s undiminished profit drive then incentivized the affected industries to capture the government bodies charged with controlling them the solution to that inherent contradiction of capitalism is surely not an endless series of oscillations between private and public control that is what has failed in the capitalist system rather the alternative solution that beckons is system change putting all the workers in democratic control of the enterprises instead of a tiny separate class of employers a system based on a democratized workplace community interdependent with a democratized residential community offers a much better way to prevent and not merely manage

insanity in britain secret court jails father for birthday message to son liberty blitzkrieg june 2 2013 the following story is another example of a situation that you might expect to read about in a novel of dystopian fiction rather than a real life situation happening on the island that brought the world the magna carta garry johnson simply sent his son sam a happy birthday message on his 21st via facebook and for this crime was sentenced to jail by britain s secret family court system the most amazing part of this story is that after the divorce from his wife both of their children choose to live with garry rather than their mother seemingly out of spite his ex wife started to make accusations against garry all of which were investigated and shown to be untrue not that this mattered as garry was still punished with a gag order that forbid him to ever mention his children publicly for the rest of his life i think it s safe to say secret courts should never ever be permitted from the daily mail
