virginia city nev aug 18 2022 globe newswire comstock inc nyse lode comstock and the company today announced that it is marketing its cellulosic ethanol production technology for construction of commercial scale facilities with a focus on upgrading pre existing first generation corn ethanol facilities to convert forestry residuals and other forms of lignocellulosic biomass into cellulosic ethanol at dramatically improved yield efficiency and cost when compared to corn comstock s technology efficiently fractionates wood into purified biointermediates that are uniquely isolated and free of the inhibitors and contaminants that have frustrated prior attempts at broadly commercializing cellulosic fuels technologies comstock s first biointermediate is a purified form of cellulosic sugar that can be used as a chemically identical drop in feedstock in corn ethanol facilities to produce about 80 gallons of advanced cellulosic ethanol per dry ton of woody biomass using cellulosic sugar as a feedstock will have extraordinary impacts for corn ethanol producers said corrado de gasperis comstock s executive chairman and chief executive officer woody biomass is a dramatically less expensive and available feedstock and delivers substantial higher revenue from significantly higher lifecycle carbon gains when compared to corn the u s environmental protection agency epa requires and incentivizes compliance with its renewable fuel standards rfs by assigning renewable identification numbers rins to each gallon of renewable fuel produced or imported into the u s different fuel types are assigned different classes of rins with different market values based on the degree to which each fuel type reduces greenhouse gas ghg emissions over fossil petroleum sources california and various other states have now also enacted low carbon fuels standards which provide significant additional incentives in short the greater the ghg reduction the lower the carbon intensity ci score the higher the selling price of the resulting fuel under current market conditions our cellulosic ethanol would have a market value in california of approximately 6 30 per gallon as compared to just over 3 00 per gallon for corn ethanol under current market conditions and prices a typical 100 million gallon corn ethanol producer that upgrades its facility to produce an additional 20 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol would increase revenue by more than 30 or over 125 million per year our goal is to accelerate the commercialization of decarbonizing technologies concluded de gasperis we are ready to enable dramatic improvements in ghg reductions and ethanol profitability today with existing corn based producers comstock is evaluating a number of existing first generation corn ethanol facilities for upgrades to and construction of co located commercial scale cellulosic ethanol production additional information is available from comstock s business development group please see

when l f o the hit making boy band trio from the late 1990s went on tour for the last time in 2017 it was without one of its three founding members rich cronin who had died in 2010 after an extended battle of leukemia and just a year later another l f o member devin lima succumbed to cancer that left brad fischetti as the sole surviving member of the group which had a 1999 platinum self titled debut album and top 10 hits summer girls and girl on tv fischetti says it was the last time he could foresee playing l f o s music live but now fischetti 44 is getting another chance he s the host of the pop 2000 tour concert show that stops at 6 30 p m saturday at easton s onecentersquare the show includes former teen pop stars ryan cabrera aaron carter and boy band o town whom fischetti says he ll join for a medley of l f o songs in a recent call from his home near orlando fla where he was with his five children fischetti spoke about the new tour his time with l f o and hi hope to make the new shows a tribute to cronin and lima here s a transcript of the call brad fischetti of lfo will headline the pop 2000 tour at onecentresquare in easton on saturday brad fischetti sorry about that man i m at home with all the kids lehigh valley music no worries thanks for taking out time to do this i appreciate it sure and the reason we re talking is you have a show with o town at our onecentresquare in easton pennsylvania and i m going to write a story in advance of you coming here so tell me about the show what s your part in it well for these pop 2000 shows i ll be hosting the show so i ll be introducing the show introducing the bands try to have some fun in between sets then during the o town set we ll actually perform a little l f o medley together so how did you hook up with the tour well the last couple years our agent matt rafal is the same agent as o town and the agency partially responsible for creating this pop 2000 tour so you know rich passed away in 2010 in 2017 devin and i got back together and did a tour of the east coast and it was great we were making plan for more shows and then he was diagnosed and then he died and so this was an opportunity that i didn t expect but that i m very comfortable with as a way to continue the legacy of lfo and then have an opportunity to honor my brothers rich and devin i want to come back to that in a little bit but i wanted to ask when you guys were in lfo did you ever perform with any of the other guys like ryan cabrera or aaron carter or o town we definitely played shows with o town and we did some stuff with aaron carter way back when actually overseas when he was just a little guy cabrera and our paths really didn t cross but we did do something with him a couple years ago but the o towns we ve known for a long time you know they re friends of ours and good dudes and i m looking forward to having an opportunity to see those guys again and spend a little time on the road together o town is from left dan miller erik michael estrada trevor penick and jacob underwood must credit handout photo by mario barberio you mentioned the fact that lfo had reunited in 2010 and that s actually when you and i first talked you played crocodile rock café here in allentown between that tour and the reunion with devin in 2017 what had you been doing musically and what have you been doing musically bring me up to date well in 2002 when we took our official hiatus which in boy band talk is we broke up i started a record label called one eleven records and i continue to run that label through the warner music group and in 2009 as you mentioned we reunited and that s when we went up there to play in your neck of the woods and in 2010 rich died so between 2010 and the current time i continue to run my label devin and i lived very close to each other he actually with me for a while we did a solo record on devin at one point in time a really cool record and i also do work at a church so i have an opportunity to serve god and minister to his people every weekend with music and in other ways too so i kept busy that s for sure now i know this is difficult for you but tell me about the loss of rich and then the loss of devin what was your reaction to those things happening well rich had obviously battled cancer for a long time devin and i were not aware he was on his death bed we knew that he was real sick i had heard tat he was having some trouble walking so i texted him on his birthday and he didn t respond and i texted him again maybe a week later saying hey man i know you re having trouble getting on your feet and i know if there s any way to get you on your feet it s to play some shows so why don t we schedule some more shows and he didn t respond to that and then a few days later i got word that he died and it s hard to describe what that feeling was like it s hard to imaging somebody so full of life and so young gone i think probably the worst thing was just seeing the pain of his family specifically his mom for a mother to have to bury a child just isn t right brad fischetti left with lfo in 2009 when singer rich cronin center was battling leukemia center cronin died in 2010 at right is devin lima who died of cancer in 2018 fischetti will perform on the pop 2000 tour coming to easton s onecentresquare on dec 7 i remember when you guys played in allentown in 2010 he still even though he was ill back then he still was the front man man recollection of that show was that he still was leading the show well he had lot of trouble getting around in those days we devoted the entire back of the bus to him so he could just sort of relax back there sleep late and then we d help him get dressed and then we d help him get to the stage sometimes there was on time we had to like literally carry him on stage because of the stairs but once he got on the stage he sort of found his position behind the mic and rocked the mic that s was rich cronin he was a performer so he would perform to the end i respect that about him you mentioned that after the 2017 reunion with devin that you guys had more shows you intended yeah i had just spent like an entire day booking travel for the next run that was on a sunday and one of the shows was going to be in vegas where that shooting happened which happened the following day monday so i did all this working booking on a sunday monday was the shooting in vegas and i want to say that two days later was when i found out devin was real sick so thankfully thank goodness that all the airlines were very accommodating casue i was able to cancel i booked a whole bunch of flights between me and devin and bands and crews driving here flying there hotels it was just there was a lot of travel so yeah we intended on continuing on with that you know the last music i could find that you released you released perfect 10 back in 2017 yeah that was awesome we recorded that with shep and aaron shep was part of the production duo that did every other time with us and life is good and a few other tracks and he and aaron who we knew back then he played guitar on those songs and had some big hits in the last few years we had the great opportunity to go up to new york and work with those guys and it was really a beautiful experience being with dev and recording with devin again and we had other songs lined up we really had a plan put together to continue on with this mission but you know the story devin lima in 2001 i also read or i saw on tmz that you guys released the xiles xmas and hip hop reindeer last oh yeah we recorded those songs a long time ago in my garage we never actually did anything with them even though we really enjoyed them a lot so we were thinking about putting those out and toward the end of devin s life i would go over to his house and i d read to him and we were reading out of this it s actually a science fiction book which typically i would never even consider reading and author named ray bradbury and it was a collection of short stories called r is for rocket and at this point in his life he was just basically in constant pain there was nothing you could do for him i mean i would rub his back for him and he was just trying to find a comfortable position on the couch you know sort of contort his body and then i d read to him from this book and i was just astounded by the beauty of the writing i think of science fiction i think of you know weird alien dinosaurs and stuff like that but it s so much more than that and bradbury has a beautiful prose just beautiful literature and so we read and the next chapter i was going to read to him was actually called the exiles and so we had both decided that we wanted to put the xiles christmas ep out and he texted me the next chapter s xiles bring xiles over when you come and he died the next day i never got a chance to read the chapter to him and it s actually still sitting on my nightstand the book i haven t read the xiles chapter yet just can t do it but um those songs are really fun and one of them s really crazy i m not exactly sure where we came up with the lyrics but we were not doing drugs or drinking i promise i don t where it came from but it s fun for christmas and you know we re trying to let people know it s out there and see if anybody consumes it over the holiday season what do you see in the future is there anything else in the lfo vault that might show up or do you have plans to do any solo music at any point i don t think you re going to see this turn into tupac you know where there s a few albums after he s gone that s not i don t have any intention on doing that i m not saying it ll never happen but both rich and devin were prolific writers and they both have a lot of things recorded but right now it s not in my heart to attempt that what i feel really good with right now is doing whatever i can to honor them and i like the idea of these pop 2000 shows because i m not out there telling people well i m just going to do it without them because that s just not possible it was hard enough to go out there without rich but devin and i we were best friends and we spent countless hours together so we felt good to get put there and honor rich which we did and play these shows but without one of those guys i m just not interested in doing that by myself and people say oh you should have auditions and replace them i m like no that doesn t honor them to replace them and further you can t we spent two decades together there s a certain camaraderie you form together you can t replace that overnight so these shows are great because i m not out there saying oh i m just going to do it all by myself i m going to host the shows and we ll do a little lfo medley together with o town and that ll be fun and i look at it as an opportunity to bring a little bit of joy into a difficult world where a lot of our fans these days are married or divorced or have kids or have real lives as opposed to being in eighth grade or 10th grade and just enjoying life so it s a break from reality a break from the news it s a break from the stock market it s just a nice opportunity to go back in time and have some fun so that s one of the motivating factors to do that and honor rich and devin and i look at it as a blessing too after all these years to go out there to have some fun to continue the legacy to earn some extra money for me anytime you pray for something the response is what s in it for me what are you doing to do to help my people what are you going to do to help the poor what are you going to do to help the non believers and so i seek to serve any way i can and i like this opportunity of going out into the secular world and trying to be a light trying to bring people closer to happiness and an opportunity to speak to people and answer questions and just try my best to honor the blessing i ve been blessed tremendously i could easily be dead or strung up and the only reason i m not is because i said at one point you know what i m righting the ship turning it over and live a life pleasing to god i m not perfect by any means but i feel the closer you get to doing that the less egregious your sins get when we did the tour in 2017 i did a short witness before each show telling a little bit about my story and then i also sang a contemporary christian song i really did so that was a nice experience now i m going out there to honor rich to honor devin to honor the legacy to bring some joy and to help support my family and to continue serving god in any way i can whether that s from donating money back from what i earn or it s trying to be a light on the stage i m not saying i m going to get up there and be a big tent revival you can evangelize just by the way you act so that s where i m at i feel extraordinarily fortunate and blessed to after 20 years being able to do this again it s crazy you know pop 2000 tour with o town ryan cabrera aaron

paris the world would save nearly 700 million tonnes of carbon pollution each year more than canada s annual emissions if every person adopted the dutch way of life and cycled on a daily basis new research showed on thursday the transport sector currently accounts for a quarter of all fuel related greenhouse gas emissions which are warming the planet half of those emissions are from passenger cars and worldwide transport demand is predicted to triple by mid century as they seek to decarbonise transport governments and industry have turned towards electric vehicles with 6 75 million units sold in 2021 alone vehicle sales are tracked and published each year however it has been difficult to calculate the production and ownership of a much older low carbon technology the bicycle an international team of researchers has now compiled the first global dataset of bicycle ownership and use by country dating back to the early 1960s using statistical modelling to fill in any information gaps they found that between 1962 2015 global production of bikes outstripped that of cars with china accounting for nearly two thirds of the more than 123 million bikes manufactured in 2015 writing in the journal communications earth and environment the team showed that bicycle ownership was generally higher in upper income and upper middle income countries but then so was the percentage of journeys undertaken by car this meant that high bicycle ownership does not necessarily lead to high bicycle use among the 60 countries included in the dataset the share of bicycle use for journeys was only five per cent some countries simply lack bicycle stocks while others with high bike ownership such as the united states tended to view cycling as more of a leisure activity than a mode of transport going dutch the team calculated that if everyone emulated the danish commute of cycling an average of 1 6 kilometres each day the world could save some 414 million tonnes of co2 a year equivalent to britain s annual emissions going dutch and cycling 2 6 kilometres daily like people do in the netherlands would save 686 million tonnes and bring with it associated health benefits due to more exercise and improved air quality a worldwide pro bicycle policy and infrastructure development enabled modal shift like the netherlands and denmark can lead to significant untapped climate and health benefits the authors wrote they said this dual benefit demanded better bicycle data collection and said there was an urgent need to promote sustainable bicycle use via supporting policy planning and infrastructure development the study s lead author gang liu a professor at the university of southern denmark s department of green technology said the research showed that bicycles had an important future role in lowering global transport s carbon footprint addressing such gigantic challenges requires not only technology side strategies such as lightweight design or electrification he told afp but also needs demand side strategies such as alternative mobility patterns sharing mobility on demand mobility and ride sharing and transport mode change such as reducing short distance car use by cycling
new york european and us stocks mostly fell on friday with investors focused firmly on central bank interest rate hikes as the us dollar rallied after slumping through the first half of 2022 amid concerns over central bank tightening stocks have done better since the end of june as investors bet on a pivot by the federal reserve fed some time in the near future but there is considerable uncertainty about when such a shift will happen as fed officials have consistently repeated the message that they are not done with rate hikes as they battle to douse red hot inflation stocks will most likely struggle for direction for the rest of the summer as wall street is still uncertain with how aggressive the fed will be in september said oanda trading platform analyst edward moya in europe london s blue chip ftse 100 index just barely managed to stay in the green but paris and frankfurt tumbled around 1 per cent wall street s three main indices closed lower with the tech heavy nasdaq composite slumping 2 per cent the losses in new york resulted in the s p 500 s first weekly decline after four straight weeks of gains patrick o hare analyst at briefing com said the recent rally has been driven by the market embracing a belief that the fed won t have to get overly restrictive with its monetary policy before ultimately shifting to an easing stance the gains have come in the face of several problems that have caused unease on trading floors including china us tensions the ukraine war supply chain snarls and extreme weather across much of the northern hemisphere data this week showing british inflation had jumped into the double digits as well as german producer price inflation surging to 37 per cent on higher energy costs also dampened hopes for a shift in monetary policy away from aggressive tightening it just reminds people that central banks policies have to be hawkish still said karl haeling of lbbw it was really the inflation data both out of the uk and germany that really gave everything the bearish push the dollar meanwhile rose sharply against its main rivals while oil prices steadied as traders assessed the risk of a possible global recession european gas prices reached a fresh record high closing price as the ukraine war impacts supplies elsewhere bitcoin slumped some 9 per cent as investors shunned risky assets jackson hole next the minutes of the fed s latest policy meeting made clear that more rate hikes are in the cards all eyes are now on next week s central banking symposium in jackson hole wyoming federal reserve chair jerome powell the star attraction he is due to speak august 26 at jackson hole one of the key things that people look at is to what extent does powell sort of repeat the message presented in the minutes haeling said do they emphasise the hawkishness over the need to slow down
new york the united states has entered the clean energy race in a big way with the inflation reduction act ira of 2022 not only will the law subsidise us renewable energy producers and consumers to the tune of 369 billion over ten years it also authorises the department of energy doe to lend up to 250 billion to us companies that are investing in the clean energy transition between the ira and the recent 52 billion package to boost us semiconductor production it is clear that industrial policy is back in vogue in washington dc to be sure these figures might sound modest according to bloomberg global investments in the energy transition topped 750 billion last year with china alone spending 266 billion compared to 47 billion in germany and 114 billion in the us and mckinsey company offers an even more generous accounting putting total current investments in clean energy and its supporting infrastructure at 2 trillion but these figures refer to total new investments worldwide they are coming primarily from the private sector which is still a long way from where we need it to be although global deployment of renewables electric vehicles and other low carbon infrastructure is accelerating fast there is still a widening gap between what is being done and what needs to be done to manage the climate crisis hence bloomberg s analysts think global investments in clean energy need to triple by 2025 and then double again by the end of the decade and mckinsey calculates that total annual investments of more than 9 trillion will be needed between now and 2050 to reach net zero with around 2 7 trillion per year shifting from dirty to clean energy sources this is where the additional us government funding and incentives come in the point is not to replace or simply add to private investment rather government subsidies when properly designed promise to mobilise a much larger multiple of private investment dollars consider the additional doe loans the programme will use just 5 billion in taxpayer funds to administer up to 250 billion in loans to businesses which in turn will put up hundreds of billions in additional private capital to spend on cutting greenhouse gas pollution the ira also shines a light on questions that might otherwise have been overlooked such as the issue of embodied carbon right now consumers are generally left in the dark about the amount of pollution that is produced in the creation of a given product the ira allocates 350 million to help manufacturers measure embodied carbon and to create a labeling programme for materials used in federal construction projects moreover those provisions come on top of more than 4 billion for federal government purchases of such materials decarbonising the us federal government s own operations is critical both for its own sake and as a way to jumpstart the broader transition to low carbon buildings and transportation infrastructure throughout the economy there are important tradeoffs to consider given the wider interplay between greenflation and the much larger problem of fossilflation no one disputes that higher fossil fuel prices have created significant inflationary pressures in the us and elsewhere over the past year energy alone accounts for an estimated 33 per cent of us inflation and it is reasonable to assume that some of the food and other commodity price increases are also due to higher energy inputs and transportation costs investing in energy efficiency and clean energy would thus be broadly deflationary at least in the medium to long run true more investments in the green transition may well lead to temporary upward pressure on clean energy and decarbonisation prices but that is why the ira places so much emphasis on investing in production capacities and supply chains while no legislation is perfect the ira is well worth celebrating until this past month there was a clear transatlantic divergence reflected even in stock prices as europe mobilised to accelerate its decarbonisation efforts while the us did not now the tables may have turned us climate tech stocks have surged as the bill has made its way to us president joe biden s desk us states like california new york and even texas have long been ahead of the us federal government in supporting renewables but now that the federal government has finally made it to the starting gate the clean energy transition has turned into a global race to the top the us has lit a carbon neutral fire under other countries and supranational blocs like the european union while the eu has had a considerable lead on climate policy issues for many years its political structure prevents it from moving as quickly as many would like it to the eu s european green deal was announced in 2019 but not adopted until july 2021 indeed its provisions are still winding their way through the european parliament and national governments still europe s goal is significantly more ambitious than america s the eu is pursuing carbon neutrality by mid century and a 55 per cent reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by the end of this decade by contrast the biden administration has committed to cutting emissions by 50 per cent from their peak levels of 2005 and the ira is now expected to reduce emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030 a strong performance in the clean energy race will be good for business the economy and national security and this is not just a transatlantic affair china arguably has a solid lead in the race to manufacture much of the energy transition s hardware it now produces over two thirds of all solar panels and lithium ion batteries and around half of all wind turbines sold globally but by doubling down on industrial policy the us may well peel off some of this market share it remains to be seen who ultimately will emerge as the relative winner in this jockeying for position but it is already clear who the absolute winners will be consumers will have more stable energy supplies younger generations will grow up with a more stable climate and we will all benefit from breathing cleaner air gernot wagner a climate

keep your hand on your gun don t you trust anyone there s just one kind of man that you can trust that s a dead man or a gringo like me ennio morricone a gringo like me i need an ar 15 let me rephrase that i need to pay for law school applications i need to replace the timing belt on my car i need to finally finish reading infinite jest that doorstopper of a book i want an ar 15 right now it s not so much a need in the maslow s hierarchy sense but a want in the this thing feels awesome to shoot and it s more accurate than the chinese sks i ve been rocking with since 2020 sense i shot my buddy s bushmaster out in the woods and with each faint red dot guided ding of 223 wolf ammunition lead on the steel gong we d set up 150 yards out i knew that i needed wanted one so i decided in my infinite wisdom to hit up the gun show the mat su veterans gun show is held annually in anchorage and it serves as a congregation point for gun nuts vets and war surplus enthusiasts to mill around and flip over old combloc surplus rifles grunting with approval or disapproval at the condition of a wood stock or worn bolt action here ar 15s rub shoulders with m1 garands rusty bayonets share table space with authentic ka bar marine knife just like rambo and dusty boxes of ammunition are lined up or displayed piecemeal like artifacts from a different america naturally i love it and i make a habit of going to every one i ve brought a non gun nut friend along to this one and as she opens the passenger door to my suburban which still smells faintly like fish from a kenai related cooler mishap i try to give her some idea of what to expect there s a lot of stuff and a lot of it s going to be overpriced i explain walking across the parking lot the gun show can be vicious man i m telling you at least there s a food truck she says and indeed there is parked just outside the venue bedecked with a smiling otter any firearms the smiling ticket taker asks us outside the front door and i respond with a shake of the head well he chuckles tucking my five bucks into an overflowing cashbox i don t know if you knew this but there s a bunch for sale in there non gun nut friend and i dutifully laugh it s a good joke delivered with well practiced timing i ll give him that we re handed a red raffle ticket each for drawings throughout the day i haven t the faintest idea what is being drawn but this adds to the allure the venue is packed with folding plastic card tables the kind i might have jumped through after a particularly vicious round of beer pong a few months ago but now i m an adult with an adult job each table is lined with guns boxes of ammo old military surplus and hundreds of other assorted items it s more swap meet than gun show with booths hocking earrings and hand knit scarfs fly rods and fishing equipment that looks to be older than eisenhower and a whole table for homemade jerky well it s a good show for buyin but not much for sellin this year a vendor wearing a u s marines baseball cap loudly laments to a companion adjusting a rack of rifles we move on into the crowded room 750 bucks for an sks i remark quietly to my friend are you shitting me is that a lot she asks it is gun prices seem to have steadily risen since the 2020 election of joe biden and even before that when covid sent everyone into a paranoid prepper tailspin gun show prices have always been sort of exorbitant in fact in gun circles there s a common joke about the older gentleman who refuses to drop the price on his rack of ancient m1 garands or 1911 45s no deals i know what i got sonny now inflation has also hit gun prices along with gas groceries and just about everything else but people still want guns and thus 750 bucks for a chinese sks which used to be available by the barrel for 100 dollars a rifle gone are the days of cheap bountiful communist bloc surplus weaponry as i peruse table after table of gear i realize that there s no way i m picking up an ar here for anything under 700 dollars that s fine i really only came to kill a windy rainy afternoon and maybe pick up some cheap ammo for my 10mm the ar can wait 10 mil a vendor scoffs as i examine a box of 180 grain bullets i don t know if i d trust that for my bear gun maybe if i didn t have anything else with me considering that i ve been packing a smith wesson 10mm in a chest holster all summer through bear country this isn t exactly the most heartening thing to hear but opinions on bear guns are multifarious everybody seems to have one the wheelgun guys swear by a few big hogleg 44 or 454 rounds while the 10mm crowd hopes that more bullets on target will get the job done i m firmly in the latter camp but examining a shiny colt anaconda revolver chambered in 44 mag i admit to myself that the revolvers do have more sex appeal what do you think i ask my friend fingering the price tag on an old west style single action revolver could i pull off the cowboy look with this and a hat she giggles which i take to mean no and put the gun down eventually i make my first and only purchase of the show a larry kaniut book about alaskan bear encounters entitled some bears kill it s for my dad who loves those books and loves even more to read particularly grisly passages out loud the grizzly ripped into my face tearing out an eye and leaving skin hanging in a bloody curtain i clapped my hand to my mouth only to find out my jaw was gone and my teeth were shattered like seashells and so on we slowly make our way to the back of the big hall occasionally chatting with vendors about prices after hemming and hawing my friend ends up buying a blue butterfly knife and swings it around in a few test stabs i tell her she should try to get in a mortal kombat style street fight with it a guy recognizes the jacket i m wearing as swiss alpenflage camo and compliments my taste in semi obscure camouflage blends i love everything the swiss ever made man it s a weird little country i opine but they make good stuff intermittently the loudspeaker booms over the dull chatter calling for a raffle ticket number would 801 please come to the front of the room 801 i always check my ticket and it turns out it s never the right one i haven t won a raffle since the grand opening of the west marine over on dimond in 7th grade where my ticket won me a pull to inflate life jacket my lifetime supply of luck ran dry by the time i turned 12 it seems everywhere are old 30 40 krags 8mm mausers the ubiquitous ruger 10 22s that pop up like cockroaches in every gun safe in the world glock 19s pump action shotguns of countless make and gauges and sprinkled in like hidden treasures ak47s polished and oiled to gleaming perfection with price tags to match the gun you can get no joke for three chickens in afghanistan costs upwards of a grand here c est la vie the signs and apparel here reflect the distinctly republican leaning of the gun show crowd a whole booth is dedicated to let s go brandon and thin blue line merch from flags to stickers to beer koozies elsewhere one of the vendors is listening to a trump speech on full blast from a portable speaker so the ex president s words seem to come from everywhere and nowhere as you pass the booth let s get our police back out there get our drug dealers off the streets one of the booths hawking a variety of handguns has a sign that adds 5 each to the price for hat on backwards baggy pants body piercings ugly tattoos and purple or orange hair any combination of three or more of the above the sign claims will result in no sale this i point out to my friend seems a pretty harsh line to take and just to be contrary i flip my hat backwards as i walk by eventually we decide that barring a sudden rise in bitcoin prices or a long lost relative stumbling out of the woodwork and dying neither of us are going to spend any more money i ve been idly debating getting a cheap truck gun to throw in the glove box but that s a purchase for later as we leave i overhear a snippet of a conversation between two vendors and then i thought should i stab him or mace him and realize that i probably don t want to eavesdrop anymore every time i attend some event like this gun show going shooting with friends hunting trip i go in thinking that by the end i ll have some higher understanding of my relationship with firearms or weapons in general in an america where the gun has never been more politicized any writing that touches on firearms even tangentially seems pressured to speak some higher truth about the capital g gun as a paradigm as a tool as a political bargaining chip but i didn t come to any higher truth at the gun show today guns are pretty cool i ve grown up around them and i think that the constitutionally enshrined right to handle them is just about essential as far as a higher truth i don t think you can do much better than that but i ll be damned if i m paying 40 dollars a box for 10mm ammo i ll tell you what jacob hersh was born and raised in anchorage alaska he recently graduated from washington state university with a degree in political science he s back in alaska taking a year off before he attends law school he s been described as neurotic emotionally distant and unhealthily obsessed with national politics all by the same person

evergreens line the slopes of joe freeman s ashe county farm like a regiment of soldiers in tight formation they stand at attention in precise terraced columns of uniform green awaiting their eventual deployment as holiday staples but as sunlight burns through the light mountain haze on a warm afternoon there are interruptions to the carefully cultivated symmetry at mistletoe meadows christmas tree farm just as there are at hundreds of others like it in the state blotches of brown dot some of the lowest rows of the farm s signature fraser firs signaling an invasion by what has become the arch enemy of north carolina s 115 million christmas tree industry it is phytophthora a root attacking fungus that is especially harmful to fraser firs which account for 94 of christmas trees grown commercially in the state not only does phytophthora kill the trees it also makes the soil it inhabits unsuitable for ever growing fraser firs again what s worse says freeman is that phytophthora has a powerful ally in its offensive on the mountain farm he s owned for 34 years in laurel springs just a few miles north of the blue ridge parkway rising temperatures tied to climate change there s no question that it s warmer here than it used to be freeman says as he dabs at the sweat on his forehead with the back of his weathered right hand it shouldn t be this warm right now so if you put a pot of water on the stove it s going to boil we re going to have more rain and more rain means consistently wetter soil below freeman s roughly 200 000 trees which range from newly planted saplings that spent their first few years in soil beds to decade old firs ready for the fall harvest it s the ideal atmosphere for moisture loving phytophthora it s spreading rampantly now and i don t see a way to control it freeman says that threat has inspired freeman and other fraser fir farmers in north carolina to employ innovative strategies to protect their prize crop from the thriving fungus we re going to have to try to modify the tree he insists rare habitat the full sculpted fraser specimens we sort through on local pop up lots are a far cry from most of their typically scrubbier native siblings whose natural range is at elevations at and above 5 000 feet frasers are grown commercially at lower mountain elevations on farms like freeman s which is at about 3 000 feet but raising those crops successfully outside their natural habitat requires constant care each tree gets touched six to eight times a year says brad edwards program assistant for the n c state cooperative extension who works extensively with growers in ashe county the nation s largest producer of christmas trees it s all about keeping those trees going and whatever they need whether we re fighting the grass or putting fertilizer down or spraying for bugs or we re shearing them that means freeman s farm employees mostly from mexico and in the country on work visas interact with the crop more than a million times a year they re not just going into the woods and cutting down trees edwards explains there s a lot of misconception about how much work gets done or not done but these guys start working in the middle of march and they work every day until we cut these trees down in november unique climate criteria native frasers which can grow to heights of up to 80 feet are found exclusively near the tallest mountain peaks in southwest virginia western north carolina and eastern tennessee the highest natural habitat for fraser firs is north carolina s mt mitchell which tops out at 6 684 feet and is the tallest point east of the mississippi river their range has historically been limited because of their fairly unique climate criteria corey davis assistant state climatologist at the n c state climate office says of fraser firs they need cool moist conditions overall with average summertime temperatures of 60 degrees or less and annual rainfall of at least 75 inches he explains when you look at maps of average summer temperatures and annual precipitation there is a very narrow set of locations that meet both criteria davis adds other than the appalachians the cascade range in oregon home to douglas and noble firs the favorite choices for christmas trees in the western u s is the only area in the u s with the same climatological conditions even including those other species that still leaves a tiny part of the country where christmas trees can grow and not much wiggle room as those climate conditions change davis says he points to grandfather mountain where native frasers thrive as an example of how warming tied to climate change is impacting their habitat from 1991 to 2020 the average summertime temperature on the mountain was 63 2 degrees that was more than 2 degrees above the summer average for the last three decades of the 20th century grandfather also is experiencing a significant increase in the number of summer days when the high temperature reaches at least 80 degrees that sort of warmth is driving up the summer average temperatures potentially beyond the fraser fir s comfort zone davis says warming temperatures fueled by climate change have prompted foresters to study how the ranges of some tree species including the loblolly pine which also is native to the southeast and used primarily for timber will likely shift northward that s really not an option for christmas tree growers though davis explains even if the future climate gets a little wetter it will be tough to find other areas that are wet enough while still being cool enough a relatively small number of non fraser species of christmas trees whose habitats are not as limited are grown and sold at lower elevation choose and cut farms on the borderline when it comes to fraser firs it s not just incremental warming that worries north carolina christmas tree farmers wider swings in precipitation and temperature tied to climate change pose potential threats explains jeff owen an n c state cooperative extension specialist who has spent decades studying christmas trees and working closely with farmers who grow them you aim for average conditions with your crops he says when nature throws you a curveball you have to adapt in 2020 for example more than 120 inches of rain drenched the area around freeman s farm considerably more than the ideal 75 inches that turns it into a temperate rain forest owen says nobody ever saw water like that in their memory climate driven variability in seasonal weather also makes christmas trees more vulnerable to irreparable harm let s say you go from eight months when a fungus thrives to 10 months when a fungus thrives owen suggests it s not like all of a sudden you have a bunch of new problems it s just that the problems you have are subject to changing weather trees that break their winter dormancy because of an early spring warm snap can suffer permanent damage from a subsequent freeze in an industry where customers expect near perfection the financial consequences of a physically compromised crop can be considerable fraser fir farmers are adaptable by nature since they already are raising the species below its preferred elevation but that resiliency only goes so far at some point when catastrophic events pile on top of each other it becomes overwhelming to any system owen says i don t really have an answer for that and i can t really manage for that but i can deal with one problem at a time the north carolina climate science report published in 2020 by the n c institute for climate studies concluded that the state can expect increasingly warm nights more days with extreme heat and heavier rainfall while phytophthora has affected north carolina fraser firs since the 1960s those kinds of intensifying weather conditions will continue to enhance its habitat experts say while the frequency and intensity of rain is expected to increase continued warming also will speed evaporation and create conditions that make wildfires more likely the north carolina climate science report also predicted those blazes could threaten the state s 40 000 acres of christmas tree farms in oregon the only state with a bigger christmas tree industry than north carolina s growers experienced considerable losses in june 2021 when extreme heat scorched their crops some farms lost all of their young seedlings which will mean an eventual year or more without a full tree harvest so is that once in 20 years owen asks about climate related extreme conditions we can handle that is it every year now we ve started getting into a situation where you don t even get through the crop cycle custom cadillac just across n c 88 from joe freeman s farm at the n c department of agriculture s 454 acre upper mountain research center owen and other experts are continuing their long running quest to engineer the best possible christmas trees the primary lab for their work is an inconspicuous 5 5 acre stand of small firs some of which barely resemble what most of us would consider a christmas tree in this case looks are deceiving says edwards the extension service assistant this is the most advanced fraser fir orchard in the world he proclaims with an unapologetic air of pride this is our future right here the firs in the field represent decades of work to as freeman the mistletoe meadows farm owner put it modify the tree at the research center that means genetically modifying trees to improve needle retention smell and other characteristics important to consumers however the culmination of researchers decades long work involves combining the most desirable characteristics of two species to create a single superior tree owen points out an irregularly shaped six foot specimen that even charlie brown would take a pass on it is the product of a genetically enhanced fraser cutting grafted to root stock from a canaan fir which has a more vigorous root system adjusts better to weather extremes and is more resistant to disease the result is a fraser fir already considered the cadillac of christmas trees edwards notes with the durability of a canaan nationwide there s a lot of different species of christmas trees sold he says but the fraser fir is by far the favorite because it s got stronger branches it s got a really good smell to it and it drops fewer needles than all the others the trees in this orchard amount to custom cadillacs outfitted with after factory components the seeds their female cones produce will lead to a generation of more resilient fraser firs we re just on the elevation borderline of being able to grow frasers and that s why phytophthora is a big issue edwards says we can grow them and we re really lucky we can grow them but if things change a lot of us have concerns it s already a species on the edge in its natural range it has nowhere else to go in the research station orchard owen turns away from the trees and looks across the road to a section of fraser firs on joe freeman s farm he grabs his wide brimmed hat as a gust of wind nearly blows it from his head then points to the spattering of lifeless brown trees that have already lost the battle to phytophthora but remain as markers for the now compromised soil that once sustained them he ll keep planting trees there until he can t owen says matter of factly in the meantime he adds the quest will continue for christmas trees that meet the high expectations of customers while surviving the threats posed by climate change and other environmental challenges but that kind of ignores the worst case scenario owen concedes at some point the truth is who cares about a christmas tree if the world s burning up we re not going to be worrying about where the next christmas tree is coming from but until that day we can keep christmas trees in somebody s living room photos christmas tree research and farming in high country n c state christmas trees n c state christmas trees n

multiplying a company s share price by the number of shares outstanding for example if company xyz has a share price of 10 and 10 million shares outstanding its market cap would be 100 million this is one way to assess a company s size moreover it is also used to help investors identify companies that may be undervalued or overvalued additionally the market cap can also be a useful tool for identifying trends in the overall stock market for example if the market cap of all publicly traded companies decreases it may indicate that the stock market is bearish conversely if the market cap of all publicly traded companies increases it may signal that the stock market is bullish market cap is just one metric that investors use when researching companies but it can be a helpful starting point for identifying potential investments what is technical analysis in stocks technical analysis is the study of past market data to identify trends and forecast future market behavior in fact technical analysts believe that the collective actions of all participants in the market can be represented in price movements and that by analyzing this data it is possible to identify patterns that can be used to predict future market behavior this strategy is widely used by traders and investors to make decisions about when to buy and sell securities technical analysis can also be used to identify a wide variety of patterns including support and resistance levels trendlines price targets and stop loss levels notably technical analysts use a variety of tools to identify these patterns including candlestick charts bar charts moving averages bollinger bands r fibonacci retracements and momentum indicators while no one indicator is perfect technical analysis can be a valuable tool for identifying opportunities in the markets what is fundamental analysis in stocks fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating a security in order to estimate its intrinsic value intrinsic value is the actual worth of a company as opposed to its market value market value is determined by the forces of supply and demand in the marketplace and it can fluctuate rapidly intrinsic value on the other hand is based on a company s fundamental factors such as its earnings power asset value and growth prospects by analyzing these factors investors can get a better sense of a company s true worth and make more informed investment decisions fundamental analysis is therefore an important tool for any serious investor benefits of investing in stocks one of the main benefits of investing in the stock

according to the imf bangladesh is not at risk of experiencing a crisis similar to the one that occurred in sri lanka an imf official said bangladesh is not facing a crisis and its external position is very different from several countries in the region when describing bangladesh s present economic status to media during an online conference on tuesday rahul anand division chief in the imf s asia and pacific department said that bangladesh s external position is quite different from several nations in the region according to him bangladesh s external debt to gdp ratio which is close to 14 is moderately low primarily concessional in form and has a minimal risk of debt crisis following his interview that was recently published in the london based daily bangladeshi finance minister ahm mustafa kamal sent a response to the financial times today the reserves stand at us 40 billion us dollars enough for more than five months import payments and beyond the risk threshold prescribed by the imf after sri lanka s economy collapsed focus shifted to bangladesh as the nation looked to prevent the financial crisis that broke out in the island nation concerns about the nation s economic health arose as dhaka sought the imf for a bailout package and amid an increase in fuel costs however a senior executive from the washington based global lender dispelled such dire predictions the economist responded to allegations that bangladesh s 40 billion reserve was a sign of impending catastrophe by saying that even though bangladesh s reserves have decreased the stockpiles are still large enough to handle four to five months of potential imports there were rumors that the government s most recent record fuel price increase was a requirement imposed by the imf the imf official however refuted the charges stating that there was no connection between the fuel price increase to bring it into line with the market pricing and the support program sought by the imf by dhaka the external debt of bangladesh is only about 14 of gdp which is quite modest according to the media reports rahul anand division leader at the imf s asia and pacific department bangladesh is not in a crisis and its external position is quite different from numerous countries in the region while the sheikh hasina government has set a target of more than 60 billion in export income for the following fiscal year bangladesh s exports in the 2021 2022 fiscal year exceeded the 50 billion threshold 2022 23 the government was able to achieve a consistent increase in remittances worth 813 million in the first ten days of august thanks to the new opening of the malaysian labor market and a number of other government initiatives the number of remittances received through the banking system in july was 2 09 billion the most in the previous 14 months due to sheikh hasina s astute leadership the nation implemented a number of preventive steps in response to the surge in spot market lng prices at the start of the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine among those measures were planned power outages in various regions of the nation the suspension of a few development initiatives geared toward the future and restrictions on government leaders overseas travel to compare rst money to an imf bailout package sought by pakistan or sri lanka is obviously to ignore the forest for the trees nasrul hamid the nation s junior minister for power mineral and energy resources has already given the people of his country the assurance that the ongoing load shedding will end in september he has also made further hints about implementing changes to oil prices in line with international markets importantly despite the price increase bangladesh continues to provide its citizens with the most affordable options and the increase in oil prices was intended to reduce a staggering subsidiary payment of more than bdt 8000 crore made by the government over the previous four months february 2022 june 2022 bangladesh is thinking about importing crude oil from russia as the price of gasoline in the country rises substantially masud bin momen the foreign minister of bangladesh announced on tuesday that a russian expert delegation will soon arrive in dhaka to discuss the problem of importing crude oil from that country according to the world bank s south asia food security update published on thursday there is no significant food shortage in bangladesh it is important to note that the government has implemented a number of initiatives to boost the nation s output of both food grains and vegetables bangladesh wouldn t experience a food crisis even if it was impossible to buy food from other nations owing to market volatility worldwide new rice varieties br 89 created by our experts will boost rice output by 50 60 however the reality is that because of the increase in the cost of diesel seeds fertilizer and other inputs the nation s farmers are now finding it difficult to continue growing food grains and vegetables diesel seeds fertilizers and other inputs are extremely important to farmers in order to nurture and grow their crops and vegetables their production costs will rise as a result of the increased cost of diesel seeds fertilizer and other inputs however the country s aman paddy production has already been severely hampered by the drought like conditions caused by a lack of rain the majority of farmers in the nation rely on rainwater for the monsoon season s aman paddy cultivation the objective of aman agriculture in this season may potentially be hampered by the lack of rain the administration is committed to ensuring everyone has access to food as a result it must come up with strategies for increasing food production while providing farmers with unwavering support everyone should keep in mind that expanding the agricultural industry needs to continue to be a top focus to meet its demand the nation has a sufficient supply of all types of fertilizers 6 45 lakh tonnes of urea fertilizer 3 94 lakh tonnes of tsp 7 36 lakh tonnes of dap and 2 73 lakh tonnes of mop are currently in stock fertilizer is currently in greater supply than it was during the same time last year the farmers farm loan of taka 2830 61 core was also distributed by the state owned commercial banks to ensure the nation s citizens have access to adequate food the ministries of agriculture and food must exert all possible effort to commercialize and profit from agricultural activity the government needs to focus more on our farmers so that the rising costs of diesel seeds fertilizer and other inputs won t deter them from growing food crops like grains and vegetables not least of all the government should take the required actions to provide farmers with cutting edge equipment

washington s ambiguous taiwan policies are edging towards conflict but beijing wants to exhaust peaceful options first the us relations with china in regards to taiwan have been dictated by years of ambiguous statements and commitments now this rhetoric is breaking down and armed conflict seems closer than ever but is washington ready to fight over taiwan or capable of winning assurances and commitments officially us policy toward taiwan is guided by three us china joint communiques issued between 1972 and 1982 the taiwan relations act of 1979 and the so called six assurances issued in 1982 in the shanghai communique of 1972 china asserted that the taiwan question is the crucial question obstructing the normalization of relations between china and the united states declaring that the government of the people s republic of china is the sole legal government of china that taiwan is a province of china and that the liberation of taiwan is china s internal affair in which no other country has the right to interfere the us responded by acknowledging that all chinese on either side of the taiwan strait maintain there is but one china and that taiwan is a part of china something the us government did not challenge the us also reaffirmed its interest in a peaceful settlement of the taiwan question by the chinese themselves before that on january 1 1979 the us and china had issued a joint communique of the establishment of diplomatic relations in which the us undertook to recognize the government of the people s republic of china as the sole legal government of china noting that within the context of that commitment the people of the united states will maintain cultural commercial and other unofficial relations with the people of taiwan president jimmy carter in announcing the communique went out of his way to ensure the people of taiwan that normalization of relations between our country and the people s republic will not jeopardize the well being of the people of taiwan adding that the people of our country will maintain our current commercial cultural trade and other relations with taiwan through nongovernmental means carter s move to establish diplomatic relations with china did not sit well with many members of congress who responded by passing the taiwan relations act of 1979 in which it was declared that it is us policy to preserve and promote extensive close and friendly commercial cultural and other relations between the people of the united states and the people on taiwan as well as the people on the china mainland and to make clear that the united states decision to establish diplomatic relations with the people s republic of china rests upon the expectation that the future of taiwan will be determined by peaceful means in this regard the taiwan relations act underscored that the us would consider any effort to determine the future of taiwan by other than peaceful means including by boycotts or embargoes a threat to the peace and security of the western pacific area and of grave concern to the united states and to provide taiwan with arms of a defensive character finally the act declared that the us would maintain the capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security or the social or economic system of the people on taiwan the emphasis on arms sales contained in the taiwan relations act led to the third joint communique between the us and china released on august 17 1982 which sought to settle differences between the two nations regarding us arms sales to taiwan the communique was basically a quid pro quo agreement where china underscored that it maintained a fundamental policy of striving for a peaceful reunification with taiwan over which it claimed sovereignty for its part the us declared that it understands and appreciates the chinese policy of striving for a peaceful resolution of the taiwan question and with that in mind the us declared that it did not seek to carry out a long term policy of arms sales to taiwan and that it would gradually reduce its sale of arms to taiwan while working for a final resolution to reunification to mollify taiwanese concerns about the third communique the us agreed to what have become known as the six assurances between the us and taiwan these are 1 the us has not set a date for ending arms sales to taiwan 2 the us has not agreed to prior consultations with china about arms sales to taiwan 3 the us has not agreed to any mediation role between china and taiwan 4 the us has not agreed to revise the taiwan relations act 5 the us has not taken a position regarding the sovereignty of taiwan and 6 that the us would never put pressure on taiwan to negotiate with china there was an unwritten corollary to the third communique an internal memorandum signed by president ronald reagan in which he declared that the us willingness to reduce its arms sales to taiwan is conditioned absolutely upon the continued commitment of china to the peaceful solution of the taiwan prc differences adding that it is essential that the quantity and quality of the arms provided taiwan be conditioned entirely on the threat posed by the prc a us policy at war with itself what emerges from this amalgam of policy statements and positions is a us policy that is inherently at war with itself unable to fully commit either to the finality of a one china policy or walk away from the sale of weapons to taiwan the us disguises this inherent inconsistency by referring to it as strategic ambiguity the problem is this policy stew is neither strategic in vision nor ambiguous from the moment president reagan issued the six assurances us china policy was strained over the issue of weapons sales with china making the case that the us was not serious about either the peaceful reunification of taiwan with china or the elimination of arms sales to taiwan arms sales increased exponentially from the reagan administration to that of george h w bush and bill clinton with the us providing taipei f 16 fighters patriot surface to air missiles and other advanced weapons in 1997 house speaker newt gingrich visited taiwan as part of a pacific tour that included china gingrich claims he told his chinese hosts that if china were to attack taiwan the us will defend taiwan period in 2005 in response to us backsliding when it came to arms sales and taiwan china adopted legislation known as the anti secession law which stated firmly that taiwan is part of china in the law china declared that it shall never allow the taiwan independence secessionist forces to make taiwan secede from china under any name or by any means china reiterated its official stance that reunification through peaceful means best serves the fundamental interests of china however the law made it clear that china would not stand idle in the face of any effort to cause the fact of taiwan s secession from china if this were to occur china would use non peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect china s sovereignty and territorial integrity fast forward to 2021 the biden administration in policy guidance issued soon after the president was sworn in undertook to deter chinese aggression and counter threats to the collective security prosperity and democratic way of life of the us and its allies while publicly committing to a taiwan policy which would be in line with long standing american commitments including the taiwan relations act of 1979 which limited us military support for taiwan to weapons of a defensive character the brink of war this it turned out was a lie in his october 2021 confirmation hearing before the us senate the current us ambassador to china nicholas burns declared that from the perspective of the biden administration the policy of strategic ambiguity provided the us with enormous latitude under the taiwan relations act to deepen us security assistance to taiwan our responsibility burns said is to make taiwan a tough nut to crack this was a stark departure from past practice and served as the justification for biden himself on two occasions to articulate as policy an american commitment to come to the defense of taiwan if china were to attack this radical departure from stated us policy by the biden administration helped launch a congressional trifecta of hubris laced ignorance which saw the dispatch of three consecutive delegations that threaten to propel china down the path toward a war with taiwan it doesn t want to wage and which the world including the us is not prepared to suffer the consequences of the first delegation in may was led by tammy duckworth d illinois prior to her departure from the us duckworth helped push through the strengthen taiwan s security act which among other things sought to improve us taiwan intelligence sharing develop plans to continue the provision of military aid in the case of a chinese attack and explore the possibility of deploying pre positioned stocks of weapons for us troops that would be dispatched to taiwan in the event of a war with china let that last point sink in for a moment duckworth was proposing to implement measures that would guarantee us troops would confront chinese troops in the case of a chinese invasion of taiwan part two of the congressional trifecta of policy ignorance was the visit by nancy pelosi to taiwan of which much has already be written the final act in this tragicomedy is the visit of senator ed markey d massachusetts which took place earlier this week according to a press release issued by markey s office prior to his visit his delegation would meet with elected leaders and members of the private sector to discuss shared interests including reducing tensions in the taiwan strait and expanding economic cooperation including investments in semiconductors left unspoken is the environment in which all three of these visits took place even before duckworth s initial visit chinese authorities had taken the unprecedented step of issuing a stark warning regarding taiwan on may 18 china s senior diplomat yang jiechi warned biden s national security adviser jake sullivan that if the us continues to play the taiwan card and head further on the wrong path this will certainly lead to dangerous situations today china the us taiwan and the rest of the world are left to face such a dangerous situation there is no doubt that any undertaking by taiwan to formally declare its independence from china will result in a chinese invasion of that island moreover it is unlikely that taiwan would ever undertake such an action void of guarantees of us military support backed up by actions designed to breath reality into rhetoric this is where the trio of congressional delegations comes into play legislation such as that proposed by duckworth and seemingly supported by pelosi and markey would be required if the us was to formally break with its past policy undertakings regarding china and taiwan the more congress continues to interface with taiwan the more china must fear legislative action by the us congress which would officially put the us and china on a path toward war as things currently stand the us is not prepared to fight and win a war with china over taiwan if china were to invade taiwan today there is little the us military could do to put teeth to the verbal commitments made by newt gingrich and joe biden about coming to the defense of taipei china has through large scale military maneuvers undertaken following pelosi s precipitous visit demonstrated its ability to invade taiwan at any moment such an invasion if it occurs would be overwhelming in scope and destructive on a scale like that being experienced by ukraine today in the face of russia s ongoing military operations and yet china continues to hold back some armchair generals assess the reluctance to go to war on china s part as a sign of weakness proof that beijing is all bark and no bite nothing however could be further from the truth unlike the united states china seeks to strictly adhere to its stated policy which is to exhaust every peaceful option possible in securing the unification of china and taiwan despite the clear evidence of a marked departure from past policy regarding taiwan and weapons sales china continues to believe that there is a non violent solution to the one china problem if only america would give peace a chance

sadly it wasn t aliens we can say with relative certainly that this was a bank of starlink satellites launched by elon musk s spacex company portland ore perhaps you were outside enjoying the darkened sky friday night maybe you didn t mean to be looking up at all and you were just hanging out with some friends or family but then something caught someone s eye an odd string of light moving steadily across the sky it looked long and thin definitely not a comet or other natural celestial phenomenon in fact it looked more like a train made of fluorescent light fixtures than anything else was it aliens we just saw something weird in the sky one viewer sent in a message to kgw on friday night just before 10 p m what is this seen in the sky just now friday at 9 50 p m another person asked sadly that was not a true uap unidentified aerial phenomena as they re called now we can say with relative certainly that this was a bank of starlink satellites launched by elon musk s spacex company there s even a website that tracks where starlink satellites are going to be visible at any given time they showed up in the portland area at 9 44 p m friday night and returned on saturday and sunday they will be visible monday as well albeit coming from slightly different directions and appearing a few minutes earlier each night for a few moments i wondered if they might be starlink one viewer said after getting an answer from kgw but thought they were typically deployed farther apart this was a great observation and may explain why a particularly high number of people were mystified by the sight on friday usually when starlink satellites show up if they re visible at all they re a little more spaced out looking like a gaggle of celestial ducklings trailing their duck parent but right now they re in a perfect unbroken line the reason for this according to the experts is that the satellites become more distinct and idiosyncratic as time goes on this batch on the other hand is brand new reportedly launched friday and dropped into low earth orbit as a result from our distant perspective on the ground they almost look like a single object according to spacex the latest launch carried 53 new satellites we were at the right place at the right time to be able to see what s called the train said jim todd director of space science education at omsi for many people this is the first time they experienced it they see it because it is fairly new the starlink satellites eventually grow dimmer as they move into higher orbits and provide high speed internet to remote areas on the planet the satellites are hundreds of miles above us much closer than traditional satellites which are considerably larger but orbit further out into space with the moon relatively obscured from us right now there are good conditions for seeing the starlink satellites as they orbit over but as kgw chief meteorologist matt zaffino said it isn t a sure thing all of these are forecast to be very bright displays like we saw tonight zaffino said friday however there is a caveat to that these are satellites and everything has to happen just right for those satellites they re reflecting sunlight they don t have power on them they aren t lit themselves like an airplane is so they have to be oriented the right way spacex plans to launch thousands of starlink satellites which means these unusual streaks of light may not be so unusual as time goes on

during mr von sanden s cross examination the court heard that in 2017 the german parent company tasked boston consulting group with examining how quickly dealer agreements could be changed or cancelled as well as how much severance payments might cost in markets where an agency model might be rolled out the agency model is part of mercedes benz germany s retail of the future plan emails between mr von sanden and a boston consulting group representative showed mr von sanden communicated that if the parties failed to reach a mutual agreement alternative compensations would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars eager to participate while mr von sanden acknowledged mercedes benz in stuttgart had the final say in which markets the new model would be implemented he said the australian team was eager to participate we were pushing to be selected as one of the pilots so it was not a push from stuttgart it was a push from me and my team to be included he said advertisement jason nomikos who took over as director of customer management retail and network development and strategy at mercedes benz australia in june 2018 took the stand in melbourne from tuesday to friday mr nomikos maintained he and mr von sanden began workshopping with the australian dealers from 2018 in an effort to demonstrate they would not suffer profitability losses or financial damage due to the change in model despite several workshops facilitated at times by deloitte mr nomikos said there was considerable pushback from dealers who argued the value of their dealerships and profitability would drop sharply through the change in model dealers worse off rather than buying stock and managing relationships with customers the new model would effectively turn established dealerships into showrooms and mercedes benz would manage the purchase of vehicles through a centralised purchasing portal mr nomikos said the dealers were immediately concerned that losing control of the margin like this would hit their bottom line but he was tasked with demonstrating they would be no worse off advertisement but emails between mr nomikos and mr von sanden in february 2020 showed mercedes benz s internal financial modelling confirmed profits would be reduced and a financial modelling tool developed by deloitte and used by australian dealers to examine the potential hit to their businesses also showed the switch would undercut trading performance this financial modelling tool was recalled after a short time mr nomikos said he and mr von sanden consulted at length with the australian dealers we took all of their concerns into account we just didn t agree with all of them he told the court the trial continues this week

text size this story is part of the august 20 edition of good weekend see all 15 stories the stock agent turned to my husband pat as they watched me walk to the ute to feed our baby and chuckled it s good to have a milk truck on board that was me two years ago as a 39 year old breastfeeding mother the personification of a 16 wheel milk tanker fuelling new zealand s nz19 billion dairy export industry the harmless jokes became vitriolic in the months that followed as the conversation shifted from motherhood to farming emissions in our cattle yards and on other farms in the centre of the north island of nz successive clusters of men laughed cynically at climate action initiatives and i chose to remain silent if i d declared that i think most farmers need regulatory pressure to embrace more environmentally friendly practices the knowledge i needed to keep going on the land would have been withheld along with the invitations to farming workshops the farmers i was learning from with their chauvinist jokes didn t want to be told how to manage their land by urban based regulators government consultants or opinionated idealists new to farming i realised that for many the barrier to environmental change was the messenger not the message loading four years ago my instinct would ve been to roll my eyes at these men and seek camaraderie in the corners of social media where farmers are portrayed as dullards then i was the managing editor at digital media company buzzfeed working long hours in sydney s inner city and burning myself out on a diet of outrage and ambition the result of that misguided energy was laid bare on a monday morning in 2018 as i lay on an emergency bed at sydney s royal prince alfred hospital while a young doctor in green scrubs prodded my abdomen and confirmed that i had miscarried my first baby at three and a half months advertisement i squashed the grief alone in the 20 minutes it took a taxi to drive from the hospital to circular quay where my office was located one evening soon after my dad called from nz and said come home you can work on the farm you and pat can rear calves it s a good way to start i didn t know what it meant to be a farmer what it entailed dad had a five year lease on a small block of land where he fattened dairy heifers for other farmers in his offer i saw the possibility of recreating something from my childhood in nz i pictured vegetables in a garden and meat from the freezer slow days centred around home cooked meals food had filled me up in the weeks after my miscarriage red meat especially giving my depleted body the sustenance it needed to avoid anaemia cooking was a distraction from the grief and the idea of getting closer to my food source felt nourishing but i was naive harvey says within months of arriving in nz she and her husband were essentially factory farming credit joel mcdowell we told people we were leaving sydney to become cattle farmers on a 130 hectare lease block in nz it wasn t a lifestyle choice we said we were going into the farming business the question i didn t know to ask then was how do you get closer to your food and make a living and care for the environment when the country s entire food production system is guided by the export commodity trade efficiency and productivity have long been priorities in nz s export focused farming sector we followed this lore for a while and didn t ask if there was another way didn t pause when something felt wrong such as buying seven day old calves from dairy farms to raise in a converted shed on a diet of milk powder and hay advertisement one morning i watched my father cut off a two year old steer s small pointed horns with a pair of horn tippers a contraption that looks a lot like tree pruning shears causing jets of blood to spout over the animal i returned to the yards alone with a bucket of warm soapy water to futilely scrub the wooden railings clean of blood at that moment in early 2019 the confidence i felt while i was in sydney disappeared loading i d believed then that we were skilled enough to be good farmers that my inner city ambition to produce food that was affordable and nutritious would survive our move to the country but i was out of my depth guided by convention i focused primarily on profit and as a result i created a little industrialised system on our farm to fall neatly into the big industrialised system that dominates nz beef and dairy within months of arriving we were essentially factory farming pushing products animals through a production line as quickly and efficiently as possible more than 450 000 tonnes of beef meat are exported from nz each year mostly to north america and asia australia one of the world s largest exporters sends more than double that abroad it s a multibillion dollar industry that s the business we came into willingly at first but we and everyone around us were soon consumed by arguments about food and farming and its role in causing and combating climate change and the degradation of land water and air in our rearing shed calves started to fall ill in the depth of a cold winter a tiny angus friesian bull calf stopped drinking milk it was so dehydrated its hips protruded like handlebars others started to wane from an unseen bug we tested for rotavirus salmonella and e coli but the true cause was the business model too many tiny calves in too small a space in the push to be efficient our animals were dying are the reports right i asked my dad and his friends after reading yet another document indicating our collective demand for red meat was degrading the planet should we stop rearing calves if all we re doing is sending low quality mincemeat into the global market it s just bloody green lefties blaming farmers for things they advised if we re not producing it another country far less efficient will just keep going they said but death takes a toll advertisement the death on our farm and the climate change reports caused me to lose my appetite the jammy slow cooked berbere beef that had soothed my craving body months earlier was replaced by a rich mix of lentils nicola with husband pat on their land the couple have now adopted a low impact farming model credit joel mcdowell do you think about our cattle after they leave on the truck pat asked one day after months of hard blue sky and no rain we d just sent 150 100 kilogram bull calves off the farm to a larger nearby property south of the lake yes i replied well i used to but then i stopped myself i can t dwell on it for long do you not much he said that s the difference between you and me i hear him think you re trying to solve everyone else s problems i m just trying to solve ours when we started farming i thought buying poorly marked bull calves from dairy farms was a change maker strategy because so many farmers considered these baby cattle a waste product their mottled coats suggesting a lineage that won t fill out quickly we continued to farm cattle but now they like us live to aid the environment not the reverse but a sobering thought had started to settle i should be leaving those calves to their fate a fate that means they leave the dairy farm at four days old on a truck destined for the abattoir not our rearing shed calves have a use off the land the tiny animals are killed for their meat veal destined for the niche european market their hide is turned into the soft leather used for expensive handbags and sports car interiors their carcasses become a blood and bone mix that helps vegetables grow and in the blood is calf serum an ingredient used for medical cell research the development of vaccines in particular advertisement not a bit of the animal is wasted and this hypothetically means fewer cattle to emit methane and excrete nitrous oxide via urine and dung isn t it the health of the land the fate of the planet that we should focus on when we first arrived from sydney i tried to win every argument i stumbled into pat didn t bother instead he started creating something new breaking the old system in his own way so that we could survive on the land to start he stopped buying dairy calves that would take years to fatten and then he reimagined what farming could look like here specifically on our piece of land if we stopped trying to control nature through a heady cycle of cropping fertilising and sowing new grass over and again loading we continued to farm cattle but now they like us live to aid the environment not the reverse for a start our low input farming model improves soil quality and protects the grasslands which provide habitat for birds and insects at the point where the cattle become a burden becoming so heavy for example that their collective weight will send dirt sliding into the waterways below the farm they have to go their lives cut short in service to the land our aim is to decarbonise the gulf between those farming for the future and those focused on today and between the people who grow food and those who consume it still exists but the chasm that had opened between us pat and me and between our imagined farm life and the reality started to close when i stopped trying to win every argument and change everyone around us instead i joined pat in the thriving ecosystem he d created to start living the change we d envisaged together years ago nicola harvey is the author of farm the making of a climate activist scribe 33 out august 30 advertisement

by claire hamlett animals have individual personalities can adapt to changing conditions and can make decisions based on social learning in ways that shape shared human wildlife spaces that means they can play an active influence in their own conservation argues a new paper published in conservation biology according to the authors wildlife conservation and management could improve the outcomes of interventions such as translocations reintroductions and resolving human wildlife conflicts by explicitly acknowledging these traits described as animal agency animal agency is an emerging way of seeing animals as helpers in their own conservation efforts says matthew hayek assistant professor of environmental studies at new york university and the paper s senior author rather than working against their own idiosyncratic behaviors conservationists are paying attention to individual animals quirks seeing differences between small groups and increasingly working with them and achieving better outcomes an open mind but according to the paper wildlife conservation management usually overlooks the concept of animal agency and prioritizes as the authors put it metrics that treat animals primarily as quantifiable stock to understand this gap the authors reviewed 190 published evaluations of policies and programs and identified three underlying assumptions that may undermine their results first the policies presuppose that animals from the same species all behave uniformly and that behavior mostly remains the same in different contexts second they assume that animals will revert to an idealized state of wildness when they are placed in appropriate wild habitats third the policies conceive of relationships between humans and wildlife in a narrowly biological or economical way and downplay cultural relationships between humans and animals don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free but animals are not mathematical formulae that provide the same answer every time if they deviate from wildlife managers assumptions they can inadvertently undermine human established conservation goals the paper lays out several documented cases where animals acted in unanticipated ways demonstrating their agency and thwarting management efforts in the process for example elephants in kenya had been detusked to prevent them smashing fences but they devised new ways of breaking through barriers leopards in india were translocated to a protected nature reserve but soon returned to the edges of an urban area where they conflicted with humans and in the united states kangaroo rats that had been translocated to newly restored habitat ended up losing previously established social connections which resulted in low reproduction and survival rates survival rates can also suffer when misbehaving animals earn themselves the label of problematic which can result in their relocation or even their extermination but those are reversible problems the paper also highlights how integrating animal agency in wildlife management and conservation can shift priorities and help policymakers and practitioners shape and implement conservation plans to take one aspect of animal agency personality bold individuals are more likely to tolerate human disturbance use conservation infrastructure or colonize new areas this has implications for interventions like wildlife corridor planning the authors argue because the scientific models for how animals use corridors present strikingly different results when different behavioral characteristics are included as another example accounting for social learning among groups can shift conservationists focus from preserving the reproductive potential of younger group members to preserving a group s culture and generational knowledge as the case of the kangaroo rat shows maintaining social ties for some species can matter more for the survival of individual animals than placing them in an ecologically correct habitat collective agency this kind of approach can save not just individual animals but whole animal communities in the united kingdom the success of vaccinating badgers against bovine tuberculosis as an alternative to culling requires engaging with their agency something i ve experienced as a badger vaccination volunteer for the past two years the badgers must be habituated to taking bait peanuts and going in and out of traps over a period of about two weeks for each badger community volunteers use their own knowledge and that of landowners such as how bold or shy the animals are how they behaved during previous vaccination rounds and how they use the land around their dens to determine where to set bait and assess the likelihood they will be trapped successfully a more famous example occurred in the dutch city of leiden in 2014 where conservationists saved gulls from a proposed cull by helping the city implement measures to change the behavior of both humans and birds the gulls lured to cities by the destruction of their natural coastal habitats and the promise of easy meals began nesting noisily on rooftops tearing open garbage bags and stealing food some species like the black headed gull and common gull are in decline but one dutch politician proposed lifting their legal protections and shooting them that met with opposition from de vogelbescherming a bird protection organization which offered several alternative interventions these included using ropes to make rooftops unsuitable for breeding using stronger garbage bags that could not be torn open educating people against feeding the birds creating nesting islands by the coast and observing which places the birds preferred this approach philosopher eva meijer wrote in the 2016 book animal ethics in the age of humans illustrate how we can experiment with interspecies decision making when conflicts arise there needs to be communication about who can live where without the agency based methods of conservationists culling as a management strategy might have prevailed and undermined efforts to preserve dwindling gull populations solving problems while many management policies contain shortcomings when it comes to thinking of animals as agents on the ground there are people seeing these phenomena regularly says hayek this means that knowledge of animal agency may inform decisions made by wildlife managers even when it s not officially part of policy don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free one example cited in the paper comes from a 2016 study on human bear cohabitation in the colorado front range of the rocky mountains in 1985 colorado parks and wildlife introduced a management policy known as the two strike directive to manage so called nuisance bears one strike for nuisance behavior such as breaking into a house to find food gets a bear trapped tagged and relocated a second strike gets them killed the study explained that the directive which is still in place is based on assumptions about bears adapting their behavior in a predictable way to the cues given to them by humans about where they are and are not welcome such as relocating them to prime bear habitat but when bears interpret the cues differently or behave in some unexpected manner the wildlife managers who implement the directive learn and adapt their methods accordingly the wildlife managers i spoke to over there acknowledge that these bears have agency they are individuals they have a certain way of behaving says susan boonman berson a co author on the study and a researcher in human wildlife conflict who spent two months in colorado in 2012 observing the interactions between black bears and wildlife managers they want to understand these specific animals and they don t see them just generally as bears one manager boonman berson interviewed described how different bears have their own methods of getting into people s property the manager had to observe and understand the signs they left behind at the site of a break in to determine the best management strategies for example a bear who broke into a car because it still smelled like the owners recently purchased cantaloupes could be lured to a trap with fresh fruit this also helps managers avoid trapping the wrong bear perhaps one who might simply wander into a trap set for the problem bear ironically this can earn the wrong bear a strike because by entering the trap they re considered to have become more habituated to accessing easy food recognizing animal agency can also challenge the idea of problem or nuisance animals that policies like the two strike directive seek to address humans can inadvertently attract animals by providing easy access to food making urban spaces more attractive than the prime habitat when we attract them and feed them and are really actually inviting them to come closer says boonman berson i think we should not speak about the problem animal because the animal is not a problem the answer she says often involves focusing on educating humans rather than managing animals they also call it people management says boonman berson it s not black bear management it s people management the wildlife managers she observed educated residents by encouraging them to secure their trash keep doors locked and not grow fruit trees inside areas where they didn t want bears to venture this is an example of how humans and animals both contribute to shaping shared environments one of the tenets of animal agency barriers remain these examples show some of the possibilities for integrating the concept of animal agency into wildlife management but also the challenges different aspects of animal agency personality social learning adaptability and relationship with humans may be more or less relevant depending on the species and contexts hayek and his coauthors argue in their paper they also acknowledge that there are barriers to a more widespread integration of animal agency into conservation practices since it introduces nonuniformity uncertainty and complexity at the modeling planning and implementation stages and might require more complex expensive and computationally intensive simulations don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free indeed the integration of animal agency into conservation plans has so far been piecemeal temporary and not very popular hayek says but he adds acknowledging the diversity of behaviors and experiences among animals of the same species can at least start to challenge the assumptions that guide much wildlife management and conservation we can find plenty of examples of animals and humans actually learning from one another in a pretty rich way says hayek and that is kind of a mark against the top down nature of some conservation programs that don t look to animals for direction this story was originally

investors continued to withdraw from mutual funds focused on investing in fixed income securities for third consecutive quarter and pulled out over rs 70 000 crore in april june due to high inflation and an increasing rate cycle in the next september quarter it is safe to assume that monetary conditions will be tighter in terms of lower amount system liquidity and higher regulatory rates both of which should see further reduction in mutual fund debt corpuses sandeep bagla ceo trust mutual fund said interest rate will be the major factor to dictate flow in debt mutual funds in coming quarters once rates start stabilizing inflows can be expected ankit yadav wealth manager usa director of market maestroo said the latest outflow has pulled down the asset managed by fund managers for debt fixed income funds by 5 per cent to rs 12 35 lakh crore at june end from close to rs 13 lakh crore at the end of march data available with the association of mutual funds in india amfi showed after hitting a peak of rs 14 16 lakh crore in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 assets under management for the fixed income category has been on a steady decline and since then the asset base has fallen by 13 per cent according to the data net outflow from open ended fixed income mutual funds or debt mutual funds was at rs 70 213 crore in the quarter under review month wise the quarter started on an optimistic note in april with the segment attracting rs 54 756 crore however this changed in may and june as the category saw net outflows of rs 32 722 crore and rs 92 247 crore respectively this came following a net outflow of rs 1 18 lakh crore in march quarter and rs 21 277 crore in quarter ended december 2021 prior to that the category had seen a capital infusion to the tune of rs 10 858 crore in july september 2021 trust mf s bagla said investors have been withdrawing from fixed income funds over the last three quarters primarily because of high inflation and its impact on interest rates higher interest rates result in lower bond prices which in turn eat into the returns of fixed income investors according to him investors have pulled out from fixed income funds both due to liquidity requirements and in order to protect their capital the rising rates scenario particularly from the us federal reserve creates uncertainty in the mind of the investors yadav of market maestroo said as new debt fund becomes more attractive due to rates hikes investors are redeeming their existing debt funds he added out of the 16 fixed income or debt fund categories 12 witnessed net outflows during the quarter under review heavy withdrawal was seen from segments such as low duration funds short duration funds corporate bond funds and banking and psu funds the only categories that witnessed inflows were the liquid funds 10 year gilt funds and the long duration funds the pull out in june quarter was largely contributed by short duration corporate bond low duration banking psu funds with the outflow figures for these categories standing at rs 19 704 crore rs 13 785 crore rs 13 757 crore and rs 8 099 crore respectively within the debt sector short end rates have risen quite sharply the bonds and funds up to 1 2 year maturity offer reasonable returns for investors as they have already factored in further rise in repo rates trust mf s bagla said however credit bonds are unlikely to face buyers as the reserve bank india rbi policies are likely to make credit conditions tougher also floating rate funds suffer from the risk of spread widening and are likely to continue to underperform he added generally debt funds are considered to be less risky with investors taking comfort in being able to hedge their risks by parking hard earned money in instruments that provide better returns than bank fixed deposits on the other hand equity mutual funds attracted a net sum of rs 49 918 crore in the quarter under review due to volatility in stock market environment and exodus by foreign portfolio investors fpis investors are preferring equity as it is known to be a value creator asset class and its increasing awareness amongst the investors is driving the growth in investments in equity oriented schemes with an aim to achieve long term financial goals during june quarter equity funds comprised around 36 per cent of the total industry s aum of rs 35 lakh crore while fixed income funds were at 35 per cent
economic uncertainty is not the only reason for the stock s recent decline the business faced significant operational challenges in the first half of the year which included extreme weather and supply chain problems alongside the impact of lower grades at many of its operations this contributed to a 9pc decline in year on year production as high inflation causes an 18pc increase in unit costs and contributes to a 28pc fall in half year profits the company s near term outlook remains highly uncertain however its market value suggests that investors have factored in the prospect of a slowing global economy it also indicates that they have priced in further operational challenges over the next decade anglo expects production to increase by 30pc over a third of this growth is expected to be derived from its quellaveco copper operation in peru which began production last month it fits in with the company s new strategy to focus on commodities that are expected to play a key role in the world s net zero ambitions copper for example is expected to experience a significant supply demand imbalance thanks to a lack of major discoveries over recent years it is used extensively in renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicles key enablers of a net zero future similarly nickel is used in electric vehicle batteries while platinum group metals are used in hydrogen fuel cells and green hydrogen production the relevance of anglo s operations to the world s long term future has been further improved by its exit from thermal coal operations in january its investment in crop nutrients could also help address established trends such as higher demand for food as the global population increases although the business reported a 1bn 844m rise in net debt in its latest half year results released at the end of last month its financial position is sound its net debt to equity ratio is just 14pc which provides scope for greater leverage should it be required it also puts the company in a strong position to overcome an uncertain operational and economic period in the short run indeed the company s new chief executive who was an internal appointment inherits a significant mismatch between its short term and long term prospects
kendari antara agriculture minister syahrul yasin limpo has encouraged the southeast sulawesi provincial government to export rice so that it could generate large profits if the rice production here is good we can export it because the domestic stock is sufficient he said during a working visit to cialam jaya village konda sub district south konawe district on saturday minister yasin limpo and his entourage made a working visit to cialam jaya village accompanied by southeast sulawesi governor ali mazi and south konawe regent surunudin dangga the minister said that the price of rice in indonesia which stands at rp12 000 per kilogram is the second cheapest in the world meanwhile the price of rice in japan has reached rp47 000 the united states rp62 000 singapore rp29 000 malaysia rp22 000 per kilogram the minister said that southeast sulawesi can export rice if the rice production has good quality rice exports can be carried out since the government has sufficient rice stocks and can meet domestic needs for the next two years now our rice stock is 10 2 million tons i hope this amount can meet the needs for two years i will control this stock so we can continue to prepare it for the people he said however before rice is exported he stressed the need for rice processing to improve its quality the quality of rice must be improved so that it becomes premium rice to improve the quality it is necessary to repair water machines machines to whiten rice and others it has a certain economy of scale so this is not detrimental he said meanwhile southeast sulawesi governor ali mazi said food crop commodities especially rice had a surplus since 2019 it is evident that in 2021 the provincial government had sent 1 000 tons of rice to north sulawesi through the state logistics agency this he said shows that southeast sulawesi province can become one of the national food barns especially in the central and eastern regions of indonesia we hope that rice production from southeast sulawesi in the future will not only maintain the availability of regional food but also the availability of national food in facing global challenges such as uncertain climate change and the threat of a food crisis he said

less than three years later however one of the biggest names in venture capital has put us350 million behind neumann s latest attempt to change the way we live last week marc andreessen the netscape co founder who spotted tech hits from airbnb to facebook announced his firm andreessen horowitz would be investing in neumann s new company flow most followers of the wework story were stunned as an entrepreneur presided over a start up where there was lots of promotion and relatively poor execution says roger mcnamee a veteran silicon valley investor the vc firm s investment its largest on record puts a roughly us1 billion valuation on flow a company whose most visible presence is a one page website with a pulsing pastel logo and the words coming 2023 jason calacanis the tech entrepreneur turned investor struggled to keep a straight face when discussing the scale of the bet on his podcast they re not launched he laughed putting his head in his hands but the funding shapes a comeback narrative for neumann that is marked by the same soaring ambition that he brought to wework what he has planned andreessen said in a blog post announcing the investment is nothing short of a direct strike on a crisis at the heart of the world s largest asset class residential property flow profile in an interview with the financial times trailing his plans in march neumann defined that crisis in terms of hard data and human longing advertisement the us is chronically short of homes he said and is not building new ones fast enough between 2018 and 2020 that shortage grew from 2 5 million homes to 3 8 million the chief economist at us government backed mortgage giant freddie mac estimates a recent white house analysis noted that the number of new homes within reach of first time buyers had fallen by 80 per cent since the 1970s the federal reserve s efforts to control inflation by pushing up interest rates are only making affordable housing more scarce as the laws of supply and demand push house prices up faster than salaries neumann said a young cohort he once named the we generation are almost the r generation because they need to rent so neumann spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying rental apartment buildings in cities such as austin miami and nashville whose popularity among that demographic has only grown through the pandemic walking through those buildings he said he saw a tremendous opportunity to make them more uplifting for tenants striving for a better quality of life it felt like there were better ways to operate the buildings and it felt like frankly there s room for more community a similar combination of macroeconomics and morale was on andreessen s mind last week he fretted in his blog post that the nation s most dynamic cities were pricing out talent but he also voiced fears of the loneliness facing people with little interaction with their neighbours only a seismic shift in how the property industry works could solve those problems he argued how flow plans to engineer that shift is not yet known it s also unclear how much property it will own or how andreessen s investment has been structured advertisement andreessen wrote of flow combining community driven experience centric service with the latest technology this would include an app on which tenants could make payments and access amenities and events according to a friend of neumann two of the buildings reportedly bought by neumann point to the options already on offer one in nashville advertises a music room for jam sessions a bark park for pups and valet trash pick up another in fort lauderdale florida lets tenants live the lifestyle deserve with rent by bedroom co living an outdoor cinema and a bumpy lawn art area but andreessen hinted that flow may also have a bigger goal to rethink a decades old rent to own model that is supposed to make it easier for tenants to turn into homeowners but that has been plagued with predatory practices you can pay rent for decades and still own zero equity andreessen observed the fundamental change he thinks is needed in housing would require rethinking the entire value chain from the way buildings are purchased and owned to the way residents interact with their buildings to the way value is distributed among stakeholders other start ups promising to make home ownership more accessible have attracted venture money with landis technologies raising us165 million from sequoia capital jay z s roc nation and others last year crunchbase estimated in april that 17 rental related us companies had raised more than us1 3 billion in venture funding over the previous nine months time to build advertisement even with the promise of a smartphone app a bricks and mortar business like flow might seem an unlikely priority for a venture capitalist such as andreessen in 2011 he wrote an essay entitled why software is eating the world which predicted the triumph of software based insurgents over most industries incumbents but in 2020 he declared it was time to build things like housing schools and hospitals to reboot the american dream with the vc world awash with cash the pressure to find bigger and bigger bets has escalated even as the collapse in tech stocks cast doubts on private company valuations and threatened to choke off the flow of new fundraisings at the end of june us venture capital firms had a record us290 billion available to be invested according to pitchbook up nearly us60 billion from the end of 2021 andreessen horowitz alone has raised a massive us14 1 billion this year for investment vehicles ranging from specialist crypto and biotech funds to more traditional venture and growth funds that is about as much as it raised in the previous seven years combined according to data compiled by crunchbase such numbers make markets as large as residential accommodation more tempting to vcs but the outspoken andreessen who made his name as the inventor of the first web browser while still a university student is known for taking big bets on the boldest ideas advertisement he had already placed a smaller wager on the wework founder earlier this year when his firm led a us70 million fundraising for flowcarbon a separately managed business launched by neumann with his wife rebekah the former actress once described as his strategic thought partner flowcarbon brings carbon credits the environmental permits companies buy to offset their emissions on to the blockchain its first token backed by a bundle of carbon offsets is named the goddess nature token andreessen horowitz appears to have been attracted less by the new age branding than by the size of the financial opportunity the carbon credit market could potentially grow to us50 billion by 2030 and on chain carbon credits can help facilitate this reality enthused arianna simpson one of the firm s general partners announcing its investment lessons learned flow s mission is a heavy lift andreessen admitted this week but he made clear that the size of its ambition is what attracted him only projects with such lofty goals have a chance at changing the world he said and neumann was the only person who had built a paradigm changing global business while upending a similar industry wework expects to make roughly us3 5 billion of revenues this year and cost conscious new managers are trying to end its long run of losses but it has closed welive which only ever opened two outlets and its valuation has fallen below us4 billion advertisement even as more diverse entrepreneurs bemoaned the overwhelming sums of vc funding that still flow to white male founders whatever their past mistakes andreessen was touting the value of past failures we love seeing repeat founders build on past successes by growing from lessons learned he wrote for adam the successes and lessons are plenty andreessen is not alone in betting on neumann pulling off a second act despite his initial mockery calacanis concluded on his podcast that flow had a good chance of succeeding i m guessing four out of five venture capitalists who would hear this pitch from adam neumann at a reasonable valuation would invest he said if you re a founder and you re willing to go big and be audacious it counts for more than your mistakes neumann usually the arch salesman was uncharacteristically quiet last week however that was deliberate according to one person who spoke to him he s saying i ve learned my lesson judge me by my actions financial times

can get items that people care about at the best price possible charley says that means beating the bushes for lower prices on everything from bananas to the plastic wrap used to package prepared foods even as shoppers are trying to save money charley says they still want the ease that comes with pre cut vegetables or market crafted kebabs convenience is king charley says they want it more and

september and december wheat futures on the chicago board of trade cbot used as a reference rate in the global grains market are currently ruling lower than the cereal s price in india after dropping 6 5 per cent last week domestic wheat prices are ruling near record highs even as global prices of the commodity are hovering near a 52 week low usually indian wheat is sold at a discount in the global wheat market including cbot wheat futures according to ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare data the average weighted modal price the rate at which most trades take place was 22 840 a tonne on august 20 also read no plans to import wheat into india govt sources on august 19 cbot september futures ended at 7 55 a bushel 22 160 a tonne while december futures closed at 7 72 22 665 in the global spot market wheat prices are near a year low though they are higher than the indian rate 2 reasons for global fall according to the international grains council europe wheat french grade is 323 a tonne while us soft red winter wheat is quoted at 318 free on board in india wheat is currently available at 24 000 25 000 a tonne for fair average quality globally prices are down since russia has begun to sell wheat said pramod kumar vice president roller flour mills federation of india rfmfi two reasons are attributed to the fall in global wheat prices the first reason is the un brokered deal on july 22 to allow exports of food commodities in the black sea region between ukraine and russia over 5 6 lakh tonnes of grains have moved out since then though wheat shipments are hardly 50 000 tonnes at least 27 ships have left the region with another seven ships being loaded at three ports black sea region wheat is being offered at 385 a tonne cost and freight said kumar fears over recession the second reason is the worldwide sell off by speculators and funds wary of a global recession according to food policy research institute the sell off is a cause for concern as it comes along with a drop in inventories the fall in cbot will not impact indian wheat prices we have to include freight and insurance also if the centre were to allow duty free wheat how long will the window be open it can allow such imports only for a limited period since the next year s crop will be ready by then at the most this can give a limited period of a 50 day window said trade analyst s chandrasekaran following concerns raised by the rfmfi over rising wheat prices food secretary sudhanshu pandey had said the centre is considering all options from lowering wheat import duty to zero from the current 40 per cent to imposing stock declaration orders retail prices up 18 y o y unfortunately nothing has been done so far to control the prices which are rising daily said rfmfi s kumar according to consumer affairs ministry data retail wheat prices are at a record high of 30 72 a kg and atta wheat flour prices are ruling at 35 24 both prices are 18 per cent higher than the same period a year ago wheat prices in the country have soared this year on lower than estimated production due to a heat wave sweeping the country during march april and demand for exports at the beginning of the season after the russian ukraine conflict escalated initially wheat production was estimated at 111 31 mt before it was pruned to 106 34 mt in its fourth advance estimate the agriculture ministry raised the production a tad to 106 84 mt the us department of agriculture has also raised the indian wheat output estimate for this year to 104 mt this month against 99 mt last month bids for tenders trade sources said they suspect the wheat production figures since the cereal was in short supply it could be lower than 100 mt a trader who did not wish to be identified said bids decline no wheat is available with farmers also the centre s decision to replace wheat with rice in the prime minister garib kalyan anna yojana pmgkay in some states is also putting pressure on the cereal said kumar while indian wheat prices are on the rise bids in import tenders floated by some countries have begun to drop said rajesh jain paharia a delhi based exporter last week jordan s ministry of industry and trade mit decided to purchase 60 000 tonnes of wheat from us food major cargill at 385 50 a tonne the wheat will be delivered in the first half of february 2023 he said on july 26 mit finalised another tender buying a similar amount of tender from cargill at 405 75 to be shipped in the second half of december this year during the same time bangladesh finalised a tender that closed on july 14 with the winning bid being 476 38 a tonne if the current trend of global price drop continues domestic wheat will be under pressure since imports will become viable then said chandrasekaran export demand a section of the trade says domestic prices could decline the moment the centre lowers the import duty the situation is in contrast to march april this year when india was expected to export over 10 mt of wheat indian wheat was in demand in view of the ukraine war but the unexpected drop in production resulted in the centre banning the grain s export from may 13 by may 13 india had shipped out over 2 mt of wheat with 1 4 mt being exported in april according to agricultural and processed food products export development authority data 3 33 mt of wheat were exported during april june fetching 8 271 60 crore though the centre banned exports it allowed shipments for which irrevocable letters of credit were opened before the ban was imposed

which semiconductor equipment giant is a better investment applied materials amat 1 05 and asml asml 0 73 are the two largest semiconductor equipment makers in the world applied materials is an american company that provides a wide range of equipment software and services used to manufacture semiconductors display panels and solar products asml is a dutch producer of photolithography systems which are used to etch circuit patterns into silicon wafers it s also the only producer of euv extreme ultraviolet photolithography systems which are required to manufacture the world s smallest and densest chips applied materials and asml don t compete against each other but they ve both profited from the skyrocketing demand for chips worldwide but over the past several months shares of applied materials and asml have both pulled back about 35 from their all time highs those declines were largely caused by concerns about a slowdown in the broader semiconductor market but rising interest rates and other macro headwinds are exacerbating that pressure so should investors take the contrarian view and invest in either linchpin of the semiconductor market today applied materials faces a near term slowdown applied materials suffered a slowdown in 2019 as a cyclical downturn in smartphone sales caused the memory chip market to stall out soft sales of tvs also throttled the growth of its display oriented businesses however its growth subsequently accelerated over the following two years as new 5g phones and oled devices hit the market stay at home trends throughout the pandemic also generated strong tailwinds for the pc data center and smart tv markets as a result applied materials revenue and adjusted earnings grew 18 and 37 respectively in fiscal 2020 which ended in october of the calendar year while its adjusted gross margin expanded from 44 to 45 1 in fiscal 2021 its revenue and adjusted eps rose 34 and 64 respectively as its adjusted gross margin expanded again to 47 5 but in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 applied materials revenue only grew 12 year over year to 19 0 billion its adjusted gross margin fell 40 basis points to 46 8 and its adjusted eps increased just 16 for the full year it expects its revenue and adjusted eps to rise 11 and 3 respectively it blames that deceleration on supply chain constraints instead of a cyclical slowdown and says its backlog continues to grow as the market s demand for its products outstrips its available supply asml faces the same challenges asml also suffered a slowdown in 2019 as it struggled with the same smartphone and memory related headwinds as applied materials but it quickly overcame those challenges as the world s top foundries including tsmc samsung and intel lined up to buy and install new euv systems to manufacture smaller and denser chips as the world s only producer of euv systems which cost about 200 million each and require several planes to ship asml held the golden tickets to winning the process race between those top foundries that monopoly also gave it a lot more pricing power than other equipment makers that s why the past two years were so kind to asml in 2020 asml s revenue rose 18 its gross margin jumped from 44 7 to 48 6 and its eps surged 38 in 2021 its revenue grew 33 its gross margin rose to 52 7 and its eps surged 69 but this year asml expects its revenue to only rise about 10 and for its gross margin to slip to 49 to 50 analysts expect its eps to dip 3 like applied materials asml attributes that slowdown to supply chain constraints instead of softer demand during its latest conference call ceo peter wennink said the market s demand for its systems still significantly exceeds its supply it also didn t alter its long term target of generating 24 billion to 30 billion euros 30 billion in revenue by 2025 which implies its revenue could grow at a compound annual growth rate cagr of up to 13 over the next four years which stock is a better value applied materials and asml face many of the same near term headwinds but they could both recover quickly as the supply chain constraints ease metric period estimated revenue growth fy 2023 estimated eps growth fy 2023 applied materials 7 11 asml 20 33 asml s growth could experience a speedier recovery as it resumes its shipments of current gen euv systems and launches next gen euv for even smaller nodes however asml s forward price to earnings ratio of 42 indicates a lot of that growth has already been priced in applied materials only trades at 13 times forward earnings both of these stocks are good long term investments but i d still pick asml over applied materials for three simple reasons it monopolizes a cornerstone technology of the semiconductor sector its business model is simpler and its growth rates are higher

earnings in the most recent quarter cash strapped shoppers are also opting for more private label products rather than brand named goods and in some cases they re having to get by with smaller package sizes walmart says so far back to school sales have been strong but customers are wary about spending outside the grocery aisle that s forced the retailer to offer deeper discounts on other

this article was originally published in knowable magazine as governments drag their feet in responding to climate change many concerned people are looking for actions that they can take as individuals and eating less meat is an obvious place to start livestock today account for about 14 5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions those numbers are daunting but the situation could grow even worse our appetite for meat is increasing the united nations forecasts that the world will be eating 14 percent more of it by 2030 especially as middle income countries become wealthier that means more demand for pasture and feed crops more deforestation and more climate problems for people alarmed about climate change giving up meat altogether can seem like the only option but is it a growing body of research suggests that the world could in fact raise enough beef pork chicken and other meat to let anyone who wants to eat a modest portion of meat a few times a week and do so sustainably indeed it turns out that a world with some animal agriculture might have a smaller environmental footprint than an entirely vegan world the catch is that hitting the environmental sweet spot would require big changes in the way we raise livestock and for most of us in the wealthy west a diet with considerably less meat than we eat today the future that sounds sustainable to me is one where we have livestock but it s a very different scale says nicole tichenor blackstone a food systems sustainability researcher at tufts university in boston i think the livestock industry s going to have to look different one big reason for meat s outsized environmental impact is that it s more efficient for people to eat plants directly than to feed them to livestock chickens need almost two pounds of feed to produce each pound of weight gain pigs need three to five pounds and cattle need six to 10 and a lot of that weight gain is bones skin and guts not meat as a result about 40 percent of the world s arable land is used to grow animal feed with all the attendant environmental costs related to factors such as deforestation water use fertilizer runoff pesticides and fossil fuel use but it s not inevitable for livestock to compete with people for crops ruminants that is grazing animals with multiple stomachs such as cattle sheep and goats can digest the cellulose in grass straw and other fibrous plant material that humans can t eat converting it into animal protein that we can and two thirds of the world s agricultural lands are grazing lands many of which are too steep arid or marginal to be suitable for crops that land cannot be used for any other food growing purpose other than the use of ruminant livestock says frank mitloehner an animal scientist at uc davis read your diet is cooking the planet of course those grazing lands could revert to natural forest or grassland vegetation taking up atmospheric carbon in the process this carbon capturing regrowth could be a major contributor to global climate mitigation strategies aimed at net zero greenhouse gas emissions researchers say but that s not necessarily incompatible with moderate levels of grazing for example some research suggests that replacing croplands with well managed grazing lands in the southeastern u s could capture far more carbon from the atmosphere although grazing lands also require far more overall area than croplands livestock can also use crop wastes such as the bran and germ left over when wheat is milled to white flour or the soy meal left over after pressing the beans for oil that s a big reason 20 percent of the u s dairy herd is in california s central valley where cows feed partly on wastes from fruits nuts and other specialty crops mitloehner says even pigs and chickens which can t digest cellulose could be fed other wastes such as fallen fruit discarded food scraps and insects which most people wouldn t eat the upshot is that a world entirely without meat would require about one third more cropland and therefore more energy intensive fertilizer pesticides and tractor fuel to feed everyone says hannah van zanten a sustainable food systems researcher at wageningen university in the netherlands but that s only if we re talking about meat raised the right way and in the right amounts livestock also bring other benefits meat provides balanced protein and other nutrients such as iron and vitamin b12 that are more difficult to get from a vegan diet especially for poorer people who can t always afford a variety of fresh vegetables and other nutritious foods says matin qaim an agricultural economist at the university of bonn in germany who co authored a paper in the 2022 annual review of resource economics on the sustainability of meat consumption livestock he notes are a source of wealth for many otherwise poor people in traditional pastoral cultures and on small mixed farms animals that graze widely and then deposit their manure in the farmyard can help concentrate nutrients for use as fertilizer in the family s garden moreover many of the world s natural grasslands have evolved in the presence of grazers which play a key role in ecosystem function where those native grazers the vanished bison from the american prairies for example no longer dominate domestic livestock can fill the same role grasslands are disturbance dependent says sasha gennet a sustainable grazing expert at the nature conservancy most of these systems evolved and adapted with grazing animals and fire they can benefit from good livestock management practices if you re doing it right and you re doing it in the right places you can have good outcomes for conservation for all these reasons some experts say the world is better off with some meat and dairy than it would be with none at all though clearly a sustainable livestock system would have to be much different and smaller than the one we have today but suppose we did it right how much meat could the world eat sustainably the answer most studies suggest may be enough to give meat eaters some hope vaclav smil an interdisciplinary researcher at the university of manitoba got the ball rolling in 2013 with a back of the envelope calculation published in his book should we eat meat let s assume he reasoned that we stop clearing forests for new pastureland let 25 percent of existing pastures revert to forest or other natural vegetation and feed livestock as much as possible on forage crop residues and other leftovers after making those concessions to sustainability smil s best guesstimate was that this rational meat production could yield about two thirds as much meat as the world was producing at the time subsequent studies suggest that the real number might be a bit lower but still enough to promise a significant place for meat on the world s plate even as the population continues to grow if so there are several surprising implications for one thing the total amount of meat or dairy that could be produced in this way depends strongly on what else is on people s plates van zanten says if people eat a healthy whole grain diet for example they leave fewer milling residues than they would on a diet heavy in refined grains so a world full of healthy eaters can support fewer livestock on its leftovers and small choices matter a lot if people get most of their cooking oil from canola for example they leave less nutritious meal for feed after pressing out the oil than if they get their oil from soy a second surprise is the nature of the meat itself sustainability experts typically encourage people to eat less beef and more pork and chicken because the latter are more efficient at converting feed into animal protein but in the livestock on leftovers scenario the amount of pork and chicken that can be raised is limited by the availability of milling residues food scraps and other food wastes in contrast cattle can graze on pastures which shifts the livestock balance back somewhat toward beef mutton and dairy products read here comes the meat tax much would have to change to make such a world possible van zanten notes to maximize the flow of food wastes to pigs and chickens for example cities would need systems for collecting household wastes sterilizing them and processing them for feed some asian countries are well ahead on this already they have this whole infrastructure ready van zanten says in europe we don t and much of our current animal agriculture which is based on grain fed livestock in feedlots would have to be abandoned causing significant economic disruption moreover people in wealthy countries would have to get used to eating less meat than they currently do if no human edible crops were fed to livestock van zanten and her colleagues calculated the world could at the high end produce only enough meat and dairy for everyone to eat about 20 grams of animal protein per day enough for about a three ounce piece of meat or cheese about the size of a deck of cards by comparison the average north american currently chows down on about 70 grams of animal protein a day well above their protein requirement and the average european on 51 that s a hefty reduction in meat but it would bring significant environmental benefits because livestock would no longer eat feed crops the world would need about a quarter less cropland than it uses today that surplus cropland could be allowed to regrow into forest or other natural habitat benefiting both biodiversity and carbon balance there s another dimension to meat s sustainability though the gut microbes that let grazing animals digest grasses and other human inedible forage release methane in the process and methane is a potent greenhouse gas indeed methane from ruminants accounts for about 40 percent of all livestock related greenhouse gas emissions animal scientists are working on ways to reduce the amount of methane produced by grazers at present however it remains a serious problem paradoxically raising cattle on grass better for other dimensions of sustainability makes this problem worse because grass fed cattle grow more slowly grass fed brazilian cattle for example take three to four years to reach slaughter weight compared to 18 months for us cattle finished on grain in feedlots and that s not all because the grain fed animals eat less roughage their microbes also produce less methane each day as a result grass fed cattle often viewed as the greener option actually emit more methane says jason clay the senior vice president of markets for the world wildlife fund u s even so raising livestock on leftovers and marginal grazing lands not suitable for crops eliminates the need to grow feed crops with all their associated emissions and there will be fewer livestock overall as a result greenhouse gas emissions may end up lower than they are today for europe for example van zanten and her colleagues compared expected emissions from livestock raised on leftovers and marginal lands with those from animals fed a conventional grain based diet livestock on leftovers would produce up to 31 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the conventional approach they calculated some sustainability experts also argue that as long as grazing herds aren t increasing methane may be less of a worry than previously thought molecule for molecule methane contributes about 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide does in the short term however co₂ persists in the atmosphere for centuries so newly emitted co₂ always makes the climate crisis worse by adding to the atmosphere s stock of co₂ in contrast methane lasts only a decade or so in the atmosphere if livestock levels remain constant over the span of decades then the rate at which old methane washes out of the atmosphere will be approximately equal to the rate at which new methane is emitted so there would be no additional burden on climate qaim says but with climate experts warning that the world may be fast approaching a climate tipping point some experts say there s good reason to reduce meat consumption well below what s sustainable completely eliminating livestock for example would allow some of the land now devoted to feed crops and pastures to revert to native vegetation over 25 to 30 years of regrowth this would tie up enough atmospheric co₂ to completely offset a decade s worth of global fossil fuel emissions matthew hayek an environmental scientist at new york university and his colleagues reported in 2020 add to that the rapid reduction in methane no longer emitted by livestock and the gains become even more attractive we need to be moving in the opposite direction than we are now hayek says the things that are going to do that are aggressive experimental bold policies not ones that try to marginally reduce meat consumption by 20 or even 50 percent

with inflation near a four decade high american shoppers are watching their pennies and adjusting their spending habits and the businesses that cater to them are taking notice the change in spending is affecting retailers across the country from giants like walmart to the neighborhood supermarket as they look for ways to deliver more affordable products to their customers here are four examples of what businesses across america are seeing and how they are adjusting to the new shopping reality the family supermarket that s offering gas promotions tom charley s family has been selling groceries in the pittsburgh area for four generations through lots of economic ups and downs even his father who ran stores during the high inflation of the 1970s and 80s has never seen a period quite like this it s a challenge for sure there s no doubt about it tom charley says the three charley family shop n save markets have long prided themselves on high quality service with in store butchers and bakeries but today the company s newspaper ads are more likely to highlight discounts on yogurt than premium hand cut steaks we are as focused today as we ve ever been on price and making sure we can get items that people care about at the best price possible charley says that means beating the bushes for lower prices on everything from bananas to the plastic wrap used to package prepared foods even as shoppers are trying to save money charley says they still want the ease that comes with pre cut vegetables or market crafted kebabs convenience is king charley says they want it more and more every day courtesy of tom charley courtesy of tom charley tom charley left and his family run three shop n save supermarkets outside pittsburgh their establishments pride themselves on in store butchers and bakeries but these days their weekly newspaper ads are more likely to feature discount items than high end steaks that s labor intensive for the supermarkets which employ more than 200 people but they still have to be cost competitive especially now when grocery prices have been climbingat a double digit annual rate we ve never said we re going to be the cheapest charley says and we ve also never said we re going to be the whole foods of the market charley s supermarkets get a lot of mileage from offering a discount at the gas station through a promotional tie in with sunoco customers save 10 cents a gallon on gasoline for every 50 they spend on groceries our customers love that promotion charley says everyone i know that shops in my store uses it cheaper train sets and hunting for used models the smoke stack hobby shop in lancaster ohio sells train sets radio controlled cars and model airplanes sales boomed early in the pandemic when many people were looking for ways to entertain themselves at home but some of the most elaborate model kits priced at 70 or more are now out of reach for some customers once you hit past the 50 mark somebody has to think long and hard about buying a kit like that says patti riordan who runs the store with her husband don so we re still going to get some of those high end ones but it s definitely going to be a lot less instead riordan is stocking more mid priced models which sell for around 35 and a growing share of her sales now comes from used items that another hobbyist has sold or traded in we buy a lot of collections so people can buy a model kit or some rolling stock for their train layout at a fraction of the cost of new riordan says and that s been a big sustainer for folks this year don riordan courtesy of patti riordan courtesy of patti riordan patti riordan runs the smoke stack hobby shop in lancaster ohio with her husband don the store has scaled back its selection of higher priced models to focus on more affordable items as well as second hand merchandise riordan says while finding and pricing used hobby items is a lot of work it s gratifying when old railroad cars or other items find new owners it s a nice way to recycle that stuff riordan says it really allows a lot more flexibility to keep the shop going and that i think gives us the strength to weather through some of these things ice cream at smaller portions and lower prices victor garcia runs a mexican style ice cream company in the fort worth area that specializes in flavors like mango tres leches and tequila our whole mission is to make people happy by sharing a piece of our mexican culture he says this summer garcia noticed some customers at his soldias stores were downsizing their orders perhaps buying just one item instead of two the average transaction dropped from 13 50 to about 12 25 that kind of was the first indicator that maybe a recession is coming garcia says and we do have to be a little more flexible with our budget conscious consumers courtesy of victor garcia courtesy of victor garcia customers at the soldias ice cream shops in the dallas fort worth area began dialing back their purchases this summer sometimes buying one item instead of two the company has started offering smaller portions to keep prices affordable garcia has started offering smaller portion sizes at lower prices he s also hunting for cheaper paper suppliers and exploring whether he could cut costs by moving more of the ice cream manufacturing process in house at the end of the day what we don t want is customers saying that place is outside of our budget garcia said it s up to us as the businesses to really listen and pivot and give the customer the experience they want more hot dog sales fewer deli meats at walmart walmart reported a drop in quarterly earningsthis past week saying cash strapped shoppers have been trading down and filling their shopping carts with less expensive items as they ve grown more sensitive to rising food prices as an example instead of deli meats at higher price points customers are increasing purchases of hot dogs as well as canned tuna or chicken says chief financial officer

thembi machaba didn t expect to find a high level of competition for workers as she tried to staff freshpet kitchens the pet food manufacturer in hanover township northampton county when i first moved to this role i didn t ever think that it would be as explosive in terms of labor movement in general said the senior vice president for human resources at freshpet i kind of thought it would be a steady flow of traffic in and out but nothing to the degree that i think i ve seen and i know i m not the only one i speak to my peers in the lehigh valley she said it s definitely been quite an interesting journey for anybody who s in hr obviously some of it s been exaggerated by the pandemic but the competition that s coming in the companies that are moving into this area certainly makes it a lot more complex and challenging in terms of trying to retain labor in general it s a good time to be a worker in the lehigh valley if you re looking for a new job or to advance your career there are companies in the region that want to talk to you thembi machaba senior vice president of human resources for freshpet kitchens in her office in hanover township northampton county according to the latest employment statistics more people are working in the valley than before the covid 19 pandemic and there are also a large number of job openings unemployment rates are lower than in late 2019 or early 2020 and businesses are finding themselves competing even harder for workers nationally the u s labor department says job openings were at 10 7 million in june while it is the lowest number since september they are still at an historically high level having never exceeded 8 million in a month prior to a year ago tim mcdonough branch manager for shipping supply company uline is looking to hire 125 more workers for the company s warehouse and 15 customer service workers for its 1 6 million square foot facility in upper macungie township he s confident his company s perks will help expand its workforce of more than 1 100 in the valley tim mcdonough branch manager for shipping supply company uline is looking to hire 125 more workers for the company s warehouse and 15 customer service workers for its 1 6 million square foot facility in upper macungie township he s confident his company s perks will help expand its workforce of more than 1 100 in the valley the competition is as tight as it has been since we ve competed in this marketplace among the home depots amazon and others and we can be very competitive in terms of compensation said mcdonough who has been with uline in the valley since 2004 very competitive with the flexible work schedules very competitive with ability to grow within the organization and develop within the organization yeah we re happy to be competing in the lehigh valley market don cunningham president and ceo of the lehigh valley economic development corp said his organization adjusted its marketing strategy toward recruiting individual workers rather than companies we ve shifted 90 of our marketing now to the attraction of people cunningham said it s away from just being around the tracking companies now we re trying to attract talent through marketing of quality of life and what s going on in the cities and the downtowns and that s not an immediate fix but long term having people either migrate from other parts of the u s or emigrate from other countries into the market is a key part of how you meet this gap the numbers according to the state department of labor industry the allentown bethlehem easton metropolitan statistical area had 384 900 seasonally adjusted nonfarm jobs in june compared to just over 380 000 in february 2020 the unemployment rate for the area which includes carbon county and warren county new jersey was 4 3 in june compared to 4 5 in february 2020 broken down lehigh county s unemployment rate was 4 7 and northampton s was 4 3 in june the rates in february 2020 just before the pandemic were 4 9 and 5 respectively nationally the unemployment rate for july was 3 5 matching the february 2020 number the u s added 528 000 jobs in july which restored all the jobs lost during the pandemic we ve had full recovery from what was lost during the pandemic although the recovery was not equal across all sectors cunningham said we ve got the total number of jobs fully recovered cunningham said there s been movement with a combination that includes baby boomers retiring and companies searching for replacements and workers of all generations seeking better opportunities what has been coming for some time in the u s is the continued retirement of the baby boomer generation and it s starting to get into gen x cunningham said so you ve got to expand job creation with the ongoing retirement of a large population base so that s where you get the delta of where unemployment is low and companies are still looking for people because of that wages are going up particularly in the entry level area where you ve got almost 9 growth of average wages since before the pandemic which is pretty significant so employers are paying more for particularly entry level talent and service sector and industrial workers wages overall have increased about 4 5 additionally jobs are being filled in the lehigh valley by commuters from neighboring counties cunningham said workers interview for positions at uline in upper macungie township the shipping supply company is expanding its operations in a competitive market attracting workers freshpet s machaba said her company has made it a priority to retain the workers it brings in obviously we re growing at accelerated rates and so we try to keep up with our own growth she said but it s really hard to do that when people are leaving out the back door at the end of last year we certainly recognized that we have to be competitive in terms of our wages too to retain workers the company has implemented its freshpet university program that gives employees a career path to follow new employees begin at 21 per hour with a chance to rise to 27 after 18 months it s a program that ceo billy cyr says gives freshpet higher skilled workers a good wage rather than lower skilled employees being paid less other perks include shares of company stock which cyr says gives workers a sense of ownership and a chance to build wealth along with more typical ones such as free refreshments and pet food to take home if we are going to get on top of the retention we probably are looking for a different type of person than we had historically been recruiting in the past machaba said we were kind of pulling in people we would screen them intensively but we were really quite comfortable with bringing in your average joe but now we re saying ok we know that we can t always compete on wages we know that we need to increase our wages we were prepared to pay for a higher level one to improve productivity but the second part of that would be that these people are growing in their careers and there s less likelihood that they re going to just turn around tomorrow and walk out the back door uline s mcdonough said his company is looking for workers who will stay hire to retire the focus he says is to develop and a team that s here for years years and years he points out that his management staff has been around for most of his 22 years at the branch communication is key for retention uline has been resuming regular meetings and programs for workers that were curtailed by the pandemic we turn on those weekly meetings with departments monthly meetings with the warehouse regular engagement activities lunch and learns things like that he said things that maybe other companies don t do or don t do as frequently we turn those switches back on 100 and i think it says particularly over the last 12 months that it has served us well keeping workers the society for human resource management recently cited a survey from wtw a global advisory company that says employers across the u s are continuing to make changes to work and reward programs as they continue to fight for new hires the survey found that 66 of respondents have increased hiring activity since the beginning of the year but 71 are having difficulty attracting and retaining employees with digital skills and 66 can t keep professional employees and 61 are having difficulty hiring and keeping hourly employees among u s employers wtw found that about 80 are hiring at the higher end of the salary range and offering signing bonuses about 65 are using retaining bonuses to keep employees with the vast majority going to managers a majority are increasing training opportunities workers are definitely catching up in terms of wages benefits and things like signing bonuses or tuition reimbursements cunningham said the other thing you re going to continue to see is companies investing a lot more in technology and trying to automate more functions and use fewer people cunningham said increased use of technology is not just for industrial work people always think that will only happen in an industrial setting but it also has been an office setting cunningham said banks have minimized back office employment through the use of technology it s an issue that won t be going away anytime soon there just aren t enough numbers in the pipeline cunningham said companies are going to have to find ways to innovate and get some work done with machines or technology because they ve reached some point where they re just not enough

it s proof of popularity that the german footwear brand birkenstock never wanted in the fight against fakes the shoemaker has been sending teams of undercover investigators with hidden cameras into what they say are counterfeiting factories birkenstock s ceo oliver reichert is aggressive we don t just punish the marketplaces or the resellers we really go to the factories turkey philippines china wherever sounds like you re running special ops said correspondent seth doane yes but that s necessary birkenstock has sent investigators with hidden cameras to track down counterfeiters creating fake sandals birkenstock his unconventional approach is clear at their munich headquarters doane said you were sitting at your desk listening at times blasting music it s not what you d expect from a ceo probably i m not the average ceo reichert said i never tried to be average in anything and birkenstock has proved it s not average either if you haven t noticed birkenstocks are everywhere revealing the toes or yes socks of not just the most unfashionable among us but models and celebrities too it s undeniable that birkenstock is having a moment nearly 250 years in the making and birks have come a long way from their days as a hippie staple sales of birkenstock sandals have more than quadrupled over the past decade cbs news since he took over this formerly family run business in 2009 reichert has tried to inject a startup energy if you have such a tradition and such a history the threat is to wake up in your own museum he said and i don t want to have this he s ruthless regarding brand collaboration requests they get plenty eight out of ten we say no they said yes to dior and are now producing a felt covered shoe doane asked how much is this not enough i would say reichert replied it s retailing for over 1 000 it s about supporting the idea behind the product and not harming the dna of either brand he said it s like a marriage you know and there s luxury shoemaker manolo blahnik known for his coveted stilettos blahnik an avid birkenstock customer is now a collaborator birkenstock has entered into partnerships with designers dior and manolo blahnik cbs news doane said you think of manolo blahnik in sex and the city and sarah jessica parker yeah yeah but she s wearing birkenstocks as well even in the private life said reichert when you see some celebrity pictured with birkenstocks what do you think i m proud that they re wearing birkenstocks and i know and this makes me even prouder they buy for it you don t give them to some famous person no we don t have a hollywood office or something like this and if some celebrity says hey i ll wear this shoe you won t send them a shoe why come on if they send me money i will send them a shoe reichert said it s a glamorous twist for a company that traces its roots back to a cobbler in central germany in 1774 in the late 1800s a descendant konrad birkenstock began making and selling flexible insoles for decades that humble footbed was the family business reichert said in the sixties carl birkenstock was somehow frustrated that ok we make the best insole in the world but nobody sees our product so he decided to try to bring the footbed out of the shoes and that s the birthday of the sandal cbs news but the shoe stores in america didn t want the product said doane it was the ugly shoe you know they say oh ok are you crazy ugly perhaps and for a time uncool but in just the past decade birkenstock reports sales have more than quadrupled with the most popular model being the arizona then covid provided another unexpected boost unfortunately we became the number one home office shoe reichert said online demand was crazy so why do you say unfortunately it s painful to have no sales but it s very painful to have too much sales trying to manage this global demand it s challenging doane saw that at one of their factories in the east of germany where they were racing to fill a backlog of nearly a million pairs managing director hilmar knoll juggles the logistics we have here stock only for ten days he said we re always at the limit of our capacity daily they produce 80 000 footbeds which all start as a mix of cork from portugal their secret recipe of jute cork latex and leather is heated then squeezed into molds birkenstock footbeds being produced at their german factory cbs news birkenstock still makes all its shoes in germany and is fiercely protective of that quality as part of its effort to crack down on counterfeiters it stopped selling on amazon citing the number of fakes being sold how hard was that for us nothing said reichert well it s a huge outlet said doane maybe but not a good one i think at the beginning amazon was a pioneer in online trading you have to kill monsters when they are small they re getting too big you can t kill them okay they will eat you and we decided to kill our monsters early in a statement amazon told sunday morning fewer than 0 01 of all products sold on amazon received a counterfeit complaint from customers and we won t rest until that number is zero the robust market for fakes reinforces as if anyone needed a reminder just how popular these sandals are whatever the reason even the people who hate the brand wear them because they are good said reichert it s like you know do you like taking medicine no it helps so you swallow it doane said you seem almost proud that some people don t like your product it s a proof of concept it doesn t matter for us because once you get the product you will wear this and you re buy it so you know one day we ll get you for more info story produced by mikaela bufano editor brian robbins

alternative propulsion testbed to mainstream crossover the badge has got around over the past 70 years photo by dodge article content this week the automotive sphere was abuzz with the news about dodge s new hornet crossover swarms of opinions of all stripes have been flying around like an angry nest had just been disturbed some of those comments were barbed and poisonous while others merely

worst than the ford maverick nameplate being attached to a little car based truck these days here s a look at a little hornet history doc stock car photo by kelly marsh for the times herald record usa today via reuters weirdly even kids will be able to identify the first hornet thanks to a little ol movie franchise from pixar ka chow the cars movie made the hudson hornet a star with a dusty but wise blue coupe called doc hudson voiced by the late paul newman himself a bona fide racing talent doc hudson helped teach the basics of racing to the brash lightning mcqueen in reality the hudson hornet had genuine racing pedigree hudson was a detroit based company founded in 1909 and initially known for manufacturing the sort of model t ish looking jalopies you re probably picturing in your head after the second world war the company launched the then innovative step down body which was pretty much what it sounded like instead of climbing up into a box mounted on a frame passengers opened the door and stepped into a compartment surrounded by a frame it was still body on frame construction but of a kind that would still be used in something like ford crown victoria cop cars in the 90s compared to the older style of vehicles the new hudsons were safer and more comfortable but they also handled much better in 1951 hudson introduced a new more powerful version of their inline six engine and called the car the hornet the 5 0l engine eventually made 170 hp and had oodles of low end grunt advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your

becoming popular at the time and the hornet would prove to be nearly unbeatable in every year of production 1951 to 1954 the hudson hornet was a winner at the track florida born driver marshall teague dominated the racing scene with a pair of cars painted with the fabulous hudson hornet down their sides however in 1954 hudson merged with nash kelvinator a combination car refrigerator company yes really the hornet would continue but not as a true hudson more a rebadged nash product the racing days were over built to beat the maverick a few gremlins emerge the hornet nameplate took a nap for most of the 1960s but by the time the 1970s rolled around it was back and ready to party and by party we mean save fuel and be affordable real fun stuff advertisement 5 story continues below this

surprisingly not bad it was slightly larger than some of the other compact offerings at the time and the standard 3 3l inline six was a bit less thirsty than the competition s engines photo by getty amc was so pleased with the reception to the hornet that it turned it into the gremlin today the gremlin is a bit of a punchline but at the time it was fun and quirky and not as horrible as everyone remembers amc would squeeze every ounce out of the hornet s metaphorical toothpaste tube eventually using the platform to develop the four wheel drive amc eagle and amc would also give the hornet a bit of a sting in its tail a 5 0l v8 engine provided a bit of muscle for a performance version and the car even achieved a bit of stardom in 1974 s the man with the golden gun roger moore as james bond steals an amc hornet from a showroom and executes a highly technical barrel roll jump with it a complex and impressive stunt almost completely undermined by the idiotic idea to play a slide

internet reacts to the 2022 ford maverick tones of tonale the internet reacts to the new 2023 dodge hornet perhaps more relevant to the hornet as it is reborn today amc used the 1970s hornet as a testbed for all sorts of alternative propulsion a gas turbine engined hornet was tested out in new york in 1973 and later in the 70s california s air research board used hybrid converted hornets to test that technology out there was even an experimental full electric powertrain hornet called the electrosport this last actually worked after a fashion with a range of several hundred kilometres regrettably it was also unbelievably slow and cost six times as much as a normal hornet advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content by 1977 the hornet had run its course and disappeared into history even as amc leveraged the platform to create other products it would next emerge as a largely imaginary product we nearly got a supercharged nissan versa chrysler acquired amc in 1987 and along with that takeover came the rights to use the hornet badge the company immediately didn t choosing instead to sell its own compact cars up went the hornet on a shelf somewhere to be dusted off after everyone finished panicking about the y2k bug but dusted off it was seeking to make an entry into the european market dodge launched the hornet concept at the 2006 geneva motor show it was even more of a toaster on wheels than the kia soul turned out to be but given that the kia soul was actually a success perhaps dodge was on to something here advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content photo by stellantis fitted with rear opening rear doors like a mazda mx 30 and seats that folded completely flat the hornet looks incredibly cool in retrospect the engine was a 1 6l supercharged four cylinder of the same kind as found in bmw built minis however dodge was only going to maybe build the engines in cooperation with bmw mini the idea was to find a shared platform with another manufacturer and a couple of years after the concept came out it looked like the unlikely co host would be nissan with its versa later a tie up with fiat nixed that plan and eventually the hornet idea gave way to the ill fated dart sedan today the modern hornet shares its platform with the alfa romeo tonale and will be built in italy in the context of the nameplate s whole story the hornet being a crossover with available plug in power and a sporting glh trim makes more sense yes the hudson hornet is a distant ancestor but this car is more related to the compact competitor and experimental powertrain machine of the 1970s and that car as an amc product was a success dodge could have a similar hit on its hands with this all new hornet share this article in your social network brendan mcaleer summary contributor driving ca 15 year

seventy five basis point bps increase of its target rate powell noted that while another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting that is a decision that will depend on the

many people are in crisis because they cannot find an affordable decent place to live most of them may have a shelter over their heads but paying for it so drains their resources that other bills go unpaid needs like healthcare get set aside and the means to save for a better life is blocked these people most working but not earning enough to make ends meet often settle for substandard housing in crowded neighborhoods last sunday the day published the first stories in what will be a year long project to document this crisis of insufficient affordable housing examine the causes and look at solutions the newspaper calls the series the housing solutions lab as the initial stories show this is an extremely complex problem driven by numerous factors but one contributing cause is straightforward it is selfishness defined in my merriam webster s dictionary as concern with one s own welfare or advantage in disregard for others selfishness is what primarily drives the strong opposition in our more affluent suburban communities to steps that would chip away at the problem amending zoning rules to allow small lot development in some sections providing more opportunities and incentives for multifamily construction or even encouraging a return of duplexes could enlarge the stock of housing that is affordable for working people on the lower echelons of the pay scale in my many years of reporting and later as an opinion editor and writer i was always taken aback by the fervent opposition development plans often faced proposals for apartment buildings with affordable units met with cries about increased traffic noise and more kids in the school system they still do zoning proposals to allow multifamily units or smaller building lots face lamentations that that they will lower property values and destroy a town s quality of life i have heard warnings that water supplies will be taxed aquifers threatened and wailings that trees will be removed from mother earth that is if such proposals even surface few do because the prospects for success are so slim and the opposition so apparent often largely absent from these debates is the reality that the working people serving these communities need places to live the developer seeking the zone change or tax incentive may make the point but it can come across as self serving depending on the nature of the project an affordable housing advocate may testify but the dominant voice typically comes from the opposition often well financed enough to hire an attorney to find any means necessary to block the proposal the legislature has tried to address the issue with legislation that allows a developer to sue a town if the developer can demonstrate the community has a lack of affordable housing yet is using local land use rules to stop his plans to build some despite the law a town can block such a project in court by showing it will create a risk to public health or safety if it moves forward this approach places a heavy burden on the developer while creating added legal expenses it assures lengthy delays sometimes years long and it is not hard for a good opposition attorney to produce evidence of public health and safety issues since its implementation in 1990 the law has shown only modest success creating an estimated 8 500 units of affordable housing that rate of development is not going to address the crisis i grew up in a two family tenement in providence my dad bought it to provide an affordable place for us to live i had two brothers and to provide an apartment upstairs for my grandmother who was a widow it was a neighborhood filled with working people my dad was a firefighter mom a receptionist and clerical worker a police officer and his sizable family lived across the street there were small business owners teachers factory government and retail workers but also lawyers and doctors the houses of the latter were often nicer the cars sometimes cadillacs instead of fords or chevys but it all added up to community while ethnically diverse it was not racially so now we have far greater economic segregation while racial integration remains largely non existent in many of our communities despite legislation that long ago outlawed discrimination in housing my wife kathy and i bought our home in jewett city in 1985 a densely developed working class borough in the town of griswold it was affordable on my modest reporter s salary kathy worked various part time jobs and sometimes stayed home full time as we raised three sons now all launched she settled in as a librarian at our local slater library a couple of decades back we still live there in the 1990s a senior apartment complex was built adjacent to our property more recently a large apartment complex featuring townhouses was built just down the street the developer continues to add townhouses as far as i know no great opposition surfaced to oppose these projects i was not inclined to do so is there more traffic probably but i have never bothered to count cars while seated on my porch nor thought of hiring someone to do so people need a place to live you cannot legislate changes in attitude and elected leaders representing connecticut suburbia and the state s rural communities are unlikely to back tougher measures to force acceptance of affordable housing not when their constituents don t want it needed is a change of hearts and minds the situation can improve if people view the folks who would populate these proposed developments as fellow citizens in pursuit of their own american dreams rather than as invaders out to sully their quality of life paul choiniere is the former editorial page editor of the day now retired he can be reached at p choiniere yahoo com

the army tactical brassiere will be presented to the army uniform board for approval in the fall u s army combat capabilities development command solider center for almost a year army leaders have been creating an officially sanctioned military uniform bra for female soldiers members of the army uniform board will review the final options in the fall and decide which to add to the uniform the goal is for the army tactical brassiere atb to be as supportive as possible for servicewomen and enhance military readiness this marks a major change for the military until now female service members have purchased bras for themselves crucially it also reflects a change in how military leaders perceive female soldiers in 1957 military women s bras exploded into the news because of what they meant for female soldiers appearances at the time military regulations governed all aspects of outward appearances for female soldiers from makeup application and hair care to how much food to eat military leaders expected servicewomen to look like the first ladies of the land as one early 1950s recruiting ad proclaimed while change has come gradually and vestiges of this thinking still affect the military development of the atb with its focus on best equipping female soldiers to do their jobs indicates that the military is making important efforts to move toward equity in 1948 the women s armed services integration act granted women permanent positions in all military branches after world war ii ended servicewomen filled military roles around the world in american occupation zones the u s occupation of japan ended in 1952 but american troops remained in the country including a group from the women s army corps wac the appearances of soldiers in the wac mattered to military officials they commissioned fashion designer hattie carnegie to design wac uniforms during world war ii elizabeth arden developed a lipstick color montezuma red made to match the trim on the marine corps women s reserve uniforms advertising materials routinely portrayed servicewomen as well dressed young women in tailored smart uniforms even so the supporting items beneath the uniform remained a secret until 1957 that fall lt jeane wolcott arrived to take over command of the 96 member wac detachment in yokohama while inspecting her unit wolcott discovered that a staggering 95 of the 96 women did not have as polished a feminine appearance as regulations demanded wolcott told the women to be better prepared for their next inspection she recommended the women shop around for shapewear including girdles shoulder padding and falsies better known today as push up bras it s unclear how news of wolcott s disappointment spread although it might have come from the women in the unit themselves but the associated press picked up the story it appeared in newspapers around the world shape up in falsies army orders girls read the london daily sketch headline wolcott doubled down telling the new york journal american some of the young ladies who are not too gifted in some ways were told they could make improvements for women who were beginning to bulge a bit wolcott suggested girdles for those who weren t well endowed causing their uniform to dip in front of the shoulders wolcott suggested padding at the shoulders or falsies but because the army did not issue servicewomen girdles or bras wolcott could not order the women to comply she promised there would be no disciplinary action taken against those whose appearance did not improve but some of the women expressed dismay at her verdict nonetheless one servicewoman contacted her congressman to complain within a week a male commander came to inspect the women he and wolcott believed the women looked better in this inspection although wolcott said she had sent some women for medical attention so they could be placed on a diet in her view women needed to look feminine and when they did not that needed to be fixed wolcott explained that she wanted her women to be women her view reflected military leaders prevailing views on female soldiers at the time since world war ii military leaders had worried over the possibility of lesbianism in the women s services to combat these fears officials linked femininity and women s military service assuming that women who looked and acted like women were also heterosexual in the aftermath of wolcott s caustic evaluation the women found support not just from the male commanding officer who inspected them next but also from new york bra manufacturer martin schur he telegrammed wolcott your order to shape up interesting but difficult also falsies old fashioned instead the manufacturer would send the unit 100 bras to uphold and uplift best traditions of the army the battle of the bulge as one editorial cartoonist named it exposed tensions over the expectations for women s appearances while some wacs reportedly scurried to purchase undergarments as wolcott recommended many did not appreciate being reduced to physical specimens of femininity on the other hand the incident reinforced for some like san francisco chronicle columnist and editor abe mellinkoff that women did not belong in defense roles in a piece with the headline support urged for strategic areas mellinkoff argued that wolcott s requests were evidence that women did not belong in the military he reminded readers that wolcott could not enforce her suggestions because the military did not stock falsies as a matter of fact he wrote the army cannot issue falsies because no training manual has been written on their proper use under various combat conditions because army manuals tended to run a couple of wars behind the times mellinkoff speculated that the military might get falsies at least by the time they get the intercontinental ballistics missile he was off on his calculations by more than half a century icbms debuted in 1959 yet while an army bra took another 60 plus years women began serving in greater numbers in the ensuing decades but even as their numbers increased equal treatment came slowly to the military through the 1970s military leaders carefully shaped women s defense roles to make the idea of women in uniform acceptable to the american public regulations required parents to sign off on women s enlistment if they were under the age of 21 rank limitations ensured few servicewomen until the late 1960s would advance to high ranks in part to ensure that women would not command men women could marry while in service but motherhood meant dismissal from the armed forces military service offered women unique career opportunities yet constrained their roles at the same time in theory women were equal partners in defense in reality these limitations and the emphasis on servicewomen s femininity set women apart a decade after wolcott s lecture to her troops wacs serving in vietnam expressed similar concerns to those aired by the soldiers she objectified asking their superiors whether they were there to do a job or to look nice sexism sexual harassment and sexual assault remained problems in the military even as women played an increasingly large role in american defense in 2015 the military finally eliminated gender based combat restrictions in the years since servicewomen have achieved firsts across the armed forces as they began to qualify for roles previously only open to men yet this process has not been easy today women achieve their positions based on their physical and mental capabilities but even these changes did not purge sexism and gender based discrimination from the military this is a key legacy of the early cold war and the ideas preached by leaders like wolcott the development of the atb is part of a larger movement to better understand what military personnel need to do their jobs well uniforms are more than just the outer layers that most people see bras in particular are increasingly understood as an important functional part of women s clothing in 2021 women on the british olympic team got bras designed for them individually based on research about how proper bras best support women athletes the atb prototypes are no different in concept and their designers are focused on comfort and performance in 1957 the yokohama battle of the bulge focused on bras as something that would help keep servicewomen looking good today military leaders attention to servicewomen s undergarments reflects a new focus on making sure all members of the nation s defense team are ready it s a recognition that readiness can look different for men and women even while acknowledging that gender should not be the main determinant of a service member s role tanya l roth is the author of her

the excise tax on stock buybacks in president biden s climate health and tax plan is lower than previous proposals and far from the ban on buybacks some democrats have sought trillions of dollars in buybacks have flowed through the capital markets in recent years and have helped to offset dilutive measures like equity compensation in stock shares issued for m a and capital raises congress acknowledged the importance of buybacks to offset the dilution from new shares in the legislation but the 1 tax may not be the final move in this battle over how corporations currently sitting on 8 trillion in cash use it former securities and exchange commission chairman jay clayton isn t a fan of the new 1 tax on stock buybacks it is a tax on shareholders clayton recently told cnbc if so shareholders haven t shown the same level of concern as the former sec chairman while stocks did post their first weekly loss in five weeks last week the recent market rally had continued right through the announcement that the 1 tax on buybacks had made it into president biden s inflation reduction act the tax is half the 2 tax on buybacks that congress had sought in the previous attempt to pass the legislation and a far cry from legislation proposed by some senate democrats in recent years to ban the use of buybacks get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters when the 2 tax was being considered many chief financial officers on the cnbc cfo council surveyed by cnbc indicated the tax would influence their decision making over half 55 of u s cfos said a 2 stock buyback tax would cause their company to buy back less of their own shares while 40 of u s cfos said that such a tax would have no impact on their buyback plans for clayton altering the mindset of cfos on use of buybacks gets to the more fundamental issue of how the u s capital markets work in his view the tax goes against the idea of the free flow of capital which has always been one of the biggest advantages for the u s economic system capital going to new things new ideas is what has kept america the leading place in the world to raise capital he said setting the tax against this concept has clayton worried i m always worried about anything that puts grit in the flow of capital he said one thing is clear the ease of using buybacks over the past decade has become core to the flow of capital for corporations any change therefore has the potential to be significant many features of the capital markets have arisen in the context of share repurchases being easy to do said jesse fried an expert on buybacks at harvard law school buybacks by taking shares out of the total share count serve as a complement to equity compensation paid in stock shares used for m a and shares issued to raise capital all of those actions are dilutive to existing shareholders and buybacks can offset that effect that s one of the reasons that the new legislation allows companies to reduce their buyback tax in relation to the number of shares bought back for specific business purposes bruce dravis past chair of the american bar association s corporate governance committee studied 1 23 trillion of buybacks in 60 fortune 100 companies over ten years post financial crisis his research shows that on average equity compensation absent buybacks would have increased share count to dilute shareholders by 7 6 from the base year the dollar value of buybacks used to offset equity compensation dilution compensation buybacks constituted 36 9 of all buybacks just over one third pure play buybacks buybacks that reduced share count beyond offsetting equity compensation represented 63 1 of all buyback spending the opposing camps are firm in their positions either buybacks are bad all of the time or taxes are always bad but dravis wrote in an email that he thinks congress has done a reasonable job in recognizing the anti dilutive offset that buybacks have come to serve in the market a 1 excise tax on pure play buybacks during a company s tax year excluding compensation buybacks as well as certain other share issuances says to dravis that congress seems to have navigated nicely between both camps with the ira when taking all of the fees associated with buybacks into account he isn t even sure that a 1 excise tax would affect the willingness of companies to do pure play buybacks companies that authorize a pool of dollars for buybacks can t pinpoint the exact number of shares they will repurchase market volatility financing fees or professional fees could eat up 1 or more of that cash even without a 1 excise tax and the dollars devoted to buybacks nonetheless run to hundreds of billions annually he wrote but fried is worried about the future he is not a defender of all buybacks used for insider trading and by managers to boost bonuses by gaming earnings metrics there are significant flaws he said but those flaws can be addressed by regulations from bodies like the sec rather than a tax with the tax now in place he suspects it will only increase in the future that s because fried is troubled by a view among senate democrats that holds corporations are wasting cash on buybacks that could be spent on better investments there is eight trillion dollars on the balance sheets of american corporations he said and he added that amount has increased by several trillions of dollars in recent years amid record buybacks they don t have a lack of cash they have too much cash fried said which leads him to see the risk of companies overinvesting as a result of efforts to reduce capital flows to buybacks as being as prominent as the risk from buybacks neither overinvestment or hoarding of cash is good for shareholders he said leading senate dems have over the last five years introduced about ten bills to substantially restrict or even eliminate buybacks fried said they seem to think buybacks are an important source of problems in the american economy given that mindset when a democratically controlled white house and congress is ready to raise taxes again and assuming dems have power they will likely use this buyback tax to incrementally raise revenue the more the buyback tax grows the more fried thinks companies would end up becoming even more bloated with cash in the short term fried says the immediate problem with the buyback tax is one of timing while the new legislation includes an offset for buybacks with a specific business purposes companies don t always time their dilutive share offers and anti dilutive buybacks in the same tax year equity compensation is one example repurchases and issuances connected to the equity pay cycle don t always take place in the same year fried said in fact it can be hard to make sure these complementary measures line up because the compensation side of it depends on when employees decide to exercise their right to buy restricted units and options if they aren t doing so already companies will need to stay on top of shares going out within a tax year to make sure they take can manage the new tax and achieve as much of the offset as they can but there s a catch cfos may not want to buy back shares when their stock price is high and that s when employees are most likely to want to exercise their right to acquire shares inability to manage this timing element could lead companies to reduce the use of equity pay which would in turn potentially reduce the use of buybacks fried said companies might pursue additional financing options such as issuing synthetic stock to employees and there could even at least theoretically be tax benefits of the new congressional approach with a decision to issue shares for business purposes like equity compensation potentially serving as a tax subsidy of 1 against buybacks there s also been speculation this will end up being a boom year for buybacks as companies rush to get ahead of the legislation becoming effective and it is already a record period for buybacks in the last 12 months ending in june corporate buybacks have been strong nearing a record 1 trillion according to s p global that is almost twice the 547 billion corporations returned to shareholders as dividends in the last 12 months for companies that have predominantly bought back stock purely to reduce share count and increase earnings per share without any business offset on the side of issuing capital 2022 should be the year for more buybacks fried said but for the many companies that have used buybacks in the context of offsetting dilutive share issuances he says we can t know what the specific effects of 1 buyback tax will be what we do know though is this it s unlikely you can impose a tax and have no effect on behavior fried said many companies issue equity in the same year they repurchase tax which will reduce or eliminate the tax but many companies repurchases exceed issuance and there will be tax on that delta he said largest total buybacks last 12 months apple 91 3 billion alphabet 54 5 billion meta 53 2 billion microsoft 32 7 billion bank of america 21 billion

fifty years ago in early august 1972 president idi amin summarily decreed the expulsion of uganda s asian that is indian and pakistani community over 50 000 people were given a scant three months to tie up their affairs and leave the country there was a scramble to secure new homes for people rendered stateless by the amin decree for months european and american media carried reports that dramatised the human misery of uganda s asians all the attention paid to the plight of the asian community has made it hard to see the much wider much more violent history of amin s economic programme it was africans not asians who were the targets of this larger campaign amin called it the war of economic independence later it was named the economic war over the past decade i ve been working with ugandan colleagues to organise catalogue and digitise endangered government archives this work has brought the political and organisational logic of amin s regime into view the economic war was fought by government officials who overhauled all at once whole sections of public life it was a regulatory war pursued by authorities who sought to control prices and supervise the conduct of business it was a war in which a great many ugandans were unwittingly made into enemies of state the inhumanity of the economic war was much more widely experienced than anniversary events marking the asian expulsion can acknowledge economic war it was supposed to be a war of liberation in the speech that announced it amin hymned the economic war as the economic war made some ugandans feel as though they were living in momentous times by the end of 1972 5 655 farms ranches and estates had been vacated by the departed asian community the abandoned properties fell under the custodianship of a new bureaucracy the departed asians property custodial board which allocated houses and business premises to african tenants here in the conduct of business was a theatre where black ugandans could fight for their freedom the days of bargaining are done read a headline in the voice of uganda the public expected the new shopkeeper in their town or village to be dedicated and very hard working a man of integrity and honesty voice of uganda 9 december 1972 new procedures were created to superintend the conduct of black run business amin himself took an active interest in the matter in the months following the expulsion of asians he made surprise tours of kampala s businesses two or three times a week on every tour of inspection he would give directions he would tell a businessman to change his method of work rearrange the stock or keep better records in the archives of the uganda broadcasting corporation there are hundreds of photographs of abdallah nasur the governor of central province canadian diplomats reported that he spent his time in the photos nasur is always at the centre of the frame thrusting himself into the lives and businesses of kampala s people in this way petty brutality was made to look like vigour economic crimes early in 1975 amin published the economic crimes decree it established a military court called the economic crimes tribunal its judges were empowered to punish profiteers hoarders and others who acted against the economic interests of the state the penalty was death by firing squad or 10 years in prison by april traders charged with selling goods in excess of established government prices were being arrested and executed in one case the tribunal ordered the execution of two dozen men who were found attempting to smuggle 500 bags of coffee out of the country the targets of the economic crimes tribunal were people without connections petty traders market women people whose financial strategies ran afoul of government edicts the most emotionally affecting pictures in the whole photographic archive are from a series made in march 1975 the photos depict people brought before the tribunal at a military barracks the cameraman took dozens of pictures most of them close ups of individuals as they faced the judges in one photo there is a girl her arms crossed staring defiantly at the camera in another photo there is a middle aged woman wearing a print dress staring at the ground with tears in her eyes her hand at her forehead the photos were made to document the identities of the people who were being judged what they captured instead is their fragility their emotion their nervousness their innocence they are evidence of the arbitrariness of justice and the cheapness of life out of the hundreds of pictures taken at the economic crimes tribunal only one was ever printed or published in the government newspaper were the image makers of idi amin s regime squeamish about the tribunal s draconian powers did they

the opportunity to reap quick returns in the short term is garnering appeal from etf investors who are either bearish or bullish on a single stock but as the latest way to trade single stocks takes off there are key components of the products that investors should keep in mind before engaging the daily reset get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters single stock etfs offers traders the exposure to the daily performance of a singular stock tsll for example gives bullish investors 1 5x the daily exposure tsls is meant for bearish investors to obtain 1x the return of the tesla at the end of the day it resets it then starts again the next day there is a swap that is utilized to give the leverage effect on all etfs and in some counterparties reggie brown principal at gts told bob pisani on cnbc s etf edge on monday some etfs have five different swap counterparties to reduce the risk to individual investors brown said that the leveraged etfs are backed by a swap a strike price or the cutoff period is the ending of the leverage but the etfs are still trading after the cutoff period where the swap is struck and reset it s important to understand when the reset is and what are the periods not covered brown said and then the next day what happens for investors who hold on to their product over a period of days brown said that they will get the reset effect or gamma it s resetting inside of it he said and you re not getting the full return swap counterparty risk graniteshares ceo will rhind said that counterparty risk is a valid concern when talking about a swap a is a bilateral contract between two parties the risk is whoever the counterparty is if they go bankrupt then that will affect the value of the etf rhind said on cnbc s etf edge on monday the counterparty is typically an investment bank rhind said he used lehman brothers during the financial crisis as an example there were a few issued exchange traded notes that were canceled or redeemed as a result of that he said people lost money so that is a concern but since single stock etfs are meant to be held for a short period of time rhind said that counterparty risk is typically not a high level of concern for investors you can trade in and out of it he said testing volatility there are currently single stock etfs for tesla apple coinbase nike pfizer paypal and nvidia brown said that issuers will not keep a product in the marketplace that s not getting reception by gaining assets generally stocks that have high conviction high beta and high volatility is probably where you ll see the most assess in a levered or inverse single stock structure brown said direxion for example recently launched a suite of single stock etfs that revolve around tesla and apple dave mazza direxion s managing director and head of product said that filings for other securities are ongoing particularly for some of the mega cap names at this time we re really focused at getting some of those larger names that have depth of volume and liquidity around them mazza said so that we are in the best position to both create etfs and manage them as daily trading tools while volatility and volume are key components to identifying a stock that can function as an etf on its own rhind said that it also must be commercially viable the question we always get asked is can you do it on gamestop or amc rhind said and so far the answer has been that it s too volatile regulatory rules on how products can be launched guide the decision making process and the amount of leverage offered rhind said there are stocks that are just too volatile that wouldn t be able to compute with that rule rhind said and going back to the reset with reinvesting profits every day with the rebalance at the end of each day there are stocks out there that are just too volatile single stock etfs first launched last month so the levels of demand for the products and its ongoing sustainability are unsettled for the time being and as the products accelerate brown said that the innovation is broadening the etf industry these are the good things bringing investors into the marketplace brown said but having a clear view on investment tools versus trading tools as we go further into innovation is probably the best practice we can put in
the office of gov glenn youngkin tried to put a positive spin on jobs numbers this week touting a 100 000 more people working since january milestone but inside the numbers job growth appears to have stalled bureau of labor statistics household survey data released friday by the virginia employment commission showed that virginia added nearly 6 000 jobs in july which is still a net positive obviously but the virginia employment commission has been reporting a sharp uptick in new initial unemployment claims in recent weeks and the labor force participation rate the measure of the proportion of the civilian population age 16 and older that is employed or actively looking for work was down a tenth of a point last month to 63 8 percent also troubling the labor force in virginia is still roughly 120 000 less than what it was before the start of the covid 19 pandemic in march 2020 the slowdown in monthly job creation and the lower level of job participation have my full attention youngkin said we will continue the critical work to return more virginians to the workforce and will double down on policies that make virginia attractive for job growth and business investment we remain laser focused on our mission to make virginia the best place to live work and raise a family to youngkin that means tax cuts he said on friday that he will push in 2023 for 400 million in tax cuts no doubt hoping to burnish his credentials as he further explores a bid for the 2024 republican presidential nomination it s not our money it belongs to the hard working taxpayers of virginia youngkin said in a 25 minute speech to members of the money committees in the virginia general assembly in which he announced that the state had wrapped the 2022 fiscal year on june 30 with a 3 2 billion cash surplus the soundbite is all well and good but the thinking behind it doesn t take into account matters like the staffing shortages being experienced by localities across the state in law enforcement and k 12 education that are a direct result of low pay it also doesn t take into account that while things are looking good budget wise in the here and now we literally just went through a two year downturn that should inform decisions about how to put some money aside for the future i ve just been here long enough where i have been through this cycle where we think things are running robust and then we hit 2018 or you know 2008 or 2009 senate minority leader tommy norment told the washington post when we hit that downturn all of a sudden these revenues drop off for whatever reason it is going to be a great comfort that we have those resources norment and virginia beach del barry knight chair of the house appropriations committee would prefer to see the general assembly set aside the 400 million that youngkin is targeting for unspecified tax cuts into the state s rainy day fund it s a wonderful place to park 400 million knight told the post it kind of sets the tone for what we may be looking at going forward
toronto canadian banks will give some insight into where they see the economy going when they start to report quarterly earnings this week analysts will be watching for trends in key indicators like loan growth capital raising and how much banks are putting aside in case loans go sour the results for the period ending july 31 come at a time when decades high inflation has pushed central banks to raise interest rates including the bank of canada s one percentage point hike in july the highest increase in more than 20 years higher rates have pushed up borrowing costs for mortgages and have caused a pullback in the real estate market which is typically a big driver of bank loan growth the canadian real estate association said that national home sales fell by 5 3 per cent in july compared with june and was down 29 3 per cent compared with july 2021 translating into lower loan activity for banks i am expecting some slower loan growth given the rise in mortgage rates said james shanahan senior equity research analyst at edward jones overall though shanahan said he s expecting a pretty good quarter for the banks as higher interest rates also translate to higher margins on loans though he pointed out with many loans at locked in rates it can take some time to show up in earnings with commercial loans generally faster to respond on the capital markets side banks are expected to report a sharp drop in investment banking revenue as companies and investors become more cautious but shanahan said that trading revenue could help buffer the impact despite market pressures that s just basically been driven by higher market volatility and so that could be a source of strength that s the trend that played out when u s banks reported with the five largest american banks reporting a 50 per cent drop in investment banking revenues while trading revenues were up 22 per cent he said bank decisions on credit loss provisions will be another key area to watch as it shows what they see ahead for economic conditions and how they expect those loans will perform shanahan said that with the economy still running at essentially full employment he s not expecting any dramatic changes but analysts are expecting banks to start to boost their reserves again after beginning to taper them down in the past year or so national bank analyst gabriel dechaine said in a note that he expects a tempered credit cycle shift with all banks adding to loan provisions with larger ones from scotiabank and rbc since they have released about 80 per cent of the provisions they had built up in the early months of the pandemic credit loss provisions are counted as expenses so they have a material effect on bank earnings the latest crop of results come as bank stocks have been under some pressure as part of the wider economic uncertainty scotiabank analyst meny grauman said in a note that bank stock performance has reflected big swings in the wider economic outlook the ratio of bank stock prices compared with earnings fell as economic concerns rose in the spring on the fallout of russia s invasion of ukraine and china s covid 19 lockdowns but is now returning to a more balanced investor consensus he said investors appear to be stepping back from the brink and realizing that while rising rates will weigh on economic growth by design the outcome is not necessarily a deep and prolonged recession said grauman at current valuation levels the market appears to be pricing in a mild recession with only limited impact on credit performance which is in fact our base case scenario dechaine noted that the big six bank stocks are down about six per cent year to date underperforming the market by about 1 4 per cent which could be too much at this point we are wondering if too much negativity has been reflected he said that for banks to expect better performance though depends on the outlook for rate hike activity market expectations need to shift to a more dovish stance from the bank of canada which would deflate concerns related to the housing market a primary sector overhang we re not there yet but could be getting close scotiabank starts the reporting on tuesday followed by rbc and national bank wednesday cibc and td bank on thursday and bank of montreal on aug 30 this report by the canadian press was first published aug 21 2022
