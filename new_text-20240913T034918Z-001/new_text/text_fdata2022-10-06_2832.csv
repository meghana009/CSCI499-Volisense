patagonia s founder yvon chouinard made headlines recently with the decision to give his family s 3 billion company and its future profits to the fight against climate change in his words earth is now the company s only shareholder climate policy advocates celebrated the decision each year 100 million in company profits will go to the holdfast collective a u s nonprofit working for climate action and policy advocacy its legal status as a 501 c 4 social welfare organization allows it to directly lobby on u s climate policy patagonia has always been a pathbreaker since 1985 the outdoor clothing company has donated one per cent of its sales to environmental causes in 2002 it helped found the business alliance 1 for the planet to inspire other companies to follow suit patagonia has also shared product innovations like its plant based neoprene with its competitors in hopes of accelerating more sustainable practices other initiatives include its certification as a b corporation certifying patagonia as a company that is committed to the common good and its used apparel marketplace worn wear but its recent decision is on another scale entirely could it help redefine the gold standard of business responsibility profit vs sustainability tensions between profits and the planet abound in business much management scholarship has focused on identifying win win scenarios where profit and sustainability coincide including getting eco conscious consumers to pay more for sustainable products and saving costs by making operations more resource efficient in many instances however a win win scenario is not an option companies then face tough choices about striking a balance between profit and sustainability patagonia has long grappled with this trade off often in public and eye catching ways its 2011 black friday ad implored customers not to buy its best selling jacket due to its environmental impacts ironically the ad quadrupled the company s sales patagonia continued this pattern in 2020 when it ran an ad in the new york times about the need to tackle the climate crisis chouinard mused in a 2013 blog post that making things in a more responsible way is a good start but in the end we will not have a sustainable economy unless we consume less he also expressed the hope that patagonia can find a way to make decisions about growth based on being here for the next 200 years and not damaging the planet further in the process foundation owned companies a major barrier for sustainable companies is the assumption of shareholder primacy that managers must maximize profits on behalf of the company s owners shareholder primacy is particularly pronounced in publicly listed corporations this is a major reason why chouinard avoided taking patagonia public and put a purpose trust in charge instead a trust or foundation running a for profit company is not a new idea in denmark and other northern european countries foundation owned companies like carlsberg and ikea are much more common studies show that the performance of foundation owned companies is often on par with investor owned companies foundation owned firms are rare in the u s regulations introduced in 1969 to reel in the perceived power of foundations imposed a stiff tax on foundations that owned over 20 per cent of a for profit company but in 2018 the philanthropic enterprise act removed these obstacles under specific conditions these legal changes set the stage for patagonia s model ownership of the company is divided to give the voting stock to the patagonia purpose trust while the non voting stock which receives the company s annual profits goes to the holdfast collective the perils of philanthro capitalism but this new model comes with potential risks if it becomes widely adopted it could be used as much to oppose progressive climate policy as to advance it dedicating profits to an organization that can advocate for political causes and candidates may be viewed as a new version of philanthro capitalism where ultra rich individuals donate money to advance the causes they care about the growing influence of philanthro barons and private foundations as interest groups in u s politics could undermine democratic processes the influence of private money on u s politics has only accelerated since the 2010 citizens united supreme court decision that struck down bans on private funding of election campaigns it facilitated billions of dollars of spending by corporations and other outside groups in recent u s elections companies purely dedicated to advocating for their

by paul r la monica cnn business mortgage rates are soaring and for many prospective home buyers especially first time purchasers the combination of rising home loan costs and still sky high real estate prices make the idea of purchasing a home prohibitively expensive if not impossible but don t tell that to the ceo of real estate developer howard hughes corp in an interview with cnn business david o reilly said that he s not too worried about another housing market crash and explains why we probably are technically in a housing recession he said referring to a term used to describe a decline in home sales for at least six months we are clearly in a downturn but this is much different o reilly said that in the years leading up to the 2008 collapses of bear stearns lehman brothers washington mutual and others there was a glut of new homes that had been built we had a massive oversupply when lehman hit the wall he said but housing starts now have significantly trailed formations that means that the number of americans that could buy a home formations exceeds the number of new homes starts coming to market so demand outstrips supply and that makes prices unlikely to fall off a cliff like they did in 2008 there was a housing shortage of around 5 million homes before the onset of the pandemic that shortage is not going away soon said lawrence yun chief economist with the national association of realtors trade group in a report last month pockets of strength in the southwest o reilly noted that in the markets where howard hughes has a big presence such as phoenix las vegas and houston he expects a so called soft landing for the housing why demand for homes in those cities remains strong particularly for retired americans living on the east or west coast looking to retire we re seeing a migration out of big cities on the coasts and into the southwest he said there is continued buying from older adults that can get twice the house with much lower taxes o reilly said the fact that mortgage rates have now spiked to 7 is not that much of a deterrent for older buyers who are selling their existing homes for huge premiums many of them are able to sell houses in new york or california at a profit and can use the cash to buy new homes with either no mortgage or a very small loan howard hughes also has a presence in commercial real estate and that is a more challenging market in light of the changing nature of how many americans particularly those with white collar jobs work clearly people are not going to use office space the way they did before the pandemic o reilly said o reilly noted that there s another challenge for commercial developers banks have far tighter lending standards in the wake of the great recession in large part due to new federal laws put into place that were designed to make sure financial firms don t get into trouble with bad loans like they did in 2008 it s now almost impossible to get a loan or refinancing of an office building even with strong fundamentals he said adding that banks are still willing to approve loans for multifamily housing i e apartment buildings but that they are running away from retail offices and hotels weakness in commercial real estate is probably one of the main reasons why howard hughes like the stocks of other real estate companies has plunged this year shares are down more than 40 o reilly conceded that the biggest problem for real estate companies and other financial firms is that nobody really has much of a clue just how much more aggressive the fed is going to be in order to get inflation under control banks are uncertain about where rates are going i think we all are he said the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warner bros discovery company all rights reserved
liz truss the new british prime minister has come into office vowing to sweep away the entrenched outworn attitudes that persist in parts of what is otherwise an admirable civil service one area she is focused on is the treasury which she regards as wholly out of sympathy with her radical approach to tackling the severe economic problems that face the uk another sclerotic area she has in her sights is the foreign office on september 22 the media outlet politico reported a downing street spokesman saying that at the recent un general assembly meeting in new york truss told her israeli counterpart yair lapid that she had ordered a review of the current location of the british embassy this has not come out of the blue during the course of the leadership contest in the summer truss told the conservative friends of israel cfi that while recognizing the importance and sensitivity of the issue she would have the uk s decision to stay put in tel aviv looked at again advertisement there was shock and horror in the hidebound foreign office and diplomatic circles generally no less than 10 former uk diplomats came together to oppose the idea in classic british style a letter to the times preceded by a catalogue of stock sitting on the fence observations the letter ended two states is british government policy until that policy is realized the embassy should stay put the union jack the national flag of the united kingdom hangs at half mast at the entrance to the british embassy in tel aviv on september 9 2022 credit avshalom sassoni flash90 in fact two states is also us government policy but that did not deter the trump administration from acknowledging reality and re siting the us embassy in israel s capital city president joe biden has not reversed that decision nor does he seem inclined to do so the uk s foot dragging on this issue stems from its long standing and continuing refusal actually to acknowledge that jerusalem is israel s capital which it was from the moment of the state s foundation what is the un policy regarding jerusalem global opinion is in a terrible muddle about the status of jerusalem in the original 1947 two state partition plan for palestine jerusalem was designated to be a corpus separatum under a special international regime administered by the un the idea that jerusalem could be separately governed under un supervision has long been abandoned yet the un as a whole like the european union still clings to the idea that jerusalem is somehow not part of the state of israel the uk goes along with this as recently as 2016 british foreign office briefing documents were still referring to jerusalem as a corpus separatum these days the un and the eu hold that jerusalem is a final status issue for which a comprehensive just and lasting solution must be achieved through negotiations between the two parties in short they hold that the exact status of jerusalem in international law is yet to be determined advertisement yet the un security council in its resolution 2334 passed in 2016 seems to override this it declares that the status of jerusalem and the west bank is as it had been on june 4 1967 that is on the day before the six day war referring three times to palestinian territories including east jerusalem ignored is the fact that in 1967 they were not palestinian territories they were territories that had been captured by the jordanian army in 1948 and illegally annexed by jordan the eu echoing the un position officially refuses to recognize any changes to the pre 1967 borders including in jerusalem other than those agreed by both sides so the un and the eu assert that jerusalem is a final status issue to be determined through negotiation and in the same breath maintain that east jerusalem is part of palestinian territories they recognize no changes to the pre six day war boundaries the eu calls them borders which they never were except that they do not acknowledge that west jerusalem was part of israel at the time their position defies logic either the status of jerusalem is still to be determined or the part that used to be occupied by jordan is declared to be palestinian and the issue is closed moreover if east jerusalem is palestinian then at least west jerusalem is israeli a position acknowledged by both the us and russia together with a clutch of other states including the czech republic and ukraine in december 2021 ukraine s ambassador to israel yevgen korniychuk said his country recognized jerusalem as israel s one and only capital following russia s invasion in february his promise to open a branch of its embassy in the city in 2022 during a projected visit by president volodymyr zelensky is obviously on hold the uk position on jerusalem is provided in a standard response by the british embassy to public queries its first sentence almost boasts that britain has not shifted its views since april 1950 at that time it said the uk unreservedly recognized the state of israel de jure but it withheld recognition of sovereignty over jerusalem pending a final determination of its status the uk recognizes israel s de facto authority over west jerusalem but in line with un security council resolution 242 1967 and subsequent unsc resolutions regards east jerusalem as under israeli occupation a final determination of the status of jerusalem should be sought as part of a negotiated settlement it must ensure jerusalem is a shared capital of the israeli and palestinian states the uk disagrees with the united states decision to move its embassy to jerusalem and recognize jerusalem as the israeli capital before a final status agreement up till now the uk response has concluded the british embassy to israel is based in tel aviv and there are no plans to move it before or in the absence of such a settlement during the leadership contest truss declared war on outworn thinking in the civil service declaring she was prepared to break eggs in taking on establishment orthodoxy that final sentence in the british embassy s standard response may one day need to be amended the writer is middle east correspondent for eurasia review his latest

patagonia s founder yvon chouinard made headlines recently with the decision to give his family s 3 billion company and its future profits to the fight against climate change in his words earth is now the company s only shareholder climate policy advocates celebrated the decision each year 100 million in company profits will go to the holdfast collective a u s nonprofit working for climate action and policy advocacy its legal status as a 501 c 4 social welfare organization allows it to directly lobby on u s climate policy patagonia has always been a pathbreaker since 1985 the outdoor clothing company has donated one per cent of its sales to environmental causes in 2002 it helped found the business alliance 1 for the planet to inspire other companies to follow suit patagonia has also shared product innovations like its plant based neoprene with its competitors in hopes of accelerating more sustainable practices other initiatives include its certification as a b corporation certifying patagonia as a company that is committed to the common good and its used apparel marketplace worn wear but its recent decision is on another scale entirely could it help redefine the gold standard of business responsibility profit vs sustainability tensions between profits and the planet abound in business much management scholarship has focused on identifying win win scenarios where profit and sustainability coincide including getting eco conscious consumers to pay more for sustainable products and saving costs by making operations more resource efficient in many instances however a win win scenario is not an option companies then face tough choices about striking a balance between profit and sustainability patagonia has long grappled with this trade off often in public and eye catching ways its 2011 black friday ad implored customers not to buy its best selling jacket due to its environmental impacts ironically the ad quadrupled the company s sales patagonia continued this pattern in 2020 when it ran an ad in the new york times about the need to tackle the climate crisis chouinard mused in a 2013 blog post that making things in a more responsible way is a good start but in the end we will not have a sustainable economy unless we consume less he also expressed the hope that patagonia can find a way to make decisions about growth based on being here for the next 200 years and not damaging the planet further in the process foundation owned companies a major barrier for sustainable companies is the assumption of shareholder primacy that managers must maximize profits on behalf of the company s owners shareholder primacy is particularly pronounced in publicly listed corporations this is a major reason why chouinard avoided taking patagonia public and put a purpose trust in charge instead a trust or foundation running a for profit company is not a new idea in denmark and other northern european countries foundation owned companies like carlsberg and ikea are much more common studies show that the performance of foundation owned companies is often on par with investor owned companies foundation owned firms are rare in the u s regulations introduced in 1969 to reel in the perceived power of foundations imposed a stiff tax on foundations that owned over 20 per cent of a for profit company but in 2018 the philanthropic enterprise act removed these obstacles under specific conditions these legal changes set the stage for patagonia s model ownership of the company is divided to give the voting stock to the patagonia purpose trust while the non voting stock which receives the company s annual profits goes to the holdfast collective the perils of philanthro capitalism but this new model comes with potential risks if it becomes widely adopted it could be used as much to oppose progressive climate policy as to advance it dedicating profits to an organization that can advocate for political causes and candidates may be viewed as a new version of philanthro capitalism where ultra rich individuals donate money to advance the causes they care about the growing influence of philanthro barons and private foundations as interest groups in u s politics could undermine democratic processes the influence of private money on u s politics has only accelerated since the 2010 citizens united supreme court decision that struck down bans on private funding of election campaigns it facilitated billions of dollars of spending by corporations and other outside groups in recent u s elections companies purely dedicated to advocating for their political cause might further accelerate this arms race on both sides of the political spectrum a new model for responsibility can patagonia s model truly solve the tension between profit and the planet could it become a new gold standard for business responsibility this will depend on the balance between its environmental impacts and the social good created via its products and advocacy patagonia s next moves will determine the actual impact of chouinard s decision will patagonia experience pressure to grow its profits to further fund the holdfast collective how will the purpose trust interpret the company s stated purpose of being in business to save our home planet the company acknowledges the new ownership model is not an excuse to ignore the real tension we ll continue to face between growth and the environmental impact of our operations for now this recognition and transparency positions it as a clear model that raises the standard for how to think talk and act about business responsibility authors graeme auld professor public policy carleton university janina grabs assistant professor of business and society esade

third quarter results next week setting up the group for a potential stock rebound according to a trio of new analyst reports out thursday bank earnings season is scheduled to start oct 14 with four of the six biggest u s banks reporting results that morning the analyst community expects good core results from the group thanks in part to higher interest rates via the federal reserve s inflation fighting campaign we think q3 results will be solid with strong trends stable fees and favorable credit trends baird analysts led by david george said despite a generally healthy fundamental backdrop sentiment has become more negative for banks in recent weeks providing a favorable trading opportunity in the group banks have gotten a boost from rising rates but that hasn t been enough to outweigh concerns that the fed s actions will inadvertently trigger an economic slowdown ultimately leading to greater loan losses for the industry that has helped keep bank shares down this year the kbw bank

says these rallies are all guilty until proven innocent josh brown does not trust the monster two day rally we had this week there are very few stocks in uptrend right now brown said thursday on cnbc s halftime report and that is why i think these rallies are all guilty until proven innocent while the two day rally this week was notable the investor does not expect that anything fundamental has changed in the market which he believes continues to point to a downtrend we re going to have these rips but like the market gets turned away from the 200 day all the time this year and until that changes i don t think there s any reason that anybody should change their mind from the current psychology and that lower high lower low trap that we ve been in really since january 3rd is still intact he said still brown identified the few sectors that are working for investors in a volatile market he said investors should find names the energy sector where a broad majority of stocks are trading above the 200 day moving average or are in a definite uptrend investors can also search out stocks in the consumer staples and health care both of which still have names that are in an uptrend it s really not a complicated market to figure out he said sarah min fed governor lisa cook sees ongoing rate hikes likely federal reserve governor lisa cook in a speech thursday advocated a strong focus on inflation which she said will necessitate the need for more interest rate increases with inflation running well above our 2 percent longer run goal restoring price stability likely will require ongoing rate hikes and then keeping policy restrictive for some time until we are confident that inflation is firmly on the path toward our 2 percent goal the central bank official said in remarks for a speech before the peterson institute for international economics with the fed largely expected to approve its fourth consecutive 0 75 percentage point increase at its next meeting in early november cook said she has supported the path of policy so far but noted that there will be a time to re evaluate at some point as we continue to tighten monetary policy it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess the effects of our cumulative tightening on the economy and inflation she said in any case the path of policy should depend on how quickly we make progress toward our inflation goal the fed shoots for a long run inflation target of 2 its favored measure core personal consumption expenditures prices most recently was running at a 4 9 annual

billion after a restructuring that turns it into more of a pure play wealth manager jpmorgan chase analysts said thursday in a note jpmorgan analysts led by kian abouhossein upgraded their recommendation on credit suisse to neutral from underweight with a december 2023 price target of chf 6 the zurich based bank last closed at a total market capitalization of about 11 billion the bank has more than 700 billion in private banking assets under management that is expected to generate a 15 return on tangible equity in 2024 abouhossein said in his note we see 15bn as minimum value today for csg in line with our estimated value of the swiss legal entity the path to get there however may involve material share price volatility uncertainty on strategy and execution risk as credit suisse is expected to disclose its restructuring plan by oct 27 the analyst said in either of two possible scenarios charted out by the research team credit suisse should be bolstered by the minimum value of its european wealth management operations according to abouhossein although other analysts have said that the bank may need to raise as much as chf 6 billion to pull off its restructuring the jpmorgan team said that a large raise is not a given if the bank exits enough capital hungry businesses hugh son energy the only sector trading higher thursday the s p 500 energy sector outperformed thursday

where it will stop raising interest rates to beat back inflation until i see some evidence that underlying inflation has solidly peaked and is hopefully headed back down i m not ready to declare a pause i think we re quite a ways away from a pause he said thursday during a q a session kashkari didn t specify how far he thinks the fed has to go estimates in september from the federal open market committee of which kashkari is an alternate member this year point to another 1 5 percentage points of rate hikes into 2023 pushing rates higher is likely to mean business failures from areas where risk was excessive kashkari conceded but he added that shouldn t deter the fed in its quest to pull inflation back down to 2 by the fed s preferred measure of personal consumption expenditures prices excluding food and energy inflation ran at a 4 9 annual rate in august to me the bar to actually shifting our stance is very high he said kashkari s comments echo sentiments expressed wednesday by

interest gap could spell economic peril a cost of living protest organised by the enough is enough campaign in birmingham uk on oct 1 ahead of the conservative party conference photo bloomberg on a recent monday the fed called an emergency meeting the discussion topics were not made known could it possibly be about turmoil in the uk bond market and the financial troubles of large investment banks at this fragile time the world cannot afford another lehman brothers type disaster after all economists are not good at predicting and protecting economies from crises in its world economic outlook report for january 2022 the imf predicted sri lanka s gdp would grow by 2 6 in 2022 and 2 7 in 2023 the united nations department of economic and social affairs also projected 2 6 growth for sri lanka in 2022 no one seemed to be aware that sri lanka was about to face an economic crisis six months later sri lanka s prime minister announced the economy had collapsed i am disappointed that these world class economists missed an important fact that sri lankan had grossly inadequate foreign reserves the country was obligated to pay 6 9 billion in foreign debt payments in 2022 but had only 3 1 billion of foreign reserve available at end 2021 that level of reserves could cover only 1 5 months of imports for which a minimum of three months of reserves was needed all public and private economic research institutions except one projected that thailand 1997 s gdp growth would be 6 8 to 7 2 how could they ignore the fact that thailand was experiencing a severe liquidity shortage prompting the overnight interbank lending rate to double from 6 1 in april 1996 to 12 1 in december 1996 to push for positive growth in 1997 which meant demanding more liquidity would put the entire economy at extreme liquidity risk at that time liquidity came mainly from foreign borrowing on july 2nd 1997 the thai economy was hit by a once in a lifetime financial crisis instead of the high growth projected gdp growth was 2 7 in 1997 and 7 6 in 1998 just last week the united kingdom was on the brink of a financial crisis luckily the bank of england intervened by pumping 65 billion into the gilt market the local name for uk government bonds to save the day fear of rising bond yields triggered a massive sell off of long term gilts to the point that the market could have collapsed the bank stepped in and was able to calm the market most critics blamed liz truss government s new era for britain policy which included support for energy bills and tax cuts these measures would result in more gilt sales to finance higher fiscal deficits this potential yield rise spooked investors into dumping current bond holdings to avoid investment loss to give readers an idea of potential losses a 1 rise in bond yield would mean a 10 loss in principal for 10 year gilt holders of course if one holds 20 year maturity gilts the principal loss would double to 20 however i have doubts about this argument for three reasons first the announcement of the new era took place on sept 23 but the bond selling panic happened five days later on sept 28 normally financial markets react instantly to news like this second the new era policy would have to receive parliamentary approval before taking effect third even if the new era policy was approved it would take time before the market saw more bond supply to me a better explanation would be rising bond yields in the us after the fed raised interest rates another 0 75 on sept 22 us government bond yields rose steadily the 10 year treasury yield surged from 3 51 on sept 21 to 3 97 on sept 27 the yield was about to break the psychological threshold of 4 the next day london s gilt market went berserk do not forget that london is five hours ahead of new york the timing was a better match than for the fiscal deficit fear assumption to an economist this is a typical capital inflow outflow phenomenon arising from an interest gap the fed funds rate is 1 higher than the bank of england s base rate naturally money will leave england to seek a better return in america the british pound plummeted to 1 07 to the dollar on sept 27 why did the bank of england not follow the fed interest rate hike and leave a sizeable interest rate gap between the two countries don t they know interest rate parity theory after all the uk has been religiously following us rate hikes for the past 25 years the answer probably is that the uk s economy is badly damaged by covid 19 and facing an energy price threat this might not be an appropriate time for a sharp rate increase of course a pound depreciation is to be expected and the bank of england is prepared to live with that but the bank of england does not anticipate a financial melt down from the interest rate gap optimistically they hope that 300 year old british financial markets would behave rationally and perform orderly self adjustments by the way the bond market turmoil did not only occur in london the bank of japan and bank of korea had to step in to support their markets too two questions first do central banks have enough resources to stabilise bond markets when needed the bank of england s balance sheet of 400 billion is nothing compared to the gilt market size of 2 1 trillion market intervention could be done only on a short term basis second what would the bank of england and other central banks do when the fed continues to raise interest rates for 2022 the fed is scheduled to meet in november and december analysts expect there will be interest rate hikes of 0 75 and 0 5 at those meetings widening interest rate gaps between the us and other countries are not something to brush aside in today s world of interconnected financial markets and a global bond market size of 120 trillion equivalent to 1 2 times global gdp central banks must be careful about running monetary policies if they care little for the fed s rate hikes liquidity in one s country could run dry before the central bank governor realises it so much about economic risk in england i am sure readers want to ask what about thailand the bank of thailand repo rate is currently 2 25 lower than the fed funds rate and thai government bond yields are significantly lower than the us s unfortunately it would require another article to explain the effects of widening the interest rate gap between thailand and the us but i will give readers a hint from aug 28 to sept 23 there was another 12 4 billion reduction in thailand s foreign currency reserves do the receding reserves come from valuation effects or real capital outflow is thailand s bond market safe and sound what is the future of the thai baht is the economy really recovering these questions will be answered in an upcoming article

although staffed at a level higher than anticipated pacon manufacturing in brunswick county has requested a state extension because it is technically short on a hiring goal tied to a 700 000 public grant the contract manufacturer has 203 full time employees as of this week according to senior vice president lawrence shannon and 135 temporary employees also working on a full time basis a state building reuse grant pacon was awarded in 2019 required the manufacturer to have 238 full time employees by april 2021 the workforce is starting to kind of reemerge and reengage shannon said it s nowhere near what it was in 2018 2019 last year pacon received a one year extension that expired in april and through the economic development agency brunswick business industry development bbid applied for a second in june the n c department of commerce is still considering pacon s request according to department spokesperson david rhoades rhoades said the department has lately received several pandemic related extension requests pacon spent a year upgrading its new facility at 100 quality drive a former u s marine boatyard site spending close to 2 million on the renovations according to bbid director bill early the grant date started at the time the business s plans were announced in 2019 before pacon could move in pacon began operating in leland at an equally opportune or inopportune time depending on how you look at it the business makes products including clorox disinfecting wipes and other pads towels and liquids used by consumers and the medical and industrial sectors its first official day in operation was may 1 2020 just as the pandemic was spreading stateside and the nation had developed a heightened wariness of contaminated surfaces the whole timing was not our friend shannon said it s like being on a fire drill for a year and a half using temporary workers was always part of pacon s plan shannon said but difficulties in the labor market have made it challenging to fully onboard the numbers required by the state in the timeframe established he said by utilizing local staffing agencies pacon has been able to onboard workers that are a good fit for the facility after a 90 day trial period about 75 of its current workforce was hired this way shannon said it s a preferred method in the way that it allows us to bring people in without going through the extra steps that are necessary to make them permanent employees he said for us to do all that legwork and they come in on the second day and say you know i don t like standing up we ve wasted a lot of time and effort for that person full time employees receive benefits shannon said the average planned salary for employees was 31 273 in 2019 over 2020 and 2021 pacon closed its facility in new jersey as part of its move to leland its new domestic headquarters moving locations was part of a cost benefit analysis shannon said a perk of the new location is the region s strong road transportation network he said particularly interstate 140 which opened in 2017 that made this whole area a lot more tenable for somebody like us that has a significant amount of tractor trailer movements in and out he said it made this area a little more accessible business surged as the pandemic spread early said demand prompted pacon to use a section of the new facility it had initially planned to sublease and to lease additional warehouse space in new hanover county their business is much stronger than what they had projected he said recent recession worries have lately started to calm things down shannon said that end marketplace has become very unaware of how to plan and stock because it s not a normal demand cycle they are used to being able to look at he said there s kind of a constant re shifting shannon said he anticipates reaching the official state required tally by the end of the year if the state doesn t authorize the extension pacon would be required to pay back some percentage of the 700 000 incentive early said the company has already received the full amount tied to specific renovation related invoices associated with upgrading the new facility according to early a separate 300 000 one north carolina fund grant tied to job creation goals reaches its deadline in 2024 receiving the extension would be a benefit shannon said but it isn t the end of the world we ll have the numbers it s just a question of the timing

the fact what s surprising is how unsurprising it all is the we all expected fireworks given the color of this particular dispute but the fact is case to settle on the eve of trial they settle just before you have to depose the big people the ceo whatever musk s deposition is scheduled to begin october 6th in some ways the fact that they would settle just before then is the most natural and obvious thing in the world all we saw were some fairly anodyne text message which is that must uh must co investors sent him and the press had an absolute field day with that now twitter has been getting all kinds of discovery on all of musk s communications with everybody about this deal i have absolutely no doubt it would have been also embarrassing if only because he didn t expect that he was talking you know talking to courtroom for the world at large and from twitter s perspective i think it s interesting because i think it s very possible that must could have uncovered damaging things not necessarily damaging enough to get them out of the deal i mean i think twitter s case was always stronger but that doesn t mean must couldn t have aired embarrassing facts about twitter s business but from twitter s perspective there s also the aspect that what do they care if they win and they get bought by musk then as company it doesn t matter what got aired that was bad news for twitter at that point the shareholders are out it s musk s problem so in that sense twitter could kind of be like just fine reveal at all it doesn t matter as long as we win the case in the end it doesn t actually matter because now it s musk s problem as company advertisement twitter under musk most of the plans are a mystery share copy link copy a super app called x a bot free free speech haven these are some of elon musk s mysterious plans for twitter now that he may be moving toward buying the company after all after months of squabbling over the fate of their bombshell 44 billion deal the billionaire and the bird app are essentially back to square one if a bit worse for wear as trust and goodwill has seemed to erode on both sides musk the ceo of tesla motors and spacex and twitter s most prolific user since former president donald trump was booted from it has shared few concrete details about his plans for the social media platform while he s touted free speech and derided spam bots since agreeing to buy the company in april what he actually wants to do about either is shrouded in mystery he could potentially own one of the world s most powerful communications platforms with a daily population of 237 million in a matter of weeks though the deal is not final the lack of clear plans for the platform is raising concern among twitter s constituencies who range from users in conflict regions where it offers an information lifeline to the company s own employees video below is the deal back on elon musk gets closer to buying twitter both users and advertisers are understandably anxious about whether the move will fundamentally change the culture of the platform said brooke erin duffy a professor at cornell university who studies social media and so musk will need to decide whether he wants to quash their concerns by retaining core features the content moderation system for instance and keeping the company public or whether he will undertake a full scale overhaul muddling things further on tuesday musk tweeted that buying twitter is an accelerant to creating x the everything app without further explanation although musk s tweets and statements have been cryptic technology analysts have speculated that musk wants to re create a version of china s wechat app that can do video chats messaging streaming scan bar codes and make payments he gave a little more detail during tesla s annual shareholder meeting in august telling the crowd at a factory near austin texas that he uses twitter frequently and knows the product well i think i ve got a good sense of where to point the engineering team with twitter to make it radically better he said video below elon musk cites whistleblower claims as another reason to back out of twitter dealhandling payments for goods could be a key part of the app musk said he has a grander vision for what x com an online bank he started early in his career that eventually became part of paypal could have been obviously that could be started from scratch but i think twitter would help accelerate that by three to five years musk said at the august meeting so it s kind of something that i thought would be quite useful for a long time i know what to do for now twitter has immediate and pressing problems musk will need to deal with if he takes ownership of the company its social media rivals are struggling with declining stock prices and some like snap even announced layoffs government regulation and attracting younger users amid competition from tiktok are also challenges and musk s vision of a free speech haven has social media and content moderation experts as well as digital and human rights advocates concerned when this all started in the spring we had indicators and a strong sense of what musk might do with the platform said angelo carusone of media matters a watchdog group that opposes the takeover because of the lawsuit we know who has been talking to what he s been saying and the types of far right ideological decision makers he wants to put in place to put it bluntly the worst fears have been confirmed video below spacex fires workers who ripped elon musk in open letter reporttwitter employees under former ceo jack dorsey and his predecessors have spent years working to tame the platform once called the free speech wing of the free speech party where hate and harassment abound into something where all are welcome and safe while it s far from perfect critics worry musk s ownership will mean turning back the clock on years of this work musk made it clear that he would roll back twitter s community standards and safety guidelines reinstate donald trump along with scores of other accounts suspended for violence and abuse and open the floodgates of disinformation carusone said the company for instance was an early adopter of the report abuse button in 2013 after u k member of parliament stella creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform echoing the experiences of other women over the years in subsequent years twitter continued to craft rules and invested in staff and technology that detect violent threats harassment and misinformation that violates its policies after evidence emerged that russia used their platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 u s presidential election social media companies also stepped up their efforts against political misinformation video below elon musk says twitter deal off unless company can prove less than 5 of users are fakethe big question now is how far musk who describes himself as a free speech absolutist wants to ratchet back these systems and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does aiming to tamp down such worries musk said in may he wants twitter to be as broadly inclusive as possible where ideally most of america is on it and talking a far cry from the far right playground his critics are warning against and while musk has hinted he d consider reinstating trump s account it s not clear the former president who has since launched his own social media platform would return then there s the matter of twitter s employees who ve been living with uncertainty high and low profile departures and a potential owner who s publicly derided them on their own platform musk has also targeted twitter s work from home policy having once called for the company s headquarters to be turned into a homeless shelter because he said so few employees actually worked there as a hyper frequent twitter user with over 100 million followers musk does know how to use the platform during an all hands staff meeting musk attended in june he said his goal was to make it so compelling that you can t live without it if he s able to realize this it could finally put twitter in the big leagues of social media with tiktok and meta s facebook and instagram where users are counted in the billions not mere millions video below elon musk s twitter bid raises concerns over free speechof course musk also well known for predictions that are delayed or may not come true such as colonizing mars or deploying a fleet of autonomous robotaxis this is not a car manufacturer where good enough all you have to do is beat general motors sorry that isn t really that hard said david kirsch a professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the university of maryland who s studied twitter bots effect on tesla s stock price you are dealing here with all of these other companies also have very sophisticated ai programs very sophisticated phd programmers everyone is trying to crack this nut
as ukrainian forces mow through cities once held by russia kyiv is reworking its weapons wish list from western countries while troops prepare to dig in for bitter winter fighting at the top of their list is new air defenses due to fears that vladimir putin will step up missile attacks on civilian targets as his front lines collapse ukraine has been able to prevent most russian attacks but we may expect increased russian missile attacks against critical ukrainian infrastructure in the coming weeks anders fogh rasmussen the former nato chief said in an interview advertisement advertisement rasmussen is meeting with u s officials in washington this week he s on a mission from kyiv where he worked with president volodymyr zelenskyy s top adviser andriy yermak to develop the kyiv security compact the plan encourages western powers to commit to long term security guarantees with ukraine including steady material support for the war effort and rebuilding the ukrainian defense industry so the country can begin to manufacture and provide its own weapons in the coming years we need to deliver all assets that ukrainians need to protect themselves against those missile attacks from russia he added no new air defense capabilities were included in the biden administration s 625 million military aid package announced tuesday which instead focused on precision artillery and rocket systems and ammunition those weapons and munitions will be critical over the next several weeks as ukrainian forces continue their counter offensives kyiv is however slated to receive two raytheon made national advanced surface to air missile systems by november defense department officials have said the systems can knock down drones missiles and helicopters which is just what ukraine is looking for advertisement advertisement yet there are worries that those systems along with six more slated to be contracted and delivered in the future won t arrive quickly enough to give ukraine the air cover it needs the first two nasams this fall are not sufficient air defense said one ukrainian adviser who asked to speak anonymously to discuss arms deliveries we re not talking stingers here we re talking about something that has mid range and higher ranges it will likely take time for those weapons to arrive western countries are reluctant to give up their own advanced missile defense capabilities plus contracting building and training crews on how to operate them takes years the biden administration has been arming ukraine in a deliberate manner sending artillery and munitions for the immediate fight and contracting with the defense industry for weapons such as nasams it s a two pronged strategy that officials have said meets kyiv s immediate needs while setting up a consistent flow of weaponry in the coming years the u s is also holding quiet talks with ukraine and the defense industry about whether to eventually acquire capabilities such as patriot batteries and f 16 fighter planes advertisement advertisement asked for comment on the ukrainians requests for the winter a senior defense department official pointed out that the u s has provided air defense radars for ukraine along with the two nasams the u s also assisted with the transfer of a slovakian s 300 air defense system in april after which the u s germany and the netherlands all deployed their own patriot batteries to slovakia to backstop the country s air defense the u s and allies have been notoriously short on patriot air defense systems and in the u s army patriot batteries for years have been the most deployed units as commanders around the globe clamor for the weapon likewise nato allies that operate the system have been careful when and where to deploy their own batteries if putin launches a renewed missile campaign against critical infrastructure the dangers to civilians will be higher than ever the dod official said since russian stocks of precision guided munitions are running low so attacks are becoming even more indiscriminate the official who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations said that russia has targeted civilian infrastructure throughout this campaign so it s not a leap to think they would continue advertisement advertisement and russian missiles do continue to fall one of the deadliest attacks in recent months came last friday when at least 30 people were killed and more than 100 wounded when russian missiles hit a convoy of civilian vehicles near the southern ukrainian city of zaporizhzhia amnesty international confirmed the vehicles were providing humanitarian relief well behind the front lines given ukraine s large size and hundreds of miles of front lines it s impossible to protect everything from missile attacks launched by russian submarines in the black sea and long range bombers flying close to ukraine s borders the lack of capabilities isn t just a ukrainian problem however which could cause more delays in rushing equipment into the country over the past two decades the u s and its allies have deprioritized short range air defense and homeland cruise missile defense and regional cruise missile defense is way behind said tom karako at the center for strategic and international studies and so what has ukraine taught us turns out there s a big demand for air defense that can t be easily or quickly filled we can help the ukrainians with javelins and stingers because they ve been sitting in the barn for decades but we don t just have things sitting in the barn for cruise and ballistic missile defense karako said advertisement advertisement the attack in zaporizhzhia hits at the heart of ukrainian concerns and the difficulty of predicting putin s next moves the strike came the same day russia declared it was annexing four territories in ukraine even as ukrainian forces continued to push deep into those areas putin s announcement and his promises to defend russian territory back the kremlin into a corner it represents a point of no return for the regime where their minimal war aims are fundamentally incompatible with ukraine s and now cannot be easily revised said michael kofman of the cna think tank one of the capabilities that can be delivered to ukraine relatively quickly and in numbers is german made leopard tanks rasmussen said though berlin still refuses to deliver them citing the lack of heavy armor donated by other major powers the issue as well as air defenses is expected to be on the table at nato s gathering of defense ministers next week in brussels which will also feature a meeting of the 50 nation ukraine defense contact group as it grapples with how to equip ukraine for the next steps in the war and the long uncertain winter months ahead advertisement advertisement as a european i m embarrassed by what i would consider very modest european contributions to the fight in ukraine rasmussen said while i have to admit that it has increased in recent months the germans could do more they should deliver the leopard tanks and france should deliver more caesar mobile howitzers the ukrainians desperately need those capabilities so i hope that the two countries will step up their endeavors rasmussen said the plan he and yermak delivered to zelenskyy would in the long run take the pressure off of europe and the u s to equip the ukrainian military since rebuilding the shattered ukrainian industrial base would allow kyiv to provide for its own defense rasmussen kicked off his tour of western capitals in washington visiting the white house and capitol hill before heading to europe to pitch the plan it s important to tell putin that this is not only a year s worth of weapons deliveries from the west and we aren t speaking about deploying our troops on ukrainian soil he said it s really to make them capable of defending themselves in the long term view comments

a major problem the us surpasses 31 trillion in debt made worse by rising interest rates and this is who holds the ious a major problem the us surpasses 31 trillion in debt made worse by rising interest rates and this is who holds the ious the gross national debt in america surpassed 31 trillion for the first time according to a u s treasury report in october the number climbed to 31 3 trillion in december if you find that hard to wrap your head around it basically boils down to 93 878 of debt for every person in the country according to the peter g peterson foundation advertisement advertisement and with the dramatic rise in interest rates over the past few months the fed funds rate target is currently between 4 25 and 4 50 the national debt will be growing at a rate that makes it even harder to ignore interest rates are a major problem says phillip braun clinical professor of finance at north western university s kellogg school of management the treasury finances the debt with a lot of short term borrowing it ll push other budgetary items out don t miss better than nfts you don t have to be ultra rich to own a piece of a pablo picasso here s how to enter the fine art market hold onto your money jeff bezos says you might want to rethink buying a new automobile refrigerator or whatever here are 3 better recession proof buys americans are paying nearly 40 more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago here s how to spend less on peace of mind the last couple of years have been expensive a deficit is what happens when the government spends more money in a fiscal year than it brings in through taxes and the last couple of years have been expensive several large bills with hefty price tags have been approved since the start of the pandemic including the american rescue plan act which cost 1 9 trillion and 750 billion for student debt relief all adding to the deficit which then adds to the debt and though the inflation reduction act which was passed in august is expected to reduce the deficit by 240 billion policies and programs brought in by the biden administration are expected to add trillions more over the next decade the committee for a responsible federal budget a non profit that addresses federal budget and fiscal issues estimates that 4 8 trillion will be added to the deficit by 2031 excessive borrowing will lead to continued inflationary pressures drive the national debt to a new record as soon as 2030 and triple federal interest payments over the next decade or even sooner if interest rates go up faster or by more than expected says the crfb much of the borrowing in the past couple of years happened while interest rates were historically low but now that they re not with inflation rising at the fastest pace in decades the cost of this debt will be amplified story continues having the government debt being 1 2 times larger than the economy is not a very good thing says braun and it really jumped up because of the pandemic but even before that it s been rising since the great recession read more the 10 best investing apps for once in a generation opportunities even if you re a beginner currently more than 965 million is spent every day just in interest on the national debt the peter g peterson foundation estimates that will triple over the next decade making it the fastest growing item in the federal budget and when the government owes a lot it makes it harder for corporations to borrow money advertisement advertisement the federal debt squeezes out other debts in the economy says braun there s only so much money in the economy and so with the government borrowing such large amounts there s only so much that people are willing to lend overall in the economy so it pushes out other types of borrowing the government could have refinanced its debt while interest rates were low he says but it didn t which means the borrowing costs today and into the future are unnecessarily higher because of that says braun so who owns america s national debt there are different kinds of national debt think about it like having a credit card a mortgage and a car payment all debt but different the u s department of the treasury manages the national debt which is split into two different types debt that one government agency owes to another and debts that are held by the public intragovernmental debt accounts for about 6 5 trillion of the debt the much bigger piece of the debt is held by the public right now that s about 24 trillion foreign governments as well as banks and private investors state and local governments and the federal reserve own most of this debt and it s held in treasury securities bills and bonds advertisement advertisement foreign governments and private investors are one of the biggest holders of the public debt owning around 7 7 trillion domestically the federal reserve holds the largest share of the public debt at about 40 but there is good news when it comes to the debt the federal reserve owns the federal reserve owns a lot of government debt says braun the treasury does pay interest payments to the federal reserve but then the federal reserve turns around and gives it back to the treasury that alleviates some of the issues a warning sign ultimately rising interest rates will only exacerbate the national debt making it harder for the government to respond to a slowing economy for too long policymakers have assumed perpetually low interest rates and we are now seeing in real time how dangerous that assumption is said michael a

rising inflation and looming recessions are squeezing household finances but businesses also worry about an economic downturn this is not just because of higher bills but also because consumers spend less and finance from banks and investors dries up when the economy worsens even strong industries such as technology feel these effects with the standard poor s 500 stock market index down 17 in the year to date and the nasdaq 100 tech sector index down 33 market uncertainties can affect a company s ability or willingness to spend on the type of innovation that can help build strength in advance of the next downturn but research into business recoveries following previous financial crises shows that some companies do increase investment in innovation to survive this makes them more resilient in the face of future downturns jp morgan chase the largest bank in america by assets for example did relatively well during the last financial crisis this was partially due to its diversification efforts it emerged from the 2008 crisis with a fortress balance sheet and an improved position versus other banks which has helped it navigate the more recent global pandemic businesses in sectors such as tech and finance are now attempting to weather the current slump by protecting their businesses with similar strategies this route has also been proven effective by other studies which demonstrate that innovative companies achieved higher sales growth rates than non innovative companies during past recessions and that is a key determinant for success especially in the long run still justifying spending on future growth is difficult when times are tough recent months have brought job losses recruitment freezes and delayed plans for tech startups to list themselves on stock exchanges even the giants of the tech space have experienced financial difficulties amazon s pandemic slump continued during the second quarter apple s revenue rose slightly but profits fell and facebook owner meta reported its first ever quarterly revenue decline and yet some companies are maintaining stronger growth prospects than others microsoft expects its revenue and operating income to increase at a double digit pace over the next 12 months its efforts to prepare for this recession started well before 2022 the company s focus on newer areas such as cloud computing in recent years is now helping it to manage the impact of factory shutdowns in china and falling demand for pcs that have inevitably hit sales of the windows operating system software instead microsoft is now signing larger deals for its azure cloud computing software moving clients to pricier versions of office cloud programmes and has switched to a subscription based model for its software products and services versus its previous one time buy offering what microsoft has recognised is that cloud computing along with other deep technological trends such as web3 the next generation of the internet artificial intelligence and machine learning are here to stay being the first to build new capabilities in these areas provides an important long term advantage in many industries also the success of tech companies with a single offering has reversed in 2022 from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2021 many single idea businesses saw a boost from people being stuck at home for work and play think remote cycling app peloton zoom netflix and trading platform robinhood in the current economic environment however investors expect businesses to generate a healthy cash flow and are no longer willing to lavish highly valued companies known as unicorns in the tech world with unending capital this means companies may need to find other ways to pay for expansion and diversification during difficult times future ready businesses the companies that are ready for the future are the ones that can deliver immediately while also building their next new innovative product or service recent research has shown businesses that are more resilient anticipate cope with and then adapt to new circumstances at the international institute for management development imd in switzerland i am part of a group of researchers who have developed an index to rank companies on this ability to adapt and become future ready we use a score based on data from 24 variables grouped across seven factors financial fundamentals investors expectations of future growth business diversity employee diversity and environmental social and governance awareness research and development early results of innovation efforts and cash and debt positions this research shows that future ready companies whether in finance technology or some other sectors exhibit very similar traits financial technology companies fintech start ups that aim to disrupt industries like financial services were a darling during the pandemic paypal and block formerly square topped our ranking in the financial service industry in 2021 but this year they have been replaced at the top by several more traditional industry titans including financial firms jpmorgan chase and dbs bank of singapore as fintech companies have increasingly attempted to bypass traditional financial services providers with digital services these companies have started to expand their businesses digitally dbs has developed a marketplaces for selling cars renting property and getting deals on electricity mobile and broadband services the bank s latest quarterly earnings remained robust despite weak markets and were its second highest on record still growth did not happen across all business segments for dbs in 2022 it s income from areas such as wealth management and investment banking decreased because these markets are slowing down however income from consumer lending insurance and card fees grew this shows how a diverse business can remain resilient in today s business environment amazon is also diversifying into yet another new business despite current economic uncertainty it recently announced it has agreed to buy primary healthcare firm one medical for us 3 9 billion pound 3 2 billion one medical is a membership based primary care provider that operates in 16 us markets this is not the first time amazon has dabbled in healthcare it teamed up with jpmorgan and berkshire hathaway four years ago to create haven which

pharmacy purchased in 2018 for 753 million and the creation of an in house telemedicine service for its employees called amazon care its latest foray with one medical is a great example of the long

despite programs to spur affordable housing development the number of affordable housing units has seen a sharp decline example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video san diego in the throes of a housing crisis and surging rent prices the city of san diego saw a steep decline in the number of permits it issued for housing units dedicated to lower income individuals and families last year according to data from the california department of housing the city issued 451 permits for very low to low income housing units in 2021 the lowest number since 2018 and a fraction of the 1 254 very low to low housing units that were permitted in 2020 in addition to dropping housing units for low and very low income earners local developers in san diego continue to build market rate housing for those earning more than san diego s median income which is 106 900 a year state housing data shows that permits for above moderate income earners which means those making more than 120 of the median annual income remained steady since 2019 the decline raises concerns about the city s ability to increase the affordable housing stock and its means to meet affordable housing requirements set by the state very low income housing according to the san diego housing commission very low income units are for those who earn 50 percent of the median income which for a single individual means an annual salary of less than 45 550 or 65 050 for a family of four in 2021 the city issued 186 permits for very low income units 751 units fewer than in 2020 when developers obtained 937 very low income housing permits last year s number of very low income units was the lowest since 2018 low income housing the number of permits for low income housing units saw a similar drop in 2021 last year the city issued permits for 265 low income units in san diego whereas in 2020 that number was 768 it was the lowest total number of low income permits since 2019 since 2018 the vast majority of permits for affordable housing units have been for developments near downtown in mission valley and san ysidro while other communities such as those along the coast have seen no proposals above moderate income housing meanwhile according to the data developers continue to focus on market rate housing units for san diego s top income earners the number of housing units that were permitted for above moderate income earners saw only a slight drop in 2021 last year developers obtained permits for 4 563 market rate housing units around 200 less than 2020 s total of 4 774 housing units the drop in affordable housing units comes despite city programs aimed to spur development in an effort to encourage developers to build more affordable housing units previous mayor kevin faulconer implemented programs such as establishing transit priority areas allowing developers to forego parking requirements in high transit areas as well as the complete communities program which allows developers to build higher and increase density if they agree to set aside 40 percent of the units for low and moderate income households but those longer term policies to address the housing shortage does little for those currently in need of affordable housing margarita diaz and her two children share a one bedroom apartment in city heights diaz says she has searched citywide for a two bedroom apartment for her and her children but has been unable to find anything under 3 000 a month diaz who works full time but would be considered in the very low income category says even if she could afford 3 000 a month she doesn t have the three months rent needed to qualify nor does she have a great credit score i just haven t had any luck says diaz i just feel like everything is so difficult because i don t have the income and i mean i m not the only one i have co workers that are single parents and they re going through the same thing it s really hard to pay your rent pay your bills and if you have debt then pay that off as well parisa ijadi maghsoodi is a civil rights attorney who specializes in issues of poverty including affordable housing policy ijadi maghsoodi says the city isn t doing enough to use evidence based approaches to lure more affordable units to san diego and protect those who are at risk of losing their homes when it comes to the city s policy ijadi maghsoodi says talk is cheap and the city has thus far failed to act we know that without incentives government incentives extremely low income very low income and low income housing is not going to be built and that is why the numbers that we see are not surprising it was completely predictable that we would be in the affordable housing crisis that we re in because of government inaction in our region that inaction deciding not to act was a decision on the city s part added ijadi maghsoodi we know housing is being built we see housing being built but what the numbers show is we are not mandating and enforcing the inclusionary provisions to require the building of income for all housing groups in addition ijadi maghsoodi says the city has historically and is currently refuses to adopt both long and short term solutions to address the housing crisis and san diego s surging homeless population she says without addressing rent control and implementing requirements that all housing developments include an affordable housing component then the problem will only get worse we must take tangible steps to preserve existing affordable housing and to incentivize the development of affordable housing ensuring that when we talk about affordable housing we re talking about extremely low very low and low income families mayor todd gloria s push for more affordable units mayor todd gloria s office says the mayor is doing just that in a statement to cbs 8 gloria says the only way to end the housing crunch while simultaneously addressing homelessness is to build more homes in more areas of the city homelessness and high rents are the results of decades of statewide and local policies that made it extremely difficult to build homes gloria said in a statement to cbs 8 if we re going to reduce homelessness and have any chance of lowering the cost of housing we must build more homes as quickly as possible gloria says he has implemented several new initiatives in hopes of making it easier and faster to put a roof over the head of every san diegan at a price they can afford those initiatives include programs that open up communities near transit areas and with fewer than five percent affordable housing units to projects that propose 100 percent affordable housing units and density bonus units gloria s office says the administration also plans to address the affordable housing shortage by expanding the complete communities program as well as updating community plans to speed up the development process and increase density in some communities gloria s office also says the city is moving forward to use city owned land for more affordable housing projects city of san diego planning director heidi vonblum says that her department has shifted away from the previous administration s focus on just building more units and more towards building more affordable units while many of the city s housing programs that have recently been put into place under prior administrations have been successful at spurring new home development they largely neglected issues related to affordability and fair housing opportunities said vonblum the mayor s most recent as well as upcoming proposals are focused on not just increasing home opportunities but increasing them in places that will afford san diegans of all incomes access to transit safe and enjoyable biking and walking in all communities and in homes that meet their needs including homes for families with children and inter generational families watch related san diego city council board of

we will begin with the obvious the markets have been volatile in 2022 there have been several short term fast fluctuations riddled with emotion in just the last few weeks we have seen a broad based sell off fueled by investor pessimism we all know that investing is a lifetime endeavor markets are dynamic and will do whatever is necessary to confuse the masses a successful long term investment program will depend on making many good decisions in the short term decisions that will allow the portfolio to adapt to the changing market conditions as they occur this is particularly true when markets get volatile and the bear raises its head when least expected it s important to always remember that making money during good times means nothing if you can t keep it during the difficult periods content continues below advertisement for the first time since the financial crisis in 2008 we are now in a true bear market bear markets do not necessarily mean that you have no alternative but to endure substantial financial damage times have changed and we have many more alternatives for managing bear markets in both stocks and bonds than we had before this update will begin with an overview of why 2022 is different from any market environment we have seen since the end of the first quarter in 2009 over 12 years ago the overview will be followed by explaining the anatomy of a bear market we will finish with a brief discussion about adaptive portfolio management and how to potentially benefit from the existing high volatility instead of being punished by it now that we are through the first 9 months of 2022 most investors should be reminded of how a real bear market feels through the conclusion of september the s p 500 is down 24 the nasdaq is down 32 5 and the 20 year treasury bond is down 29 the current market environment cannot be confused with a rare trading anomaly like we saw at the beginning of the covid crisis in 2020 in 2020 we saw an example of what canterbury calls a mega trading anomaly the s p 500 dropped 32 over just 23 trading days the market then rallied back to breakeven just 5 months later the current bear market appears to be a long drawn out affair this bear is showing no signs of ending anytime soon the markets this year below we have provided bullet points to highlight the wild swings seen in the bear market of 2022 so far the year s theme has been about market volatility this was particularly true during the 3rd quarter the second quarter ended as the s p 500 recovered from its june low from mid june through mid august the market rallied 17 in just 2 months at the time the market index was still down 10 from the high that was established in the first week of the year from mid june through mid august the market rallied 17 in just 2 months at the time the market index was still down 10 from the high that was established in the first week of the year the 17 advance was quickly followed by a 17 move in the opposite direction to end the quarter that is a lot of volatility in just the month of september the s p 500 fell 9 3 which is the worst september since 2002 the month had 8 outlier days a trading day beyond 1 50 put into perspective according to accepted mathematical statistics the s p 500 would be expected to have only 13 total outlier days for an entire year the month had 8 outlier days a trading day beyond 1 50 put into perspective according to accepted mathematical statistics the s p 500 would be expected to have only 13 total outlier days for an entire year there have been 62 outlier days in 2022 more than 4 5 years worth of outliers september s decline was broadly felt even the most defensive sectors like consumer staples energy and utilities felt the impact of market volatility even the most defensive sectors like consumer staples energy and utilities felt the impact of market volatility the issues facing many conservative investors has not only been about the bear market in stocks the bigger issue is about the corresponding bear market in bonds during september alone long term treasuries were down 8 bringing their decline in 2022 to a whopping 29 worse yet the 20 year treasury bond is down 40 from its all time high in 2020 8 bringing their decline in 2022 to a whopping 29 worse yet the 20 year treasury bond is down 40 from its all time high in 2020 a balanced allocation of 60 stock and 40 bonds would be down about 22 on the year in other words the traditional conservative asset allocation has been anything but conservative bear market anatomy bear markets as we have seen this year are characterized by having high volatility and outlier days that far exceed what would be predicted by statistical analysis bear markets are counter intuitive and will tend to rally when investors are the most pessimistic financial markets are known as being a leading indicator of changing fundamental data in other words it is typical for a market or security to advance prior to a good report this is because some investors will become aware of new information and will react to it quickly other investors may be less informed or are generally slower to see changes and are slower to react there is a popular wall street saying buy on the rumor and sell on the news on the other hand the same is true when investors react to bad news particularly during bear markets the difference is that investors are more skittish during bear markets and they are more likely to overreact to the day to day news events their emotional actions contribute to increasing volatility when you think about it behavioral finance and human psychology will logically have an impact on liquid financial markets you can see this in real time in 2022 the market has seen several emotional swings both up a down investors have felt a different emotion during every one of these swings which coincides with the market s short term movement the chart below shows investor sentiment at each market peak and trough during 2022 investors have felt more bearish at the troughs prior to a rebound and less bearish as the s p 500 has gone higher and put in a relative peak source american association of individual investors sentiment survey data chart created using optuma technical analysis software visually bear markets will establish a chart pattern of lower lows and lower highs which can be seen above bear markets will also have large short term fluctuations over shorter time periods therefore bear markets will be more volatile and are more likely to have sharp parabolic declines followed by equally sharp short term advances this has been seen over and over again in 2022 at the end of the 3rd quarter pessimism was at its highest level since 2009 this would give an indication of a rally to soon follow the extent and timing of the coming advance are unknown variables but when pessimism is at a high it puts the market in a position to do the opposite of what most would expect and that is to see a rally there are three primary certainties about bear markets bear markets are volatile the market movements in both directions tend to be bigger than what are seen during bull markets and they happen fast the biggest up days and rallies tend to occur during bear markets in other words if you want to catch a rally you should add money to equity following a sharp decline when pessimism is at the highest this is the case because bear market rallies happen so fast that if you are not already in it will be hard to be able to get in quickly enough before the rally ends all bear markets will eventually be followed by a new bull market the goal of successful adaptive portfolio management is to manage the bear market by adjusting the holdings in a way to maintain a high benefit of diversification own securities with low correlation low correlation creates low volatility a portfolio with low volatility will benefit from the markets fluctuations instead of being punished by it remember volatility is the killer of long term compounding of returns adaptive portfolio management canterbury s primary objective is to manage our portfolio in a manner that will benefit from extended bear markets like the one that we are currently experiencing in both the stock and bond markets we use a process called adaptive portfolio management an adaptive portfolio should adjust its diversification in a way to maintain what we call an efficient portfolio or one that has consistent low volatility through variable market environments one way to measure consistent low volatility is through a concept we discuss often and mentioned earlier in this piece outlier days as discussed an outlier day is any trading day that exceeds 1 50 as mentioned earlier an outlier day statistically should occur once every twenty trading days or thirteen times per year so far in 2022 the market has experienced 62 outlier days six times the expected amount to this point in the year although the metric is slightly different for bonds twenty year treasuries have experienced 46 days beyond 1 50 and one balanced vanguard 60 stock 40 bond mutual fund has experienced 21 outlier days so far this year year to date canterbury s adaptive portfolio strategy the canterbury portfolio thermostat has experienced only 8 outlier days which is what you expect to experience in a normal market environment with limited volatility even with that limited volatility it takes more than limiting outlier days to benefit from a bear market an adaptive portfolio needs to limit declines but also participate in the sharp bear market rallies that are common and expected in today s market environment too much of a good thing limiting declines will not benefit from bear markets unless the portfolio can also participate in the bear market rallies because of this an adaptive portfolio will increase its exposure to equities during the declines to best participate in the rallies that soon follow right now the canterbury portfolio thermostat has fluctuated significantly less than the overall markets and has had half the volatility of even the most conservative of balanced portfolios now it is in a position to benefit from any upward market momentum with new exposure to technology based indexes while also holding more defensive sectors like energy utilities the us dollar and inverse positions in financials and emerging markets which move in the opposite direction of their underlying indexes bottom line the month of september was a difficult one for many investors no matter how they were invested the broad selloff was felt across the board in all sectors whether they be technology related financials or more defensive sectors like utilities and energy as a matter of fact virtually every asset class outside of the us dollar and inverse securities is in a bear market state with high volatility this bear market has made investors expect the unexpected it was uncommon to see a trading day beyond 1 50 in 2021 in fact the s p 500 only experienced 18 of them now we have seen 62 outlier days and the year still has a quarter left to go a day beyond 1 50 feels like a new normal the decline experienced last month to end the third quarter has made many market participants feel like throwing in the towel and staying away from the markets this is particularly true for those who consider themselves conservative investors where bonds have done virtually nothing to offset the risks of a declining stock market benefitting from a bear market takes an evidence based adaptive process bear markets are full of the unexpected when you think things are bad then you have another decline when you find yourself feeling the most pessimistic the market rallies no one can predict the markets the market already knows what we know and it knows it before we know it having a process like the canterbury portfolio thermostat allows an investor to take the largest disadvantage of bear markets which are volatile fluctuations and potentially turn them into an advantage by limiting portfolio declines and benefitting from market swings with the process we have outlined in this

an lpl financial advisor scammed a widow in her 90s out of more than a million dollars over eight years before the firm detected any problems according to the securities and exchange commission in a sept 29 filing in chicago federal court the regulator charged barred former financial advisor bradley a goodbred with defrauding a 97 year old woman who has since been diagnosed with dementia for 1 3 million the regulator alleges that goodbred used his trusted relationship with the widow and her power of attorney to convince her to invest in phony real estate products goodbred 54 operated his roselle illinois based practice under brokerage affiliation with lpl for the entire time he was allegedly steering the client s money toward his personal use between 2012 and 2020 the scheme outlined in the sec s case bears similarities with other fraud cases targeting older adults in which a trusted advisor targets a vulnerable client in 2021 more than 92 000 victims who were 61 or older reported fraud losses of 1 7 billion according to the fbi goodbred convinced the client to invest in a real estate investment trust by selling part of her holdings then using the proceeds to write a check to his business investigators say rather than investing the sums in a reit he spent the money on personal expenses according to the sec goodbred s previously unmarked disciplinary record and the frequency of clients cashing out part of their portfolios for the purposes of say buying a home would make it difficult for wealth managers like lpl to detect anything amiss according to fraud expert douglas schulz of invest securities consulting schulz also faults regulators for the billion dollar fraud losses for going after low hanging fruit rather than imposing enforcement actions that would make cases like goodbred s more costly to lpl and other large brokerages he said the reason that the industry doesn t clean itself up is because it s just a cost of doing business schulz said finra and sec rules absolutely require the broker dealers to monitor their licensed agents like a hawk it s not immediately clear whether the regulators are investigating lpl for any potential supervisory cases or whether goodbred will face criminal charges because authorities have policies against disclosing pending cases goodbred who had known the client for more than 20 years gave her back more than 300 000 between 2013 and 2014 and another 147 000 in march after the discovery of the scam according to the sec in august lpl paid the client s successor trustee a settlement of more than 1 2 million finra brokercheck shows an attorney who represented goodbred before finra in its case barring him from the industry in february 2021 declined to discuss the case representatives for lpl which disclosed regulatory and compliance charges totaling 29 million over the past 12 months ending in july compared to more than 1 billion in earnings didn t respond to requests for comment the client s late husband introduced her to goodbred prior to his 2006 death after which she lived alone their children had died earlier as well goodbred positioned himself as a friend and confidant to her according to the sec a year after he first sold her on the phony reit investments she appointed him the investment advisor of her trust account and later endowed him with her power of attorney for property and health purposes according to investigators when lpl eventually fired goodbred in january 2021 the firm cited allegations that he used unapproved power of attorney to facilitate distribution of customer funds to a real estate company according to brokercheck a successor trustee who was the first to recognize any concerns with their relationship later filed an arbitration case that expressly linked goodbred s power of attorney to the fraud brokercheck shows it s not clear what kind of a reit or returns goodbred was pitching to the woman she transferred the proceeds of her stock sales from her trust into her bank account and wrote 10 checks between 2012 and 2020 to his real estate company according to the sec the company northern lights properties owns four single family rental homes goodbred s disclosure of the outside business activity on brokercheck states that company didn t hold onto the money for long goodbred used the money to pay credit card bills for himself and his wife along with income taxes and auto loan debt among other outlays according to the sec the estate s successor trustee finally broke the case open in september 2020 when the client s cognitive condition necessitated the hiring of a professional care manager goodbred terminated the caretaker and refused the trustee s request for a medical examination according to the sec in addition he didn t comply with the trustee s multiple demands to provide copies of the client s bank statements investigators say meanwhile the client received the dementia diagnosis in december 2020 and moved into the memory care unit of an assisted living facility lpl received a complaint in november 2020 about the possibility that goodbred might be exercising inappropriate discretion over the client s trust account the complaint states the firm subsequently began its investigation and fired him in february 2021 the sec s case charges goodbred with five violations of antifraud laws and seeks disgorgement of ill gotten gains

more than 9 000 markup to its price ferraro a 44 year old radford virginia resident who was not charged in the criminal indictment with costello did not immediately respond to a request for comment from cnbc ferraro is accused of using the twitter account with the handle computerbux which had almost 10 000 followers in late 2019 in the scheme soon after costello failed to surrender thursday the fbi issued a wanted poster featuring costello noting he was a fugitive he may be traveling with his wife katrina rosseini who is not a fugitive said that poster which included multiple photos of costello some of which included rosseini the poster noted that the couple might be traveling with their small dog named harry on tuesday night costello was arrested by an fbi swat team in el cajon california in san diego county according to emily langlie a spokeswoman for the u s attorney s office for the western district of washington on wednesday morning costello was taken to a hospital after complaining of health issues langlie said it is not yet known when he will make his first appearance in federal court in california fbi chris rasmussen a las vegas attorney who represents rosseini told cnbc on thursday that she was not with costello when he was a fugitive she was on the other side of the country rasumussen said the attorney said that he sought to contact costell trying to get him to surrender but she couldn t get ahold of him we had no way to contact him rasmussen said rosseini had no involvement at all in any of the alleged criminal conduct of her husband she was never a suspect never a target nothing said rasmussen the apprehension of costello was welcome news to steven selna an oakland california lawyer whose client ccsac inc was one of the three cannabis companies allegedly swindled by costello ccsac has a pending lawsuit against costello and his companies in u s district court for the northern district of california over his failure despite claims to the contrary to pay 2 2 million in taxes to the state of california on ccsac s behalf from its account at pacific banking corp selna told cnbc that costello was holding at least 2 9 million that belongs to ccsac which he said has a major presence in california through retail and distribution operations the firm which plans to expand to the east coast in 2023 believes its monetary loss from costello may be as high as 5 million the criminal indictment against costello accuses him of fraudulently diverting 300 000 of ccsac s money deposited with pacific banking to purchase shares in a publicly traded shell company in 2019 for the purposes of ultimately completing a reverse merger with costello s then privately held company grn holding corp grn s shares became publicly traded as a result of that merger grn holding s most recent sec filing says costello resigned as ceo of the company in april the same month that he sold 144 million shares of grn holding to its current ceo for 140 000 the indictment also says that at various times during costello s alleged schemes he described another company he ran grn funds llc as having more than 1 billion under management and 600 million under deposit that claim was not true the complaint says according to the indictment a judge in the civil case filed against costello by ccsac last month ordered him to declare under the penalty of perjury the name of the financial institution and other details about the account where the balance of ccsac s funds was being held costello submitted a sworn declaration saying that at least 2 9 million in ccsac s funds were being held in a credit union in tacoma washington in the name of grn funds llc the indictment notes but contrary to that claim the grn funds checking account at the credit union has a balance of 15 35 as of september 9 2022 the indictment said all we re interested in is getting our client s money back said selna ccsac s attorney if it facilitates that it s a good thing he said referring to costello s arrest selna also said that costello in dealings with ccsac certainly presented himself as being highly successful in this industry and that he would protect our client s money and that wasn t true the indictment says that when costello solicited funds from investors he made false claims that included saying he graduated from the university of minnesota and had a master s degree in business administration from harvard he also claimed to have served two tours in iraq as a member of the special forces and been shot twice leaving shrapnel in his leg the complaint says source fbi costello also falsely said he was a billionaire he managed money for wealthy individuals including a saudi sheikh and he had 14 years of experience on wall street the indictment said none of that is true a press release by u s attorney brown s office said the indictment says that in 2019 when an online article questioned costello s statements about his education he had grn holding corp issue an 8 k filing with the sec which stated that costello was a graduate of winona state university with a degree in public administration who attended harvard university but did not graduate this statement was also misleading the indictment said it noted that costello only took one course in harvard s continuing education program that same year costello had grn holdings issue a press release stating it had nonbinding letters of intent to acquire at least 10 companies and that in the following months it issued 10 press releases announcing the completion of due diligence for each company the indictment said filings by grn holding with the sec also reflected those claims but grn holding corporation never completed the acquisitions of the companies even though justin costello was an affiliate shareholder owner or manager of each company the indictment said most of the companies were instead acquired by renewal fuels inc another traded company controlled by justin costello and contrary to costello s claims to investors in grn holdings the companies had little or no revenue or assets the indictment said between july 2019 and may 2021 over 7 500 investors purchased and sold grn holding corporate stock while justin costello was making and continuing to be made the material misrepresentations concerning grn holding the indictment said collectively these investors lost approximately 25 million

pound josh brown says these rallies are all guilty until proven innocent josh brown does not trust the monster two day rally we had this week there are very few stocks in uptrend right now brown said thursday on cnbc s halftime report and that is why i think these rallies are all guilty until proven innocent while the two day rally this week was notable the investor does not expect that anything fundamental has changed in the market which he believes continues to point to a downtrend we re going to have these rips but like the market gets turned away from the 200 day all the time this year and until that changes i don t think there s any reason that anybody should change their mind from the current psychology and that lower high lower low trap that we ve been in really since january 3rd is still intact he said still brown identified the few sectors that are working for investors in a volatile market he said investors should find names the energy sector where a broad majority of stocks are trading above the 200 day moving average or are in a definite uptrend investors can also search out stocks in the consumer staples and health care both of which still have names that are in an uptrend it s really not a complicated market to figure out he said sarah min fed governor lisa cook sees ongoing rate hikes likely federal reserve governor lisa cook in a speech thursday advocated a strong focus on inflation which she said will necessitate the need for more interest rate increases with inflation running well above our 2 percent longer run goal restoring price stability likely will require ongoing rate hikes and then keeping policy restrictive for some time until we are confident that inflation is firmly on the path toward our 2 percent goal the central bank official said in remarks for a speech before the peterson institute for international economics with the fed largely expected to approve its fourth consecutive 0 75 percentage point increase at its next meeting in early november cook said she has supported the path of policy so far but noted that there will be a time to re evaluate at some point as we continue to tighten monetary policy it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess the effects of our cumulative tightening on the economy and inflation she said in any case the path of policy should depend on how quickly we

recommendation on credit suisse to neutral from underweight with a december 2023 price target of chf 6 the zurich based bank last closed at a total market capitalization of about 11 billion the bank has more than 700 billion in private banking assets under management that is expected to generate a 15 return on tangible equity in 2024 abouhossein said in his note we see 15bn as minimum value today

is expected to disclose its restructuring plan by oct 27 the analyst said in either of two possible scenarios charted out by the research team credit suisse should be bolstered by the minimum value of its european wealth management operations according to abouhossein although other analysts have said that the bank may need to raise as much as chf 6 billion to pull off its restructuring the jpmorgan

pause i think we re quite a ways away from a pause he said thursday during a q a session kashkari didn t specify how far he thinks the fed has to go estimates in september from the federal open market committee of which kashkari is an alternate member this year point to another 1 5 percentage points of rate hikes into 2023 pushing rates higher is likely to mean business failures from areas where risk was excessive kashkari conceded but he added that shouldn t deter the fed in its quest to pull inflation back down to 2 by the fed s preferred measure of personal consumption expenditures prices

by j keith buchanan cfa portfolio manager a few times this year we have revisited the topic of corporate earnings as a pulse check on risk markets particularly equity markets macroeconomic crosswinds these days are persistently unprecedented one could make that same statement about the economy since early 2020 we have experienced historic development after historic development but now the market is faced with one central question can our economic momentum coming out of the pandemic induced recession of spring 2020 withstand inflationary pressures and tightening monetary policy so far the results have been mixed real gdp has declined over the last two quarters an indication of softening demand while the labor market has been resilient with unemployment at historically low levels there is no surefire north star for investing in times like this but in my opinion watching what companies are saying about their businesses going forward is very telling and can give a picture of what can be expected for broader macroeconomic trends content continues below advertisement we saw this case in point with fedex s recent preannouncement the market sold off the next day as investors digested fedex s ceo comments about slowing demand and an impending recession a few days later ford issued its own profit warning this was all after general electric warned that supply chain issues were having a negative impact on profits the market collectively began to question if our expectations for corporate profits are fair given the current environment but what does the market expect the market expects 3 2 earnings growth in the 3rd quarter of 2022 which will soon be reported however the s p 500 is trading at 15 8 times forward earnings which is below the 10 year average of 17 we interpret this development to indicate that the market has doubts about expected earnings which raises the importance of the upcoming corporate earnings reporting season will companies confirm the fears of the marketplace if the reaction to fedex s preannouncement is any indication stocks still have the propensity to inject fresh selling pressure if companies confirm pessimism surrounding the demand environment and competitive dynamics will companies stave off doubts about their revenue growth opportunities and profitability for full year 2022 analysts are projecting revenue growth of 10 7 and earnings growing slower at 7 7 this implies a level of margin degradation that carries with it the potential to be refuted by company results and commentary inflationary expectations are real and have caused a reckoning of sorts across all asset classes however the degree to which corporations can manage and pass along those cost pressures is yet to be determined each earnings reporting season enlightens onlookers to certain aspects of our current economic condition this 3rd quarter of 2022 earnings season will be no different market participants will look to make progress toward

vienna london opec looks set for deep oil output cuts when it meets on wednesday curbing supply in an already tight market despite pressure from the united states and other consuming countries to pump more the potential opec cut could spur a recovery in oil prices that have dropped to about 90 from 120 three months ago due to fears of a global economic recession rising u s interest rates and a stronger dollar opec which includes saudi arabia and russia is working on cuts in excess of 1 million barrels per day sources told reuters this week one opec source said on tuesday the cuts could amount to up to 2 million barrels per day sources said it remained unclear if reductions could include additional voluntary cuts by members such as saudi arabia or if cuts could include existing under production by the group opec has been under producing over 3 million bpd and the inclusion of those barrels would dilute the impact of new cuts higher oil prices if driven by sizable production cuts would likely irritate the biden administration ahead of u s midterm elections citi analysts said in a note there could be further political reactions from the u s including additional releases of strategic stocks along with some wildcards including further fostering of a nopec bill citi said referring to a u s anti trust bill against opec saudi arabia and other members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and allied producers opec have said they seek to prevent volatility rather than to target a particular oil price on tuesday international benchmark brent crude rose 3 above 91 per barrel the west has accused russia of weaponizing energy as europe suffers from a severe energy crisis and may face gas and power rationing this winter in a blow to its industry moscow accuses the west of weaponizing the dollar and financial systems such as swift in retaliation for russia sending troops into ukraine in february the west accuses moscow of invading ukraine while russia calls it a special military operation russia has formed part of the opec club since 2016 the group has cut and raised output to manage the oil market but has rarely made cuts when the market is tight a significant cut is likely to anger the united states which has pressured saudi arabia to pump more to pressure oil prices and reduce revenue for russia saudi arabia has not condemned moscow s actions and relations are strained between the kingdom and the administration of u s president joe biden who traveled to riyadh this year but failed to secure any firm cooperation commitments on energy
it was a mini budget with a major impact shortly after the uk chancellor announced his plans for a new era full of tax cuts there were dramatic falls in the pound a nervous response from mortgage lenders and an urgent intervention from the bank of england such high levels of uncertainty especially during a cost of living crisis have led to widespread criticism of liz truss s new government and a huge boost in the polls for the labour party aside from a u turn on ditching a tax cut for the highest earners at the time of writing truss appears to be sticking to most of her plan but she should take note perhaps of the way her predecessors in no 10 have dealt with economic whirlwinds of the past for there have been plenty some of their effects lasted years and caused major political upheaval here s a reminder of some of them the 1931 devaluation crisis in september 1931 the uk was forced to abandon the gold standard the cornerstone of its economic policy and devalue the pound it was a humiliating moment which came after the british economy and its finances had been severely weakened by the first world war and its aftermath from 1925 the bank of england had kept interest rates high to keep the pound at a fixed parity to gold but by 1931 with rising unemployment and banks failing throughout europe this was not enough as gold reserves drained from the bank it was forced to approach american bankers for a loan to stabilise the currency those bankers demanded drastic public spending cuts as part of the deal including a 20 cut in unemployment benefits the labour prime minister ramsey macdonald believed he had no choice but to agree despite opposition from members of his cabinet and the trade unions in august 1931 macdonald resigned and formed a cross party national government made up mainly of conservatives despite this the pressure on the pound proved too great and in september the gold standard had to be abandoned nevertheless in the following month the national government won a landslide victory attacking the labour party for its economic mismanagement labour did not return to power until 1945 the 1976 imf crisis in september 1976 the uk s economy was in such a poor state that the labour government was forced to go cap in hand to the international monetary fund imf to ask for a record us 3 9 billion loan it was a pivotal moment which seemed to symbolise britain s post war economic decline the uk economy was already facing multiple problems with a growing balance of payments deficit inflation at over 15 an unsustainable government deficit and rising unemployment in return for its support the imf insisted on major cuts to public spending the labour government led by jim callaghan was split over whether to accept these terms but eventually gave in cutting back large swathes of government investment including its council house building programme worse was to come the squeeze on public spending coupled with high inflation led to the government trying to limit pay increases especially in the public sector the 1976 crisis and the subsequent strike wave in the 1978 1979 winter of discontent severely damaged labour s economic credibility opening the way for the election of a conservative government under margaret thatcher the 1992 erm crisis on 16 september 1992 black wednesday the pound came under intense pressure on foreign exchange markets without the support of european central banks britain was forced out of the european exchange rate mechanism erm the centrepiece of government s plan to curb inflation despite desperate measures from the bank of england which raised interest rate in a single day from 10 to 15 that evening the conservative chancellor norman lamont announced that britain was temporarily suspending its membership of the erm after a difficult and turbulent day the conservative government led by john major never fully recovered its reputation for economic credibility while bitter divisions emerged over the future of uk s economic relations with the rest of europe five years later with the economy still weakened and the government cutting spending and raising taxes the labour party under tony blair won a landslide victory in 1997 the 2008 global financial crisis in september 2008 the global financial system suddenly ground to a halt as fear spread throughout the financial system that major banks were insolvent the immediate cause was the collapse of a major us investment bank lehman brothers which held too many risky financial assets with plummeting values it soon became clear that many other banks both in the us and the uk also held too many of these assets as contagion spread governments scrambled to save the entire banking system and the world economy from collapse by october with major british banks running out of cash the labour government nationalised the royal bank of scotland and lloyds while the bank of england provided large undisclosed cash loans to prop them up in total the potential liability to the uk government amounted to pound 1 5 trillion the swift action prevented a global banking collapse which would have crippled the world economy but it still led to a severe and long global recession while the cost of the bailouts led government debt to soar the hard won economic credibility of the labour government under gordon brown was shattered and a conservative liberal democrat coalition government was formed in 2010 in the midst of new market jitters over a looming crisis in the eurozone although these crises had different origins a number of common themes emerge firstly the evidence suggests it is difficult for governments to buck the financial markets when traders have lost confidence in their economic policy credibility in financial markets is fragile it takes a long time to establish can be swiftly lost and hard to recapture the danger for governments is that problems in one financial market can often spillover into others through contagion sometimes with unexpected and global consequences secondly studies have shown that cuts to public spending often one of the most common responses to a crisis can be damaging reductions in spending especially on infrastructure can make it harder to repair the economic damage and stimulate growth finally there is evidence that the damage to a government s economic credibility has long lasting effects on political confidence permanently changing voting intentions weakening support for established parties who have been in power it can lead not only to electoral defeat but disenchantment with the whole political process author steve schifferes honorary research fellow city political economy research centre city university of london
opec went ahead and slashed 2 million barrels a day from production despite the pathetic entreaties from the biden administration the president and his minions went begging hat in hand and got nothing because of mr biden s misbegotten unscientific hysterical obsession over climate change and his holy jihad against american fossil fuels we now find ourselves once again dependent on the middle eastern oil sheikhs wait a minute it s opec nowadays that includes russia that s another opec saudi stick in the eye to america since higher oil prices help finance vladimir putin s war against ukraine in two years really less than two years joe biden has taken this country from former president donald trump s energy independence or dominance to a state of energy dependence on our adversaries we have gone back to the energy stone age americans should prepare for gas prices to keep rising analysts warn remember all the great knee knocking fears surrounding financial markets and the economy in the 1970s 80s 90s and the early 2000s when every opec meeting was surrounded by high drama speculation because the rest of the world feared oil shortages and sky high prices as recently as 2008 not so long ago oil jumped to 150 a barrel largely because of opec and opec price spikes would inevitably lead to high inflation and deep recession that is the situation joe biden s green new deal policies have put us into once again it is a terrible situation it is an unnecessary situation it damages our energy security and our national security only a few trump years ago the u s was producing slightly more than 13 million barrels a day outstripping the saudis and the russians and everybody else by a wide margin our best in the world energy industry was calling the tune on oil and natural gas and gasoline now we are whistling past the graveyard this is what biden has wrought according to the energy information administration we should be at 14 million barrels a day right now on our way to 15 million barrels a day by 2024 instead despite record high prices we are at 11 8 million barrels in the last monthly reading this summer again pre pandemic we were over 13 million so we re about a million and a half barrels short we are also over a million barrels short of gasoline all this thanks to biden s war on fossils another point the baker hughes rig count an indicator of oil and gas drilling is only 604 today it was over 800 during the trump years that s how our private companies have been forced to cut back because of biden s war on permitting drilling fracking pipelining refining and lng terminals closing the fossil spigots has jeopardized not only the economic welfare of our citizens here at home but our national security posture abroad we were an energy powerhouse biden now has given that powerhouse title back to opec on top of that biden is destroying the strategic petroleum reserve that was originally meant to pitch in oil sales during temporary natural disasters and supply oil during wartime emergencies or opec oil embargos instead biden has depleted roughly 50 of the spr for political election year price fixing to suppress gasoline costs at the pump here too the saudis have outwitted him click here to get the fox news app by cutting production the bidens will have to pay high prices to refill the petroleum reserve hoisted on their own petard ironically as opec moves oil prices in their so called october surprise and gas prices edge higher it is the biden democrats who will pay a price at the polls this whole catastrophic scenario is homemade by these global warming central planners who have done so much damage to our economy and our country thank goodness the cavalry is coming this article is adapted from larry kudlow s opening commentary on the october 5 2022 edition of kudlow

index terms adding another 2 3 on top of tuesday s 4 2 as the aussie ten year yield fell another 8 points to 3 65 and the two year 3 points to 3 10 never mind that the rbnz raised kiwi rates by a fifth consecutive 50 points yesterday it is interesting that banks stocks should surge on lower rates which reduce margins but lower rates take the pressure off household stress and weak loan demand never before has a 25 point rba rate hike brought such relief technology was of course the highest percentage gainer adding another 3 9 on top of tuesday s 4 8 as the punters pile in to the most heavily beaten down names as is the case for the nasdaq it s the same story for consumer discretionary adding 2 7 on top of 3 6 as we ll all now rush out and buy stuff again given only a 25 point rate hike in contrast staples which were the outperformers on the way down sat out the session to be the only sector to close just in the red utilities were similarly benign 0 7 while all other sectors posted gains of between 1 0 1 7 we actually managed to get a full five stocks onto the asx200 top five losers board yesterday and a full twenty in the asx300 top twenty losers with smaller miners dominating both tables having led the pack over the prior two soaring sessions the big miners nevertheless took the materials sector up 1 4 energy rose 1 2 on higher oil prices ahead of last night s opec plus meeting that meeting brought a 2m barrel per day production cut when 1m was forecast and 500k was thought possible but having rallied solidly for two sessions the oils were up only 2 last night joe biden will be fuming at the saudis recently having visited to plead for exactly the opposite bond yields were on the move back on wall street overnight but the us stock indices managed only modest falls similarly our futures are down 27 points this morning true grit last night s data showed 208 000 jobs added in the us private sector in september up from 185 000 in august and meeting forecasts of 200 000 no sign of any slackening in the labour market as yet wages were up 7 8 year on year compared to 7 7 in august the us ten year yield jumped back 14 points to 3 76 and the us dollar rallied back 0 9 there was some better bad news in the form of the us services pmi which fell to 56 7 from 56 9 in august but aside from that being a minimal change 56 7 is still a ripping pace of expansion wall street did nevertheless cling on to a fall in the prices paid sub index which fell to 68 7 from 71 5 but if 56 7 is ripping well 68 7 pent up demand post restrictions has led to a services boom in the likes of dining travel and entertainment and prices have shot up accordingly this will of course ease over time and perhaps the first signs have emerged the dow was down 430 points at its low last night yet despite the bond yield and dollar headwinds the dow rallied back to be up 100 in the last hour before giving that up into the close just as we always see slow moving sellers sell into any initial attempts at a bounce off the lows we may have last night simply seen late moving buyers who missed out on the two days of surge it s a big punt ahead of tomorrow night s non farm payrolls report that report is setting up as a binary proposition anything lower than the 275 000 additions forecast down from 315 000 in august would give the rally another leg up but anything higher than 275k or worse than 315k could kill the rally altogether one difference bringing some confidence nonetheless is the breadth of the rally to date compared to the rally in july while the july rally was boosted by a lot of short covering it was mostly led by the big tech names and not so much by the broader market one us fund manager has noted that 97 of s p500 stocks were up for the third time in the past five trading days as of tuesday being the first time since at least 2000 that the broader market index has seen such strength at the stock level for a rally to have any lasting potential it must feature breadth but still there are few if any who believe any rally no matter how strong will still just be another temporary bear market rebound new lows are still being

the war and the intellectuals randolph bourne vents his animus against war pro war statements and speeches as well as more coercive measures gradually captured american public discourse in 1917 fairly quickly those who rejected the rationales for united states participation in the war found themselves increasingly isolated liberals intellectuals and even many socialists soon supported american intervention a youthful critic in his twenties randolph bourne wrote a bitter essay in the intellectual magazine seven arts lambasting his fellow intellectuals for lining up so readily behind the war effort to those of us who still retain an irreconcilable animus against war it has been a bitter experience to see the unanimity with which the american intellectuals have thrown their support to the use of war technique in the crisis in which america found herself socialists college professors publicists new republicans practitioners of literature have vied with each other in confirming with their intellectual faith the collapse of neutrality and the riveting of the war mind on a hundred million more of the world s people and the intellectuals are not content with confirming our belligerent gesture they are now complacently asserting that it was they who effectively willed it against the hesitation and dim perceptions of the american democratic masses a war made deliberately by the intellectuals those intellectuals who have felt themselves totally out of sympathy with this drag toward war will seek some explanation for this joyful leadership they will want to understand this willingness of the american intellect to open the sluices and flood us with the sewage of the war spirit we cannot forget the virtuous horror and stupefaction which filled our college professors when they read the famous manifesto of their ninety three german colleagues in defense of their war to the american academic mind of 1914 defense of war was inconceivable they would have thought anyone mad who talked of shipping american men by the hundreds of thousands conscripts to die on the fields of france such a spiritual change seems catastrophic when we shoot our minds back to those days when neutrality was a proud thing but the intellectual progress has been so gradual that the country retains little sense of the irony the war sentiment begun so gradually but so perseveringly by the preparedness advocates who came from the ranks of big business caught hold of one after another of the intellectual groups with the aid of roosevelt the murmurs became a monotonous chant and finally a chorus so mighty that to be out of it was at first to be disreputable and finally almost obscene and slowly a strident rant was worked up against germany which compared very creditably with the german fulminations against the greedy power of england the nerve of the war feeling centered of course in the richer and older classes of the atlantic seaboard and was keenest where there were french or english business and particularly social connections the sentiment then spread over the country as a class phenomenon touching everywhere those upper class elements in each section who identified themselves with this eastern ruling group it must never be forgotten that in every community it was the least liberal and least democratic elements among whom the preparedness and later the war sentiment was found the farmers were apathetic the small businessmen and workingman are still apathetic towards the war the election was a vote of confidence of these latter classes in a president who would keep the faith of neutrality the intellectuals in other words have identified themselves with the least democratic forces in american life they have assumed the leadership for war of those very classes whom the american democracy has been immemorially fighting only in a world where irony was dead could an intellectual class enter war at the head of such illiberal cohorts in the avowed cause of world liberalism and world democracy no one is left to point out the undemocratic nature of this war liberalism in a time of faith skepticism is the most intolerable of all insults our intellectual class might have been occupied during the last two years of war in studying and clarifying the ideals and aspirations of the american democracy in discovering a true americanism which would not have been merely nebulous but might have federated the different ethnic groups and traditions they might have spent the time in endeavoring to clear the public mind of the cant of war to get rid of old mystical notions that clog our thinking we might have used the time for a great wave of education for setting our house in spiritual order we could at least have set the problem before ourselves if our intellectuals were going to lead the administration they might conceivably have tried to find some way of securing peace by making neutrality effective they might have turned their intellectual energy not to the problem of jockeying the nation into war but to the problem of using our vast neutral power to attain democratic ends for the rest of the world and ourselves without the use of the malevolent technique of war they might have failed the point is that they scarcely tried the time was spent not in clarification and education but in a mulling over of nebulous ideals of democracy and liberalism and civilization which had never meant anything fruitful to those ruling classes who now so glibly used them and in giving free rein to the elementary instinct of self defense the whole era has been spiritually wasted the outstanding feature has been not its americanism but its intense colonialism the offense of our intellectuals was not so much that they were colonial for what could we expect of a nation composed of so many national elements but that it was so one sidedly and partisanly colonial the official reputable expression of the intellectual class has been that of the english colonial certain portions of it have been even more loyalist than the king more british even than australia other colonial attitudes have been vulgar the colonialism of the other american stocks was denied a hearing from the start america might have been made a meeting ground for the different national attitudes an intellectual class cultural colonists of the different european nations might have threshed out the issues here as they could not be threshed out in europe instead of this the english colonials in university and press took command at the start and we became an intellectual hungary where thought was subject to an effective process of magyarization the reputable opinion of the american intellectuals became more and more either what could be read pleasantly in london or what was written in an earnest effort to put englishmen straight on their war aims and war technique this magyarization of thought produced as a counterreaction a peculiarly offensive and inept german apologetic and the two partisans divided the field between them the great masses the other ethnic groups were inarticulate american public opinion was almost as little prepared for war in 1917 as it was in 1914 we have had to watch therefore in this country the same process which so shocked us abroad the coalescence of the intellectual classes in support of the military program in this country indeed the socialist intellectuals did not even have the grace of their german brothers to wait for the declaration of war before they broke for cover and when they declared for war they showed how thin was the intellectual veneer of their socialism for they called us in terms that might have emanated from any bourgeois journal to defend democracy and civilization just as if it were not exactly against those very bourgeois democracies and capitalist civilizations that socialists had been fighting for decades but so subtle is the spiritual chemistry of the inside that all this intellectual cohesion herd instinct become herd intellect which seemed abroad so hysterical and so servile comes to us here in highly rational terms we go to war to save the world from subjugation but the german intellectuals went to war to save their culture from barbarization and the french went to war to save their beautiful france and the english to save international honor and russia most altruistic and self sacrificing of all to save a small state from destruction whence is our miraculous intuition of our moral spotlessness whence our confidence that history will not unravel huge economic and imperialist forces upon which our rationalizations float like bubbles the jew often marvels that his race alone should have been chosen as the true people of the cosmic god are not our intellectuals equally fatuous when they tell us that our war of all wars is stainless and thrillingly achieving for good an intellectual class that was wholly rational would have called insistently for peace and not for war for months the crying need has been for a negotiated peace in order to avoid the ruin of a deadlock would not the same amount of resolute statesmanship thrown into intervention have secured a peace that would have been a subjugation for neither side was the terrific bargaining power of a great neutral ever really used our war followed as all wars follow a monstrous failure of diplomacy shamefacedness should now be our intellectual s attitude because the american play for peace was made so little more than a polite play the intellectuals have still to explain why willing as they now are to use force to continue the war to absolute exhaustion they were not willing to use force to coerce the world to a speedy peace the results of war on the intellectual class are already apparent their thought becomes little more than a description and justification of what is going on they turn upon any rash one who continues idly to speculate once the war is on the conviction spreads that individual thought is helpless that the only way one can count is as a cog in the great wheel there is no good holding back we are told to dry our unnoticed and ineffective tears and plunge into the great work not only is everyone forced into line but the new certitude becomes idealized it is a noble realism which opposes itself to futile obstruction and the cowardly refusal to face facts this realistic boast is so loud and sonorous that one wonders whether realism is always a stern and intelligent grappling with realities may it not be sometimes a mere surrender to the actual an abdication of the ideal through a sheer fatigue from intellectual suspense the pacifist is roundly scolded for refusing to face the facts and for retiring into his own world of sentimental desire but is the realist who refuses to challenge or criticize facts entitled to any more credit than that which comes from following the line of least resistance the realist thinks he at least can control events by linking himself to the forces that are moving perhaps he can but if it is a question of controlling war it is difficult to see how the child on the back of a mad elephant is to be any more effective in stopping the beast than is the child who tries to stop him from the ground the ex humanitarian turned realist sneers at the snobbish neutrality colossal conceit crooked thinking dazed sensibilities of those who are still unable to find any balm of consolation for this war we manufacture consolations here in america while there are probably not a dozen men fighting in europe who did not long ago give up every reason for their being there except that nobody knew how to get them away but the intellectuals whom the crisis has crystallized into an acceptance of war have put themselves into a terrifyingly strategic position it is only on the craft in the stream they say that one has any chance of controlling the current forces for liberal purposes if we obstruct we surrender all power for influence if we responsibly approve we then retain our power for guiding we will be listened to as responsible thinkers while those who obstructed the coming of war have committed intellectual suicide and shall be cast into outer darkness criticism by the ruling powers will only be accepted from those intellectuals who are in sympathy with the general tendency of the war well it is true that they may guide but if their stream leads to disaster and the frustration of national life is their guiding any more than a preference whether they shall go over the right hand or the left hand side of the precipice meanwhile however there is comfort on board be with us they call or be negligible irrelevant dissenters are already excommunicated irreconcilable radicals wringing their hands among the debris become the most despicable and impotent of men there seems no choice for the intellectual but to join the mass of acceptance but again the terrible dilemma arises either support what is going on in which case you count for nothing because you are swallowed in the mass and great incalculable forces bear you on or remain aloof passively resistant in which case you count for nothing because you are outside the machinery of reality is there no place left then for the intellectual who cannot yet crystallize who does not dread suspense and is not yet drugged with fatigue the american intellectuals in their preoccupation with reality seem to have forgotten that the real enemy is war rather than imperial germany there is work to be done to prevent this war of ours from passing into popular mythology as a holy crusade what shall we do with leaders who tell us that we go to war in moral spotlessness or who make democracy synonymous with a republican form of government there is work to be done in still shouting that all the revolutionary by products will not justify the war or make war anything else than the most noxious complex of all the evils that afflict men there must be some to find no consolation whatever and some to sneer at those who buy the cheap emotion of sacrifice there must be some irreconcilables left who will not even accept the war with walrus tears there must be some to call unceasingly for peace and some to insist that the terms of settlement shall be not only liberal but democratic there must be some intellectuals who are not willing to use the old discredited counters again and to support a peace which would leave all the old inflammable materials of armament lying about the world there must still be opposition to any contemplated liberal world order founded on military coalitions the irreconcilable need not be disloyal he need not even be impossibilist his apathy towards war should take the form of a heightened energy and enthusiasm for the education the art the interpretation that make for life in the midst of the world of death the intellectual who retains his animus against war will push out more boldly than ever to make his case solid against it the old ideals crumble new ideals must be forged his mind will continue to roam widely and ceaselessly the thing he will fear most is premature crystallization if the american intellectual class rivets itself to a liberal philosophy that perpetuates the old errors there will then be need for democrats whose task will be to divide confuse disturb keep the intellectual waters constantly in motion to prevent any such ice from ever forming source randolph bourne the war and the

of 20twenty for a special live streamed event hosted at vision s studios one of the topics kameel discussed was the change of events in america when donald trump was us president he was able to bring peace to the middle east through the abraham accords as significant as this was it got very little press coverage joe biden came to office with a very different point of view from trump about israel and the middle east he s reverted to the establishment mindset about the middle east where the state department and bureaucrats of washington dc believe israel should be partitioned with palestine as should the city of jerusalem biden s administration is returning to the old policies of obama clinton bush senior and junior although in 1991 when george bush snr was president they did not believe in a palestinian state but george bush jnr did they think by dividing israel and jerusalem the war parties in palestine and the jihadists will not want to fight anymore and there will be peace but that s not how it works said kameel the trump administration offered the palestinians a type of mini marshall plan but it was rejected before it was ever heard since joe biden became the president of america the global superpower is now seen around the world as weak and divided biden has made some disastrous moves the most highlighted was the us withdrawal from afghanistan where hundreds of americans who were seeking to escape the taliban rule were left behind thousands of afghans who had assisted the us military over the twenty year war were also left behind to face execution at the hands of the taliban tensions between israel and iran have since reached a peak and hamas leaders believe the conquest of palestine will only be achieved through jihad wokeism and cancel culture the biden administration is going all out to implement woke policies in every area you can imagine with indecent haste because the midterm elections are coming and the polls aren t looking very good so they are trying to pass as much legislation as possible or sign as many executive orders while still in power the democratically dominated congress has approved something like over 4 trillion of bills that s a lot of money on top of a 30 trillion deficit said kameel some are suggesting the russians see the americans as a laughing stock particularly around gender identity and the sorts of racial politics the divisions between black and white said kameel wokeism is basically another name for cultural marxism it is marxist on steroids it s highly emotional highly reactive and highly destructive because one of the aspects of wokery is cancel culture the cultural marxism war traditional society is judeo christian western civilisation believes in a nation state and a christian god they believe in the family as the building block of society western civilisation also has a passionate belief in freedom freedom of individuals human rights and freedom of speech this is the conservative or classic liberal mindset as opposed to left wing liberalism today whereas cultural marxism believes the opposite they want to substitute the state for god basically and the tribe is substituted for the family and freedom is not free they would say they believe in freedom but it s nothing like what we would be used to it is a radically different and aggressive worldview said kameel what s happened in the last two years during the pandemic has brought marxism to the surface most people had never heard of it but now it s becoming more apparent as the woke culture has been adept at infiltrating through the institutions of culture the good news is that we re turning a corner because the average person now feels very empowered to do something to stop this from progressing so whether it s in school board meetings at elections and with new legislation to ensure there s election integrity it is time to take action and take our freedoms back we are in a cultural marxism war and it s causing christians to pray as they have never prayed before kameel believes that when christians unite in prayer there is no doubt about who will win the war dr kameel majdali is currently touring australia

patagonia s founder yvon chouinard made headlines recently with the decision to give his family s 3 billion company and its future profits to the fight against climate change in his words earth is now the company s only shareholder climate policy advocates celebrated the decision each year 100 million in company profits will go to the holdfast collective a u s nonprofit working for climate action and policy advocacy its legal status as a 501 c 4 social welfare organization allows it to directly lobby on u s climate policy patagonia has always been a pathbreaker since 1985 the outdoor clothing company has donated one per cent of its sales to environmental causes in 2002 it helped found the business alliance 1 for the planet to inspire other companies to follow suit patagonia has also shared product innovations like its plant based neoprene with its competitors in hopes of accelerating more sustainable practices other initiatives include its certification as a b corporation certifying patagonia as a company that is committed to the common good and its used apparel marketplace worn wear but its recent decision is on another scale entirely could it help redefine the gold standard of business responsibility profit vs sustainability tensions between profits and the planet abound in business much management scholarship has focused on identifying win win scenarios where profit and sustainability coincide including getting eco conscious consumers to pay more for sustainable products and saving costs by making operations more resource efficient in many instances however a win win scenario is not an option companies then face tough choices about striking a balance between profit and sustainability patagonia has long grappled with this trade off often in public and eye catching ways its 2011 black friday ad implored customers not to buy its best selling jacket due to its environmental impacts ironically the ad quadrupled the company s sales patagonia continued this pattern in 2020 when it ran an ad in the new york times about the need to tackle the climate crisis chouinard mused in a 2013 blog post that making things in a more responsible way is a good start but in the end we will not have a sustainable economy unless we consume less he also expressed the hope that patagonia can find a way to make decisions about growth based on being here for the next 200 years and not damaging the planet further in the process foundation owned companies a major barrier for sustainable companies is the assumption of shareholder primacy that managers must maximize profits on behalf of the company s owners shareholder primacy is particularly pronounced in publicly listed corporations this is a major reason why chouinard avoided taking patagonia public and put a purpose trust in charge instead a trust or foundation running a for profit company is not a new idea in denmark and other northern european countries foundation owned companies like carlsberg and ikea are much more common studies show that the performance of foundation owned companies is often on par with investor owned companies foundation owned firms are rare in the u s regulations introduced in 1969 to reel in the perceived power of foundations imposed a stiff tax on foundations that owned over 20 per cent of a for profit company but in 2018 the philanthropic enterprise act removed these obstacles under specific conditions these legal changes set the stage for patagonia s model ownership of the company is divided to give the voting stock to the patagonia purpose trust while the non voting stock which receives the company s annual profits goes to the holdfast collective the perils of philanthro capitalism but this new model comes with potential risks if it becomes widely adopted it could be used as much to oppose progressive climate policy as to advance it dedicating profits to an organization that can advocate for political causes and candidates may be viewed as a new version of philanthro capitalism where ultra rich individuals donate money to advance the causes they care about the growing influence of philanthro barons and private foundations as interest groups in u s politics could undermine democratic processes the influence of private money on u s politics has only accelerated since the 2010 citizens united supreme court decision that struck down bans on private funding of election campaigns it facilitated billions of dollars of spending by corporations and other outside groups in recent u s elections companies purely dedicated to advocating for their political cause might further accelerate this arms race on both sides of the political spectrum a new model for responsibility can patagonia s model truly solve the tension between profit and the planet could it become a new gold standard for business responsibility this will depend on the balance between its environmental impacts and the social good created via its products and advocacy patagonia s next moves will determine the actual impact of chouinard s decision will patagonia experience pressure to grow its profits to further fund the holdfast collective how will the purpose trust interpret the company s stated purpose of being in business to save our home planet the company acknowledges the new ownership model is not an excuse to ignore the real tension we ll continue to face between growth and the environmental impact of our operations for now this recognition and transparency positions it as a clear model that raises the standard for how to think talk and act about

after a year with some of the most volatile markets in history crop growers will need a careful marketing strategy to turn a profit in 2022 23 advertisement read also skills training that can make you a better farmer first you could get process minded about it if you recognize it would pay to get serious about adding an education the last two years have made for complacent marketing says jim beusekom president of market place commodities in lethbridge alta holding on to commodities and waiting for the price to go higher worked then but unless the market is in an aggressive uptrend i would expect that to be over brian wittal of paterson grain says farmers will need to diversify and spread their risk by using different tools as opposed to one strategy he says huge daily market moves mean farmers need to make decisions more quickly or risk losing opportunities beusekom emphasizes taking a profit if there s one to be had do not compare prices to the last six to 12 months alone in fact why bother instead sell basis profitability think of selling crops as a grain company would do if it s profitable sell it how much to lock in but what s profitable growers need to work that out starting with estimating their cost of production for each crop says neil blue crops market analyst with alberta agriculture forestry and rural economic development he recommends using crop budgeting software and related online resources blue also urges growers to estimate yields for each crop to determine break even prices per tonne or bushel compare estimated break evens to available prices from cash and futures options markets while considering historic prices and basis levels he says to consider cash flow needs and to set target prices based on a conservative portion of your expected crop a rule of thumb is to price no more than 50 per cent before harvest when volume and quality are known better advertisement neil townsend chief market analyst with farmlink marketing solutions says that despite high prices earlier this season many farmers weren t keen to lock in that was partly due to lingering concerns from last year s drought plus spring weather challenges such as dryness in alberta and parts of saskatchewan and excess moisture in manitoba and since crops such as durum lentils and peas can t be hedged on futures markets growers were uncomfortable to go too far forward on sales townsend says instead of selling crops in typical increments of 20 to 30 per cent he recommends farmers consider five to 15 per cent just because of market uncertainty and volatility when you see prices go up sell another chunk because the price won t stay up if you can make money at a certain price consider selling to free up storage on its website alberta agriculture says that for crops that can be hedged futures and basis are traditionally weak right after harvest which is a signal to store grain and wait for prices to improve so if you can afford to be patient and have the bin space you can store more crop than usual to buy time selling signals blue says a good time to price cash grain or sign a deferred delivery contract is when both futures and basis are strong advertisement weak futures with a strong basis signals good local demand which is the time to consider locking in that basis with a basis contract while leaving the futures portion open for a rally blue says farmers can also time their cash grain sales according to seasonal highs promarket communications president errol anderson says buyers tend to step into the market as early as late september and continue buying through december certainly into november classically the selling pressure is over from harvest and then buyers start covering cash sales he explains that because many growers are already deferring their deliveries into the new year often for tax reasons buyers will sweeten their offers with spot basis sales to ensure they get their grain bought and delivered before christmas and new year basis levels typically weaken thereafter as buyers have covered their sales and farmers may need to wait until buyers supplies are running out in spring for another period of strong basis anderson says waiting too long advertisement paterson grain s wittal urges farmers to stay on top of markets to get an indication of sales opportunities rather than sitting on inventory through the winter every month in the bin comes with potential lost opportunities and quality losses wittal observed farmers delivering 2021 s grain last july and some was tough heated or had insects it s not always the case that once grain is in the bin that it s as good as gold he says if you don t think you re going to be able to retrieve or cover those costs by waiting for the markets to go up you re better off getting rid of it sooner than later capture carry ideally farmers who store their grain while waiting for selling signals can get paid to do so one way to find out if that s possible is by watching the market s carrying charge if there s a positive carrying charge deferred futures contracts trade at a premium to nearby ones a positive carry tells you to make a forward sale and you ll get paid to store that grain for a few months a negative carrying charge or an inverted market is the opposite nearby futures contracts trade at a premium to deferreds this occurs during tight supplies and is a signal to farmers they can receive a premium for immediate deliveries advertisement hedging your bets with options puts and calls can allow you to take advantage of price changes without committing physical grain combining cash strategies with futures or options is a great way to diversify risk but some experts prefer options especially in volatile markets when expensive margin calls may be needed to maintain your position the key is to give yourself flexibility says promarket communications president errol anderson cash contracting is important but at the same time using some risk management in your trading account is also very beneficial the markets are going to be volatile unfortunately many crops that had once had futures markets such as feed wheat barley oats and flax no longer have them which reduces pricing alternatives says alberta agriculture s neil blue some offset to that is provided by the increasing number of delivery points resulting in improved buying competition across most areas of the prairies he says farmers can still use u s futures for wheat oats corn soybeans and soybean products a rally in say corn is a hedging opportunity for prairie feed grain growers puts and calls advertisement a good time to buy a put option is when futures are strong but basis is weak it affords producers protection from futures price slides while enabling them to capture higher prices for their physical stock should futures rise farmlink s neil townsend says an optimal time to have hedged with put options would have been when prices soared during the spring another opportunity to buy a put is if you re unsure of quality but want to price without committing physical grain anderson says the most useful risk management tool this year has been the put option that s been the star he cites a particularly successful use of puts during a strong rally in chicago soymeal futures when the market collapsed those options doubled in value there are opportunities when you see a market just take off like a rocket i m just a real believer in using a combination of cash grain contracts and trading accounts because they re both beneficial overall anderson says if you feel you don t want to commit more tonnage to a grain buyer that s when your commodity accounts come in because you don t obligate yourself to delivering when futures are weak but basis strong farmers may wish to look at purchasing call options to take advantage of potential futures rallies alberta agriculture says growers could also sign a favourable basis contract if growers are unpriced this fall they can get caught selling into doldrum markets in that case they can buy call options to reopen their price ceiling anderson says there s room for a grower that did not price to sell into the spot market for cash flow or bin space and then reopen the ceiling for a mid winter market rebound advertisement a trading account gives farmers flexibility outside of a cash market anderson says you can either protect your downside or you can reopen your upside don t focus entirely on your cash marketing anderson also encourages growers to make marketing plans up to a year ahead it s not too early to start looking at november 2023 canola some growers already shorted that market months ago to guard prices that far out anderson says at the very least look six months forward on your farm marketing plan he says he prefers the strategies of farmers who go into fall fairly well covered deliver and take their profit and then concentrate on next year i don t like chasing a market anderson says i know growers that get caught selling into depressed markets who want to reopen their ceiling so they can recover some of their money but i like more forward thinking rather than hindsight market place commodities jim beusekom also urges longer term planning advertisement markets are forward thinking hence the futures market trades up to two years forward as a producer or even an end user the battle for them is to get out of the current market mindset and the best way to do that is to look at the forward markets and see what is trading it helps provide direction
