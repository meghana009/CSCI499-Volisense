bloomberg whenever traditionally minded investors think they finally have their heads wrapped around cryptocurrencies role in financial markets the digital asset class always seems to prove them wrong the ink had barely dried on analysis pointing out that bitcoin and stocks were moving in the same direction downward in september when that positive correlation quickly reversed this month as it stands now the s p 500 is down about 5 from its last record on sept 2 while the biggest cryptocurrency is up 10 the decoupling of bitcoin and stocks could revive one of the longstanding promises of cryptocurrencies heralded by their proponents that they can serve as a hedge to protect investment portfolios when equities sell off during times or turmoil that s a function that is highly in demand now with many worrying that treasuries can t be relied upon to perform that role during a period of ultra low yields and accelerating inflation still the highly speculative nature and often unexplainable volatility of crypto leave many reluctant to attempt to pigeonhole it into reliable relationships with traditional assets for stephane ouellette chief executive officer of the crypto focused platform frnt financial inc it s a matter of recognizing what type of trading window is dominating sentiment these can be swiftly moving targets sometimes you may say it s correlated with more speculative equities like tech other times a store of value type mentality takes over and it s correlated with gold in major liquidations the space tends to correlate with risk assets generally he said while for periods these relationships are relatively consistent they tend to change at a moment s notice and that appears to have happened here now that it s unlinked from equities he said we appear back in some kind of inflation hedge hard asset correlated window that jibes with the thinking of jpmorgan chase co strategists including nikolaos panigirtzoglou who speculated in a note wednesday that institutional investors could be returning to bitcoin perhaps seeing it as a better inflation hedge than gold over the last 10 trading sessions platinum a traditional inflation hedge has been the most tightly linked macro asset to bitcoin among those tracked by bloomberg with a correlation coefficient of 0 76 a coefficient of 1 means the assets are moving in lockstep while minus 1 would show they re moving in opposite directions however the mercurial nature of crypto and the shifting narratives employed to explain its performance raise the risk that investors could be fooled by randomness it s probably too early to get comfortable connecting dots between crypto and traditional asset classes according to brian mosoff ceo of toronto based investment company ether capital corp he sees crypto as still very much a risk on asset like stocks because investors who have bought over the past year or so don t yet have full conviction that the asset class is here to stay eventually though mosoff sees the promise of crypto playing out as an uncorrelated asset and as such a useful hedge it s plausible that is part of what s driving bitcoin s latest leg higher as uncertainty builds surrounding the ramifications of the u s debt ceiling brinkmanship and federal reserve policy while politicians can drive the government to the brink of default on its debt and central bankers can grow or shrink the amount of money the supply of bitcoin is limited and predictible because it s all been written into its software code this is a moment when the new world steps in and says there s a reason why these are core functions and core value propositions to the design of this asset class he said investors are slowly saying maybe it s not such a crazy idea and that s why capital is trickling into this space he said of course there are potential reasons for crypto s recent bust and boom that have nothing to do with its theoretical or real role in investment portfolios china s latest crackdown on cryptocurrency transactions that caused a selloff last month has been overshadowed by more bullish news a bank of america deep dive research report calling the asset class too big for investors to ignore u s bancorp s launch of custody services to institutional investors and reports that brazil is considering legislation making bitcoin legal tender on top of that there have been some favorable comments on crypto from u s lawmakers and signs of big money investors or whales making large purchases as coindesk reported there s also another obvious reason that bitcoin may have decoupled from equities this month it s getting pumped liked mad the phrase uptober has spread quickly among true believers on social media as a rallying cry for gains in october to steve sosnick chief strategist at interactive brokers the latest boom is reminiscent of the speculative frenzy surrounding meme stocks such as gamestop corp and amc entertainment holdings inc that was fueled by aggressive social media campaigns i think they draw from a similar pool of investors if not the same pool he said and i think that the mentality behind the trading can be similar 2021 bloomberg l p
by david morgan washington reuters a threat by democrats to do away with the u s senate s filibuster rule colored wednesday s behind the scene efforts to avert a looming federal debt default which economic analysts say could upend the global financial system president joe biden a former senator who has long defended the filibuster rule that requires 60 of the chamber s 100 members to agree on most legislation said late on tuesday that democrats would consider making an exception to the filibuster to hike the government s 28 4 trillion debt ceiling and defend the economy democrats called off an early wednesday afternoon vote after the senate s top republican mitch mcconnell floated a plan that would buy more time to resolve the issue without congressional action to raise the debt limit the treasury department has forecast that it will run out of ways to meet all its obligations by oct 18 while mcconnell did not explicitly tie his offer to back a temporary extension of the debt limit through early december both he and his fellow top republicans raised concerns in public remarks hours before announcing his offer mcconnell made a direct reference to the filibuster by warning on the senate floor that democrats could be intentionally playing russian roulette with the economy to try to bully their own members into going back on their word and wrecking the senate democrats hold just 50 senate seats with their majority coming in vice president kamala harris ability to break ties but that has allowed republicans to use the filibuster to block many of their priorities including bills on immigration reform and voting rights some in the caucus have called for blowing up the filibuster a senate tradition not enshrined in law though biden and two moderate democrats joe manchin and kyrsten sinema have objected manchin on wednesday reiterated his opposition to ending the filibuster a term that the senate says is descended from a dutch word for pirate i ve been very very clear where i stand on the filibuster i ve been very clear nothing changes the west virginia democrat told a hastily arranged news conference proponents of the filibuster say it ensures stability in the law preventing major elements of american life from changing every time control of the senate shifts from party to party but the threat of soaring interest rates a surge of layoffs and a sharp drop in the stock market if the united states were to default would have upped pressure on the holdouts to agree to eliminate it senator john thune the chamber s no 2 republican told reporters that doing away with the filibuster would be a horrible option for this institution and for the country reporting by david morgan editing by grant mccool

for investors concerned with the prospects of rising inflation and related market volatility several alternative investment asset classes may merit consideration since the beginning of the year the distribution of covid 19 vaccines abundant fiscal stimulus and the lifting of restrictions on many activities have fueled the economy and generated a resurgence of optimism among americans by the midpoint of the year some forecasts pointed to potential calendar year growth in the united states that could be the strongest in nearly four decades but there are challenges the lingering economic effects of the pandemic s disruption are still apparent in the form of bottlenecks in global supply chains inventory and material shortages and a scarcity of skilled labor for businesses the result has been a surge in prices for various goods and services and the resurfacing of inflation as a legitimate concern the prevailing view has been that the current surge in consumer prices will be temporary and as conditions normalize price pressures will ease still conditions are uncertain and it s possible that the country could experience inflation that s higher than we ve experienced over the past decade which could persist longer than anticipated what does that mean for investors what are considerable investment opportunities if inflation persists for investors concerned with the prospects of rising inflation and related market volatility several alternative investment asset classes may merit consideration real estate private credit and commodities have often performed well during periods of rising inflation which resemble that of today s environment private real estate as a real or physical asset class real estate is often sought after for its diversification and inflation protection characteristics value from investment real estate is tied directly to its appreciation potential and expected cash flows associated with income generated by users of the property it s a broad category though with a wide range of risk return profiles and property types public market options are available in the form of real estate investment trusts reits however exposure via private vehicles can act as a better diversifier to stocks and experience less volatility than publicly traded reits income producing real estate appeals to investors for its relatively stable source of return to a portfolio currently high quality private commercial property yields exceed those of high quality bonds providing a larger potential income cushion to a portfolio to offset inflationary impacts unlike traditional bonds where the coupon rate is fixed at the point of issuance real estate generated income may grow over time as a result of rising rental or usage rates in an inflationary environment characterized by a strong economy increasing construction input costs and demand for space that outstrips available supply real estate investors could benefit from both higher rental income and property appreciation still these particular investors should consider the risks including property valuation considerations lack of liquidity regulation and the use of leverage professionally managed private real estate vehicles can provide some protection to investors through limits on voluntary liquidity and by applying expertise in pricing assets underwriting tenants negotiating lease structures and navigating the dispersion in local markets and property types private credit private credit investments involve debt financing transactions that occur outside of the traditional public markets in particular direct lending is a subset of the space that focuses specifically on loans to private middle market companies that might not have access to traditional bank financing these obligations are typically collateralized with senior first lien positions against the assets of a company the direct lending market has grown considerably since the 2008 global financial crisis private lenders often work directly with private equity firms to create customized capital structure solutions offering flexibility to borrowers not typically available from traditional lenders direct lending strategies benefit from relatively high yields and low interest rate risk because the interest charged on the loans floats with increases or decreases in a short term benchmark rate a structural feature that may increase inflation protection and while there are publicly traded debt securities with floating interest rates most notably the leveraged loan market the direct lending market typically benefits from higher interest rates considerations when investing in direct lending include credit risk a relative lack of liquidity and the negative effect of ordinary income tax applicable to the income generated to taxable investors given the importance of credit selection and the strategy s buy and hold nature it s important that investors gain access through a professionally managed vehicle that reduces or eliminates voluntary liquidity and which necessitates investor commitments for a period that could exceed five years commodities many commodities including energy agricultural and industrial metals are essential inputs into various goods and services that comprise key components of inflation indices such as the consumer price index this relationship creates a strong linkage between commodity prices and broad inflation gauges gold has also shown some ability to act as an inflation hedge over time additionally over the long term the performance of a basket of commodities futures have demonstrated relatively low correlation to stocks and bonds providing strong portfolio diversification commodities tend to perform best when inflation is rising such as in the 1970s and early 1980s and can also do well in periods of high demand for physical commodities such as the period leading up to 2008 however they suffered dramatically over the last decade failing to even keep pace with cash yields over that time frame extended periods of underperformance compared to traditional markets can make it difficult for investors to maintain an allocation to commodities commodities investors should consider political and regulatory risks risk return characteristics and implementation factors volatility and lower return expectations can make it difficult to make a commitment to commodities within a portfolio particularly if that inflation surge is short term in nature or is driven by factors that aren t directly reflected in commodity prices in summary the current spike in prices for many goods and services has raised inflation concerns for investors while the consensus view is that structural disinflationary forces will persist in our economy and mitigate longer term inflation risks the alternative investments discussed above could enable investors to reduce negative impacts of inflation

in this article i ll discuss why autocanada tsx acq stock has surged 135 in the last year and whether it s still worth buying autocanada tsx acq stock has been going through a minor correction phase lately the stock has lost nearly 9 of its value in the second half of 2021 so far after consistently rising for five quarters in a row despite this correction acq stock is still trading with solid 135 gains in the last year as of october 5 let s look at some key factors that could have driven these massive gains before exploring whether or not acq stock is still worth buying autocanada stock rally auto canada is a canadian vehicle dealership company it offers a large variety of automotive products and services including new and used vehicles along with maintenance and collision repair services currently the company operates 66 franchised dealerships of some top auto industry brands in canada and the united states most of its revenue still comes from its home market though in 2020 canada accounted for nearly 89 of its total revenue while the remaining came from the u s market prior to the global pandemic phase autocanada s financial growth was picking up pace however a sudden drop in new vehicle demand badly hurt its financial growth trends last year on the positive side in the second half of 2020 a surge in old vehicle demand and high expectations of new vehicle demand recovery kept investors confidence alive its decent financial growth trend some recent acquisitions to expand the business and expectations of a sharp sales recovery could be three main reasons why autocanada stock has yielded strong triple digit positive returns in the last year is acq stock worth buying now the ongoing chip shortages are badly affecting vehicle sales and the auto industry while this temporary issue might not affect the long term vehicle sales outlook it certainly could hurt autocanada s business growth in the near to medium term that s the first reason why i wouldn t recommend investors to buy autocanada stock right now investors also should note while autocanada s profit margins are gradually expanding they re still very low in the june quarter the company reported an adjusted net profit margin of 2 8 compared to 2 1 in the previous quarter i won t completely blame autocanada for its low profit margins as we can t expect very high margins from a car dealership company but it might not be a wise decision to invest in a company with low profitability when you have the option to invest in highly profitable canadian companies from sectors like energy and tech that s why its poor profitability is the second reason why don t find autocanada stock worth investing in right now also autocanada stock has already seen a massive rally in the last few quarters in the last three years its stock has risen by nearly 270 in my opinion this consistent rally has made its stock look overvalued right now even if we take into account the company s recent growth trends and future outlook foolish takeaway i agree that autocanada stock s solid year to date gains of 92 look very impressive however every surging stock might not be worth buying instead of investing your hard earned money in acq stock you may want to buy some other cheap high dividend stocks right now that could yield much better returns in the long term
understanding investing saving money is an important part of any financial plan but to grow your money significantly over time you must also invest investing involves committing a certain amount of money to a venture with the expectation that it will return a profit the size of the profit depends on the level of risk you assume investing requires taking on some risk which can lead to a greater potential reward or loss investing is different from saving money because there is no guarantee you will earn a return or that you will even get the entire principal back experts recommend diversifying investments by balancing riskier ones with low risk choices safe investments include certificates of deposit cds treasury bonds and money market funds riskier investments include stocks and mutual funds before you get started be sure to research all your options

by david morgan washington reuters a threat by democrats to do away with the u s senate s filibuster rule colored wednesday s behind the scene efforts to avert a looming federal debt default which economic analysts say could upend the global financial system president joe biden a former senator who has long defended the filibuster rule that requires 60 of the chamber s 100 members to agree on most legislation said late on tuesday that democrats would consider making an exception to the filibuster to hike the government s 28 4 trillion debt ceiling and defend the economy democrats called off an early wednesday afternoon vote after the senate s top republican mitch mcconnell floated a plan that would buy more time to resolve the issue without congressional action to raise the debt limit the treasury department has forecast that it will run out of ways to meet all its obligations by oct 18 while mcconnell did not explicitly tie his offer to back a temporary extension of the debt limit through early december both he and his fellow top republicans raised concerns in public remarks hours before announcing his offer mcconnell made a direct reference to the filibuster by warning on the senate floor that democrats could be intentionally playing russian roulette with the economy to try to bully their own members into going back on their word and wrecking the senate democrats hold just 50 senate seats with their majority coming in vice president kamala harris ability to break ties but that has allowed republicans to use the filibuster to block many of their priorities including bills on immigration reform and voting rights some in the caucus have called for blowing up the filibuster a senate tradition not enshrined in law though biden and two moderate democrats joe manchin and kyrsten sinema have objected manchin on wednesday reiterated his opposition to ending the filibuster a term that the senate says is descended from a dutch word for pirate i ve been very very clear where i stand on the filibuster i ve been very clear nothing changes the west virginia democrat told a hastily arranged news conference proponents of the filibuster say it ensures stability in the law preventing major elements of american life from changing every time control of the senate shifts from party to party but the threat of soaring interest rates a surge of layoffs and a sharp drop in the stock market if the united states were to default would have upped pressure on the holdouts to agree to eliminate it senator john thune the chamber s no 2 republican told reporters that doing away with the filibuster would be a horrible option for this institution and for the country reporting by david morgan editing by grant mccool

mcconnell offers dems short term debt fix amid standoff washington senate republican leader mitch mcconnell on wednesday told democrats he would allow an emergency debt limit extension into december edging back from a perilous standoff by offering a potential path to avoid a federal default a procedural vote on legislation that would suspend the debt limit for two years was abruptly delayed and the senate recessed so lawmakers could discuss next steps this will moot democrats excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation mcconnell said it also will allow republicans to avoid the blame they would have gotten from some quarters for blocking a vote on the longer extension earlier wednesday president joe biden enlisted top business leaders to push for immediately suspending the debt limit saying the approaching oct 18 deadlines created the risk of a historic default that would be like a meteor that could crush the economy and financial markets at a white house event the president shamed republican senators for threatening to filibuster any suspension of the 28 4 trillion cap on the government s borrowing authority he leaned into the credibility of corporate america a group that has traditionally been aligned with the gop on tax and regulatory issues to drive home his point as the heads of citi jp morgan chase and nasdaq gathered in person and virtually to say the debt limit must be lifted it s not right and it s dangerous biden said of the resistance by senate republicans so let s end this mess and vote today his moves came amid talk that democrats might try to change senate filibuster rules to get around republicans but sen joe manchin d w v reiterated his opposition to such a change wednesday likely taking it off the table for democrats business leaders echoed biden s points about needing to end the stalemate as soon as possible though they sidestepped the partisan tensions in doing so each portrayed the debt limit as an avoidable crisis we just can t wait to the last minute to resolve this said jane fraser ceo of the bank citi we are simply put playing with fire right now and our country has suffered so greatly over the last few years the human and the economic cost of the pandemic has been wrenching and we don t need a catastrophe of our own making the financial markets have been yet to fully register the drama in washington though there are signs that they are getting jittery said adena friedman ceo of the nasdaq stock exchange stock prices rose after news of mcconnell s offer came out ahead of the white house meeting the administration warned that if the borrowing limit isn t extended it could set off an international financial crisis the united states might not be able to manage a default would send shock waves through global financial markets and would likely cause credit markets worldwide to freeze up and stock markets to plunge the white house council of economic advisers said in a new report employers around the world would likely have to begin laying off workers the recession that could be triggered could be worse than the 2008 financial crisis because it would come as many nations are still struggling with the covid 19 pandemic the report said it was first obtained by the new york times congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it would quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load the senate meanwhile had been scheduled to vote wednesday on whether to take up a bill to suspend the debt limit republicans were again expected to block it to get around the gop standoff biden indicated in off the cuff comments tuesday democrats were weighing a change to senate rules it s a real possibility biden told reporters outside the white house but manchin who has for months resisted pressure from liberal activists to change the filibuster so that democrats can advance legislation on other issues such as voting rights appeared unmoved i think i ve been very clear manchin told reporters nothing changes he implored senate majority leader chuck schumer and gop leader mitch mcconnell to work together to resolve the impasse getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60 vote threshold for passage to 50 in the split 50 50 senate vice president kamala harris can break a tie allowing democrats to push past republicans but to succeed in changing the rules all democratic senators would need to be on board at his weekly press conference schumer did not embrace or reject the idea of changing the filibuster for this one specific issue instead schumer simply repeated what he biden and others have said that republicans should get out of the way and allow democrats to pass the debt measure that s already been approved and sent over from the house he said the burden is on mcconnell s shoulders mcconnell though wants to force democrats to use the process he favors which gives republicans ample time to remind voters about the unpopular vote he sought to frame the democrats as flailing while insisting they play by his rules once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load both parties have contributed to the debt and the nation has run a deficit most years for decades the filibuster has been up for debate all year as biden and his allies consider ways to work around gop opposition to much of his agenda biden has not backed earlier calls to end the filibuster for other topics namely voting law changes but tuesday s comments could signal a new phase
three decades after the state banned the harvesting of goliath grouper the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission approved plans that would allow about 200 of the fish to be killed annually goliath grouper which can grow to 800 pounds and more than eight feet in length had been harvested in state waters since the late 1800s up until the 1990 ban over the objections of dive operators the commission voted to move forward with a draft rule allowing up to 200 fishing permits a year for juvenile goliath grouper with the first harvest expected in 2023 fwc commissioner robert spottswood supports the limited harvest this stock is rebuilding we re hearing that it can easily sustain this very small harvest of fish we re going to learn something from it and more importantly we re going to give some access that we can give safely dive operators including donna askew begged commissioners to keep the juvenile grouper from being caught saying tourists travel to florida to see and photograph the fish they ll come and they ll spend the weekend diving with us and do the goliath trips that we have then on monday they re going to disney they re going to seaworld fishing for goliath grouper would run annually from march 1st through may 31st in state waters outside of southeast florida
republican and democratic leaders edged back wednesday from a perilous standoff over lifting the nation s borrowing cap with democratic senators signaling they were receptive to an offer from senate gop leader mitch mcconnell that would allow an emergency extension into december mcconnell made the offer shortly before republicans were prepared to block legislation to suspend the debt limit until december of next year and as president joe biden and business leaders ramped up their concerns that an unprecedented federal default would disrupt government payments to millions of people and throw the nation into recession the emerging agreement sets the stage for a sequel of sorts in december when congress will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays a procedural vote on the longer extension the republicans were going to block was abruptly delayed late wednesday and the senate recessed so lawmakers could discuss next steps democrats emerged from their meeting more optimistic that a crisis would be averted basically i m glad that mitch mcconnell finally saw the light said sen bernie sanders the independent senator from vermont the republicans have finally done the right thing and at least we now have another couple months in order to get a permanent solution sen chris murphy d conn added that assuming final details in the emergency legislation are in order for the next three months we ll continue to make it clear that we are ready to continue to vote to pay our bills and republicans aren t unsurprisingly mcconnell portrayed it very differently this will moot democrats excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation he said congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it would quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load mcconnell and senate republicans have insisted that democrats would have to go it alone to raise the debt ceiling and allow the treasury to renew its borrowing so that the country could meet its financial obligations further mcconnell has insisted that democrats use the same cumbersome legislative process called reconciliation that they used to pass a 1 9 trillion covid relief bill and have been employing to try and pass biden s 3 5 trillion measure to boost safety net health and environmental programs mcconnell said in his offer wednesday that republicans would still insist that democrats use the reconciliation process for a long term debt limit extension however he said republicans are willing to assist in expediting that process and in the meantime democrats may use the normal legislative process to pass a short term debt limit extension while he continued to blame democrats his offer will also allow republicans to avoid the

in the meantime democrats may use the normal legislative process to pass a short term debt limit extension while he continued to blame democrats his offer will also allow republicans to avoid the condemnation they would have gotten from some quarters for causing a financial crisis earlier wednesday biden enlisted top business leaders to push for immediately suspending the debt limit saying the approaching deadline created the risk of a historic default that would be like a meteor that could crush the economy and financial markets at a white house event the president shamed republican senators for threatening to filibuster any suspension of the 28 4 trillion cap on the government s borrowing authority he leaned into the credibility of corporate america a group that has traditionally been aligned with the gop on tax and regulatory issues to drive home his point as the heads of citi jp morgan chase and nasdaq gathered in person and virtually to say the debt limit must be lifted it s not right and it s dangerous biden said of the resistance by senate republicans his moves came amid talk that democrats might try to change senate filibuster rules to get around republicans but sen joe manchin d w v reiterated his opposition to such a change wednesday likely taking it off the table for democrats the business leaders echoed biden s points about needing to end the stalemate as soon as possible though they sidestepped the partisan tensions in doing so each portrayed the debt limit as an avoidable crisis we just can t wait to the last minute to resolve this said jane fraser ceo of the bank citi we are simply put playing with fire right now and our country has suffered so greatly over the last few years the human and the economic cost of the pandemic has been wrenching and we don t need a catastrophe of our own making the financial markets have yet to fully register the drama in washington though there are signs that they are getting jittery said adena friedman ceo of the nasdaq stock exchange stock prices rose after news of mcconnell s offer came out ahead of the white house meeting the administration warned that if the borrowing limit isn t extended it could set off an international financial crisis the united states might not be able to manage a default would send shock waves through global financial markets and would likely cause credit markets worldwide to freeze up and stock markets to plunge the white house council of economic advisers said in a new report employers around the world would likely have to begin laying off workers the recession that could be triggered could be worse than the 2008 financial crisis because it would come as many nations are still struggling with the covid 19 pandemic the report said it was first obtained by the new york times to get around the standoff taking place in the senate biden indicated in off the cuff comments tuesday democrats were weighing a change to senate rules it s a real possibility biden told reporters outside the white house but manchin who has for months resisted pressure from liberal activists to change the filibuster so that democrats can advance legislation on other issues such as voting rights appeared unmoved i think i ve been very clear manchin told reporters nothing changes he implored senate majority leader chuck schumer and gop leader mcconnell to work together to resolve the impasse getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60 vote threshold for passage to 50 in the split 50 50 senate vice president kamala harris could then break a tie allowing democrats to push past republicans but to succeed in changing the rules all democratic senators would need to be on board once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load ap business writer stan choe contributed from new york

hundreds of chinese fishing vessels fill the seas near the maritime borders of south american countries while appearing modest the fleet of small fishing vessels is among an armada of ships financially supported by the chinese regime with a portion potentially involved in illegally fishing other nation s territorial waters off the coast of argentina some of these ships are reported to turn off their mandatory tracking devices at night to fish illegally within other nations exclusive economic zones in the southwest atlantic non profit oceana cited several incidents of chinese vessels potentially carrying out illegal fishing they were reported to have turned off their automated identification systems which are mandatory under a u n treaty signed by china the report tracked fleet activity along the waters of argentina from jan 1 2018 to april 25 2021 oceana documented over 6 000 gap events during which vessels were invisible for more than 24 hours hiding fishing vessel locations and masking potentially illegal behavior such as crossing into argentina s national waters to fish the ships were undetectable for 600 000 hours in total and the chinese fleet was responsible for 66 percent of those incidents moreover 523 boats were detected in the southwest atlantic near argentina between november 2020 and may 2021 of those 42 percent went dark at least once as they turned off their transponders meanwhile in the southeast pacific a vigilante patrol called the ocean warrior recorded 16 cases of chinese ships turning off their tracking devices broadcasting multiple electronic ids and transmitting information that didn t match listed names and locations about 24 of the boats sailing in the area had a history of labor abuse accusations illegal fishing convictions or appeared to be in violation of maritime law china s overseas fleet is the largest in the world officially capped at 3 000 ships however it is reported to have between 200 000 and 800 000 boats according to ian urbina director of journalism non profit the outlaw ocean project the fleet receives billions in subsidies from the chinese communist party ccp urbina states that the fleet is primarily fueled by the ccp adding that china s fishing fleet acts as a projection of geopolitical power on the world s oceans he further cites greg poling director of the asia maritime transparency initiative saying that the scale and aggressiveness of its fleet puts china in control and that foreign countries are not willing to fight back chinese fishing ships that enter their waters urbina said that in 2018 the chinese regime awarded its fisheries subsidies of 7 2 billion which includes money for fuel new boats engines this amounts to roughly 20 percent of estimated global subsidies in the industry chinese company pingtan marine and its affiliates which deploys china s second largest overseas fleet and is listed on the nasdaq was allegedly built on state loans subsidies and its ceo zhou xinrong s connections within the ccp reported ap two u s officials said former president donald trump banned zhou and his wife from entering the united states for being complicit in illegal fishing and human trafficking indonesia s former foreign fishing minister said pingtan is not just a fishing company it s practically a chinese government asset for example pingtan received 29 million in subsidies in the first nine months of 2020 and 280 million in loans from the china development bank and other state lenders as reported in its last earnings report the company has 57 ships registered by china to fish in the south pacific and has been accused of illegal fishing in indonesia ecuador and south africa as was reported by ap overfishing china s exploitation of areas further and further from their shores comes after decades of overfishing near home this constitutes a major problem for south america as industrial chinese fishing may pose a threat to local fishermen s source of livelihood chinese vessels usually remain on the high sea near the americas outside the countries maritime jurisdiction while fishing for humboldt squid china s squid fishing in the southeast pacific high sea amounted to over 300 000 tons in 2019 by comparison peru s catch during 2018 was 317 000 tons in its exclusive economic zone and 218 tons at high sea the data was collected by the south pacific regional fisheries management organization an inter governmental group committed to the conservation and sustainability of fishery resources though squid is abundant in the area experts caution the species may also suffer from overfishing citing instances of stock disappearance in argentina mexico and japan the region is vulnerable to abusive fishing from china according to captain peter hammarstedt director of campaigns for sea shepherd an activist organization for the conservation of marine fauna he blames china for the plunder of tuna and shark in asia and claims there is no reason to believe they will manage this new fishery responsibly hammarstedt also pointed out that the south pacific ocean is like the wild west as nobody is responsible for enforcement out there as the high seas have no regulations non profits are pushing for a high seas treaty pursuing the creation of restrictions on fishing in international waters recently hundreds of chinese ships were found fishing near the galapagos islands a unesco world heritage site that is home to several endangered species the finding spurred the deployment of a vigilante patrol called the ocean warrior in the south pacific to keep track of fishing activity the associated press contributed to this report

the u s senate appeared near to a temporary deal to avert a federal debt default in the next two weeks after democrats said wednesday that they might accept a republican proposal to defuse the partisan standoff that threatens the broader economy democrats called off an early afternoon vote after the senate s top republican mitch mcconnell floated a plan that would buy more time to resolve the issue mcconnell proposed that his party would allow an extension of the federal debt ceiling into december without congressional action to raise the 28 4 trillion debt limit the treasury department has forecast that it will run out of ways to meet all its obligations by october 18 the bipartisan policy center said wednesday that unemployment insurance payments salaries for millions of federal employees and medical insurance payments could be delayed without a debt ceiling hike no official acceptance yet several democrats said they would accept the republican offer we intend to take this temporary victory democratic senator tammy baldwin said on cnn but without a statement from senate democratic leader chuck schumer it was not clear whether that was the party s official stance and the white house did not commit to the idea the white house has yet to receive a formal offer spokeswoman jen psaki said still democrats would have to address the issue again in december just as federal funding is due to expire that could complicate their efforts to pass two massive spending bills that make up much of biden s domestic agenda republicans said democrats could use the intervening weeks to pass a longer debt ceiling extension through a complex process called reconciliation which democrats have dismissed as too cumbersome and risky mcconnell said republicans would make concessions to help speed the process up republicans had been expected to block the bill that was up for a vote wednesday which suspended the debt limit until december 2022 after the midterm elections that will determine which party controls congress for the next two years dangers of default analysts say a default could upend the global financial system and cause millions of lost jobs even a close call would likely be damaging a 2011 debt ceiling dispute that congress resolved two days before the borrowing limit was due to be reached caused stocks to tumble and prompted a first ever credit downgrade for u s debt moody s investors service said on tuesday that it expected washington would ultimately raise the debt limit however and u s stock indexes rose on wednesday as investors grew more optimistic that congress could reach a deal a more telling indication of investor relief was evident in the u s treasury market which would be directly affected by a u s default rates on one month treasury bills the securities most likely to be impaired by a failure of the government to pay interest or principal on the debt immediately after the deadline dropped sharply an indication that investors were again willing to buy them democrats had considered other options to resolve the standoff biden said tuesday that democrats might weaken a long standing rule known as the filibuster which requires 60 votes to advance most legislation in the 100 seat senate but that notion seemed to fade on wednesday as a key centrist democrat senator joe manchin said he would not support it
social security card with capitol in the background throughout your career it s likely that a portion of your income has gone toward social security benefits each pay period the purpose when the time comes to retire you are able to draw monthly benefits from this program this provides you with an additional income stream on top of your personal retirement savings if your work over the years has made you eligible to draw from a pension however those payments can reduce the social security benefits for which you would otherwise be eligible this reduction is called the windfall elimination provision or wep consider working with a financial advisor as you make financial plans for your retirement what is the windfall elimination provision the windfall elimination provision wep is a formula that effectively reduces social security and disability benefits for certain retirees who receive a pension during retirement in addition to their social security payments advertisement advertisement wep applies to social security payees whose pension comes from a non covered job or one that didn t pay into fica if you didn t have social security taxes withheld from your paychecks and then receive a pension from that job you can probably expect your social security benefits in retirement to be reduced the windfall elimination provision was introduced in 1983 as a benefits safeguard it prevents certain workers from collecting full social security benefits in addition to a pension without having paid into social security for enough of their career the wep formula takes into account the number of years you did have social security taxes withheld it then uses a sliding scale to determine your eligibility year ely benefits how the wep is applied senior woman talking to a social security official the windfall elimination provision affects both social security and disability benefits it calculates a fair benefit that is proportional to the number of years that you had substantial earnings from an eligible job one that withheld fica wep reductions are applied on a sliding scale if you have 30 or more years of substantial earnings from a social security eligible job for example you may receive 90 of your social security benefits even if you re also collecting a pension from a non covered job advertisement advertisement if you have fewer than 20 years working an eligible job with substantial earnings though and receive a pension from a non covered career you may only receive up to 40 of your social security benefits the wep calculation is applied before other benefit adjustment calculations such as early retirement reductions delayed retirement credits and cola story continues provision limits if you re collecting social security benefits while receiving a pension from a non covered job the wep most likely applies in fact in december 2020 more than 1 9 million americans were affected by the wep according to the federation of american scientists most of these were former state and federal employees however there are limits to how much this provision can reduce your social security payments this is especially true if you receive a smaller pension the wep has a maximum reduction equal to 50 of pension or retirement benefits from any non covered employment this means that regardless of how many years you spent or didn t spend receiving substantial earnings from a covered job your social security benefits will not be reduced by more than half of your pension payment advertisement advertisement who is exempt from the wep if you get a pension from a non covered job your benefits won t automatically be subject to the windfall elimination provision there are a few important exceptions you have 30 or more years of eligible earnings if you worked 30 or more years in another job with substantial earnings which withheld social security you re exempt from wep substantial earnings are defined as 26 550 or more for the year 2021 this exemption generally applies to retirees who started a second career after their first retirement it may also benefit those who have changed jobs midway through their career you were eligible for pension payments before 1986 if you became eligible to accept pension payments from your non eligible job before the year 1986 you are not subject to a wep adjustment on your social security benefits advertisement advertisement you re a federal employee whose service and social security coverage began on jan 1 1984 the wep mandatory coverage provision means that federal employees who were in

republican and democratic leaders edged back wednesday from a perilous standoff over lifting the nation s borrowing cap with democratic senators signaling they were receptive to an offer from senate gop leader mitch mcconnell that would allow an emergency extension into december mcconnell made the offer shortly before republicans were prepared to block legislation to suspend the debt limit until december of next year and as president joe biden and business leaders ramped up their concerns that an unprecedented federal default would disrupt government payments to millions of people and throw the nation into recession the emerging agreement sets the stage for a sequel of sorts in december when congress will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays a procedural vote on the longer extension the republicans were going to block was abruptly delayed late wednesday and the senate recessed so lawmakers could discuss next steps democrats emerged from their meeting more optimistic that a crisis would be averted basically i m glad that mitch mcconnell finally saw the light said sen bernie sanders the independent senator from vermont the republicans have finally done the right thing and at least we now have another couple months in order to get a permanent solution sen chris murphy d conn added that assuming final details in the emergency legislation are in order for the next three months we ll continue to make it clear that we are ready to continue to vote to pay our bills and republicans aren t unsurprisingly mcconnell portrayed it very differently this will moot democrats excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation he said congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it would quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load mcconnell and senate republicans have insisted that democrats would have to go it alone to raise the debt ceiling and allow the treasury to renew its borrowing so that the country could meet its financial obligations further mcconnell has insisted that democrats use the same cumbersome legislative process called reconciliation that they used to pass a 1 9 trillion covid relief bill and have been employing to try and pass biden s 3 5 trillion measure to boost safety net health and environmental programs mcconnell said in his offer wednesday that republicans would still insist that democrats use the reconciliation process for a long term debt limit extension however he said republicans are willing to assist in expediting that process and in the meantime democrats may use the normal legislative process to pass a short term debt limit extension while he continued to blame democrats his offer will also allow republicans to avoid the condemnation they would have gotten from some quarters for causing a financial crisis earlier wednesday biden enlisted top business leaders to push for immediately suspending the debt limit saying the approaching deadline created the risk of a historic default that would be like a meteor that could crush the economy and financial markets at a white house event the president shamed republican senators for threatening to filibuster any suspension of the 28 4 trillion cap on the government s borrowing authority he leaned into the credibility of corporate america a group that has traditionally been aligned with the gop on tax and regulatory issues to drive home his point as the heads of citi jp morgan chase and nasdaq gathered in person and virtually to say the debt limit must be lifted it s not right and it s dangerous biden said of the resistance by senate republicans his moves came amid talk that democrats might try to change senate filibuster rules to get around republicans but sen joe manchin d w v reiterated his opposition to such a change wednesday likely taking it off the table for democrats the business leaders echoed biden s points about needing to end the stalemate as soon as possible though they sidestepped the partisan tensions in doing so each portrayed the debt limit as an avoidable crisis we just can t wait to the last minute to resolve this said jane fraser ceo of the bank citi we are simply put playing with fire right now and our country has suffered so greatly over the last few years the human and the economic cost of the pandemic has been wrenching and we don t need a catastrophe of our own making the financial markets have yet to fully register the drama in washington though there are signs that they are getting jittery said adena friedman ceo of the nasdaq stock exchange stock prices rose after news of mcconnell s offer came out ahead of the white house meeting the administration warned that if the borrowing limit isn t extended it could set off an international financial crisis the united states might not be able to manage a default would send shock waves through global financial markets and would likely cause credit markets worldwide to freeze up and stock markets to plunge the white house council of economic advisers said in a new report employers around the world would likely have to begin laying off workers the recession that could be triggered could be worse than the 2008 financial crisis because it would come as many nations are still struggling with the covid 19 pandemic the report said it was first obtained by the new york times to get around the standoff taking place in the senate biden indicated in off the cuff comments tuesday democrats were weighing a change to senate rules it s a real possibility biden told reporters outside the white house but manchin who has for months resisted pressure from liberal activists to change the filibuster so that democrats can advance legislation on other issues such as voting rights appeared unmoved i think i ve been very clear manchin told reporters nothing changes he implored senate majority leader chuck schumer and gop leader mcconnell to work together to resolve the impasse getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60 vote threshold for passage to 50 in the split 50 50 senate vice president kamala harris could then break a tie allowing democrats to push past republicans but to succeed in changing the rules all democratic senators would need to be on board once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load ap business writer stan choe contributed from new

by david morgan washington reuters a threat by democrats to do away with the u s senate s filibuster rule colored wednesday s behind the scene efforts to avert a looming federal debt default which economic analysts say could upend the global financial system president joe biden a former senator who has long defended the filibuster rule that requires 60 of the chamber s 100 members to agree on most legislation said late on tuesday that democrats would consider making an exception to the filibuster to hike the government s 28 4 trillion debt ceiling and defend the economy democrats called off an early wednesday afternoon vote after the senate s top republican mitch mcconnell floated a plan that would buy more time to resolve the issue without congressional action to raise the debt limit the treasury department has forecast that it will run out of ways to meet all its obligations by oct 18 while mcconnell did not explicitly tie his offer to back a temporary extension of the debt limit through early december both he and his fellow top republicans raised concerns in public remarks hours before announcing his offer mcconnell made a direct reference to the filibuster by warning on the senate floor that democrats could be intentionally playing russian roulette with the economy to try to bully their own members into going back on their word and wrecking the senate democrats hold just 50 senate seats with their majority coming in vice president kamala harris ability to break ties but that has allowed republicans to use the filibuster to block many of their priorities including bills on immigration reform and voting rights some in the caucus have called for blowing up the filibuster a senate tradition not enshrined in law though biden and two moderate democrats joe manchin and kyrsten sinema have objected manchin on wednesday reiterated his opposition to ending the filibuster a term that the senate says is descended from a dutch word for pirate i ve been very very clear where i stand on the filibuster i ve been very clear nothing changes the west virginia democrat told a hastily arranged news conference proponents of the filibuster say it ensures stability in the law preventing major elements of american life from changing every time control of the senate shifts from party to party but the threat of soaring interest rates a surge of layoffs and a sharp drop in the stock market if the united states were to default would have upped pressure on the holdouts to agree to eliminate it senator john thune the chamber s no 2 republican told reporters that doing away with the filibuster would be a horrible option for this institution and for the country reporting by david morgan editing by grant mccool

following the bloody encounters in kansas in the mid 1850s john brown a radical abolitionist who had been fighting against pro slavery forces in kansas decided on a plan to end slavery brown came up with the idea to capture harpers ferry its store of firearms and spark a slave insurrection throughout the south that would lead to the collapse of slavery brown came to harpers ferry on july 3 1859 to begin preparations for his abolitionist crusade on the night of october 16 1859 brown and twenty one raiders invaded the town and seized the united states arsenal and armory and hall s rifle works ironically the first casualty of brown s raid was heyward shepherd a free black from winchester virginia who worked as a baggage handler on the railroad after brown captured harpers ferry the town s citizens supported by area militia cornered brown and his men in a small fire engine house finally on october 18 a contingent of united states marines under the command of colonel robert e lee captured brown he stood trial and was executed on december 2 1859 to many brown s raid signaled the civil war s imminence the war began not at sumter wrote future confederate cavalry officer turner ashby but at harper s ferry even though brown s raid foreshadowed armed conflict residents of harpers ferry and the nation hoped to avoid war as states grappled with the secession issue following the election of abraham lincoln as u s president in november 1860 like most shenandoah valley communities harpers ferry urged loyalty to the union during virginia s long debate over secession following the attack on fort sumter april 12 13 1861 former virginia governor henry wise believing that the secession convention in richmond would vote to leave the union on april 17 1861 urged governor john letcher to capture harpers ferry and its large store of firearms for the confederacy after the convention did in fact vote for secession alfred barbour superintendent of the armory and a confederate sympathizer informed the arsenal s employees and garrison that it would be handed over to virginia s forces destruction and military occupation in an effort to prevent confederates from seizing arsenal equipment including 15 000 muskets 1st lieutenant roger jones set fire to the arsenal buildings and then fled north to carlisle pennsylvania in the meantime virginia militia under the command of major general kenton harper occupied the town and when colonel thomas j jackson arrived on april 27 to organize the militia into army regiments he salvaged what he could from the arsenal ruins including 300 machines and 57 000 tools and rifle stocks and shipped them to richmond he also set about fortifying the town regarding it as strategically significant when confederate general joseph e johnston took command of harpers ferry on may 24 however he viewed the site as indefensible surrounded by the blue ridge mountains it would be easy prey to an artillery siege and moved his command south to winchester on june 14 1861 one month later union troops under general robert patterson occupied harpers ferry marking the first of many times the town would change hands union soldiers found the setting to be impressive the scenery around harper s ferry is majestically grand wrote colonel john white geary and such as bears an almighty impress union troops remained in control of harpers ferry until august 22 1861 when confederate cavalry under captain turner ashby occupied the town over the next six months harpers ferry changed control four times but by late in february 1862 union forces under general nathaniel p banks occupied the town and made it the base of his operations in the shenandoah valley less than a year after the war s beginning harpers ferry already bore the scars of war it is really or rather was a town of some note wrote an officer of the 10th maine in late march 1862 but the ruin absolute devastation now in its place is beyond anything i ever dreamed or saw or heard tell of as part of the shenandoah valley campaign of 1862 stonewall jackson s forces attacked harpers ferry on may 30 but union general rufus saxton mounted a successful defense in 1893 he would be awarded the congressional medal of honor for his actions that day three months later harpers ferry was again of critical strategic importance robert e lee was commencing his first invasion of the north and wanted to secure his supply lines from the shenandoah valley and cover a possible line of retreat behind the blue ridge in a risky move he divided his army sending part of it with jackson to take the town which the general did on september 15 1862 defeating the approximately 14 000 union troops garrisoned there under colonel dixon miles jackson however was then forced to race to maryland for the battle of antietam on september 17 which ended with lee s retreat back into virginia a week later union troops were back in control of harpers ferry for nearly the next year harpers ferry remained firmly in union hands not until july 1 1863 did the remnants of general robert h milroy s command defeated during the second battle of winchester in mid june withdraw when pressed by confederate cavalry confederate success was short lived as union soldiers regained control eight days later by this time harpers ferry was no longer in confederate territory west virginia was admitted to the union as a state on june 20 1863 union troops only momentarily lost control of the town on july 4 1864 when confederates under general jubal a early forced them to withdraw after early withdrew four days later union troops took control and would not relinquish harpers ferry for the remainder of the war by august 1864 harpers ferry had become the gathering point for union general philip h sheridan s newly created middle military division and the base of operations for his splendid campaign that finally wrested the shenandoah valley from confederate control

as a british soldier in the cold war andrew coombs was posted to berlin when it was still cleaved in half by a wall of concrete and barbed wire more than three decades later things are thankfully different and the boss of sirius real estate has a great view from his office overlooking the reichstag coombs runs what has quietly become an impressive british success story abroad fightback sirius real estate boss andrew coombs in his office overlooking the german parliament the ftse 250 firm owns a sprawling empire of business and industrial parks across germany and pulled in profits of 141million last year up from 124million in 2019 tenants include gkn amazon daimler bopp reuther and other blue chip giants plus smaller firms in a trading update yesterday coombs reported a near 12 per cent rise in a key rental figure to 85million and said confidence is returning thanks to the vaccine rollout the shares slipped a little down 3 2 per cent to 125 2p but remain up more than 150 per cent since the pandemic lows it s a far cry from the situation coombs 56 inherited in 2010 when he was brought in to stabilise sirius in the wake of the financial crisis with shares hovering around 20p at its low point the firm had crashed to a 44million annual loss as the real estate bubble popped and property values plummeted with creditors banging on the door coombs was forced to fight a rear guard action just to stay afloat the first two years were just about survival he says when i arrived we only had enough cash to last us three weeks the company s bank was circling anxious to recover a 100million loan even if it meant closing the company down while investors did not want to provide further funds soldier coombs in his army days he was posted to berlin briefly in 1982 aged just 17 i can remember dreadful days where i personally fired 29 people coombs says so how did the company survive we halted spending let staff go and managed to arrange the pre payment of rent by some clients to keep us liquid he remembers eating in a london restaurant with a client when two senior bankers ambushed them and told him you re finished it was absolutely horrendous but my answer was we re turning the business round i m paying back these loans if you use these tactics the business will go bust and you ll get nothing and we paid back every single cent one of the reasons we can get money at low interest rates today people know we will pay it back by 2012 sirius had been restructured to bring the management of its properties in house making further savings but with the company still valued at a 70 per cent discount to its properties coombs decided he needed finally to raise cash so he opted for a dual listing on the johannesburg stock exchange largely because by his own admission south africa was the only place we could raise money the firm raised 40million and used the money to invest in new properties kick starting a revival that culminated in a debut on the ftse 250 three years ago it is a vindication for coombs who took an unusual path to the boardroom via the military and consultancy work after leaving school and joining the territorial army he was posted to berlin briefly in 1982 aged just 17 he remembers crossing the east west germany border and watching russian troops goose stepping past an unknown soldier memorial it was like the west was in colour but when you crossed the border the cars the clothes and everything else were black and white he says that was hard to grasp at that age it was an adventure drinking german beer meeting german girls it was a great experience you only realise the significance of it later a year later he had joined the grenadier guards part of the regular army and went on to serve in central america and northern ireland and became a qualified sniper coombs went back to the ta in 1987 and left as a platoon sergeant in 1992 he initially struggled outside the forces i didn t have the social skills but with help from a mentor he got a sales and marketing job at the yellow pages and rose through the ranks he left as a manager and went on to work on and off as a consultant for companies who needed to undergo transformations including british airways this was followed by a stint at regus before joining sirius
menafn valuewalk the fed chair reappointment is hanging in the balance amid questioning of its leadership and an ethics scandal in the central bank jerome powell s term at the federal reserve is expiring early next year and president biden will have to decide to keep him at the helm get the full henry singleton series in pdf get the entire 4 part series on henry singleton in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q3 2021 hedge fund letters conferences and more fed chair reappointment after nearly four years as chairman of the fed powell still has a good probability of being reappointed the new york times reports this is so as he has earned respect within the white house for his aggressive use of the fed s tools in the wake of the pandemic recession however despite powell having the odds in his favor the decision and the timing of any pronouncement has been surrounded by a great deal of ambiguity as the white house is expected to issue a statement on the matter in the next few weeks passing the spending legislation and the lifting of the u s debt limit are for now hogging the government s agenda but it is this very uncertainty that could complicate jerome powell s renomination for the post senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts has been candid about his leadership by pointing to powell s inaction at stopping top fed officials from trading securities last year when the central bank came to the markets rescue this possibly gave the officials privileged information critical times the nyt reveals that two regional presidents traded for their own profit in assets under the fed s actions influence while the fed s vice chair richard h clarida moved money from bond funds into stock funds in late february 2020 just before the fed hinted that it would rescue markets and the economy senator warren has attacked powell s track record on big bank regulation and even went to call him a dangerous man to lead the central bank on tuesday during a senate floor speech ms warren said it is not clear why chair powell did not takes steps to prevent these activities on the day before she had sent a letter calling for the securities and exchange commission sec to launch a probe whether the transactions could mean insider trading amid talk of the fed chair reappointment biden has reaffirmed his confidence in powell but asserted that the government is also paying close attention to other pressing matters on the economic agenda this is starting to feel like an incredibly consequential time for the fed said dennis kelleher the chief executive of better markets as the job market is still very volatile and inflation is threatening the economic rebound
washington to get around republican obstruction president biden said tuesday that democrats are considering a change to the senate s filibuster rules in order to quickly approve lifting the nation s debt limit and avoid what would be a devastating credit default the president s surprise remarks come as the senate is tangled in a fiscally dangerous standoff over a vote that s needed to suspend the nation s debt limit and allow the federal government to continue borrowing to pay down its balances congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it will run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load biden has resisted any filibuster rule changes over other issues but his off the cuff comments tuesday night interjected a new urgency to an increasingly uncertain situation it s a real possibility biden told reporters outside the white house getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60 vote threshold for passage to 50 in the split 50 50 senate vice president kamala harris can break a tie allowing democrats to push past republicans the topic was broached during a private democratic senate lunch session tuesday as senators were growing exasperated with republican leader mitch mcconnell s refusal to allow a simple vote on the debt limit instead mcconnell is forcing democrats to undertake what they view as a cumbersome process taking days if not weeks that will eat into their agenda advertisement with republicans putting up hurdles to the vote democratic senators have been discussing a range of options including a carve out to the chamber s filibuster rules but invoking a filibuster rules change seems highly unlikely in part because all democratic senators would need to be on board at his weekly press conference senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y did not embrace or reject the idea of changing the filibuster for this one specific issue instead schumer simply repeated what he biden and others have said that republicans should get out of the way and allow democrats to pass the measure that s already been approved and sent over from the house the best way to get this done is for republicans to just get out of the way schumer said he said the burden to stand aside is on mcconnell s shoulders advertisement mcconnell though wants to force democrats to use the process he favors which gives republicans ample time to remind voters about the unpopular vote dug in tuesday mcconnell refused to budge they ve had plenty of time to execute the debt ceiling increase mcconnell said about the democrats they need to do this and the sooner they get about it the better once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load now at 28 trillion the fact is both parties have contributed to the debt and the nation has run a deficit most years for decades the filibuster has been up for debate all year as biden and his allies consider ways to work around republican opposition to much of their agenda advertisement biden has not backed earlier calls to end the filibuster for other topics namely voting law changes but tuesday s comments could signal a new phase at least one democrat sen joe manchin d w va sounded resistant tuesday he and sen kyrsten sinema d ariz have raised objections to ending the filibuster on other topics this year the standoff over the debt ceiling that started weeks ago as a routine political skirmish is now entering more serious territory as the senators risk a rare federal default if no agreement is reached that could set off a cascading fiscal crisis rippling through not just the government and financial markets but the ordinary economy and the lives of americans send questions comments to the editors previous next
longer dated global sovereign bond yields have broken out significantly to the upside from their recent summer slumber the us 10 year treasury yield has spiked by 30 basis points from its recent september low of 1 26 to print a three month high of 1 56 on 29 september in addition it has also staged a bullish breakout from a six month corrective decline in place since 30 march high of 1 77 and traded back above its 50 day moving average these observations suggest a likely continuation of its current major uptrend phase since its pandemic induced capitulation low of 0 33 printed on 9 march 2020 to test its next key resistance at 1 95 in the coming months in q4 us 10 year treasury yieldâ further potential up move towards 1 95 â whatâ s interesting is that the economic backdrop that is associated with this recent episode of rising sovereign bond yields is different from the prior sharp rallies seen earlier in q1 during q1 the prior up move seen in the us 10 year treasury yield was being coined as a reflation theme play where covid 19 vaccination roll out programme started to gain traction and massive expansionary fiscal policies added another form of â liquidity tapâ for the markets us congress passed a 900 billion stimulus and relief bill in late december 2021 all these measures were considered growth positive that supported the recovery process after a severe economic downturn triggered by the pandemic within a short span of time hence cyclical stocks such as industrials financials energy and materials outperformed in q1 in line with the rally seen in the us 10 year treasury yield while technology stocks underperformed in contrast the current economic backdrop has been mired by the â peak growthâ narrative where growth in manufacturing and services activities across developed nations including china have either stalled or contracted lower consumer confidence higher inflationary pressures including food due to a persistent environment of global supply chain disruptions and most recently the global energy supply crunch that has triggered another round of steep rallies in oil prices thus the current rally seen in longer dated sovereign bond yields is now being associated with a lower economic growth environment lack of additional liquidity being flowed into the markets as most developed nations central banks including the fed have provided clear guidance to start tapering on their respective massive quantitative easing programmes before 2021 ends and a higher inflationary environment that does not seem to be transitory in nature given that monetary policies are now getting less accommodative and the next source of liquidity to quench the thirst for risk assets such as equities will be fiscal stimulus policies the passage of the additional 3 5 trillion infrastructure spending bill that is being pushed out by the us administration is now in a limbo state as differences in terms of spending priorities have yet to be resolved among different factions of the democrats camp therefore it is likely that we are witnessing a potential stagflation theme play on the horizon this time round rather than reflationary the next question is who will be the potential winners and losers in terms of us equities under the current rising us 10 year treasury yield environment letâ s look at this table below that highlights the performances of the 11 s p sectors data obtained from their respective spdr select exchange traded funds 20 day rolling correlation of the sectorsâ movement with the us 10 year treasury yield and the respective sectorsâ 12 month forward p e ratios â potential winner energy sector has recorded the highest one month return of 13 20 as well as a significant 20 day positive correlation coefficient reading of 0 90 with the us 10 year treasury yield which suggests that the spdr select energy sector etf tends to see a similar directional movement with the us 10 year treasury yield correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two different variables that ranges from a minimum value of 1 to a maximum value of 1 another linkage on its highly positive correlation reading with us 10 year treasury yield is via higher oil prices that tend to reinforce inflationary pressures which in turn can be one of the factors that trigger a further rise in longer dated global sovereign bond yields seen in the past one month also a bullish oil market may provide an uplift to the profit margins of us energy related companies in addition the energy sectorâ s 12 month forward p e ratio is relatively cheaper in terms of valuation versus the benchmark s p 500â s 12 month forward p e ratio and trades at a discount of 32 84 the lowest among the 11 sectors the top five component stocks in the spdr select energy sector etf in terms of weightage are exxon mobil chevron schlumberger conocophillips and eog resources potential losers information technology sector is vulnerable in a rising longer dated us treasury yields environment due to higher valuation risk its 12 month forward p e ratio is trading at a premium of 24 88 against the s p 500â s 12 month forward p e ratio and itâ s the second highest among the 11 sectors â â also a further potential up move in the us 10 year treasury yield implies an increase in longer term interest rates which may hamper larger scale share buybacks programmes due to higher costs of funding to initiate such programmes the information technology sector has recorded the highest amount of share buybacks in q2 among the 11 sectors that was worth 62 8 billion in addition spdr select information technology sector etfâ s 20 day correlation coefficient stands at a significant 0 70 with the us 10 year treasury yield which indicates a further increase in the movement of us 10 year treasury yield is likely to see a decline in the share price of spdr select information technology sector etf the top five component stocks in the spdr select information technology sector etf in terms of weightage are apple microsoft nvidia visa mastercard real estate sector has a significant concentration in reits that tend to face downside pressure in the short to medium term horizon in a rising interest rate environment reits give out a constant stream of periodic dividend pay outs to investors and they are considered in competition for capital flows with similar â risk freeâ constant periodic coupon pay outs from us treasury bonds or notes thus an up trending us 10 year treasury yield coupled with a lacklustre economic growth environment is likely to increase the opportunity costs for investing in reits over less risker treasuries which in turn lead to a potential repricing on the share prices of reits to the downside the above mentioned inverse relationship between share prices of reits and treasuries yields can be backed by data where the recent 20 day correlation coefficient of spdr select real estate sector etf with the us 10 year treasury yield is at significant level of 0 91 the highest among the 11 sectors the top five component stocks in the spdr select real estate etf in terms of

an out of state billionaire who has previously bankrolled attempts to defend controversial immigration laws is responsible for nearly all the donations to gov greg abbott s 54 million border wall fund a member of one of america s richest family dynasties timothy mellon contributed nearly 98 of the fund s total donations when he donated 53 1 million in stock to the state in august according to

stalled at about 1 25 million around mid august two months after its launch a drop in the bucket for a project with a price tag estimated in the billions of dollars but on aug 27 a state website that tracks donations to the crowdfunding effort said the fund had jumped to nearly 19 million by the end of the month it had topped 54 million mellon did not respond to multiple requests for comment made to his company new hampshire based pan am systems and a marketing firm that handled publicity for his 2015 autobiography abbott declined to comment mellon does not appear to have close ties to texas

million to the congressional leadership fund the house gop super pac and he gave 30 million to the senate leadership fund which tries to elect republicans to the u s senate in 2020 mellon has not donated to abbott but he gave 2 500 to republican gubernatorial challenger allen west when west ran for congress in florida in 2012 mellon ramped up his political donations in 2018 while he overwhelmingly supports conservative campaigns and republicans mellon also gave to two democrats u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez of new york in 2018 and former u s rep tulsi gabbard of hawaii for her bid for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination ocasio cortez s campaign later said it did not solicit the donation and would return it in the 2015 book mellon wrote that after the great society programs of the 1960s which were intended to tackle poverty and racial injustice black people became even more belligerent and unwilling to pitch in to improve their own situations according to the washington post he also called social safety net programs slavery redux mellon is the chair of pan am systems a privately held transportation and freight holding company in the 1980s he founded a rail company called guilford transportation industries in the 1990s he rebranded the company after buying the brand of bankrupt pan am airways forbes estimated mellon was worth almost 1 billion in 2014 and last year the magazine estimated the mellon family was worth 11 5 billion abbott s crowdsourced wall abbott a two term republican has made border security his top priority this year as he seeks reelection next year and is fighting off challenges from his right abbott has blamed the biden administration for an increase in migrants at the border in march abbott deployed state military and police resources to the border to help federal authorities enforce immigration law in june he announced a state of disaster in 34 counties that were seeing large increases in migrant crossings and he unveiled his plan to build a state funded border wall picking up where trump left off the texas legislature has approved nearly 3 billion over the next two year budget cycle toward border security with about 1 billion going to the governor s office for grants including 750 million dedicated to construction of a border wall texas is already paying 25 million for a nearly 2 mile concrete barrier along state loop 480 in eagle pass portions of the federal border wall started by the trump administration and put on hold by the biden administration ranged from 6 million per mile to 34 million per mile for construction abbott s office said it has identified 733 miles of border that may need some type of barrier while the state displays the aggregate of private donations to the border wall on its website it does not readily provide the names of individual donors despite a commitment from abbott early on that the crowdfunding effort would have transparency and accountability outside of mellon the fund received more than 12 100 individual donations as of sept 14 totaling about 1 3 million the median donation was 50 that level of fundraising is more in line with a similar crowdfunding attempt by arizona lawmakers 10 years ago to raise private money for constructing a fence on the mexican border that effort received about 270 000 in three years according to the arizona republic during the trump administration a nonprofit called we build the wall which included his former political adviser steve bannon as a board member raised 25 million for a border wall bannon and brian kolfage the group s leader were accused by the federal government in august 2020 of looting the charity for personal gain bannon was later pardoned by trump tax benefit tax experts say mellon s decision to donate stock instead of cash could yield a tax benefit for the billionaire normally a person has to pay taxes on profits made on their investments when they are sold but investors who donate stock to charity avoid paying a tax on the earnings on their investment and get a tax deduction for the full amount of stock it s common to give stock that s increased in value because they can get rid of the gains and they can deduct the donations said lloyd mayer a professor at notre dame law school such donations are usually made to nonprofit organizations but under the tax code a charitable contribution to a state would likely be tax deductible if it is made exclusively for public purposes some people for example get tax deductions for donating money to cut the federal debt the only hurdle is ensuring the money is only used for public purposes in the case of border wall presumably built upon public land i think it d be hard to argue there are private purposes said lisa de simone an accounting professor at the mccombs school of business at the university of texas at austin but mayer said such donations raise questions about undue influence by wealthy donors on governmental policymaking in june tennessee billionaire willis johnson offered south dakota gov kristi noem 1 million to help pay for a state national guard s deployment to the border to aid texas efforts to catch people crossing illegally the state s soldiers were then sent to the texas border the thing that s controversial about these kinds of donations is whether they re distorting government priorities if government collects money in taxes and the government legislature and governor decide how to spend it they re setting their priorities based on the political environment mayer said but if you open it up to donations you re handing what the government should spend their money on to wealthy donors
according to a paper published on october 1 a portfolio that includes companies with high employee satisfaction ratings can measurably outperform a portfolio that doesn t feature such firms and these returns were even better in crisis periods researchers hamid boustanifar and young dae kang at edhec business school in nice france said the paper entitled employee satisfaction and long run stock returns 1984 2020 builds on a similar 2011 study by expanding the dataset and controlling for more variables using data from the great place to work institute the two men created a portfolio that contained some of the highest rated companies from those lists over the years the data was based on an anonymous survey of more than 4 1 million u s based employees that was started in 1984 updated in 1993 and then used by fortune magazine to compile its annual 100 best companies to work for in america feature beginning in 1998 only companies that employed at least 1 000 people in the united states were considered the researchers used monthly returns from the companies as their basis of comparison a method that allowed them to rebalance the list whenever it was updated and they also controlled for other factors such as size book to market ratio and momentum to ensure that their results could be attributed to employee satisfaction rather than other factors the not driven by firm characteristics industry composition or micro cap stocks they said the portfolio that boustanifar and kang ultimately created included 283 companies the two men found that the average monthly return of the best company portfolio was 1 25 percent higher than both the average return for a portfolio based on companies with similar characteristics 1 14 percent and a portfolio based on companies in similar industries 0 95 percent however when the researchers controlled for important factors such as the riskiness of the companies involved the results were even more impressive the best company portfolio outperformed at a rate of roughly 0 2 per month resulting in an annual excess return of approximately 2 5 interestingly when the researchers looked at the returns achieved during various market periods over the last three decades the pre dot com boom 1984 to 1994 the dot com boom 1995 to 2000 the dot com crash 2000 to 2002 the boom leading up to the 2008 financial crisis 2002 to 2008 the financial crisis itself 2008 to 2009 the years following the financial crisis 2009 to 2013 and the period in which interest in esg was on the rise 2014 to 2020 they found that the best company portfolio held up particularly well for example during the dot com bubble crash and the financial crisis the best company portfolio returned about 0 8 percent per month and 1 5 percent per month respectively higher than the return of the average equal weighted best company portfolio which returned between 0 17 and 0 20 percent per month over the 36 year sample period overall our results suggest that the stock market still undervalues employee satisfaction which seems to have the greatest value in bad times the researchers said

by randy the commish gordon on friday september 24 gerry cooney and i were wrapping up our longtime siriusxm show at the fights giving our predictions of the next day s heavyweight title showdown between the champ anthony joshua and the challenger oleksandr usyk gerry went first he picked joshua he gave his reasons they made sense he pointed out that joshua was physically bigger in every department and had the edge on paper gerry ended with a good big man always beats a good little man really how many times have you heard that want to tell that to joe frazier want to tell that to mike tyson want to tell that to rocky marciano then it was my turn i picked usyk i picked him because of his speed quickness athleticism durability stamina i picked him for every reason you saw the following day i told gerry and our listening audience that on september 25 a good big man did beat a good little man september 25 1962 on that day the heavyweight title changed hands on that day the popular but flawed smaller champion floyd patterson was knocked out in the first round by charles sonny liston but that was liston v patterson anthony joshua is not sonny liston oleksandr usyk is not floyd patterson a good big man doesn t always beat a good little man bring on tyson fury v deontay wilder at 6 7 and around 220 pounds deontay wilder is taller than sonny liston he is taller than muhammad ali george foreman lennox lewis vitali and wladimir klitschko and anthony joshua he is taller than jess willard and primo carnera he is heavier than most of the other men who preceded him to the heavyweight throne yet on october 9 he will be not only the smaller man but the much smaller man he will be smaller by around two inches and lighter by around 50 pounds this will be the third fight between the two behemoths their first encounter took place on december 1 2018 in the staples center in los angeles just over three years to the day earlier fury had shocked the boxing world by dethroning longtime champion wladimir klitschko beating him by unanimous decision in the esprit arena in dusseldorf germany over 55 000 fans were on hand for the fight most were from germany and most were klitschko fans they left disappointed as the long reigning champion landed a total of 52 punches over the course of 12 rounds unable to launch any kind of offensive against the taller longer more elusive and busier challenger when it was over all three judges had fury ahead 115 112 twice and 116 111 there were plans for a rematch at manchester arena the bout was supposed to take place on july 9 2016 on june 24 fury postponed the fight due to an ankle injury on july 7 2016 promoters announced that the fury klitschko rematch would be in october 2016 at manchester area however on september 23 2016 fury again postponed the fight this time due to being physically unfit shortly after citing depression he vacated his titles klitschko then agreed to face ibf champion anthony joshua at wembley stadium on april 29 2017 joshua retained his ibf belt and won the vacant wba and wbo heavyweight titles with an 11th round stoppage of klitschko in what was the fight of the year as fury s stock increased talk grew louder for a wilder fury fight the fight began marinating however boxing has a way of over marinating its showcase events in 2019 we saw anthony joshua derailed when he was tko d by andy ruiz he got back on track six months later when he easily outpointed the sadly out of shape ruiz it was now up to wilder two months after joshua s return to heavyweight glory came wilder s crushing defeat the loss to fury was more than a l on wilder s record for one it erased his unbeaten record it also made him an ex champion at the post fight press conference wilder made it clear that his cornerman mark breland should not have thrown in the towel i have told my camp that nobody under any circumstance is to ever stop a fight if i lose i want to go out my terms what happened tonight wasn t under my terms i knew where i was i had plenty of fight in me i have been hurt before and came back to win that was wrong to throw in the towel a glance around the media room told each of us that nobody agreed with that statement over the next few days and weeks it got worse from wilder much worse following the shattering defeat wilder began firing off one preposterous charge after another as to why he lost those charges included not only the rematch against fury but the first fight against the man who now wears the wbc belt the 12th round knockdown scored by wilder over fury on a quickly delivered well executed left hook right cross to the chin was said to be a long count given by referee jack reiss to fury he was down for a lot longer than 10 seconds said wilder who put a clip of the knockdown on his social media going by that clip alone fury was down for more than 10 seconds however the clip was apparently doctored and slowed down just enough to make it seem as if fury did not beat reiss count however when real time footage was examined there was no question reiss count was stopwatch perfect there is no question fury beat the count of the draw verdict wilder said everyone knows i won ya all just wanted to see me lose wilder s rants were endless as well was as baseless both against the judges and the referee boxing fans even his own fans began to see him as a sore loser in the 11 months fter the draw against fury wilder fought twice in the first of the two on may 18 he faced tall once beaten contender dominick breazeale in brooklyn s barclays center in that one a single explosive right put breazeale to sleep in 2 17 of the first round in november of that year wilder faced the 40 ish heavyweight contender luis ortiz who had given wilder a rough fight 20 months earlier taking him into the 10th round before being stopped in their las vegas rematch while leading comfortably in the seventh round on all three scorecards in the seventh round ortiz walked into a wilder right dropping him on his back and putting him in dreamland afterwards wilder said you have seen what i do to guys in rematches you saw me against bermane stiverne you saw me against luis ortiz now bring back fury in his previous fight to the rematch against wilder fury won a hard fought unanimous decision against previously unbeaten otto wallin surviving severe facial cuts suffered in the fight cuts caused by punches because of the severity of the cuts fury shut himself down from any more boxing before the wilder rematch he did however take part in something far safer a wwe match against big braun strowman which to nobody s surprise drew big numbers and was won by fury slightly five months after his fight against wallin fury faced wilder in a sold out grand garden arena at the mgm grand in las vegas the arena was packed with fans of both fighters with thousands of brits pouring in on flights from the u k in the few days before the event fury s entrance was perhaps the most spectacular of any man ever challenging for the heavyweight title he sat on a velvet throne atop a velveted box on four wheels dressed in a crown and regal attire he was pushed slowly into the arena by mgm employees and escorted by a phalanx of bodyguards and las vegas police wilder s entrance while flashy paled by comparison he came in wearing 40 pounds of costume including a mask which he said was designed to celebrate black history month he had donned the outfit some 15 minutes before his ring walk and later said the weight affected his legs that was the beginning of his myriad of excuses months earlier as wilder yelled his signature bomb squad and promised to drop fury in the rematch for a lot longer than 10 seconds fury made his own predictions and boasts following the win over wallin fury weighed 254½ afterwards he boasted i will be a lot heavier for wilder don t be surprised if i come in at 300 pounds while fury didn t come in at 300 he was indeed considerably heavier than he had been in his last four fights for wilder he weighed 273 at the weigh in that came as a surprise as many boxing authorities had thought he was joking about putting on weight at the final pre fight press conference fury said i wasn t joking when i said i would weigh more then he added i will even tell you how i will fight wilder i have nothing to hide we all leaned forward to hear the joke i am going to take the fight right to him he won t have to look for me fury said with a straight face i will be right there backing him up wilder laughed so did all the members of his camp some members of the media did too when wilder spoke he sounded confident you saw me at the weigh in he said i weighed 231 pounds that s 231 pounds of muscle how is he gonna be able to back me up i ask you but he says that s what he intends to do i hope he does because if he does we are all going home early he held up his howitzer of a right the one responsible for 41 knockouts who knew who knew that fury did indeed have the strength and power to back wilder up who knew that fury told us the truth about what his fight plan who knew he could thoroughly outbox and outslug the world s heaviest handed fighter from the opening bell it was no contest in the third round as wilder missed with a right then ate a few counter shots in return i said to gerry cooney who was next to me at ringside this is not looking like wilder s night a moment later a right hand dropped him he looked more bewildered than hurt it was if he was thinking what in the world just happened did fury just knock me down wilder ate more leather that round but stayed on his feet he ate even more in the fourth but in the fifth round you could see a different look on his face gone was the cold steely glare of confidence he always wore even in tough rounds against ortiz in the first fight and against artur szpilka who had given wilder some rough moments before nearly being decapitated by a wilder right in the 9th round four years earlier when a left hook to the body dropped him in the fifth you knew the fight was gone from wilder we in the media knew it the fans knew it and screamed for fury to finish him or for wilder to hold on and survive the fighters knew it fury was just waiting for his moment wilder knew it the look on his face said i m in trouble big trouble i ve gotta land my right hand soon referee kenny bayless also knew it as the fighters moved around throwing punches bayless looks at fury were exactly that looks nothing more his looks at wilder were studies they were examinations of wilder s facial expressions and eye clarity he knows a fading fighter when he sees one in wilder he saw a fading fighter despite wilder s withering chances in the fight he allowed it to go on as i watched i was having trouble grasping the fact i was seeing wilder lose his first fight that he was going to be an ex champion that it was tyson fury beating him up the same tyson fury who came within one or two punches from being stopped on cuts by otto wallin just five months earlier by the same tyson fury who was floored by the light hitting steve cunningham in 2013 in the seventh round after wilder stumbled while taking a punch my eyes cut to the champ s corner there was cornerman mark breland the beloved former olympic gold medalist and pro welterweight champion holding a towel i watched breland my eyes moved to an unsteady wilder then back to breland as quick as he once flashed his lethal right hand breland flung the towel into the ring even without seeing it but only seeing a stumbling champion ref bayless jumped in and stopped the fight the time was 1 39 wilder protested but that was to be expected he was undefeated he was a champion he felt he could have gone on he wanted to go on he was a proud warrior and wanted to go out on his shield he wanted to fight on until there was nothing left inside of him that s why the ref is there that s why a cornerman is there sometimes a fighter needs to be saved not so much from his opponent but from himself if bayless saved wilder from fury then breland saved wilder from himself he couldn t stand seeing his fighter floundering and stumbling like a drunk emerging from a bar at 3 00a m far too many referees and cornermen have allowed their fighters to do what wilder said he wanted to go go out on his shield it s a fine quality for a fighter to have and for them to want to go out that way it s up to the referee and their corner not to allow that to happen when bayless and breland stopped the fight they did wilder the biggest favor of his career instead of firing breland which we ll get to in a moment and instead of making up a terrible story about bayless which we ll get to after we tell you about breland wilder should have thanked them both he is quite possibly in satuday s fight because of the actions of both breland and bayless following the very correct stoppage wilder showed more fire than he did in the 19 39 the fight lasted the former champ accused breland of poisoning his drinking water as for the world class bayless wilder accused him of being out drinking before the fight the charges and excused didn t stop there of course there was the one about the 40 pounds of costume he wore into the ring wearing out his legs then there was the one about the nevada commission allowing fury s wrapped and inspected gloves of fury being unwrapped removed stuffed with metallic egg weights then put back only partially on fury s hands the charges went on for days weeks and even months wilder said he had a legal document signed by tyson fury calling for a rematch but as 2020 moved on and covid moved in fury and his team distanced themselves from the constant rants of the man he so fairly beat on february 22 as the distance between the two of them ever meeting again grew further apart fury began to talk about a match against anthony joshua so did fury s co promoter bob arum that contract wilder said he has is null and void said arum if he comes back with a few good victories maybe he can fight the winner of fury v joshua but wilder never let up neither did his co manager shelly finkel who kept telling those of us who were willing to listen that the contract they held was perfectly valid while a fight between joshua and fury were making plans to face each other in the summer of 2021 team wilder was making other plans to face fury is a trilogy fury kept waving his fists saying i beat you already get back in line wilder kept waving the rematch clause you must honor this first he kept stating wilder was right it was the one moment of a fight he did indeed win against fury wilder got his wish for a trilogy fight in mid may 2021 when arbitration court judge daniel weinstein ruled that the signed return clause contract was indeed valid and fury must step in the ring against wilder before stepping in against joshua or anybody else not named deontay wilder with that wilder went back to the gym with his his new trainer malik scott and continued preparing for his third fight against fury it was something he was already doing for months while fury prepared to face joshua after it became apparent that fury wilder iii was real joshua moved ahead and selected unbeaten former cruiserweight champion oleksandr usyk as his opponent on september 25 you saw how that worked out for joshua there were several summer dates for fury wilder iii the last one being august 24 shortly before the bout fury announced he had tested positive for covid then came the date which is now just hours away saturday october 9 while fury seems to be in shape nobody knows for sure as his workouts have been behind closed doors for fury there was a brief break in camp to be at the bedside of his wife who had given birth to their daughter in england the baby had some issues at birth and fury stayed until all was fine when he was given the green light he returned to camp but the questions have been raised what kind of physical and mental shape is fury in compared to the physical and mental shape he was in for both of his previous fights against wilder you can also ask the same questions of wilder is he more prepared now than he was in either of the first two bouts against fury will he be affected by the knowledge that fury can and did back him up beat him to the punch and hurt him will fury use that knowledge to his advantage will wilder use it to fire him up how much has wilder learned under the training of malik scott will it be enough as he had to learn so much will wilder look like a different fighter at the sound of the opening bell in what way does it matter what about the wilder jab it never was a jab given a very high boxing iq has malik scott been able to trade wilder s old jab in for a brand new much more effective jab yes gerry cooney and others have long believed that a good big man can beat a good small man to that i ll say just watch the fight on saturday it just may be the bigger they are the harder they fall randy the commish gordon is the author of the hit book glove affair order your copy by clicking here

democrats accepted an offer from senate minority leader mitch mcconnell on wednesday for a short term suspension of the debt ceiling delaying a showdown over the nation s borrowing limit until december the kentucky republican specified that his proposal was contingent on a democratic agreement that long term action to raise the debt ceiling would be achieved unilaterally via budget reconciliation the process allows specific spending and tax measures to avert the senate s 60 vote filibuster threshold and pass with a simple majority this will moot democrats excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified democratic government more than enough time to pass stand alone debt limit legislation through reconciliation mr mcconnell said senate democrats said they support the two month suspension but using reconciliation for a long term fix is off the table we ve made it clear we re not doing it through reconciliation that s a recipe for a long term disaster said sen christopher murphy connecticut democrat it s up to republicans i hope in december we re not through march mr mcconnell made the offer shortly before republicans were planning to block legislation to suspend the debt ceiling until december 2022 and as president biden and banking and financial leaders ramped up concerns that an unprecedented federal default would disrupt government payments to millions of people and throw the economy into recession citigroup ceo jane fraser said defaulting would cause lasting damage to the credibility of the united states with investors and in financial markets around the world the ramifications are not limited to the markets she said it s already beginning to cause some damage in the economy it will hurt consumers it will hurt small businesses treasury secretary janet yellen has warned that the government will run out of money to pay its bills on oct 18 democratic leaders are wary of reconciliation because it would force them to specify a new amount for the nation s borrowing limit the number which would be above the current limit of 28 8 trillion opens vulnerable lawmakers to attack during next year s midterm elections democrats hope to extract concessions from mr mcconnell when the government funding deadline and the debt ceiling suspension come up again in december an attempt to couple the debt ceiling to legislation preventing a partial government shutdown failed at the hands of a republican filibuster last month regardless democrats are confident that republicans will capitulate during another showdown over the debt ceiling what we ve seen is that republicans are eventually willing to join us to do the right thing this is for only three months but it is clear that republicans know that they would get the blame for a default mr murphy said that s what we ve said all along sen elizabeth warren massachusetts democrat said mr mcconnell caved by offering a short term suspension of the debt limit and would do so again former president donald trump echoed a similar sentiment shortly after news of mr mcconnell s proposal broke looks like mitch mcconnell is folding to the democrats again mr trump said in a statement he s got all of the cards with the debt ceiling it s time to play the hand don t let them destroy our country sources close to the republican leader say the proposal is a logical extension of his position that he wants democrats to raise the debt ceiling on their own through reconciliation such a maneuver would put democrats on record as voting to increase the national debt well above 30 trillion and would likely delay mr biden s 3 5 trillion expansion of the federal safety net democrats are planning to use reconciliation to move the more extensive package which includes a slew of liberal priorities such as action on climate change tuition free community college and expanded health care programs if democrats abandon their efforts to ram through another historically reckless taxing and spending spree that will hurt families and help china a more traditional bipartisan governing conversation could be possible mr mcconnell said the short term suspension is likely to only postpone a debt ceiling showdown provided reconciliation is not an option as democrats claim stock prices rallied from a morning loss after mr mcconnell s offer was announced democratic lawmakers this week began exploring whether they would have sufficient support to change the filibuster rules so that debt ceiling votes would need only a simple majority of 51 votes instead of 60 for such a carve out to be enacted all 50 democrats in the evenly split senate would need to back the change the idea was quickly rebuked by sen joe manchin iii of west virginia a critical democratic swing vote mr manchin said lawmakers had a responsibility to protect the credit of the u s and its institutions i ve been very very clear where i stand on the filibuster mr manchin said i don t have to repeat that i think i ve been very clear nothing changes amid the partisan bickering over the debt ceiling polls show that voters opinions are mixed a survey conducted last week by the hill harrisx found that 54 of registered voters oppose raising the borrowing limit while 46 support the move a poll from the economist yougov found that 34 of adults favor raising the limit and 32 oppose with 34 undecided both surveys indicate that a position on the topic is closely associated with partisan affiliation republicans are vehemently opposed to raising the debt limit and democrats support increasing it jeff mordock contributed to this article which is based in part on wire service reports haris alic can be reached at halic washingtontimes com

announced democratic lawmakers this week began exploring whether they would have sufficient support to change the filibuster rules so that debt ceiling votes would need only a simple majority of 51 votes instead of 60 for such a carve out to be enacted all 50 democrats in the evenly split senate would need to back the change the idea was quickly rebuked by sen joe manchin iii of west virginia a critical democratic swing vote mr manchin said lawmakers had a responsibility to protect the credit of the u s and its institutions i ve been very very clear where i stand on the filibuster mr manchin said i don t have to repeat that i think i ve been very clear nothing changes amid the partisan bickering over the debt ceiling polls show that voters opinions are mixed a survey conducted last week by the hill harrisx found that 54 of registered voters oppose raising the borrowing limit while 46 support the move a poll from the economist yougov found that 34 of adults favor raising the limit and 32 oppose with 34 undecided both surveys indicate that a position on the topic is closely associated with partisan affiliation republicans are vehemently opposed to raising the debt limit and democrats support increasing it jeff mordock contributed to this article which is based in part on wire service reports haris alic can be reached at halic washingtontimes com

washington oct 6 efe senate republicans on wednesday offered us president joe biden and his party a deal to extend the debt ceiling until december and thereby avert a government default on oct 18 in a statement senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said the move to allow the short term debt limit extension was contingent upon the democrats affixing a dollar amount to the debt level to protect the american people from a near term democrat created crisis we will allow democrats to use normal procedures to pass an emergency debt limit extension at a fixed dollar amount to cover current spending levels into december the top ranking republican in the senate said this will moot democrats excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through a reconciliation bill which only requires a simple majority that the democrats have with the vote of vice president kamala harris alternatively if democrats abandon their efforts to ram through another historically reckless taxing and spending spree that will hurt families and help china a more traditional bipartisan governing conversation could be possible he was referring to democrats plans for a 3 5 trillion spending bill that would make major new investments in child care education health care and climate initiatives and would need to be passed through the reconciliation process without any support from senate republicans the task of lifting the debt limit has proved to be a thorny one for democrats in the 50 50 senate since most legislation can only be advanced with 60 votes and republicans opposed to the new spending want to paint their opponents as the party of debt increases democrats strategy thus far has been to seek to extend the debt ceiling until december 2022 so it does not become a campaign issue in the lead up to that year s midterm elections in november mcconnell however remains opposed to any longer term measure the senate minority leader made his offer just before the senate was to hold a procedural vote on the bill that the democrat controlled house of representatives passed last week to suspend the debt ceiling through mid december 2022 senate republicans had already warned that they would vote as a bloc against that initiative biden for his part said wednesday at the white house where he met with leaders of major financial institutions such as bank of america and citibank that the republicans were the ones being irresponsible in failing to raise the debt limit the united states pays its bill it s who we are it s who we ve been it s who we re going to continue to be god willing that s what s called the full faith and credit of the united states the president said let s be clear raising the debt limit is paying our old debts it has nothing to do with new spending or what may be coming this year or other years the us faces a debt ceiling crisis every few years because the government spends much more money that it raises in federal taxes in the us unlike in other countries the government can only issue debt up to the limit established by congress which has the power to raise that ceiling when it deems it appropriate the us never has had to suspend payment on its national debt although it was close to doing so in 2011 when barack obama was in the white house the impasse at that time caused enormous chaos in financial markets and led to standard poor s downgrading the us s top notch aaa credit rating for the first time ever efe bpm mc
glacier farmmedia the good news is that beef prices are extremely strong even in the face of record beef production in north america we have record high wholesale beef prices right now canfax manager and senior analyst brian perillat said at the recent and virtual canadian beef industry conference unfortunately cattle prices are just not responding that s been frustrating for a lot of producers and the industry he said but tides will change the typical cattle cycle is we overproduce plug the system in terms of bottleneck at processing and then we shrink this will rebalance over time as the market readjusts advertisement read also ukraine sows 852 100 ha to 2024 crops as of april 5 ministry says all ukrainian regions have started 2024 sowing and had seeded 852 100 hectares of spring crops as of april 5 the for most of the year the beef cut out price relative to pork was cheaper than it has been for quite a few years largely because pork prices have risen too overall red meat prices have been extremely strong said perillat and strong demand looks set to continue the impact of african swine fever which decimated china s pig herd still lingers as the nation attempts to build its domestic supply as well drought hit australian production hard dropping it from the world s no 2 exporter to the no 5 spot those and other factors mean there were declining global meat supplies in 2019 and 2020 which hasn t been seen before said perillat advertisement we re seeing some shifts around globally all of that is supporting the beef market and supporting our wholesale meat prices one of the biggest drivers is declining cattle numbers in the u s where the herd peaked in 2019 as we head into 2022 this will be the third consecutive year that we will see smaller cow numbers and smaller cattle numbers in the united states said perillat we ll have about a million less breeding stock at the middle of the year and about half a million fewer cattle outside of feedlots in the united states american cattle production will be flat this year but we will start to see the herd decline their replacement heifer numbers are down he said advertisement drought and very high grain prices are major factors although the need for supply has drawn in some dairy cattle some of these dairy calves and crossbred calves are coming up in the canadian industry as well as getting fed and finished and processed in canada he said over the past few years the united states has shifted between being a net exporter of beef and a net importer it s back to being a net exporter this year said perillat china has stepped up from being a small importer 10 years ago to being the largest beef importer in the world we continue to see impacts of that canada has continued to have strong exports well above 2020 levels even though last year was a bit of an anomaly because of supply chain issues even last year when we saw exports down slightly we had record high values volume was down last year three to four per cent but value was fractionally higher advertisement canadian exports are up a billion dollars from 2015 and 2016 and 10 per cent since 2019 because of strong international demand that s true domestically too we ve seen some of the strongest demand levels we ve seen in the last 30 years he said despite all the rhetoric around cattle and cattle production and beef production and markets consumers continue to spend a lot of their protein dollars on beef however don t take those customers for granted he warned we do see those prices jumping higher and we have to watch how consumers start reacting to these higher prices advertisement this year prices have stayed high but consumption has levelled off there was no pullback from higher prices last year but there were flat consumption levels the other big factor to watch is whether the steadily declining canadian herd sees a big drop in numbers because of the drought late season rains may have stopped as many cows from going to market and some producers may have found feed he said aside from the massive decline in the herd in canada beef production is strong and healthy he said the industry has the highest slaughter rates in a decade along with larger carcass rates the feedlot sector has continued to grow and there are about 15 per cent more feedlots than 2015 alexis kienlen is s reporter for the alberta farmer express her article appeared in the sept 20 2021 issue

and the market republicans defeat that cr yeah let me be crystal clear about this republicans are united in opposition to raising the debt ceiling not because it doesn t need to be done so i want to make sure everybody clearly understands this the last time the debt ceiling was raised it was done on a bipartisan basis in conjunction with an overall caps agreement and that debt ceiling increase covers basically what we did last year this year is unique and you know i ve been here a while i ve never seen such an effort to expand the reach of the federal government like we ve been confronted with this year through not just one reconciliation process but apparently yet another so if they want to do all of this on a partisan basis they have the ability and the responsibility to ensure that the federal government not default and they will have to take care of that thank you i d like every single republican senator to answer the question are they willing to let the government default as to the plans we are working there are a number of different options the white house speaker pelosi myself are discussing those and we believe that we must do this we believe it s an imperative to do it and leader mcconnell as i said is playing a dangerous political games by not stepping up to the plate as he asked us to do and we did when trump was president advertisement congress foresees short term debt ceiling fix amid perilous standoff share copy link copy republican and democratic leaders edged back wednesday from a perilous standoff over lifting the nation s borrowing cap with democratic senators signaling they were receptive to an offer from senate gop leader mitch mcconnell that would allow an emergency extension into december mcconnell made the offer shortly before republicans were prepared to block legislation to suspend the debt limit until december of next year and as president joe biden and business leaders ramped up their concerns that an unprecedented federal default would disrupt government payments to millions of people and throw the nation into recession the emerging agreement sets the stage for a sequel of sorts in december when congress will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays a procedural vote on the longer extension the republicans were going to block was abruptly delayed late wednesday and the senate recessed so lawmakers could discuss next steps democrats emerged from their meeting more optimistic that a crisis would be averted basically i m glad that mitch mcconnell finally saw the light said sen bernie sanders the independent senator from vermont the republicans have finally done the right thing and at least we now have another couple months in order to get a permanent solution sen chris murphy d conn added that assuming final details in the emergency legislation are in order for the next three months we ll continue to make it clear that we are ready to continue to vote to pay our bills and republicans aren t unsurprisingly mcconnell portrayed it very differently this will moot democrats excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation he said congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it would quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load mcconnell and senate republicans have insisted that democrats would have to go it alone to raise the debt ceiling and allow the treasury to renew its borrowing so that the country could meet its financial obligations further mcconnell has insisted that democrats use the same cumbersome legislative process called reconciliation that they used to pass a 1 9 trillion covid relief bill and have been employing to try and pass biden s 3 5 trillion measure to boost safety net health and environmental programs mcconnell said in his offer wednesday that republicans would still insist that democrats use the reconciliation process for a long term debt limit extension however he said republicans are willing to assist in expediting that process and in the meantime democrats may use the normal legislative process to pass a short term debt limit extension while he continued to blame democrats his offer will also allow republicans to avoid the condemnation they would have gotten from some quarters for causing a financial crisis earlier wednesday biden enlisted top business leaders to push for immediately suspending the debt limit saying the approaching deadline created the risk of a historic default that would be like a meteor that could crush the economy and financial markets at a white house event the president shamed republican senators for threatening to filibuster any suspension of the 28 4 trillion cap on the government s borrowing authority he leaned into the credibility of corporate america a group that has traditionally been aligned with the gop on tax and regulatory issues to drive home his point as the heads of citi jp morgan chase and nasdaq gathered in person and virtually to say the debt limit must be lifted it s not right and it s dangerous biden said of the resistance by senate republicans his moves came amid talk that democrats might try to change senate filibuster rules to get around republicans but sen joe manchin d w v reiterated his opposition to such a change wednesday likely taking it off the table for democrats the business leaders echoed biden s points about needing to end the stalemate as soon as possible though they sidestepped the partisan tensions in doing so each portrayed the debt limit as an avoidable crisis we just can t wait to the last minute to resolve this said jane fraser ceo of the bank citi we are simply put playing with fire right now and our country has suffered so greatly over the last few years the human and the economic cost of the pandemic has been wrenching and we don t need a catastrophe of our own making the financial markets have yet to fully register the drama in washington though there are signs that they are getting jittery said adena friedman ceo of the nasdaq stock exchange stock prices rose after news of mcconnell s offer came out ahead of the white house meeting the administration warned that if the borrowing limit isn t extended it could set off an international financial crisis the united states might not be able to manage a default would send shock waves through global financial markets and would likely cause credit markets worldwide to freeze up and stock markets to plunge the white house council of economic advisers said in a new report employers around the world would likely have to begin laying off workers the recession that could be triggered could be worse than the 2008 financial crisis because it would come as many nations are still struggling with the covid 19 pandemic the report said it was first obtained by the new york times to get around the standoff taking place in the senate biden indicated in off the cuff comments tuesday democrats were weighing a change to senate rules it s a real possibility biden told reporters outside the white house but manchin who has for months resisted pressure from liberal activists to change the filibuster so that democrats can advance legislation on other issues such as voting rights appeared unmoved i think i ve been very clear manchin told reporters nothing changes he implored senate majority leader chuck schumer and gop leader mcconnell to work together to resolve the impasse getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60 vote threshold for passage to 50 in the split 50 50 senate vice president kamala harris could then break a tie allowing democrats to push past republicans but to succeed in changing the rules all democratic senators would need to be on board once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load ___ ap business writer stan choe contributed from new york

several days to spotlight climate action explore possibilities and showcase ambitious solutions more than 1 600 participants actively joined in the virtual gathering with the host government of uganda bringing together governments at all levels across the region along with private sector leaders academic experts and other key stakeholders janet rogan cop26 regional ambassador for africa and the middle east said that the meeting enabled many stakeholders to build new partnerships and strengthen existing ones only by working together can we truly help to deliver on the ambition of the paris agreement while being conscious of the unique opportunities and challenges this presents in the region she said un agencies were involved the world bank examined economy wide approaches for a sustainable green recovery the un development programme undp explored how both climate risk and climate solutions are reshaping different sectors the un environment programme unep reimagined the future and looked at behaviors technologies and financing the food and agriculture organization fao published its first ever stock take of africa s forests and landscapes revealing that up to 65 per cent of productive land is degraded while desertification affects 45 per cent of africa s land area africa has contributed little to climate change generating only a small fraction of global emissions however it may be the most vulnerable region in the world already suffering of droughts floods and destructive locust invasions among other impacts 4 cop hosts the united kingdom asked countries to secure the money right at the beginning of the general assembly the uk prime minister boris johnson convened an emergency meeting to press for more action on climate finance and other measures ahead of un cop26 world leaders addressed the gaps that remain on the actions needed from national governments especially the g20 industrialized powers on mitigation finance and adaptation the uk prime minister warned that history will judge the world s richest nations if they fail to deliver on their pledge to commit 100 billion in annual climate aid ahead of cop26 he placed the chances of securing the money before november at six out of 10 mr johnson also assured his country will lead by example keeping the environment on the global agenda and serving as a launchpad for a global green industrial revolution but warned no one country can turn the tide it would be akin to bailing out a liner with a single bucket 5 world leaders committed to reform global food systems food systems cause as much as a third of greenhouse gas emissions up to 80 per cent of biodiversity loss and use up to 70 per cent of freshwater reserves however sustainable food production systems should be recognized as an essential solution to these existing challenges on 23 sept the first ever un food systems summit convened world leaders to spur national and regional action to transform the way we produce consume and dispose of our food following from the latest ipcc report which raised a code red for human driven global heating the us administration one of the world s major agricultural producers pledged 10 billion over five years to address climate change and help feed those most vulnerable without exhausting natural resources the summit called by the un secretary general in 2019 to accelerate global progress by leveraging the interconnected importance of food systems featured other commitments from more than 85 heads of state around the world many countries announced national initiatives to ensure their food systems met not only the nutritional needs of their populations but also goals around climate change biodiversity and decent livelihoods for all business and civil society organizations also made important promises 6 no more blah blah blah almost 400 activists aged 15 to 29 from 186 countries met in milan italy a few days ago to rev up the call for climate action with weeks to go before cop26 they highlighted youth leadership and pushed for a far more climate conscious society greta thunberg along with ugandan environmentalist vanessa nakate was among the speakers at the youth4climate event run by italy and the world bank group build back better blah blah blah green economy blah blah blah net zero by 2050 blah blah blah this is all we hear from our so called leaders words that sound great but so far have not led to action our hopes and ambitions drown in their empty promises thunberg said no more empty conferences it s time to show us the money added nakate 24 referring to the 100 billion in annual climate aid promised by the richest economists to help developing countries vulnerable to the impact of climate change what do we want we want climate justice now highlighted thunberg known for inspiring a series of youth climate strikes around the world since 2018 the three day meeting finalized with a joint document to be presented at negotiation meetings during the preparation cop26 event the pre cop and then during the pivotal conference un chief antónio guterres thanked young people for contributing ideas and solutions in advance of the un climate conference young people have been in the forefront of putting forward positive solutions advocating for climate justice and holding leaders to account we need young people everywhere to keep raising your voices he said in a video message 7 next commitments to watch the pre cop each un climate conference cop is preceded by a preparatory meeting held about a month before called pre cop the meeting is the final formal multilateral opportunity for ministers to shape the negotiations in detail ahead of the meeting in glasgow in november the event this year in milan brings together climate and energy ministers from a selected group of countries to discuss and exchange views on some key political aspects of the negotiations and delve into some of the key topics that will be addressed at cop26 the meeting is taking place just weeks after a report by un climate change found that nations must urgently redouble their climate efforts if they are to prevent global temperature increases beyond the paris agreement s goal of 2c ideally 1 5c by the end of the century the issues under discussion in milan include
washington ap republican and democratic leaders edged back wednesday from a perilous standoff over lifting the nation s borrowing cap with democratic senators signaling they were receptive to an offer from senate gop leader mitch mcconnell that would allow an emergency extension into december mcconnell made the offer shortly before republicans were prepared to block legislation to suspend the debt limit until december of next year and as president joe biden and business leaders ramped up their concerns that an unprecedented federal default would disrupt government payments to millions of people and throw the nation into recession the emerging agreement sets the stage for a sequel of sorts in december when congress will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays a procedural vote on the longer extension the republicans were going to block was abruptly delayed late wednesday and the senate recessed so lawmakers could discuss next steps democrats emerged from their meeting more optimistic that a crisis would be averted basically i m glad that mitch mcconnell finally saw the light said sen bernie sanders the independent senator from vermont the republicans have finally done the right thing and at least we now have another couple months in order to get a permanent solution sen chris murphy d conn added that assuming final details in the emergency legislation are in order for the next three months we ll continue to make it clear that we are ready to continue to vote to pay our bills and republicans aren t unsurprisingly mcconnell portrayed it very differently this will moot democrats excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation he said congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it would quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load mcconnell and senate republicans have insisted that democrats would have to go it alone to raise the debt ceiling and allow the treasury to renew its borrowing so that the country could meet its financial obligations further mcconnell has insisted that democrats use the same cumbersome legislative process called reconciliation that they used to pass a 1 9 trillion covid relief bill and have been employing to try and pass biden s 3 5 trillion measure to boost safety net health and environmental programs watch biden enlists ceos to warn of default if federal debt limit is not raised mcconnell said in his offer wednesday that republicans would still insist that democrats use the reconciliation process for a long term debt limit extension however he said republicans are willing to assist in expediting that process and in the meantime democrats may use the normal legislative process to pass a short term debt limit extension while he continued to blame democrats his offer will also allow republicans to avoid the condemnation they would have gotten from some quarters for causing a financial crisis earlier wednesday biden enlisted top business leaders to push for immediately suspending the debt limit saying the approaching deadline created the risk of a historic default that would be like a meteor that could crush the economy and financial markets at a white house event the president shamed republican senators for threatening to filibuster any suspension of the 28 4 trillion cap on the government s borrowing authority he leaned into the credibility of corporate america a group that has traditionally been aligned with the gop on tax and regulatory issues to drive home his point as the heads of citi jp morgan chase and nasdaq gathered in person and virtually to say the debt limit must be lifted it s not right and it s dangerous biden said of the resistance by senate republicans his moves came amid talk that democrats might try to change senate filibuster rules to get around republicans but sen joe manchin d w v reiterated his opposition to such a change wednesday likely taking it off the table for democrats the business leaders echoed biden s points about needing to end the stalemate as soon as possible though they sidestepped the partisan tensions in doing so each portrayed the debt limit as an avoidable crisis we just can t wait to the last minute to resolve this said jane fraser ceo of the bank citi we are simply put playing with fire right now and our country has suffered so greatly over the last few years the human and the economic cost of the pandemic has been wrenching and we don t need a catastrophe of our own making the financial markets have yet to fully register the drama in washington though there are signs that they are getting jittery said adena friedman ceo of the nasdaq stock exchange stock prices rose after news of mcconnell s offer came out ahead of the white house meeting the administration warned that if the borrowing limit isn t extended it could set off an international financial crisis the united states might not be able to manage a default would send shock waves through global financial markets and would likely cause credit markets worldwide to freeze up and stock markets to plunge the white house council of economic advisers said in a new report employers around the world would likely have to begin laying off workers the recession that could be triggered could be worse than the 2008 financial crisis because it would come as many nations are still struggling with the covid 19 pandemic the report said it was first obtained by the new york times to get around the standoff taking place in the senate biden indicated in off the cuff comments tuesday democrats were weighing a change to senate rules it s a real possibility biden told reporters outside the white house but manchin who has for months resisted pressure from liberal activists to change the filibuster so that democrats can advance legislation on other issues such as voting rights appeared unmoved i think i ve been very clear manchin told reporters nothing changes he implored senate majority leader chuck schumer and gop leader mcconnell to work together to resolve the impasse getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60 vote threshold for passage to 50 in the split 50 50 senate vice president kamala harris could then break a tie allowing democrats to push past republicans but to succeed in changing the rules all democratic senators would need to be on board once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load ap business writer stan choe contributed from new york

join our growing army of changemakers and get unlimited access to our premium content a new report published on wednesday 6 october from finance for biodiversity f4b estimates that the value of the potential damage to nature from lending activities by public development banks pdbs worldwide is around 800bn annually the report finds that the value of nature at risk currently equates to 7 for every dollar invested pbds of which there are more than 450 globally are therefore exposing themselves to a dependency on natural services that are at risk from a range of disruptive trends including climate change and a growing population more than 40 of the total 11 6trn in assets across pdbs is highly dependent on vulnerable ecosystems such as fishers relying on declining stocks of fish the report notes f4b ambassador jeremy eppel said these publicly owned banks should be fulfilling their mandate to foster development in a way that protects the environment but without adequate measurement and reporting of biodiversity risks how can their shareholder governments or their citizens know that development banks are not damaging the biodiversity and other natural resources that they committed to protect many development banks have been slow to assess nature related risks citing a lack of data around biodiversity and nature our published methodology shows that any financial institution can make a credible first pass biodiversity related stress test of its balance sheet pbds are state owned financial institutions and the report notes that the g20 is particularly exposed to nature based risks as a result g20 countries have collective stakes in 28 development banks that are worth nearly 7trn the report notes additionally these countries have the majority of board votes in seven out of the eight largest multilateral development banks they also hold large stakes in the world bank 42 european bank for reconstruction and development 56 and the asian development bank 47 separate research found that g20 member countries collectively allocated subsidies topping 3 3trn to the oil coal gas and fossil fuelled electricity generation sectors between 2015 and 2019 a level incompatible with the paris agreement that was according to a report from bloomberg nef and bloomberg philanthropies entitled the climate policy factbook the report highlights the fact that direct support for fossil fuels from the g20 governments in 2019 topped 636bn a decrease of just 10 since the ratification of the paris agreement in 2015 as such the f4b report calls on pdbs to better incorporate nature risks into its planning the report calls on the banks to publish a whole balance sheet stress test of nature related financial risks and impacts within the next 12 months the report arrives just days after the french development agency afd confirmed that it would lead a development finance hub as part of the broader network supporting the taskforce on nature related financial disclosures tnfd senior figures from global banking giants including blackrock hsbc and bank of america have been selected to help shape a new global framework from the tnfd the finalised framework is earmarked for release in late 2023 however the tnfd aims to release a draft version early next year which will be tested via an open innovation approach with a selection of market participants a total of 30 new members will sit on at least one of five working groups that will each focus on defining nature related risks data availability landscape of standards and metrics development of a beta framework and pilot testing and integration more than 100 institutions have also agreed to help the taskforce through a broader consulting forum matt mace
american president joe biden again asked congress to lift the united states debt limit after a meeting wednesday with the nation s business leaders the white house council of economic advisors warned before the meeting that the united states government will default on its obligations if congress does not raise the debt limit by october 18 a default is a failure to meet the legal obligations of a loan the council said millions of americans might not receive their payments from social security and government healthcare a default could also affect national defense and pandemic services since many countries depend on the u s monetary policy it said a default would likely cause credit markets worldwide to freeze up and stock markets to plunge employers around the world would likely have to begin laying off workers what is the debt limit like some of us governments sometimes spend more money than they receive from taxes so they have to borrow money by issuing bonds or debts to be repaid later in the u s congress has the power to set a debt limit it is the maximum amount of debt that the department of the treasury can issue to the public or to other federal agencies since 1960 congress has changed the debt limit 78 times under both republican and democratic administrations to pay for government operations raising the debt limit does not mean that treasury has more money to spend it only permits the u s government to finance existing legal obligations when the limit is reached the treasury cannot issue more debt or borrow more money what is the current situation in august 2019 the u s congress passed a budget deal with support from both republican and democratic lawmakers that raised spending and suspended the debt limit for two years under the agreement the money borrowed during the suspension of the debt limit will be added to the previous limit of 22 trillion an additional 6 5 trillion had been borrowed since the 2019 tax cuts and pandemic spending raising the nation s debt limit to 28 5 trillion the congressional budget office estimated that the federal government has a deficit of 2 7 trillion for the budget year ending in september 2021 the government also ran up deficits each year from 2016 to 2020 technically the u s has already reached its debt limit at the end of july as agreed to in the 2019 budget deal once the debt limit is reached the u s cannot borrow more money to pay its bills but treasury could and has used extraordinary measures like delaying some payments to employees retirement funds to avoid a default unless congress acts to raise the debt limit the bipartisan policy center projects that the u s will most likely reach the limit between october 15 and november 4 the center added that a default would likely raise borrowing costs as investors will demand a higher rate of return on u s debts even a short term default it said could also threaten the country s current economic recovery why does the u s have a debt limit before world war i the u s congress permitted borrowing only for special reasons such as the building of the panama canal in 1917 congress passed a law that set a debt limit it gave treasury some flexibility in dealing with the national debt to pay for the war the u s is one of few countries around the world with a debt limit denmark is often noted as another developed country with a debt limit but denmark often sets its borrowing limit so high that a default is not really possible for many years in the u s raising the debt limit was not an issue the republican party has since only supported increase while it has controlled the white house it has argued against raising the limit under democratic administrations earlier this year democratic congressman bill foster of illinois introduced a bill to end the debt limit the bill however is not guaranteed to pass with the currently divided legislature late on wednesday senate republican leader mitch mcconnell told democrats he would permit an emergency debt limit extension into december to avoid a default if the offer is accepted the u s will have to deal with the debt limit again by the end of the year i m jill robbins hai do wrote this story for voa learning english susan shand was the editor __________________________________________________ words in this story obligation n something that you must do plunge v drop suddenly maximum n the highest number that is permitted flexibility n ability to change things easily

support nonprofit journalism wglt is community powered it s the fall fund drive and your financial support at wglt org is the power we rely on to keep your favorite npr programs on the air and your newsroom local join the community that powers wglt with a contribution austin hinshaw was working as a sous chef at a local restaurant when he found out earlier this year he has lung cancer at the time he said it seemed like the end of his world i kinda just went off the deep end hinshaw explained i stopped working stopped paying my rent that s why i m here here is the mclean county law and justice center hinshaw was ordered to appear for a court hearing after his landlord filed to evict him from his bloomington apartment hinshaw said after he took leave from work he fell months behind on his rent the landlord gave him five days to pay up or move out hinshaw said he hopes his landlord will work with him to get caught up but he s not sure that will save him i feel like i put them through the ringer so i completely understand if they did not want to he said hinshaw is one of thousands of illinoisans at risk of losing their home as the state eviction moratorium expires gov jb pritzker allowed the moratorium to expire after a 1 1 2 years citing the 1 5 billion in assistance the state has made available to renters and homeowners during the pandemic the courthouse in bloomington is getting increasingly busy with new eviction filings while mclean county has offered a program to help people stay in their homes erin duncan is an attorney with prairie state legal services a bloomington agency that offers free legal help for low income families in central and northern illinois duncan helps clients in mclean county navigate an eviction diversion program meeting with clients and with attorneys for the landlords she encourages tenants to apply for state and federal rental assistance if they haven t already that includes funding through the illinois rental payment program that can pay up to a year of back rent and three months of prospective rent for people who have an active eviction case said duncan adding this assistance buys time for tenants she said that works best for everyone because then the landlord gets paid and the tenant gets to stay and in our mind that s a win win duncan said hopefully folks can have some patience with the process so we can try to keep families and individuals housed but rental assistance requires a lot of patience perhaps more than some landlords may have after waiting months for rent payments from some tenants duncan said the process to get rental assistance has been slow adding she s concerned too many people will run out of time as the eviction moratorium expires we are hoping to avoid a situation where we have double or more than the usual number of cases in any given month of course that s bad for community transmission of covid 19 but also the many disruptions that come with housing instability she said eviction filings increase eviction filings have picked up again in mclean county there were 28 eviction filings in mclean county in august according to mclean county circuit clerk don everhart that number grew to 32 in september the county doesn t have an exact comparison to pre pandemic evictions because the county did not separate residential and commercial evictions pre covid but it appears mclean county is still behind pre pandemic totals the county averaged 48 evictions per month in 2018 and 70 per month in 2019 duncan said she s concerned some landlords were just waiting for the eviction moratorium to expire because of how challenging it s been to keep up with all the changes and moratorium extensions mark fellheimer is chief judge of the eleventh judicial circuit that includes mclean county fellheimer said if ever there was a good time for eviction filings it s now with the diversion program in place fellheimer said the program has kept cases from going to trial for unpaid rent almost all of those have ended up with a dismissal of the eviction case fellheimer said we ve seen good luck i can t do much about the folks who don t show up in court fellheimer said the court will help tenants as much as it can but judges can no longer sympathize once a case goes to trial the judges are now going to be put in a difficult spot of having to sign those eviction orders by following the law since we are neutral to both sides it s a struggle judges have to deal with but that was what we were sworn to uphold the law that s in place fellheimer said eric stock wglt keatta davis not every case that winds up in eviction court is simply about rent not being paid some cases are far more complicated keatta davis said she fell behind 10 000 in rent for her apartment davis said the landlord did not offer her a new lease because nearby residents complained about bugs they said were coming from her place she blames the exterminator for that it turns out the eviction program couldn t help her because her hardship wasn t covid related davis agreed to move out in a week she said she doesn t have many options but is ready to put the legal case behind her it s a relief that i m trying to get this done but it s also hard because i really don t know anyone out here davis said davis said she has been in and out of the hospital being treated for diabetes and has a history of health problems that includes sleep apnea and cognitive delays due to a lead exposure as a child she said now she s trying to get back her own kids child protective services took them after she was charged with child endangerment davis said she had trouble sleeping after her grandfather died and her 4 year old was found alone outside davis is contesting the charges but she hopes settling the eviction case can provide a fresh start i just have to find another apartment so i can get my babies back said davis adding she plans to move in with her mother in normal and find work the eviction diversion program also may not be able to help people like austin hinshaw of bloomington his eviction also was not covid related but hinshaw said he s grateful diversion programs are in place to help people like him i m just thankful they were able to help me as much as they did i came in here not knowing what was going to happen hinshaw said after his court appearance hinshaw said he plans to move out of his apartment anyway find a new place to live find a new job and pay all of his back rent the federal moratorium expired in august after the u s supreme court ruled the centers for disease control exceeded its authority when it tried to extend the moratorium to areas with significant covid transmission
and the market republicans defeat that cr yeah let me be crystal clear about this republicans are united in opposition to raising the debt ceiling not because it doesn t need to be done so i want to make sure everybody clearly understands this the last time the debt ceiling was raised it was done on a bipartisan basis in conjunction with an overall caps agreement and that debt ceiling increase covers basically what we did last year this year is unique and you know i ve been here a while i ve never seen such an effort to expand the reach of the federal government like we ve been confronted with this year through not just one reconciliation process but apparently yet another so if they want to do all of this on a partisan basis they have the ability and the responsibility to ensure that the federal government not default and they will have to take care of that thank you i d like every single republican senator to answer the question are they willing to let the government default as to the plans we are working there are a number of different options the white house speaker pelosi myself are discussing those and we believe that we must do this we believe it s an imperative to do it and leader mcconnell as i said is playing a dangerous political games by not stepping up to the plate as he asked us to do and we did when trump was president advertisement congress foresees short term debt ceiling fix amid perilous standoff share copy link copy republican and democratic leaders edged back wednesday from a perilous standoff over lifting the nation s borrowing cap with democratic senators signaling they were receptive to an offer from senate gop leader mitch mcconnell that would allow an emergency extension into december mcconnell made the offer shortly before republicans were prepared to block legislation to suspend the debt limit until december of next year and as president joe biden and business leaders ramped up their concerns that an unprecedented federal default would disrupt government payments to millions of people and throw the nation into recession the emerging agreement sets the stage for a sequel of sorts in december when congress will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays a procedural vote on the longer extension the republicans were going to block was abruptly delayed late wednesday and the senate recessed so lawmakers could discuss next steps democrats emerged from their meeting more optimistic that a crisis would be averted basically i m glad that mitch mcconnell finally saw the light said sen bernie sanders the independent senator from vermont the republicans have finally done the right thing and at least we now have another couple months in order to get a permanent solution sen chris murphy d conn added that assuming final details in the emergency legislation are in order for the next three months we ll continue to make it clear that we are ready to continue to vote to pay our bills and republicans aren t unsurprisingly mcconnell portrayed it very differently this will moot democrats excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation he said congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it would quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load mcconnell and senate republicans have insisted that democrats would have to go it alone to raise the debt ceiling and allow the treasury to renew its borrowing so that the country could meet its financial obligations further mcconnell has insisted that democrats use the same cumbersome legislative process called reconciliation that they used to pass a 1 9 trillion covid relief bill and have been employing to try and pass biden s 3 5 trillion measure to boost safety net health and environmental programs mcconnell said in his offer wednesday that republicans would still insist that democrats use the reconciliation process for a long term debt limit extension however he said republicans are willing to assist in expediting that process and in the meantime democrats may use the normal legislative process to pass a short term debt limit extension while he continued to blame democrats his offer will also allow republicans to avoid the condemnation they would have gotten from some quarters for causing a financial crisis earlier wednesday biden enlisted top business leaders to push for immediately suspending the debt limit saying the approaching deadline created the risk of a historic default that would be like a meteor that could crush the economy and financial markets at a white house event the president shamed republican senators for threatening to filibuster any suspension of the 28 4 trillion cap on the government s borrowing authority he leaned into the credibility of corporate america a group that has traditionally been aligned with the gop on tax and regulatory issues to drive home his point as the heads of citi jp morgan chase and nasdaq gathered in person and virtually to say the debt limit must be lifted it s not right and it s dangerous biden said of the resistance by senate republicans his moves came amid talk that democrats might try to change senate filibuster rules to get around republicans but sen joe manchin d w v reiterated his opposition to such a change wednesday likely taking it off the table for democrats the business leaders echoed biden s points about needing to end the stalemate as soon as possible though they sidestepped the partisan tensions in doing so each portrayed the debt limit as an avoidable crisis we just can t wait to the last minute to resolve this said jane fraser ceo of the bank citi we are simply put playing with fire right now and our country has suffered so greatly over the last few years the human and the economic cost of the pandemic has been wrenching and we don t need a catastrophe of our own making the financial markets have yet to fully register the drama in washington though there are signs that they are getting jittery said adena friedman ceo of the nasdaq stock exchange stock prices rose after news of mcconnell s offer came out ahead of the white house meeting the administration warned that if the borrowing limit isn t extended it could set off an international financial crisis the united states might not be able to manage a default would send shock waves through global financial markets and would likely cause credit markets worldwide to freeze up and stock markets to plunge the white house council of economic advisers said in a new report employers around the world would likely have to begin laying off workers the recession that could be triggered could be worse than the 2008 financial crisis because it would come as many nations are still struggling with the covid 19 pandemic the report said it was first obtained by the new york times to get around the standoff taking place in the senate biden indicated in off the cuff comments tuesday democrats were weighing a change to senate rules it s a real possibility biden told reporters outside the white house but manchin who has for months resisted pressure from liberal activists to change the filibuster so that democrats can advance legislation on other issues such as voting rights appeared unmoved i think i ve been very clear manchin told reporters nothing changes he implored senate majority leader chuck schumer and gop leader mcconnell to work together to resolve the impasse getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60 vote threshold for passage to 50 in the split 50 50 senate vice president kamala harris could then break a tie allowing democrats to push past republicans but to succeed in changing the rules all democratic senators would need to be on board once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load ___ ap business writer stan choe contributed from new york

seeking an auto in wild times of mega deception editor s note this column is dedicated to jc s brother p j campion whose guidance and stellar recon work put him in a position to survive some crazy shit author s note if you have read this column for even a week much less the last twenty four years you know what a cynical skeptic i am i ve purchased many cars and faced some bizarre behavior for decades and hell southeast toyota finance would not take my late father s lease after he exited the planet in 2019 without putting the car up for auction and our family having to pay the balance i know how ruthless and dishonest this industry can be so make sure you keep this in mind when reading the following mayhem before the deluge of angst i m going to lead this one with a positive after one solid week of searching for either a new car lease or a used car purchase in a time of computer chip shortages shrinking inventory and underhanded car dealer bullshit i found the car i ultimately wanted a mitsubishi outlander se thanks in no small part to the honest and upstanding folks at nielson mitsubishi in rockaway n j especially its manager andrew kamaris and salesman ryan bet those guys were an welcomed oasis in an arid landscape of abject prevarication the nielsen group is the only dealership in a thirty mile radius of my home that is not currently raising prices by anywhere from five to eight grand on automobiles and running bait and switch schemes to rival a congressional bill caucus it is the wild west out there boy did i find this out the hard way my experience started about two weeks ago with a recon visit to route 17 mitsubishi in ramsey n j spoke to a fast talking lifer named pete he assured me what i was looking for was in stock at the advertised price a base model outlander i was more interested in this level of what they call in the industry trim than the slightly more expensive se that i ended up with but more on that later because you see pete did not care about any ad two grand down three year lease at 10k miles a year for 334 that drove me to the dealership in the first place nor that he assured me on the phone before i came in that he had everything in stock he showed me the se we drove it throughout the test drive i was flabbergasted that the base model had heated and electric seats climate control etc oh yeah and plus we don t have computer chips in these so we never had a shortage pete like his promise of everything in stock was making all of this up he then came back with well north of 450 a month with four grand down and a four year lease i did not want a four year lease he told me i could bolt on the lease after three he did not mention that i would still have to pay for a car i was no longer driving none of which was in the ad when i showed him the ad he proceeded to lie badly that it was for a front wheel drive vehicle note i have worked with truly agile liars in my time pete sucked at it it was not front wheel drive in the ad my bro p j confirmed this on the phone and sent me the link i showed pete the link this put pete on his heels forcing him to blurt out that the car in the ad was the es base model not what i drove i reminded him that he assured me that what i drove was the base model he started coming apart at this point in our dali esque illogic speak this rote character out of central casting of a slick old time car huckster was not holding it together i told him and whatever suit came out pretending to be the manager that if they got the car i wanted i would be back two days hence to buy it pete and the de facto manager said they would have it by then they even sent me a text asking if i was still coming a day later i never heard from them again p j suggested the aforementioned nielsen group around this time and when i called the guy whose name i do not recall but this could have been my hero ryan he did not blow smoke up my skirt we just do not have any es models in the color you want man it s tough to get or keep anything now to make matters more complicated i really wanted the car in dark gray i understood and appreciated his honesty it turns out i should have stayed with nielsen but i moved onto another dealer fairly close like 45 minutes away close in goshen n y mainly because my pal brock lives up there and he is a car guy and he trusted his area to come through for me but predictably healy mitsubishi could not help but crank up the lie machine when i called they said they had the cars on their web site in their lot i had not been completely felled by a phalanx of deceit yet so i took the long trip to goshen cue the sinister music here a lovely young woman greeted us and proceeded to say that not only did they not have any of those cars listed on their site but the first woman i spoke to who answered the healy mitsubishi phone and oozed confidence to this end had no authority to promise any of this she is merely the web person i would confront this web person mystery before too long with another manufacturer fed up with mitsubishi my bro did some recon on a car my late dad was interested in back in the day a nissan murano route 23 nissan in butler answered my queries about its availably and price this way my manager wants to know what you want to pay for the car i told him five hundred bucks with a used moped trade in he did not get the joke i wished to know what the professionals at nissan wanted to charge for the car since i had never even seen the fucking thing in person just some photos on the internet they did not call me back for nearly the entire week and when they did they said that i had to put five grand down and that it would be marked up six grand and the monthly payments were north of five bills i wished them well and said i preferred my offer with the moped he still did not get it as mentioned once i drove pete s se the bastard had me hooked so my bro sent me to route 46 mitsubishi where comedy and tragedy reside comfortably to form a miserable cocktail of time wasting crapolla to their credit these lunatics hid nothing the manager a corpulent smile fiend with an open shirt revealing a giant crucifix laying on a tuft of chest hair sat me down and explained the current economic climate i m going to be honest with you ignore the msrp the way the industry is right now you can automatically add five grand to every sticker price he said affecting an air of parental guidance he may have even touched my knee sympathetically but i probably conjured that due to lightheadedness yet i still drove one of their es series and it was something like 498 a month with 5 500 down and by the way i found out the es s hood undulates spastically if you get it over sixty mph something they failed to mention until i told them about my highway experience oh that s a recall so i m woefully overpaying for a damaged car i must eventually take back in fantastic before i left i found a plaque with the president and vice president i assume of the dealership who wanted me to call if i was not 100 satisfied you can imagine that i did this because i did at first i got something called the sun homes sales group in florida when i called again the prompt sent me right to the vp i left my message of hate and rage he never returned my call for comment one last shot a used outlander my bro found city motor group in haskell that advertised a used 2016 se looked clean he said 16 769 00 forty five thousand miles on it drove down there perfectly cordial bunch test drove it liked it then they sent me to the finance guy and things went sideways fast after something called a multi state inspection fee of 1 800 00 and other hidden fees added on a list i had to wrest from the guy as if it were trump s tax returns the final number was 21 grand another five thousand dollar mark up when i brought up the idea that making sure a car they were selling could pass inspection might be on them like say if you buy a steak in a restaurant you assume that meant it was being cooked without a special fee he said that because things are so crazy out there they can get away with it we used to pay for this but now people are willing to pay for it he was right when i checked on the car writing this it was sold cue the p t barnum quote about suckers note on the city motor group web site is a code of ethics under something called the national independent automotive dealers association that has as much integrity as the multi state inspection charge because if you go to their web site you get a 404 web page not found message it reads i added the italics for comedic emphasis members of the niada and its state associations are independent auto dealers that abide by a strict code of ethics for membership that will give you additional peace of mind among other things niada dealers commit to operating with integrity honor and fair dealing toward the general public comply with all city county state and federal laws employ truth and accuracy in advertising and selling and constantly strive to improve business methods to the end that the public is better served when you re done throwing up it s important to note the operative words found in that pile of steaming shit all city county state and federal laws there are no laws it s like opec without the third century garb that should frighten us the most but i digress at this point i can tell you i tried to buy a car listed as a 2021 chevy trailblazer at schumacher chevrolet in clifton that was not only on their web site but i called first and spoke to another mysterious web person who told me as i was six minutes out they had the car on the lot ten or so minutes later the guy on the floor said it sold two days ago after he said it was a service model and some other stammering nonsense but i won t burden you any further suffice to say p j s desperate last minute plan of building the outlander of my choice on their corporate web site the sunday evening before the good people at nielsen saved my ass was a winner after only a couple of minutes with these guys i knew the difference between a preponderance of dealers out there that are using this crisis to gouge consumers and those who are riding it out with us and trying to do the right thing and quite frankly considering the vagaries of capitalism who knows what the right thing is they are selling these cars people need them and dealerships need to stay solvent selling only a portion of their inventory no one expects this computer chip shortage to subside until maybe the end of next year and who knows what a world looks like without covid anymore but beware there are sharks in the water now and they have ramped up their image of charlatans a notch or two finding salesman like andrew and ryan in these waters is rare but they are out there hang in there like p j and me but don t give into the that s the way it is now eat it mentality they want you to give in to get lazy to accept their reality it does not have to be love my car love even more that it took all of the above and more to get it at the proper price from honest sellers never surrender
washington ap republican and democratic leaders edged back wednesday from a perilous standoff over lifting the nation s borrowing cap with democratic senators signaling they were receptive to an offer from senate gop leader mitch mcconnell that washington ap republican and democratic leaders edged back wednesday from a perilous standoff over lifting the nation s borrowing cap with democratic senators signaling they were receptive to an offer from senate gop leader mitch mcconnell that would allow an emergency extension into december mcconnell made the offer shortly before republicans were prepared to block legislation to suspend the debt limit until december of next year and as president joe biden and business leaders ramped up their concerns that an unprecedented federal default would disrupt government payments to millions of people and throw the nation into recession the emerging agreement sets the stage for a sequel of sorts in december when congress will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays a procedural vote on the longer extension the republicans were going to block was abruptly delayed late monday and the senate recessed so lawmakers could discuss next steps democrats emerged from their meeting more optimistic that a crisis would be averted basically i m glad that mitch mcconnell finally saw the light said sen bernie sanders the independent senator from vermont the republicans have finally done the right thing and at least we now have another couple months in order to get a permanent solution sen chris murphy d conn added that assuming final details in the emergency legislation are in order for the next three months we ll continue to make it clear that we are ready to continue to vote to pay our bills and republicans aren t unsurprisingly mcconnell portrayed it very differently this will moot democrats excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation he said congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it would quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load mcconnell and senate republicans have insisted that democrats would have to go it alone to raise the debt ceiling and allow the treasury to renew its borrowing so that the country could meet its financial obligations further mcconnell has insisted that democrats use the same cumbersome legislative process called reconciliation that they used to pass a 1 9 trillion covid relief bill and have been employing to try and pass biden s 3 5 trillion measure to boost safety net health and environmental programs mcconnell said in his offer wednesday that republicans would still insist that democrats use the reconciliation process for a long term debt limit extension however he said republicans are willing to assist in expediting that process and in the meantime democrats may use the normal legislative process to pass a short term debt limit extension while he continued to blame democrats his offer will also allow republicans to avoid the condemnation they would have gotten from some quarters for causing a financial crisis earlier wednesday biden enlisted top business leaders to push for immediately suspending the debt limit saying the approaching deadline created the risk of a historic default that would be like a meteor that could crush the economy and financial markets at a white house event the president shamed republican senators for threatening to filibuster any suspension of the 28 4 trillion cap on the government s borrowing authority he leaned into the credibility of corporate america a group that has traditionally been aligned with the gop on tax and regulatory issues to drive home his point as the heads of citi jp morgan chase and nasdaq gathered in person and virtually to say the debt limit must be lifted it s not right and it s dangerous biden said of the resistance by senate republicans his moves came amid talk that democrats might try to change senate filibuster rules to get around republicans but sen joe manchin d w v reiterated his opposition to such a change wednesday likely taking it off the table for democrats the business leaders echoed biden s points about needing to end the stalemate as soon as possible though they sidestepped the partisan tensions in doing so each portrayed the debt limit as an avoidable crisis we just can t wait to the last minute to resolve this said jane fraser ceo of the bank citi we are simply put playing with fire right now and our country has suffered so greatly over the last few years the human and the economic cost of the pandemic has been wrenching and we don t need a catastrophe of our own making the financial markets have yet to fully register the drama in washington though there are signs that they are getting jittery said adena friedman ceo of the nasdaq stock exchange stock prices rose after news of mcconnell s offer came out ahead of the white house meeting the administration warned that if the borrowing limit isn t extended it could set off an international financial crisis the united states might not be able to manage a default would send shock waves through global financial markets and would likely cause credit markets worldwide to freeze up and stock markets to plunge the white house council of economic advisers said in a new report employers around the world would likely have to begin laying off workers the recession that could be triggered could be worse than the 2008 financial crisis because it would come as many nations are still struggling with the covid 19 pandemic the report said it was first obtained by the new york times to get around the standoff taking place in the senate biden indicated in off the cuff comments tuesday democrats were weighing a change to senate rules it s a real possibility biden told reporters outside the white house but manchin who has for months resisted pressure from liberal activists to change the filibuster so that democrats can advance legislation on other issues such as voting rights appeared unmoved i think i ve been very clear manchin told reporters nothing changes he implored senate majority leader chuck schumer and gop leader mcconnell to work together to resolve the impasse getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60 vote threshold for passage to 50 in the split 50 50 senate vice president kamala harris could then break a tie allowing democrats to push past republicans but to succeed in changing the rules all democratic senators would need to be on board once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load kevin freking and josh boak the

timothy mellon is the wyoming based grandson of banking tycoon andrew mellon he is responsible for nearly 98 of the donations to texas border wall fund by james barragán and carla astudillo texas tribune an out of state billionaire who has previously bankrolled attempts to defend controversial immigration laws is responsible for nearly all the donations to gov greg abbott s 54 million border wall fund a member of one of america s richest family dynasties timothy mellon contributed nearly 98 of the fund s total donations when he donated 53 1 million in stock to the state in august according to public records mellon is the 79 year old wyoming based grandson of banking tycoon and former u s treasury secretary andrew mellon before mellon s donations abbott s private fundraising campaign had stalled at about 1 25 million around mid august two months after its launch a drop in the bucket for a project with a price tag estimated in the billions of dollars but on aug 27 a state website that tracks donations to the crowdfunding effort said the fund had jumped to nearly 19 million by the end of the month it had topped 54 million the donations have since stalled again mellon did not respond to multiple requests for comment made to his company new hampshire based pan am systems and a marketing firm that handled publicity for his 2015 autobiography abbott declined to comment mellon does not appear to have close ties to texas but he was a top donor to the reelection campaign of former president donald trump who made building a border wall a top priority and has previously donated money to defend legislation targeting immigrants in 2010 he gave an unsolicited 1 5 million to the legal defense of an arizona law that required police to determine the immigration status of people suspected of being in the country illegally according to the washington post critics said the law would lead to racial profiling the law was challenged all the way to the u s supreme court which struck down parts of it but left intact the section allowing officers to ask about immigration status last year mellon gave 20 million to america first action the main super pac supporting trump s reelection since 2018 he s donated 30 million to the congressional leadership fund the house gop super pac and he gave 30 million to the senate leadership fund which tries to elect republicans to the u s senate in 2020 mellon has not donated to abbott but he gave 2 500 to republican gubernatorial challenger allen west when west ran for congress in florida in 2012 mellon ramped up his political donations in 2018 while he overwhelmingly supports conservative campaigns and republicans mellon also gave to two democrats u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez of new york in 2018 and former u s rep tulsi gabbard of hawaii for her bid for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination ocasio cortez s campaign later said it did not solicit the donation and would return it mellon has taken heat for using offensive stereotypes to describe black americans in his self published autobiography in the 2015 book mellon wrote that after the great society programs of the 1960s which were intended to tackle poverty and racial injustice black people became even more belligerent and unwilling to pitch in to improve their own situations according to the washington post he also called social safety net programs slavery redux mellon is the chair of pan am systems a privately held transportation and freight holding company in the 1980s he founded a rail company called guilford transportation industries in the 1990s he rebranded the company after buying the brand of bankrupt pan am airways forbes estimated mellon was worth almost 1 billion in 2014 and last year the magazine estimated the mellon family was worth 11 5 billion abbott s crowdsourced wall abbott a two term republican has made border security his top priority this year as he seeks reelection next year and is fighting off challenges from his right abbott has blamed the biden administration for an increase in migrants at the border in march abbott deployed state military and police resources to the border to help federal authorities enforce immigration law in june he announced a state of disaster in 34 counties that were seeing large increases in migrant crossings and he unveiled his plan to build a state funded border wall picking up where trump left off the texas legislature has approved nearly 3 billion over the next two year budget cycle toward border security with about 1 billion going to the governor s office for grants including 750 million dedicated to construction of a border wall texas is already paying 25 million for a nearly 2 mile concrete barrier along state loop 480 in eagle pass portions of the federal border wall started by the trump administration and put on hold by the biden administration ranged from 6 million per mile to 34 million per mile for construction abbott s office said it has identified 733 miles of border that may need some type of barrier while the state displays the aggregate of private donations to the border wall on its website it does not readily provide the names of individual donors despite a commitment from abbott early on that the crowdfunding effort would have transparency and accountability outside of mellon the fund received more than 12 100 individual donations as of sept 14 totaling about 1 3 million the median donation was 50 that level of fundraising is more in line with a similar crowdfunding attempt by arizona lawmakers 10 years ago to raise private money for constructing a fence on the mexican border that effort received about 270 000 in three years according to the arizona republic during the trump administration a nonprofit called we build the wall which included his former political adviser steve bannon as a board member raised 25 million for a border wall bannon and brian kolfage the group s leader were accused by the federal government in august 2020 of looting the charity for personal gain bannon was later pardoned by trump tax benefit tax experts say mellon s decision to donate stock instead of cash could yield a tax benefit for the billionaire normally a person has to pay taxes on profits made on their investments when they are sold but investors who donate stock to charity avoid paying a tax on the earnings on their investment and get a tax deduction for the full amount of stock it s common to give stock that s increased in value because they can get rid of the gains and they can deduct the donations said lloyd mayer a professor at notre dame law school such donations are usually made to nonprofit organizations but under the tax code a charitable contribution to a state would likely be tax deductible if it is made exclusively for public purposes some people for example get tax deductions for donating money to cut the federal debt the only hurdle is ensuring the money is only used for public purposes in the case of border wall presumably built upon public land i think it d be hard to argue there are private purposes said lisa de simone an accounting professor at the mccombs school of business at the university of texas at austin but mayer said such donations raise questions about undue influence by wealthy donors on governmental policymaking in june tennessee billionaire willis johnson offered south dakota gov kristi noem 1 million to help pay for a state national guard s deployment to the border to aid texas efforts to catch people crossing illegally the state s soldiers were then sent to the texas border the thing that s controversial about these kinds of donations is whether they re distorting government priorities if government collects money in taxes and the government legislature and governor decide how to spend it they re setting their priorities based on the political environment mayer said but if you open it up to donations you re handing what the government should spend their money on to wealthy donors

just keep it flowing three people working to untangle supply chain collapse inside miracle mile toys gifts in los angeles owner christina mullin is deftly guiding a customer past the disruption in toy deliveries caused by the global supply chain backup of specific concern is an adorable wooden train that carries safari animals we re out of that she apologizes to a woman who wants it for her little boy then follows up can i take your name she ll contact the customer when it arrives but the woman is from out of town so ms mullin suggests a different wooden train it s the same brand and comes with a remote control the mother is happy with that and leaves with an additional gift a tray of plush play sushi for her daughter so california i hope against hope that i get my order before christmas says ms mullin about the popular train and other items on back order she s no expert she explains but she thinks they might be on a container ship somewhere because they re made in china meanwhile she s looking to try some new products and help customers find a new favorite ms mullin s missing toys could very well be aboard one of the dozens of ships that are waiting to enter the port complex of los angeles and long beach the twin ports move more than 40 of all cargo containers entering the united states now the complex has become a critical chokepoint in a tangled global web of shortages and shipping troubles affecting everything from school lunches to toilet paper again to auto parts to unravel what s happening the monitor visited with three human links in the la supply chain the director of ship traffic control for southern california a harbor trucker and the toy store retailer their stories illustrate the interconnectedness of the problems and efforts to address them any small disruption is a multiplier when supply chains are stretched says gad allon a professor of operations information and decision at the wharton school in philadelphia ports that are already running near capacity can t catch up when their operations are disrupted when you close a port in china for a week it s going to have a massive impact that s not a hypothetical statement the bottleneck here in los angeles is just one link in a global supply chain that lacks lubrication for months factories in asia have faced shortages of parts raw materials and workers amid the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus ports in china have had to halt operations the suez canal closure in march when a giant ship ran aground imposed lasting ripple effects in recent weeks chinese factories have experienced power shortages due to energy rollbacks ordered by local governments trying to hit their emissions targets alongside squeezed supply is rebounding demand for goods a surge in activity is coming from u s consumers shopping from home and juiced by stimulus checks and low interest rates in the short term companies will find workarounds to speed up deliveries of u s bound goods but there are no easy fixes for example airlines are flying less so they offer fewer cargo holds for transporting finished goods for the longer term questions about how to bolster supply chains go beyond the pandemic and its effects says dan breznitz a professor of public policy at the university of toronto who co directs its innovation policy lab even once the current backlog is resolved the challenge of managing risk in supply chains remains especially amid worries about overreliance on imports from china i think we have a serious problem with the way we produce stuff and i don t think this is going away says professor breznitz we have a system that is very vulnerable francine kiefer the christian science monitor capt j kipling kip louttit executive director of the marine exchange of southern california stands on the balcony of the building where he oversees traffic control for ships entering and leaving the twin ports of los angeles and long beach on sept 27 2021 in the background is san pedro bay where ships are anchored awaiting a berth to unload like air traffic control but for ships capt j kipling kip louttit has been around ports most of his life his father was a welder in a shipyard in pennsylvania then enlisted in the navy and ended up in the publishing business in manhattan because he loved the water he bought a boat for his family when kip was just 10 years old the youngster found he was really good at this water thing and went on to a decadeslong career with the u s coast guard from which he is now retired he couldn t stay away from the water though and now he s the executive director of the marine exchange of southern california which controls ship traffic in and out of the ports of los angeles and long beach from his vantage point on a hill near a former defense battery he has a commanding view of the docks and cranes of the twin ports san pedro bay santa catalina island and the ships in the area i m the true romantic who is the son of a romantic he says he s also an operations guy repeating his mantra of safe secure efficient reliable and environmentally sound marine transportation the past 18 months have put him and his team of 20 people to the test they have had to navigate the pandemic in a round the clock operation that meant no vacations last year as well as relocating the general manager to his home garage where he is still working set up with computers and radar they have also had to manage a historic surge in ship traffic that has been breaking records for weeks on end while communicating with ship captains who may not know the port complex and for whom english may not be their first language francine kiefer the christian science monitor hector gallardo a ship traffic controller for the marine exchange of southern california in san pedro keeps his eye on a radar screen showing the positions of dozens of ships awaiting entry to the ports of los angeles and long beach on sept 27 2021 the left side shows the big picture including ships in drift areas the right side shows a close up of the precautionary area where shipping lanes intersect and where most of the anchorages are located he uses the gray radio to communicate with the ships because the ports are full ships are directed to anchor in specific spots to await their turn but those spots are also at capacity and so ships are sent farther out to drift areas the drifting ships turn off engines that power their propellers repositioning themselves when necessary and are advised to keep 2 miles apart on sept 19 a record 73 container ships were at anchor or drifting normally one container ship or none is at anchor captain louttit calls this a podium kicker statistic pay attention captain louttit objects to descriptions of the port backup as a traffic jam because it implies ships blocking the middle of the road the shipping lanes in and out of the ports and up and down the coast are clear with the marine exchange assigning and watching over parking places for ships in an orderly way he explains we can handle virtually any number of ships it s not like landing at lax with one ship every minute he says referring to the international airport but the consequences of an accident are huge particularly in terms of an oil spill fouling southern california waters the comment made before this month s oil spill now seems prescient federal investigators say a cargo vessel s anchor may have hooked an underwater pipeline tearing it and spilling 140 000 gallons of oil along the southern california coastline anchor dragging is rare and the anchor sites are away from critical infrastructure like pipelines and communication lines right now is peak shipping season in preparation for the holidays the ports can normally handle this but the problem is the backlog says captain louttit last year the peak season was amplified by people buying home gym equipment outfitting home offices and remodeling their homes then add to that all the cash that people did not spend on vacations and theme parks plus workers out because of illness or quarantine it s rippled across the docks to the trains the trucks the warehouses the forklift drivers so the system choked and they haven t been able to clear it since his answer put the entire goods movement system on a 24 7 work schedule to both clear the backlog and then compete in the future he s not the only one thinking that way truckers turned away at the ports everybody s trying to get creative nowadays and see how we can keep cargo flowing says gio marz from the loading dock of atlas marine a long beach trucking and warehouse company where he is the operations manager when you grow up in the port area you become one of three things says mr marz a longshoreman on the docks a refinery worker or a trucker mr marz got his commercial driver s license when he was 18 and he s been driving trucks pretty much ever since he sometimes still drives his own rig and mentioned a personal experience from the spring that speaks directly to the hours issue to drop off or pick up a container a trucker needs an appointment at a port terminal which comes with a grace period but with full ports everyone is trying to get to their appointment on time so they arrive early which makes for a huge line while some terminals are more lenient than others it s not unusual that the congestion causes truckers to miss their appointments and have to turn around francine kiefer the christian science monitor gio marz director of operations for atlas marine trucking and storage in long beach california shows off one of the company s new rigs powered by natural gas on sept 28 2021 mr marz says that for harbor truckers it s not a lack of drivers that s the problem but workflow and congestion at the ports as well as an acute shortage of chassis to haul full containers that s what happened with mr marz earlier this year he pulled up at a terminal at the port of los angeles the largest port in the u s at the exact last minute of his grace period they told me driver you do not have an appointment he had to turn around i literally made no money for four or five hours normally that would have been a 500 job mr marz blames the work rules at the docks that bring everything to a full stop for lunch and shift changes just keep it flowing he says including starting earlier drivers would love to be able to pull up at 4 or 5 a m and avoid la traffic mario cordero executive director of the port of long beach america s second largest port just 4 miles from the port of los angeles has been preaching the 24 7 message since before the pandemic asia s on that schedule he says and given the long term trajectory of growth in container shipping the u s should be too long beach is trying out an extended schedule at one of its six terminals but mr cordero says moving to round the clock operations is going to take time for this to work the supply chain has to buy into this the truckers the warehouses the railroads it s not that simple even if the ports were open for longer that still would not solve another big problem no place for truckers to deliver empty shipping containers long beach cleared 64 acres of space for empties but that s now full and some drivers are literally leaving empty containers in the streets the empties are important for what s underneath them chassis truckers need a chassis to haul a new full container and right now there s a huge chassis shortage because so many of them are stuck under empty containers mr cordero says he s looking for new places to put empty containers and is in discussion with ship lines that refuse to carry empties back to asia in the past they have sent vessels to take back empties it all boils down to the chassis story says mr marz noting that half the containers in his company s yard are empty he s trying to work around the problem by making sure that each transaction at a terminal involves a drop off and a pickup and by scouring the internet for export opportunities to load up empty containers he thinks things will get worse before they get better so do your christmas shopping now francine kiefer the christian science monitor christina mullin owner of miracle mile toys gifts holds a dinosaur in her shop in los angeles on sept 24 2021 she normally has about 20 types of this popular item but because of the supply chain backup she only has about five or six she is looking for alternative makers the early holiday shopper at miracle mile toys gifts a few customers have shopped for the holidays and one purchased a dollhouse early to avoid being disappointed later ms mullin is storing it for her until closer to gifting time vendors have urged the experienced retailer to order early so she can secure a place in line and she has followed their advice as it is a good portion of every order is either not available or not due in until november december or even january it s all random she says and yet ms mullin is keeping a positive attitude after all it s a toy store grown ups and kids come there to have fun to touch and squeeze the cushiony avocado cupcake and double cherry no shortage of those connect the wooden animal puzzle at the play station or check out the costumes and capes in the loft hers is a neighborhood store with repeat customers fortunately she has a lot of stock from an earlier larger location and she is actively looking for alternatives turning to an american toy truck manufacturer for instance instead of a european brand there s still plenty for me to choose from given the many vendors in the industry she says it s an opportunity to sometimes try something new staff writer simon montlake contributed to this article from boston
