as europe continues to grapple with a daunting energy crisis european energy markets still face a liquidity disaster with financial institution exposure to fossil fuels and record levels of margin calls sounding the alarm bells according to norway s equinor asa nyse eqnr european energy trading is under severe strain by margin calls of at least 1 5 trillion putting extra pressure on governments to provide more liquidity buffers aside from fanning inflation the energy crisis is sucking up capital to guarantee trades amid wild price swings energy prices have been fluctuating over such a broad range that many firms are now struggling to manage margin calls making them demand additional collateral to guarantee trading positions while also forcing traders to secure multi billion euro credit lines liquidity support is going to be needed this is just capital that is dead and tied up in margin calls if the companies need to put up that much money that means liquidity in the market dries up and this is not good for this part of the gas markets helge haugane equinor s senior vice president for gas and power has told bloomberg haugane has noted that derivatives trading is where support will be needed and added that the 1 5 trillion estimate is actually a conservative one a report by the brussels based ngo finance watch reveals that the 60 largest banks in the world have fossil fuel exposures of 1 35 trillion with more than half of this total exposure on the books of asian banks however the report notes that the 22 european banks featured in the analysis account for 239 billion of credits doled out to finance fossil fuel activities with north american banks carrying a comparable amount related the u s is preparing its response to the short sighted strategy of opec finance watch has also calculated how much additional capital these banks would need to properly account for the risk of these fossil fuel exposures becoming stranded assets the report says that although eu and north american banks have about the same amount of fossil fuel exposures eu banks would need significantly more capital to cover the risk since they are backed by significantly less equity but will european banks be able to step up to the plate finance watch has argued that banks should back fossil fuel exposures with additional capital the ngo advocates for a risk weight of 150 meaning that every loan given to companies for existing fossil fuel activities would have to be backed by 12 of capital back in september the european banking authority eba issued a response to the european commission regarding current high levels of margin calls and excess volatility in the european energy markets the european commission had asked the european banking authority eba to consider among other questions any other possible measures to minimize the liquidity challenges currently faced by energy companies including ways to improve the transparency volatility and predictability of margin calls in particular intraday to which the ecb s response was the eba has not identified any potential changes to the prudential framework which can effectively help alleviate the current situation this reflects the fact that most of the binding constraints that the eba has identified stem from existing internal risk management limits and constraints decided upon by banks and or central clearing counterparties ccps as a result of their risk appetites and sustained flows of business with customers and counterparties banks are however facing significant liquidity draws including in usd in some cases with quite short notice when there are significant market movements efforts to provide more transparency around margin calls would therefore be welcome looks like more european countries might have to go the german way with governments directly stepping in with subsidies and other relief measures something that has not gone well with many of its neighbors fossil fuel exposure of top banks in europe and north america source euractiv united response about a week ago the german government announced that it would ditch earlier plans for a gas levy on consumers and instead will instead introduce a gas price cap to curb soaring energy bills with german chancellor olaf scholz setting out a 200 billion 194 billion defensive shield to protect companies and consumers against the impact of soaring energy prices the german government will do everything in its power to bring prices down we are now putting up a large defensive umbrella which we will endow with 200 billion scholz said at a press conference in berlin which he attended virtually due to a covid 19 quarantine so far germany has introduced the biggest scheme in europe to backstop companies affected by the energy crisis setting aside 7 billion euros in loans to be made available to companies facing liquidity issues german energy giant uniper se has sought an extra 4 billion euros after fully using a 9 billion euro existing facility while austria extended a 2 billion euro credit to cover the trading positions of vienna s municipal power utility meanwhile finland and sweden have announced a 33 billion emergency liquidity facility to utilities through loans and credit guarantees but not everybody is happy with germany s massive handouts to energy firms advertisement french finance minister bruno le maire as well as italian prime minister mario draghi have not pulled any punches warning that such a move increases the risk of fragmentation of the eurozone on wednesday commission president ursula von der leyen took up the criticism to avoid serious fragmentation we need a united and common european response we need to preserve a level playing field without distortions of the single market and act together in a spirit of strengthened solidarity she wrote in her letter to european leaders ahead of the european council in prague hinting that the generous subsidies would put the rest of europe at a disadvantage meanwhile french and italian commissioners thierry breton and paolo gentiloni have called for a pan european response in an op ed published in newspapers the german government has previously rejected a common fiscal response by the eu which might be understandable considering how heavily europe s largest economy relied on russian gas by alex kimani for oilprice com more top

rns i was talking with an old friend about travel a fellow very tall person he told me whenever i fly anywhere farther than two hours away i fly business class i am 6 foot 2 and i simply cannot fit into those regular seats i said to him i get it i feel the same way but how do you afford it he said to me it s really quite simple i use miles and my amex points hmmm i said i could do that i have a lot of miles and points to which he responded you might as well your loved ones won t be able to use them to upgrade your funeral it reminds me of something i saw in an old synagogue in a small village of poland a quote that is framed on the wall of the sanctuary it comes from sefer ha chaim the book of life which was published in krakow in the year 1593 its author was chaim ben bezalel which is probably why he named the book sefer ha chaim you have probably heard of his brother judah loew ben bezalel also known as the maharal whose greatest professional achievement was the creation of the mythical golem the creature that protected the jews of prague until he ran amok and had to be destroyed but chaim was no slouch he wrote this work during the two months in 1578 when he was confined to his house as a result of a plague people worry about losing their money and they never worry about losing their days your money won t help you and your days will never come back get it we can theoretically get our money back and let us offer a silent prayer for the stock market but we can never get our days back this is about the urgency of today do it now yes i originally delivered these words on yom kippur but they are equally relevant if not more relevant to the festival of sukkot the sukkah hut is fragile and temporary a hymn to today likewise the plants that make up the lulav bundle the willow and the myrtle lose their leaves with every passing day of the festival until by the end the willow is a frail twig i think this is the lesson beauty fades even the most beautiful flower can become a twig decades ago when my mother died at this season i remember sitting with my brother and with my father may his memory also be a blessing going through my mother s stuff we found her beautiful clothing with the tags still attached she expected to wear them to my wedding perhaps which she was too ill to actually attend or other occasions that was not going to happen her still tagged dresses testified to the fact she was living yes with hope in the presence of unseen tomorrows that would never come we utter the blessing the shehecyanu with utmost regularity at any sacred moment at any joyous occasion but the official name of that blessing is not the shehecyanu it is birchat ha zman the blessing for time ha zaman ha zeh not some idealized moment in the past and not some imagined moment in the future this moment today to live for today could mean a life of hedonism a life of unrestrained pleasure but no the prophet isaiah spoke out and castigated those who said let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die neither am i counseling those words that once appeared in the window of a bakery on columbus avenue in new york city life is uncertain eat dessert first i am saying don t waste time the great sage hillel said do not say when i have leisure i will study and learn perhaps you will never have leisure waste no time he was saying in the task of growing intellectually and spiritually this is not the proverbial can that you can kick down the road yet another ancient sage said repent one day before your death how can you know when you are going to die that is precisely it he said act as if every day were to be your last when i got covid in may in the middle of the night i woke up in a cold sweat that was not induced by the illness it was my anxiety had i updated my will did my kids know my account numbers could they access my pension i was being a little over dramatic but could you blame me act as if every day could be your last not by seeking fun but by seeking meaning by making each day a glimpse into eternity on yom kippur in the days of the ancient temple the high priest would enter the holy of holies and would utter the unpronounceable to everyone else four letter name of god yud hay vav heh that sacred word was an impossible combination of the past present and future tense of the hebrew root hayah which means to be god s name was is was will be or all of those things said simultaneously which is impossible to say that is the meaning of eternity those moments when the past the present and the future come together those moments that lift you out of time that is my job description or rather that is the benefit of my career as a rabbi i feel that sense of eternity when i am at a bris or a baby naming and i feel that this moment could have happened at any time in jewish history at that moment past present and future collapses i feel that sense of eternity when i stand next to a child who is becoming bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah and sense that moment rabbi with child could have happened at any moment in jewish history at any place in jewish history going back almost a thousand years at that moment past present and future collapses into one no science fiction film could ever imagine it there are other such moments as well those moments describe the sacred the holy the other worldly embedded in this world the ineffable like the name of god that which we cannot say and that which we cannot pronounce that which is in the soul and might come into the mind but rarely can leave the mouth your homework for the coming year multiply those moments realize that every day can contain a moment in which we can glimpse into eternity do not let this pass you by i end with the words of the psalmist the days of our lives may be many or few but the best of them are filled with sorrow and they pass by speedily and we are in darkness teach us therefore to number our days that we may attain a heart of wisdom to number our days limnot yameinu keyn hoda literally to number our days teach us to say yes teach us to say yes to every day that is the teaching that is the torah of life this is the urgency of today do it now excerpted from my yom kippur evening sermon at temple israel west palm beach florida

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox washington when it comes to reassuring americans about an economy that s an election year challenge for his party president joe biden is telling the country to hold on it s a message of patience as voters are buffeted by persistent inflation fears of a recession and the prospect of rising energy prices in the closing weeks of the campaign season when they will determine the fate of vulnerable democrats and control of congress the 25 trillion plus economy is veering in two radically different directions growth has fallen for two straight quarters raising the specter of recession but job gains have rolled on including 263 000 more in september as a sign of economic health nonetheless the latest jobs report sent stocks plummeting friday on renewed worries that the federal reserve will have to continue aggressive interest rate increases to temper rising consumer prices biden argued that the newest numbers are solid and have slowed in recent months in a way that points toward inflation easing major oil producing countries led by saudi arabia and russia dealt him a disappointment with their decision last week to cut production but the u s government forecasts that domestic output should increase by an average of roughly 840 000 barrels a day next year speaking at a volvo drivetrain factory in hagerstown maryland biden tried to make the case once more that lots more factory jobs were on the horizon this is the progress we need to see the president said in the short term the transition to a more stable growth that continues to deliver for workers and families while bringing inflation down in the long term the economy built on a firmer foundation we still have a lot of work to do we re building a different economy than before a better one a stronger one yet polls show biden consistently with poor marks for his handling of the economy and people in the united states broadly view the country as headed in the wrong direction a september poll from the associated press norc center for public affairs research found just 38 of those surveyed approve of biden s economic leadership twenty nine percent of u s adults said the economy is in good shape while 71 say it s doing poorly that was better than in june when 20 said conditions were good and 79 said they were bad while biden is not on the ballot nov 8 democratic candidates are facing relentless criticism from republicans who want to make the election a referendum on the president s performance with gop ads citing inflation and high gas prices there is growing pressure for the white house to address the public s concerns about the economy before election day jason furman who led the white house council of economic advisers under president barack obama said the jobs numbers were a political win for biden but also a warning of the economic hardship to come as the fed faces pressure to raise rates to tackle inflation the price level is still high and headline inflation is likely to have picked up every month from july through october due to the dynamics of gas prices furman said curtailing that he said unfortunately will take a lot of time and potentially a lot of pain for them to succeed nowhere is biden s messaging challenge more pronounced than on gas prices for 99 straight days the white house highlighted declining prices after their peak in june but they started ticking up last month and they have shot up more since opec and its partners announced severe production cuts wednesday the u s national average is now 3 91 a gallon according to aaa that s below the june high of 5 02 but higher than a month ago 3 74 and a year ago 3 27 at the end of march biden ordered the release 1 million barrels of oil a day for six months from the u s strategic reserve to help lower prices the white house now says the administration is weighing further releases to offset the opec cuts it has also tried to shame oil companies into increasing production and cutting their profit margins meanwhile the fed expects that bringing inflation closer to the central bank s target of no more than 2 a year it was 8 3 higher in september than a year earlier will require a contraction in the labor market that could put at least a million people out of work fed officials indicated last month that the unemployment rate would climb next year to 4 4 up nearly a full percentage point if inflation were to fall below 3 the hiring biden that cheered on friday might soon give way to losses opec s production cut could mean that it will be even harder to lower inflation with more expensive gas requiring the fed to take more drastic measures to bring down prices costing even more jobs investment bank goldman sachs on thursday suggested that oil prices will reach 110 a barrel toward the end of this year compared with its prior forecast of 100 a barrel that would translate into higher prices at the pump and has given republicans more evidence to say he s put the economy at risk the president is in denial that america is experiencing a dangerous wage price spiral that will drive high inflation for years that we are in stagflation and that we are either in or on the verge of a harsh recession all that he created by bungling the recovery said texas rep kevin brady the top republican on the tax writing house ways and means committee

medicines for the treatment of cancer metabolic autoimmune ophthalmology and other major diseases is pleased to see that the national medical products administration nmpa of china has approved the supplemental new drug application snda for cyramza ramucirumab in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma hcc also known as liver cancer who have an alpha fetoprotein of 400 ng ml and have been treated with sorafenib in march 2022 cyramza ramucirumab was approved by the nmpa in combination with paclitaxel for second line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro esophageal junction gej adenocarcinoma making it the first and only targeted drug approved for the second line treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro esophageal junction gej adenocarcinoma in china cyramza ramucirumab has been discovered and developed by lilly in march 2022 innovent and lilly expanded their strategic partnership in oncology which includes an agreement for innovent to obtain the sole commercialization rights of cyramza ramucirumab once approved in china which positions innovent to be fully responsible for the pricing importation marketing distribution and detailing of this product with this further expanded oncology product portfolio innovent intends to use its experienced oncology commercial team to leverage its broad commercial coverage in hospitals and pharmacies at various tiers and to provide integrated patient solutions with strong synergies to cancer patients in china this new approval was based on the results of the reach 2 study a global randomized double blind placebo controlled phase 3 clinical trial the reach 2 study is the first phase 3 clinical trial in hcc to obtain positive results in a biomarker enriched population known for poor prognosis on the primary endpoint of overall survival os treatment with cyramza significantly improved the os of patients compared to placebo hr 0 71 95 ci 0 53 0 95 p 0 020 the median os was 8 5 months with cyramza compared to 7 3 months with placebo on the secondary endpoint of progression free survival pfs median pfs was significantly improved with cyramza 2 8 months vs 1 6 months for placebo hr 0 45 95 ci 0 34 0 60 p 0 0001 objective response rate orr was numerically higher with cyramza compared to placebo 4 6 vs 1 1 disease control rate dcr was higher with cyramza than with placebo 59 9 vs 38 9 cyramza was well tolerated in chinese patients and the overall patient population the safety and efficacy profile of cyramza in the chinese population was consistent with that observed in previously reported global studies professor shukui qin the principal investigator of reach 2 in china and the director of the cancer center of nanjing jinling hospital stated primary liver cancer plc is the fourth most common cancer in terms of prevalence and the second leading cause of cancer related mortality in china with only a 12 1 five year survival rate hcc is the main type of plc and most hcc patients with afp 400ng ml experience greater disease progression on or after first line treatment new treatment options are urgently needed to improve outcomes in these patients globally cyramza is the first approved novel medicine specifically evaluated in the biomarker enriched population of hcc patients with afp 400ng ml the study results in chinese patients demonstrated a consistent efficacy and safety profile with the global population i believe the approval will ignite a positive impact on the clinical practice of liver cancer in china bringing a new and efficacious treatment option for chinese patients with advanced hcc dr yongjun liu president of innovent stated hepatocellular carcinoma ranks fifth among the number of new cases in china with approximately 410 000 new cases yearly and the number of deaths each year are nearly the same most patients will experience disease progression after current first line therapy and are left with limited treatment options we are excited about the approval of cyramza the first innovative drug proven to have clinical benefits for a biomarker enriched population of patients with hcc this differentiated product will potentially be an exciting treatment option and bring new hope to patients in china with advanced hcc the successive approvals of cyramza in second line gc gej and hcc this year enable us to provide integrated patient solutions with strong portfolio synergies while enhancing our leading franchise in these two large cancer indications innovent is fully committed to making these new treatment options available to benefit more cancer patients in china as soon as possible about hepatocellular carcinoma primary liver cancer plc is a common malignancy of the digestive system worldwide among which about half of all new cases and deaths occur in china the main pathological types of liver cancer are hepatocellular carcinoma hcc which accounts for 85 to 90 percent and a small number of cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma icc and hcc icc mixed liver cancer in china hcc is primarily caused by hepatitis b virus hbv and or hepatitis c virus hcv infection about cyramza ramucirumab cyramza is an antiangiogenic therapy it is a vascular endothelial growth factor vegf receptor 2 antagonist that binds specifically to vegfr 2 thereby blocking the binding of the receptor ligands vegf a vegf c and vegf d which may slow tumor growth in recent years studies have shown that the vegf pathway is an important signaling pathway involved in tumor angiogenesis and it is also the main target pathway in targeted therapy of liver cancer from the existing research results the single drug use of compounds targeting the vegf pathway can bring survival benefits to patients and is a very promising treatment method in the treatment of liver cancer in march 2022 cyramza ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel was approved by the national medical products administration nmpa for second line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro esophageal junction gej adenocarcinoma in october 2022 cyramza ramucirumab was approved by the nmpa for patients

patients with ret fusion positive nsclc in the global libretto 001 phase i ii clinical study with a median pfs of about two years the libretto 321 study further showed that selpercatinib significantly improved the efficacy of chinese patients with advanced ret fusion positive nsclc including patients with brain metastases and the response was clinically meaningful and durable we are thrilled that the approval will bring new treatment options to chinese patients with ret fusion positive nsclc professor cheng ying from jilin cancer hospital stated the current global incidence of ret fusions in nsclc patients is 1 to 2 and the incidence of ret fusion nsclc in china is 1 4 in the past there have been limited therapies available for ret fusion positive nsclc to achieve satisfactory efficacy in recent years the introduction of ret inhibitors has opened a new era of therapy for such patients as observed in the libretto 321 study the orr of selpercatinib in naïve and pre treated patients in the chinese population is very exciting in addition selpercatinib has also shown antitumor activity against brain lesions in preclinical models we believe that the approval of selpercatinib in china will bring more survival benefits to chinese patients with ret fusion positive nsclc professor ming gao from tianjin people hospital stated ret alterations are oncogenic drivers in thyroid cancer mostly seen in mtc selpercatinib is a highly selective and potent ret kinase inhibitor in the libretto 001 study the largest clinical trial ever reported in patients with ret driven cancers selpercatinib demonstrated clinically meaningful and durable responses in ret altered thyroid cancer the libretto 321 study has further demonstrated that the safety and efficacy profile of selpercatinib in the chinese population was consistent with that observed in a previously reported global study its approval is undoubtedly a breakthrough milestone and we hope more tc patients in china will benefit from it in the future dr yongjun liu president of innovent stated globally selpercatinib is the first ret inhibitor approved and we are pleased to see its strong and durable response in line with good tolerability in clinical studies this approval marks another milestone in mainland china for targeted therapies and will bring a new treatment option with high quality to ret fusion positive cancer patients in china for innovent the addition of a high value commercialized product in our tki bu will further enhance the synergistic value in the pipeline portfolio as well as our franchise in certain cancer types we are committed to the partnership with lilly to accelerate the launch of innovative medicines to benefit more cancer patients in china as soon as possible about ret driven cancers genomic alterations in the ret kinase which include fusions and activating point mutations lead to overactive ret signaling and uncontrolled cell growth ret fusions have been identified in approximately 1 2 of nsclc and 10 20 of papillary thyroid cancers activating ret point mutations account for approximately 60 of sporadic mtc and approximately 90 of familial mtc ret fusion positive cancers and ret mutant mtc are primarily dependent on this single activated kinase for their proliferation and survival this dependency often referred to as oncogene addiction renders such tumors highly susceptible to small molecule inhibitors targeting ret activating ret alterations are predominantly mutually exclusive from other oncogenic drivers about non small cell lung cancer nsclc lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and the most commonly diagnosed tumor type in china with an overall five year survival rate of less than 15 non small cell lung cancer nsclc accounts for about 80 to 85 of all lung cancer ret fusions have been identified in about 1 4 of chinese patients with nsclc and the incident cases are above 10 000 every year 8 up to 50 of patients with ret fusion positive nsclc can have tumors that metastasize to the brain about thyroid cancer tc thyroid cancer is a cancer that starts in a person s thyroid gland the most common types of thyroid cancer are papillary and follicular other types include hurthle cell medullary and anaplastic studies show that the positive rate of ret fusion in the chinese tc patient population is about 6 03 with about 3 484 new cases each year in china the positive rate of ret mutations in the chinese sporadic mtc and familial mtc are approximately 42 and 88 8 respectively with about 1 795 new cases each year

positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are radioactive iodine refractory if radioactive iodine is appropriate in sep 2022 the fda granted an accelerated approval for a tumor agnostic indication for selpercatinib in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a ret gene fusion that have progressed on or following prior systemic treatment or who

by ken bridges special to the globe news john ireland lost more political races than he won but he had an important role in state history he rose from an impoverished background to become a civil war officer judge and governor along the way he helped create two icons of texas the university of texas and the state capitol john ireland was born on new years day 1827 in rural central kentucky his parents were irish immigrants and farmers he grew up working hard but had little formal education as very little education was available he was seen as reliable and was appointed deputy sheriff of hart county in 1845 at age 18 ireland developed a fascination with the law and began studying it at age 24 by apprenticing himself to a local attorney he was admitted to the bar later in 1851 the next year he moved to texas for a fresh start and an opportunity to establish his own law practice he settled in the town of seguin where he soon became an important figure in the community ireland served as mayor of seguin briefly in 1858 ireland had fought for secession and participated in the 1861 secession convention after texas pulled out of the union ireland immediately enlisted as a private in the confederate army he saw little action during the civil war as his assignments kept him within the state patrolling the coast and the borders nevertheless he dramatically rose through the ranks ending the war as a lieutenant colonel the chaos of reconstruction politics swept up ireland in 1866 he was part of the state constitutional convention shortly afterward he was elected judge however texas and many other southern states were placed under martial law in 1867 for failing to uphold the rights for freedmen and impeding reconstruction ireland and many other politicians were thrust from office as reconstruction was winding down ireland re entered politics and was elected to the state legislature in 1872 while serving in the legislature ireland was the sponsor for the legislation that allowed the university of texas to finally become a reality the creation of the university was an effort shared by many over a long period of time he lost a race for u s senate in 1874 but in 1875 he was appointed to briefly serve as an appellate judge in 1878 ireland challenged congressman gustav schleicher for the sixth district congressional seat which then included the san antonio area schleicher a german immigrant and businessman faced a formidable challenger in ireland he was able to win his second term but he died just months after his victory in january 1879 ireland chose not to run in the special election to fill the remainder of the term a race ultimately won by attorney christopher upson in 1882 he won election easily to become the state s eighteenth governor as governor he pushed for property taxes and faced the fence cutting wars with the 1874 invention of barbed wire large ranchers started fencing in their properties blocking in small farms and ranches in response fences began getting cut and violence erupted on the frontier ireland sent in the texas rangers to maintain order and pushed legislation in 1884 to give the rangers special powers in these cases the other major issue of his administration was construction of the new state capitol fire destroyed the old capitol in 1881 money had been appropriated for a new building and construction started after ireland s 1884 re election the distinctive pink granite look of the state capitol is due in part to ireland he insisted on texas limestone instead of importing limestone from indiana after using this stone to lay the foundation iron particles in the stone rusted and discolored the stone learning of the problem owners of granite mountain near marble falls in burnet county approached ireland with a solution they owners donated the pink granite to complete the building an offer ireland happily accepted the new state capitol was formally dedicated in april 1888 he chose not to run for a third term in 1886 and instead ran for the u s senate he challenged incumbent sen samuel b maxey at that time the state legislature still elected senators rather than the voters legislators rejected both gov ireland and sen maxey in favor of veteran congressman john h reagan ireland never ran for election again after ireland finished his terms as governor in january 1887 he quietly resumed his law practice in seguin where he remained a respected figure he had made a tidy profit in the stock market over the years but this was all wiped out in the panic of 1893 a deep economic depression that crushed stocks and left millions unemployed nationally john ireland died deeply in debt in 1896 at the age of 69 ken bridges is a writer historian and native texan he holds a doctorate from the university of north texas bridges can be reached by email at drkenbridges gmail com
october 9 2022 latest articles this newsletter issue focuses on recent problems with developed country sovereign bond markets and how energy supply constraints pose an ongoing problem for them the sovereign bond bubble during much of 2019 and 2020 large portions of the developed country bond market were outright negative in nominal terms rather than getting paid interest investors had to pay for the privilege of lending to governments and even some corporations mainly across europe at its peak the amount of negative yielding bonds reached over 18 trillion chart source bloomberg in july 2019 i wrote an article focusing on the high probability that we were in a bond bubble i opened the article by highlighting that even though i had some concerns about stocks i was even more concerned about bonds i read thousands of emails from my readers and one of the key themes i see is that people are concerned about the next stock market crash and perhaps rightly so by many measures we have high stock valuations in the united states after a decade long bull market and we have high corporate debt levels both inside the united states and globally but one question i rarely receive is are bonds safe from a historical perspective the bond market is acting a lot weirder than the stock market at the current time the stock market looks like it often does at this point in the business cycle which is not great for the probable range of forward returns but bonds are doing things they haven t done ever before in history which should give investors pause since bonds are traditionally considered the safer asset class should this be cause for concern are we in a bond bubble or is this just how things are now this article examines the issue lyn alden july 2019 are we in a bond bubble or is this the new normal throughout the article i went on to describe how a number of magazine covers and financial commentators were emphasizing the idea that inflation is dead which i interpreted as a contrarian signal back then and this seems ironic now many central bankers were publicly lamenting that inflation was persistently below their targets i pointed out that in addition to the possibility of de globalization and other inflationary trend shifts the combination of aggressive fiscal policies by governments and debt monetization by central banks to support those fiscal policies would be quite inflationary historically highly indebted countries with liabilities denominated in their own currency don t default they print and inflate their way out of it as i wrote back then if central bank actions get more aggressive combine with fiscal policies and start targeting the middle class they have the power to override these various deflationary forces with sheer monetary expansion they can issue helicopter money to pay off debts boost inflation build infrastructure bail out unfunded pension systems and prop up the middle class if that s what policymakers decide to do i wouldn t want to be holding a 20 year or 30 year bond at super low fixed yields in that kind of environment negative yields would be even more vulnerable lyn alden july 2019 are we in a bond bubble or is this the new normal in early 2020 when the pandemic hit such a highly leveraged operationally and financially global economy it indeed triggered a series of global stimulus efforts by fiscal and monetary policymakers to prevent mass debt liquidations among businesses and households a lower debt economy could have withstood an economic shock like this without the need for as much stimulus whereas a high debt economy like what we have is inherently fragile and doesn t deal well with cashflow interruptions as a result of the stimulus developed countries had their biggest increases in broad money supply since the 1940s throughout 2020 and 2021 i began comparing the 2020s decade to the 1940s decade and wrote at length about how this big blend of fiscal and monetary policy would likely be inflationary for broad prices this chart is becoming due for an update by this point but i still think it s the most important chart for summarizing the macroeconomic context from a high level it is probably the chart i have shown the most in a few different forms over the past few years looking back on the past few years from the vantage point of late 2022 it certainly has been a wild ride year over year inflation reached above 2 5 in march 2021 and from there it took off quickly up to over 9 i was expecting significant inflation but this was fast and strong even relative to what i would have guessed back then chart source st louis fed it has been a broad and rolling set of price inflation ever since at first this inflation was mainly attributed to transitory supply chain problems but even things like rents and house prices were soaring with so much money pumped into the economy and into consumers bank accounts us gasoline prices reached record levels and year over year wage inflation reached multi decade highs but europe has had it worse than the united states with russia eliminating their gas flows to europe it resulted in skyrocketing natural gas prices and by extension electricity prices due to this the netherlands currently has 14 official inflation which is higher than any point they reached in the 1970s poland has 17 year over year inflation germany s inflation is 10 and climbing and italy s is 9 and climbing with inflation coming in hot nearly all of those 18 trillion in negative yielding bonds are positive yielding now and when yields rise it means bond prices fall cash savers have lost purchasing power over the past couple years and long duration bondholders have been crushed even further in both nominal and inflation adjusted terms european consumers have been impaired by these extremely high energy prices and in many cases governments have stepped in to help alleviate their energy cost burden but this comes with more debt and thus more sovereign bond issuance this chart shows historical drawdowns from all time highs for the bloomberg global aggregate bond index chart source ycharts united kingdom bond blow up the shortage of natural gas in europe means that europeans buy more liquified natural gas which is a more portable global market but is constrained by expensive export and import infrastructure in other words there is a hard limit on how much lng export import capacity exists in the world and it takes time and money to build more europe s increased purchases of lng have therefore pushed up lng prices for the rest of the world which puts pressure on japan and hurts energy importing developing countries the most back in my june 2022 newsletter i wrote about an upcoming checkmate scenario for central banks where they are forced to print money into a high inflation environment due to a combination of untenably high debt and commodity driven inflation japan has over 250 public debt to gdp italy has over 150 the uk and usa are both over 100 the thesis here is that the macroeconomic environment is like the 1940s for them high debt and high inflation not like the 1970s low debt and high inflation and their sovereign bond markets therefore require support from central banks to avoid a fiscal spiral and nominal default this support typically takes the form of yield curve control yield curve management and various other types of financial repression as i described the situation in june the bank of japan and the european central bank were already in that checkmate situation with those banks buying japanese and italian debt respectively despite above target inflation in order to prevent yields from rising while the us federal reserve bank of england and some other developed market central banks were still holding hawkish for the moment but at risk of being unable to continue that path well in september the bank of england fell into that checkmated category too their sovereign bond market started to become extremely disorderly with yields rapidly spiking and thus prices rapidly falling on long duration government debt the uk pension system is a big holder of that debt and with leverage so some of them were getting margin called when such large balance sheets all have the same type of asset and that asset is selling off then if a pension fund gets liquidated and is forced to sell some of their assets it worsens the price for everyone else and triggers more margin call liquidations which then worsens the price further and triggers more liquidations in other words bond selling would trigger more bond selling which would trigger more bond selling and there isn t enough balance sheet capacity for other buyers to step in and fix that cascade since the biggest balance sheets in the country are the ones that are doing the selling the market basically goes no bid to prevent that outcome the bank of england stepped in with emergency quantitative easing on september 28th to buy those bonds and suppress the yields and thus to keep the prices high and to keep the whole uk pension system from getting margin called and throwing up their bonds all at the same time prior to this the bank of england was intending to reduce their balance sheet and had a speech planned for september 29th to discuss balance sheet reduction which they quickly cancelled so the united kingdom is currently in the same boat as japan and various southern european countries in having their central bank continue to buy their government debt amid high inflation in order to suppress yields below the prevailing inflation rate maintain fiscal solvency and maintain pension system solvency they ll probably be able to stop their intervention at some point but the underlying issue is clear despite 10 inflation the uk couldn t let its government bonds go above 5 yields due to so much leverage in the system the result is financial repression and the market comes to understand that there will always be a bid by central banks at points of acute disorder to keep the sovereign bond market liquid and at low yields relative to inflation united states bond illiquidity among central banks the us federal reserve is the 800 pound gorilla but even they are starting to run into some issues with their hawkish monetary tightening plan since the us is less reliant on external energy than much of europe and japan are and because the dollar is the global reserve currency the fed has been able to be more hawkish than many other developed country central banks but they still face similar problems in the country s sovereign bond market us federal debt to gdp is about 125 and pretty much for any country it becomes nearly impossible to maintain positive inflation adjusted yields when debt is over 100 of gdp chart source st louis fed the fed is now doing quantitative tightening meaning they are net sellers of treasuries as they let bonds mature off of their balance sheet and choose not to reinvest the proceeds commercial banks due to slr regulations and other constraints are also not buying treasuries the foreign sector in aggregate has been reducing their us treasury holdings as well foreign central banks accumulate treasuries and other reserve assets when times are good in other words when their economies are growing and when the dollar is weakening vs other currencies they have flexibility to print currency and buy foreign assets this is like a squirrel collecting nuts during times of abundance and then during periods of recession or when the dollar is sharply strengthening and their own currencies are weakening these foreign central banks can sell some of their reserves and buy back their own currency strengthening it this is like a squirrel eating the nuts during the winter that it has previously collected central banks buy or sell reserves assets in a counter cyclical way to manage the volatility of their currency relative to the dollar this chart shows the dollar index vs the portion of foreign held treasuries in custody with the fed chart source st louis fed looking at the broader picture of over 7 5 trillion in treasuries held by foreign sources of which this fed custody snapshot represents about half the amount has also been flat to down over the past year despite an increase in the amount of treasuries outstanding foreign official sources e g central banks have been net sellers while foreign private sources have been mild net buyers with the overall amount being slightly down as a result us treasury market liquidity is very poor and volatility is very high this is the move index which measures treasury market volatility chart source google finance back in march 2020 when the world shut down over covid 19 it resulted in a big global dollar shortage international dollar cash flows for many businesses dried up as trade plummeted and yet the world had and still has a lot of dollar denominated debt mostly owed to entities in china europe and japan and this debt needs to be serviced even if cash flows aren t flowing so many foreign entities sharply sold treasuries to get dollars which rendered the treasury market acutely illiquid basically no bid on some off the run securities and forced an emergency meeting of the fed to buy treasuries they ended up buying 1 trillion of treasuries in three weeks which was a record pace here in autumn 2022 it has been a more gradual problem with the dollar strengthening all year and foreign central banks trimming their treasury security exposure all year which puts a lot of pressure on the us treasury market its starting to reach very problematic levels last month the bank of japan performed their first currency intervention in over two decades as they sold 20 billion worth of reserves to put a bid under the yen my concern and one that i ve had since the springtime of this year is that the us treasury market is at risk of becoming acutely illiquid and disorderly like it did in march 2020 and like the uk government bond market just did in september 2022 assuming the fed continues with their current approach it s not about the price of the bonds in that sense it s about who has the balance sheet capacity to hold them at any price and about liquid market functioning and if that acute liquidity problem occurs the fed would need to buy treasury bonds despite high inflation much like the bank of england just had to do they could alternatively adjust slr rules to have commercial banks absorb more treasury bonds instead but either way it would be a liquidity response to an emergency sovereign bond situation while inflation is still elevated there is also a possibility that the fed will recognize it advance and slow down rate hikes and other dollar strengthening activities ahead of time like the reserve bank of australia has recently done however this does not seem to be the path that the fed wishes to take because they wish to be viewed as credible fighters of inflation either way once acute treasury liquidity problems manifest themselves or the fed front runs and avoids them by shifting policy there s a significant probability of it resulting in a top in the dollar index meaning it would likely mark the end of this major dollar rally and would be a catalyst for the next leg higher in many commodity prices which fuels the existing inflation problem even more until that pivot there continues to be a good case for defensive portfolio positioning after that pivot we still need to be careful about which assets to own how energy challenges the bond market when energy is abundant it makes a lot of things easier when energy is scarce it leads to stagflation and a much less comfortable situation economically socially and politically going into the 2008 2009 crisis for example there had been many years of strong oil prices and strong supply response to bring more oil and gas to market when the severe recession hit it reduced demand which along with a supply glut resulted in low energy prices for the 2010s decade as a whole and especially the second half opec fought with us shale producers over market share new technology and zero interest rates incentivized a lot of us and canadian shale oil and gas producers to bring new energy to market it was often unprofitable since capital costs were nearly free but the narrative and the financing were all about growth and opec was annoyed about this new unprofitable competitor pushing down global oil prices for everyone until they struck back and flooded the market with supply to try to bankrupt some of this new unprofitable production threat for consumers this fight over market share was a good thing there was too much oil and too much gas relative to demand and so prices were low but that period is behind us now and there is not much marginal capacity available globally after years of low capital expenditures in the industry we are now in an energy constrained world and an increasingly fragmented one the us government is rapidly drawing down its strategic petroleum reserve in order to put downward pressure on oil prices this likely helps incumbent midterm election chances because the biden administration has scored a near term political win for getting energy prices under control but it leaves the oil market in a more precarious position for 2023 when the us is no longer able to keep dumping this reserve supply onto the market meanwhile opec has cut production which puts somewhat of a floor under prices the issue under the surface however is that opec has already been failing to even meet their existing production quotas and they likely have to reduce production due to physical realities rather than just geopolitical price fixing choices russia s oil fields were worked in part by major western oil corporations and the capital and equipment they bring with them this is no longer the case and so russia is facing a capital and equipment hurdle in the coming years when it comes to maintaining and growing their recent production rate similarly saudi arabia and other opec countries were already running near the high end of their realistic capacity limits and it s hard to keep running at that pace there is no easy marginal supply ready to come to market the us shale sector can continue to bring on more shale oil supply gradually but due to fast decline rates it takes quite a bit of capital just to maintain existing production rates let alone quickly grow net new supply large offshore projects take years to become active wells many european and north american politicians are bringing up policies such as export bans and windfall taxes that are not conducive to enticing new supply to come online since it reduces clarity about the profitability of any long term oil and gas production project big offshore oil wells or big pipeline export terminals for example require billions of dollars and have a payback period that stretches many years into the future if there is a reduction in certainty about what percentage of cash flows from a company s energy sales that they ll be able to keep then it increases the hurdle for greenlighting the project and therefore can make it harder for new supply to come to market meanwhile munich re the world s largest reinsurer just announced that it is ending insurance coverage for new oil and gas fields a number of companies have adopted policies like this over the years where they don t invest or work with hydrocarbon companies this forces hydrocarbon companies to be more self contained meaning they grow slower but become more profitable and fund development out of profits rather than financing for as long as energy prices remain elevated due to these supply limitations it means there will be upward pressure on inflation demand destruction from central bank tightening can keep a lid on prices for a period of time but containing inflation that way is like holding a beach ball under water it s ready to pop right back up as soon as they stop holding it down right now we are in a period of us domestic economic deceleration which might turn into an outright recession parts of europe are already in recession the oil price often follows this cycle rising as the pmi rises and dropping when the pmi drops however oil is currently over 90 despite the fact that we re firmly in a down pmi cycle europe is facing recessionary conditions the us is dumping its strategic petroleum reserve onto the market the us dollar is very strong relative to other currencies and ongoing chinese lockdowns reduce their marginal demand for oil all of those are bearish factors for oil and yet oil s price remains elevated whenever we get the next economic acceleration cycle oil prices may very well be starting that demand increase from an already high price point and ready to start climbing significantly from there a year from now probably with a rising pmi by that point a functionally depleted strategic petroleum reserve and a potential change in china s lockdown policies it s not hard to envision a rather bullish environment for oil the next several months remain quite uncertain however this tight energy situation in my view is likely to keep pressure on the sovereign bond market for years by making inflation always ready to return should the economy begin to re accelerate until new energy supply comes online and the problem is fixed more structurally energy led inflation is a problem that can be temporarily suppressed but that can t really be avoided much like how the 1940s and 1970s had recurring waves of inflation rather than just one big inflationary spike my base case is that the 2020s decade will likewise have waves of inflation led by energy portfolio updates i have several investment accounts and i provide updates on my asset allocation and investment selections for some of the portfolios in each newsletter issue every six weeks these portfolios include the model portfolio account specifically for this newsletter and my relatively passive indexed retirement account members of my premium research service also have access to three additional model portfolios and my other holdings with more frequent updates i use a free account at personal capital to easily keep track of all my accounts and monitor my net worth m1 finance newsletter portfolio i started this account in september 2018 with 10k of new capital and i put new money in regularly currently i put in 1 000 per month it s one of my smallest accounts but the goal is for the portfolio to be accessible and to show newsletter readers my best representation of where i think value is in the market it s a low turnover multi asset globally diversified portfolio that focuses on liquid investments and is scalable to virtually any size i chose m1 finance because their platform is commission free and allows for a combo of etf and individual stock selection with automatic and or manual rebalancing it makes for a great model portfolio with high flexibility and it s the investment platform i recommend to most people see my disclosure policy here regarding my affiliation with m1 and here s the breakdown of the holdings in those slices changes since the previous issue no recent changes other model portfolios and accounts i have three other real money model portfolios that i share within my premium research service including fortress income portfolio etf only portfolio no limits portfolio plus i have larger personal accounts at fidelity and schwab and i share those within the service as well final thoughts rising debt rising rates one of the most impactful aspects of higher interest rates is that it puts a brake on the housing market mortgage activity has fallen to multi decade lows a 30 year mortgage for 300 000 at 7 rates has a cost of 1 996 month vs only 1 347 month for the same mortgage at 3 5 this makes many houses too expensive for new buyers and or eats heavily into their other monthly spending this also makes existing homeowners less likely to sell and move because they would be exiting from a cheap mortgage and into an expensive mortgage the housing market therefore slows down and this weighs on the economy the same is true for corporate bonds and other commercial borrowing debt that matures will be refinanced at higher interest rates over time which eats into profits higher rates have also put considerable valuation pressure on corporate equities so both their earnings and their share price multiple on those earnings are pressured this is why monetary policy operates with a lag at first higher rates and lower prices only affect the marginal market participant such as for example someone that was planning to buy a house or move houses now or that has a corporate bond ready for refinancing now but as these policies remain in place and people over time need to buy or move houses or refinance corporate debt it begins affecting more and more entities the fed s existing monetary tightening will continue to affect new market participants going forward as those participants buy or change houses or refinance any type of debt when we look out longer term another issue is that higher interest rates make the federal debt increasingly more expensive to service for decades people have been warning about the federal debt eventually causing a crisis and their dire predictions never seem to come true in the timeline that they thought there were people worrying about rising debt in the 1980s and 1990s for example which seems quaint in hindsight this is because during the past four decades the structural rise in federal debt to gdp was offset by a structural decline in interest rates as a result interest expense as a share of gdp was flat rather than up those declining rates made it considerably easier to keep servicing higher and higher debt levels chart source st louis fed however as interest rates hit zero and then started trending sideways or up it began shifting to a toxic combination of both higher debt and higher interest on that debt even if rates just go sideways now that represents a major trend shift from the prior decades of structurally declining rates source charliebilello the us government is unlikely to make major cuts to social security or medicare given how popular those programs are among voters they re also unlikely to cut military spending while they re in a geopolitical power competition with russia and china lastly they re also unlikely to pass major tax hikes assuming that the government remains relatively split between parties this means that the deficit will remain large and the government will have to issue more treasuries in order to finance the larger deficits that come with higher interest expense this is a concern because as this newsletter issue already discussed the treasury market has been increasingly illiquid lately with major pools of capital unable to keep buying for that reason i view treasury market functionality as one of the main constraints for how tight the fed can make monetary policy and i view inflation and deficit monetization to likely be a persistent or recurring issue this decade albeit with occasional periods of disinflation as central banks briefly fight back as is the case for 2022 once the fed is put into a position where it is forced to re liquify the treasury market this will open a serious possibility of a top in the dollar index and would be a powerful catalyst for the next cycle higher in commodity prices however i expect those higher commodity prices and labor prices to put pressure on the major stock indices by eating into profit margins us stock market capitalization reached approximately 200 of gdp back in 2021 and i don t expect that level to be reached again for a very long time chart source st louis fed instead i expect most of the investment opportunities for the remainder of this decade to consist of some combination of energy commodities precious metals infrastructure chemicals biotech bitcoin and select foreign markets

supplemental new drug application snda for cyramza ramucirumab in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma hcc also known as liver cancer who have an alpha fetoprotein of 400 ng ml and have been treated with sorafenib in march 2022 cyramza ramucirumab was approved by the nmpa in combination with paclitaxel for second line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro esophageal junction gej adenocarcinoma making it the first and only targeted drug approved for the second line treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro esophageal junction gej adenocarcinoma in china cyramza ramucirumab has been discovered and developed by lilly in march 2022 innovent and lilly expanded their strategic partnership in oncology which includes an agreement for innovent to obtain the sole commercialization rights of cyramza ramucirumab once approved in china which positions innovent to be fully responsible for the pricing importation marketing distribution and detailing of this product with this further expanded oncology product portfolio innovent intends to use its experienced oncology commercial team to leverage its broad commercial coverage in hospitals and pharmacies at various tiers and to provide integrated patient solutions with strong synergies to cancer patients in china this new approval was based on the results of the reach 2 study a global randomized double blind placebo controlled phase 3 clinical trial the reach 2 study is the first phase 3 clinical trial in hcc to obtain positive results in a biomarker enriched population known for poor prognosis on the primary endpoint of overall survival os treatment with cyramza significantly improved the os of patients compared to placebo hr 0 71 95 ci 0 53 0 95 p 0 020 the median os was 8 5 months with cyramza compared to 7 3 months with placebo on the secondary endpoint of progression free survival pfs median pfs was significantly improved with cyramza 2 8 months vs 1 6 months for placebo hr 0 45 95 ci 0 34 0 60 p 0 0001 objective response rate orr was numerically higher with cyramza compared to placebo 4 6 vs 1 1 disease control rate dcr was higher with cyramza than with placebo 59 9 vs 38 9 cyramza was well tolerated in chinese patients and the overall patient population the safety and efficacy profile of cyramza in the chinese population was consistent with that observed in previously reported global studies professor shukui qin the principal investigator of reach 2 in china and the director of the cancer center of nanjing jinling hospital stated primary liver cancer plc is the fourth most common cancer in terms of prevalence and the second leading cause of cancer related mortality in china with only a 12 1 five year survival rate hcc is the main type of plc and most hcc patients with afp 400ng ml experience greater disease progression on or after first line treatment new treatment options are urgently needed to improve outcomes in these patients globally cyramza is the first approved novel medicine specifically evaluated in the biomarker enriched population of hcc patients with afp 400ng ml the study results in chinese patients demonstrated a consistent efficacy and safety profile with the global population i believe the approval will ignite a positive impact on the clinical practice of liver cancer in china bringing a new and efficacious treatment option for chinese patients with advanced hcc dr yongjun liu president of innovent stated hepatocellular carcinoma ranks fifth among the number of new cases in china with approximately 410 000 new cases yearly and the number of deaths each year are nearly the same most patients will experience disease progression after current first line therapy and are left with limited treatment options we are excited about the approval of cyramza the first innovative drug proven to have clinical benefits for a biomarker enriched population of patients with hcc this differentiated product will potentially be an exciting treatment option and bring new hope to patients in china with advanced hcc the successive approvals of cyramza in second line gc gej and hcc this year enable us to provide integrated patient solutions with strong portfolio synergies while enhancing our leading franchise in these two large cancer indications innovent is fully committed to making these new treatment options available to benefit more cancer patients in china as soon as possible about hepatocellular carcinoma primary liver cancer plc is a common malignancy of the digestive system worldwide among which about half of all new cases and deaths occur in china the main pathological types of liver cancer are hepatocellular carcinoma hcc which accounts for 85 to 90 percent and a small number of cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma icc and hcc icc mixed liver cancer in china hcc is primarily caused by hepatitis b virus hbv and or hepatitis c virus hcv infection about cyramza ramucirumab cyramza is an antiangiogenic therapy it is a vascular endothelial growth factor vegf receptor 2 antagonist that binds specifically to vegfr 2 thereby blocking the binding of the receptor ligands vegf a vegf c and vegf d which may slow tumor growth in recent years studies have shown that the vegf pathway is an important signaling pathway involved in tumor angiogenesis and it is also the main target pathway in targeted therapy of liver cancer from the existing research results the single drug use of compounds targeting the vegf pathway can bring survival benefits to patients and is a very promising treatment method in the treatment of liver cancer in march 2022 cyramza ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel was approved by the national medical products administration nmpa for second line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro esophageal junction gej adenocarcinoma in october 2022 cyramza ramucirumab was approved by the nmpa for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma hcc who have an alpha fetoprotein afp of 400 ng ml and have been treated with sorafenib about innovent s strategic cooperation with eli lilly and company innovent entered

treating interest properly in the tax code is essential to maintaining neutrality neutrality should be the guiding principle of tax reform it holds that taxes should not influence positively or negatively the economic decisions of families investors entrepreneurs or businesses a neutral tax code is the most conducive to economic growth in debates about tax reform or closing loopholes many argue that deductions for interest like those for mortgage interest and business interest should be curbed or eliminated altogether to raise more money for the government to spend however deductions for interest expense whether for individuals or businesses preserve neutrality because they establish symmetry between lenders and borrowers when tax is levied on the interest income of lenders eliminating those deductions would both violate neutrality by discouraging investment and inflict serious damage on the economy congress should maintain interest deductions as long as it taxes the interest income of lenders maintain neutrality by establishing symmetry the mortgage interest deduction mid is the deduction that it is most commonly suggested congress should eliminate or curtail as such it provides a useful and understandable example of how an interest deduction establishes symmetry and maintains neutrality in the lending borrowing decision the mid is a deduction from taxable income for taxpayers that itemize deductions on their federal tax returns and pay interest on a mortgage for instance if a family paid their mortgage lender 100 in interest in a given year and itemized their deductions they would subtract that 100 from their taxable income the deduction would reduce their tax bill by 100 multiplied by their marginal tax rate assuming they pay the 35 percent rate the deduction lowers their taxes by 35 the deduction has been in the tax code since the income tax began in 1913 because it is essential to maintain the neutrality of the tax code in fact the original tax code allowed a deduction for all personal interest expenses not just mortgage interest this is sound policy because all interest expenses should be deductible to borrowers if the interest income is taxable to the lenders thus properly understood the mid is not a subsidy for taking a mortgage as some suggest nor are other varieties of interest deductions as long as interest income is taxable to lenders interest deductions like the mid prevent taxes from raising the cost of borrowing and therefore altering the decision to take loans stopping a disincentive to invest is not the same as creating an incentive or providing a subsidy the mid and other similar interest deductions maintain neutrality by establishing symmetry between lenders and borrowers thereby preventing taxes from creating a disincentive to take a mortgage sound policy should seek to maintain and expand that symmetry for all interest expenses lenders pay tax on the interest earned from loaning money to borrowers today lenders pay a 35 percent federal corporate tax rate on their interest earnings the highest corporate tax rate in the world the tax imposed on the lenders causes them to raise their interest rates higher than they would without the tax lenders set rates based on the after tax rate of return they require which is a function of their cost of capital the risk involved in making a particular loan the time value of money and their tax rate among other factors because lenders seek a certain after tax return for taking the risk of making loans they build the cost imposed on them by taxes directly into the interest rates that they charge the difference in interest rates between municipal bonds and corporate bonds with similar risk characteristics is proof that lenders raise the interest rate that they demand to reflect taxes lenders demand lower rates for tax exempt municipal bonds than for taxable corporate bonds that spread sometimes called the tax wedge is almost entirely the result of their different tax treatment interest rates are the prices that lenders charge borrowers to borrow money like the price of any other good or service when the price of an item rises customers in this case borrowers buy less of it all else equal because the taxes cause lenders to raise interest rates borrowers take fewer mortgages this would violate tax neutrality because taxes would negatively influence the amount of investment in housing however the higher interest rate does not deter borrowers from taking a mortgage because the mid reduces borrowers tax liabilities by the exact extra amount that their interest expense rises because of the tax on lenders for example if a lender requires a pre tax 5 percent return to lend a particular borrower 100 for one year the 35 percent tax forces the lender to charge the borrower 7 7 percent to meet the original 5 percent return it requires the higher interest rate raises the interest cost to the borrower by 2 70 over what he would have paid in interest if the tax had not been levied on the lender assuming the borrower was willing only to pay up to 5 percent interest on the mortgage he would not take the loan because he would not be willing to pay the extra amount but because of the mid the borrower is willing to pay the higher interest rate the borrower s total interest expense is 7 70 which once deducted from his taxable income and multiplied by his tax rate also assumed to be 35 percent reduces his tax liability by the same 2 70 the mid cancels out the higher interest cost this symmetry leaves the amount of investment in housing unaffected by tax preserving neutrality the lender is willing to make the loan because he receives the required after tax return and the borrower is willing to take the mortgage because after accounting for the mid he effectively pays the amount of interest he was originally willing to pay symmetry and neutrality are similarly established and preserved in all lending and borrowing scenarios as long as lenders are taxed on their interest income and borrowers receive a deduction for their interest expense neutrality and symmetry could also be achieved for lending and borrowing decisions by not taxing the interest that lenders earn from making loans and denying borrowers a deduction for the interest they pay in this case taxes do not raise the interest rate the lender charges so no deduction is necessary just as in the case in which lenders are taxed on their interest income and borrowers receive a deduction for their interest expense taxes do not alter the borrowing decision investment would decline without mid preserving neutrality is not simply a textbook exercise violating it causes real economic damage continuing with the example of the mid if congress abolished it and continued to tax lenders interest income for instance it would destroy the symmetry that the mid creates as a result families would take fewer mortgages to buy houses because the price of mortgages would rise artificially because of a non neutral tax code for families that pay cash for their houses the lack of a mid would not affect their decision to invest in housing other families would still take a mortgage at the higher rate if there was no mid although they would have less money to spend or invest elsewhere without the deduction however a segment of home buyers at the margin would no longer invest in housing because artificially high interest rates would price them out of the market taxes matter at the margin creating a disincentive for some families to invest in housing by denying a mid would lower investment which would decrease economic growth and opportunity for americans at all income levels because less investment reduces job creation and suppresses wages a similar process would occur in any sector where congress decided to deny an interest deduction to borrowers and continued taxing the interest income of borrowers and would create similar deleterious economic impacts same principles apply to business interest deduction many also favor scrapping the deduction for businesses interest expense but it is based on the same principles of neutrality and symmetry as the mid and should similarly remain in a neutral tax code the economy would suffer if congress eliminated either deduction because investment would fall in the case of the business interest deduction businesses are the borrowers and families are the lenders the tax code taxes the interest that families earn from making loans to businesses and businesses deduct the interest that they pay to families families require a higher rate to make loans to businesses when they pay tax on their interest income because similar to mortgage lenders lending to families they require a certain after tax rate of return however businesses are willing to pay the elevated rate because the interest deduction reduces their tax bill by the same amount that the tax families pay on the interest they earn from lending to businesses raises businesses interest expense neutrality is preserved because the tax falls out of the lending and borrowing decision the same as with the mid in contrast to those who want to abolish both the mid and the interest deduction for businesses there are those who want to eliminate the mid but keep the interest deduction for businesses this is an inconsistent position a person who favors the businesses interest deduction should also favor the mid because they are predicated on identical principles others see the deduction for business interest expense as a subsidy that favors debt financing over equity financing this is also a mistake the deduction is not a subsidy to take on debt debt enjoys a tax advantage as compared to equity not because of the interest deduction but because equity is double taxed first at the business level through the corporate income tax and then at the shareholder level through capital gains and dividends taxes the correct way to equalize the tax treatment of debt and equity is to eliminate the double taxation of equity not to add another disincentive to investment by taking away the interest deduction for businesses as the old adage says two wrongs do not make a right interest deductions not tax expenditures since the mid is often incorrectly called a subsidy it is usually wrongly grouped with tax expenditures which are policies that deviate from a subjectively defined normal or ordinary income tax often other interest deductions such as the one for student loan interest are referred to as subsidies too and therefore also wrongly included as tax expenditures a normal income tax has a proper tax base but there is not a universal standard for defining a proper base hence a normal income tax is in the eye of the beholder the mid is essential for neutrality regardless of how a normal income tax is defined and like other similarly necessary policies it should not be included in the poorly named tax expenditures list nevertheless because of its frequent inclusion in the list analysts also often look at the distribution of the mid in other words how much the families that take the deduction earn in income and pay in taxes regrettably these data are often used to craft arguments in favor of repealing the mid that are based on class warfare while distributional information is interesting because it shows who takes mortgages and itemizes deductions the distribution of a deduction mid and others is irrelevant to its inclusion in the tax base if it is necessary to maintain neutrality interest expenses should be deductible setting a neutral tax base is essential to pro growth tax reform and keeping the right deductions is just as important as lowering tax rates to reduce tax imposed disincentives against productive activity this basic fact is too often overlooked in the tax reform debate because of the strong desire to lower tax rates as much as possible of course lower rates are good but they must be paired with a proper tax base to maximize their benefit similarly those who are ravenous for more revenue to spend too often judge a loophole by how much revenue they could raise by eliminating it while failing to consider how eliminating it in addition to the resultant tax hike would damage the economy congress should not fall prey to either mistake abolishing interest deductibility either to pay for lower tax rates or to raise revenue would make the tax code less neutral and lower investment less investment would reduce opportunity for families struggling in a sluggish economy congress should never eliminate tax deductions simply to raise revenue if it decides to reform the tax code it should establish a neutral tax base this means that as long as it taxes interest income to lenders it should keep interest deductible to borrowers is senior analyst in tax policy in the thomas a roe institute for economic policy studies at the heritage

discontinued therapy due to treatment related aes professor shun lu from shanghai chest hospital of shanghai jiao tong university stated ret is a relatively rare target for nsclc in the context of the high prevalence of nsclc in china s patient population but there exists a certain absolute base of patients whose survival status is equally noteworthy selpercatinib demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with ret fusion positive nsclc in the global libretto 001 phase i ii clinical study with a median pfs of about two years the libretto 321 study further showed that selpercatinib significantly improved the efficacy of chinese patients with advanced ret fusion positive nsclc including patients with brain metastases and the response was clinically meaningful and durable we are thrilled that the approval will bring new treatment options to chinese patients with ret fusion positive nsclc professor cheng ying from jilin cancer hospital stated the current global incidence of ret fusions in nsclc patients is 1 to 2 and the incidence of ret fusion nsclc in china is 1 4 in the past there have been limited therapies available for ret fusion positive nsclc to achieve satisfactory efficacy in recent years the introduction of ret inhibitors has opened a new era of therapy for such patients as observed in the libretto 321 study the orr of selpercatinib in naïve and pre treated patients in the chinese population is very exciting in addition selpercatinib has also shown antitumor activity against brain lesions in preclinical models we believe that the approval of selpercatinib in china will bring more survival benefits to chinese patients with ret fusion positive nsclc professor ming gao from tianjin people hospital stated ret alterations are oncogenic drivers in thyroid cancer mostly seen in mtc selpercatinib is a highly selective and potent ret kinase inhibitor in the libretto 001 study the largest clinical trial ever reported in patients with ret driven cancers selpercatinib demonstrated clinically meaningful and durable responses in ret altered thyroid cancer the libretto 321 study has further demonstrated that the safety and efficacy profile of selpercatinib in the chinese population was consistent with that observed in a previously reported global study its approval is undoubtedly a breakthrough milestone and we hope more tc patients in china will benefit from it in the future dr yongjun liu president of innovent stated globally selpercatinib is the first ret inhibitor approved and we are pleased to see its strong and durable response in line with good tolerability in clinical studies this approval marks another milestone in mainland china for targeted therapies and will bring a new treatment option with high quality to ret fusion positive cancer patients in china for innovent the addition of a high value commercialized product in our tki bu will further enhance the synergistic value in the pipeline portfolio as well as our franchise in certain cancer types we are committed to the partnership with lilly to accelerate the launch of innovative medicines to benefit more cancer patients in china as soon as possible about ret driven cancers genomic alterations in the ret kinase which include fusions and activating point mutations lead to overactive ret signaling and uncontrolled cell growth ret fusions have been identified in approximately 1 2 of nsclc and 10 20 of papillary thyroid cancers activating ret point mutations account for approximately 60 of sporadic mtc and approximately 90 of familial mtc ret fusion positive cancers and ret mutant mtc are primarily dependent on this single activated kinase for their proliferation and survival this dependency often referred to as oncogene addiction renders such tumors highly susceptible to small molecule inhibitors targeting ret activating ret alterations are predominantly mutually exclusive from other oncogenic drivers about non small cell lung cancer nsclc lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and the most commonly diagnosed tumor type in china with an overall five year survival rate of less than 15 non small cell lung cancer nsclc accounts for about 80 to 85 of all lung cancer ret fusions have been identified in about 1 4 of chinese patients with nsclc and the incident cases are above 10 000 every year 8 up to 50 of patients with ret fusion positive nsclc can have tumors that metastasize to the brain about thyroid cancer tc thyroid cancer is a cancer that starts in a person s thyroid gland the most common types of thyroid cancer are papillary and follicular other types include hurthle cell medullary and anaplastic studies show that the positive rate of ret fusion in the chinese tc patient population is about 6 03 with about 3 484 new cases each year in china the positive rate of ret mutations in the chinese sporadic mtc and familial mtc are approximately 42 and 88 8 respectively with about 1 795 new cases each year in china about selpercatinib selpercatinib is a selective and potent ret kinase inhibitor with cns activity in the u s selpercatinib was approved by the fda in may 2020 under the brand name retevmo as the first therapy specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic ret fusion positive non small cell lung cancer nsclc adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older

observed in previously reported global studies professor shukui qin the principal investigator of reach 2 in china and the director of the cancer center of nanjing jinling hospital stated primary liver cancer plc is the fourth most common cancer in terms of prevalence and the second leading cause of cancer related mortality in china with only a 12 1 five year survival rate hcc is the main type of plc and most hcc patients with afp 400ng ml experience greater disease progression on or after first line treatment new treatment options are urgently needed to improve outcomes in these patients globally cyramza is the first approved novel medicine specifically evaluated in the biomarker enriched population of hcc patients with afp 400ng ml the study results in chinese patients demonstrated a consistent efficacy and safety profile with the global population i believe the approval will ignite a positive impact on the clinical practice of liver cancer in china bringing a new and efficacious treatment option for chinese patients with advanced hcc dr yongjun liu president of innovent stated hepatocellular carcinoma ranks fifth among the number of new cases in china with approximately 410 000 new cases yearly and the number of deaths each year are nearly the same most patients will experience disease progression after current first line therapy and are left with limited treatment options we are excited about the approval of cyramza the first innovative drug proven to have clinical benefits for a biomarker enriched population of patients with hcc this differentiated product will potentially be an exciting treatment option and bring new hope to patients in china with advanced hcc the successive approvals of cyramza in second line gc gej and hcc this year enable us to provide integrated patient solutions with strong portfolio synergies while enhancing our leading franchise in these two large cancer indications innovent is fully committed to making these new treatment options available to benefit more cancer patients in china as soon as possible about hepatocellular carcinoma primary liver cancer plc is a common malignancy of the digestive system worldwide among which about half of all new cases and deaths occur in china the main pathological types of liver cancer are hepatocellular carcinoma hcc which accounts for 85 to 90 percent and a small number of cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma icc and hcc icc mixed liver cancer in china hcc is primarily caused by hepatitis b virus hbv and or hepatitis c virus hcv infection about cyramza ramucirumab cyramza is an antiangiogenic therapy it is a vascular endothelial growth factor vegf receptor 2 antagonist that binds specifically to vegfr 2 thereby blocking the binding of the receptor ligands vegf a vegf c and vegf d which may slow tumor growth in recent years studies have shown that the vegf pathway is an important signaling pathway involved in tumor angiogenesis and it is also the main target pathway in targeted therapy of liver cancer from the existing research results the single drug use of compounds targeting the vegf pathway can bring survival benefits to patients and is a very promising treatment method in the treatment of liver cancer in march 2022 cyramza ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel was approved by the national medical products administration nmpa for second line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro esophageal junction gej adenocarcinoma in october 2022 cyramza ramucirumab was approved by the nmpa for patients

but i have a feeling they re going to be busy digesting all of the inflation data that s coming out said shawn cruz head trading strategist at td ameritrade he added that inflation data has driven much of the market s choppiness lately as it will depend how aggressive the federal reserve is with continued rate hikes going forward carmen reinicke brainard says fed is watching global spillovers and lags of rate hikes fed vice chair lael brainard said at an event in chicago that the central bank was seeing tentative signs of a cooling labor market and acknowledged that lags in transmission mean that the fed s recent rate hikes will have a growing impact on non housing sectors of the economy in the coming months brainard also said the fed was aware of the impact of hikes on the global economy and not just in the u s the combined effect of concurrent global tightening is larger than the sum of its parts the federal reserve takes into account the spillovers of higher interest rates a stronger dollar and weaker demand from foreign economies into the united states as well as in the reverse direction we are attentive to the risk of further adverse shocks for instance from russia s war against ukraine the pandemic or china s zero covid policies brainard said brainard did not reveal her preference for the size of rate hikes going forward nor suggest that the fed pause its tightening process but stocks appeared to rebound slightly after the comments were released brainard also pointed to high profit margins in some sectors such as auto dealerships as proof that rate hikes have not yet had their desired impact monetary policy will be restrictive for some time to ensure that inflation moves back to target over time it will take time for the cumulative effect of tighter monetary policy to work through the economy broadly and to bring inflation down she said jesse pound pharmaceutical companies among stocks with unusual volumes pharmaceutical companies immunic

its 20 year high we may hear more in the coming weeks on the pressures an exceptionally strong dollar can have on us exports and thus earnings of us companies but dollar strength could also play a

recent developments related to barrick gold by some measures the world s largest gold mining corporation highlight the heavy dependence of canada s mining companies on the imperialist thuggery of the canadian state for their continued operations and profits in april the globe mail newspaper revealed that barrick had been ordered to produce as many as 120 000 documents to defend itself in a london uk court it is being sued by tanzanian claimants in respect to the killings and injuries of local villagers by tanzanian police and security forces paid fed and housed by the company at its north mara mine the claimants reported raid an anti corporate malfeasance ngo include the family of a nine year old girl killed by a mine vehicle driven by police and four women who were fired upon while gathering around her body barrick s subsidiaries deny liability over the years scores of villagers have been killed or injured but leaked documents expose that the canadian state accepted barrick s denials at face value concerned only to cover up the violence lest it get in the way of resolving barrick s enormous tax and export problems the following month the globe reported some of the sordid details of barrick s 190 billion tax and export dispute with tanzanian authorities exposing the intimate involvement of canadian officials and diplomats in barrick s negotiations with the tanzanian government the globe as the principal mouthpiece of canada s capitalist ruling class was determined to obscure the political and historical context of its own reporting the truth is that barrick s profitable tanzanian operations only exist due to decades of relentless pressure exerted on tanzania by the canadian state which took full advantage of the political bankruptcy and greed of successive tanzanian bourgeois nationalist governments the canadian international development agency cida first threatened to withhold food aid in 1985 if tanzania refused to open up its economy to canadian mining investments canadian state pressure played a major role in bullying tanzania away from its policy of ujamaa or agrarian african socialism in reality ujamaa had nothing whatsoever to do with socialism it was a reactionary nationalist and backwards looking development policy pursued disastrously by the tanganyika african national union tanu and then its political successor the chama chai mapinduzi party of the revolution after independence from british colonialism in 1961 subsequent market reforms demanded and imposed by imperialism combined with colonialism and state led post colonial national capitalist development have restricted tanzania to a very low level of economic development annual per capita gdp is 2 200 and half the population lives on less than 1 90 usd per day mining investment is held up by canadian imperialism as a solution to the problem of african development but the problems of african development are due entirely to capitalism and imperialism despite making investors in imperialist countries obscenely wealthy tanzania s entire mining sector accounted for only 6 percent of its meagre us 62 billion gdp in 2020 including investment wages and taxes to compare canada s 40 largest mining companies had revenues of us 124 billion in 2020 equivalent to 7 5 percent of canada s gdp with most of this revenue flowing into canadian markets from foreign mining operations canada is tanzania s single largest foreign investor focused on the removal of billions of dollars of mineral wealth per year from the country for which the tanzanian state has historically received a pittance in royalty fees similar in many aspects to the political leaders of the former soviet stalinist republics ccm party officials today preside over a corrupt gangster state with factions battling over control of various rent seeking and bribe taking schemes connected to the mining sector and government contracts canadian pressure has only intensified this corruption in 1996 in the aftermath of international monetary fund imf structural adjustment reforms and after the threat of the withdrawal of hundreds of millions in development loans exploration at what is now barrick s bulyanhulu gold mine was undertaken by a canadian company sutton resources little real exploration was required however as the area was already being mined by more than one hundred thousand small scale tanzanian miners who had been encouraged by the old ujamaa policy then canadian high commissioner to tanzania verona edelstein pressured the tanzanian government via diplomatic channels on tanzanian television and in the press into evicting the small scale miners from the area to allow the canadian mine to be built in the violent evictions that followed as many as 60 artisanal miners were buried alive when bulldozers filled in their pits barrick subsequently purchased sutton resources and bulyanhulu in 1999 barrick has enjoyed the constant support of the canadian state ever since canadian prime minister stephen harper notably used a 2007 trip to tanzania to visit barrick s operations while barrick was using scabs to break a strike of more than one thousand bulyanhulu mine workers more recently canadian mining industry profits were assisted by the tanzanian government s abandonment of any fight against the covid pandemic reporting on any covid cases or testing in tanzania is illegal former president magufuli declared the pandemic defeated in june 2020 due to prayer but died of covid himself in early 2021 along with tens of thousands of uncounted tanzanian workers in 2020 as the pandemic raged canadian minerals and mining imports experienced 2 5 percent growth while the value of all other imports save agriculture shrank dramatically the value of canadian mining assets abroad increased by 3 5 percent in 2020 gold miner s profit per ounce was a record setting 828 in 2020 according to a sub secretary in a latin american ministry of mines the canadian ambassador here is a representative for canadian mining companies canadian imperialism and mining canada has 0 48 percent of the global population but is home to 80 percent of the world s mining companies the total value of canadian foreign mining investments stood at 273 billion in 2020 according to natural resources canada latin america is the principal target of canadian mining investment followed by the us and then africa the dollar value of these capital investments is deceptive however the investments extract 50 of their value in revenue each year 143 billion in 2021 much of it from structurally impoverished countries with vast mineral wealth it has been estimated that between 1990 and 2015 imperialist countries appropriated 242 trillion dollars from the former colonial and other historically oppressed countries if canada s foreign mining investments are often more profitable than many other sectors of the economy they are so because of the financial support structures for mining corporations created by the imperialist canadian state and the pressure it exerts on various comprador bourgeois governments to repress their workers lax rules for the establishment of mining joint stock companies on the toronto and vancouver stock exchanges require listed companies to have neither revenue nor profits among mining investors a saying goes that a gold mine is simply a hole with a liar at the top 43 percent of the world s mining companies are listed on the tsx toronto stock exchange export development canada s mining loan portfolio of state backed credit stood at 6 5 billion in 2021 the canada pension plan which invests the state pension contributions of workers which are deducted from their every paycheque by law holds major investments in arnico eagle barrick gold fortis arc resources ivanhoe mines kinross gold corp lundin mining nutrien formerly potash corp tek resources and wheaton precious metals corp there are more mining companies in its stock portfolio than from any other sector of the canadian economy the canadian government maintains 160 trade commissioners across the globe whose job is to translate the demands of canadian capital into local economic policies favorable to the maximization of canadian capitalist profits the federal ministry of global affairs enforces corporate demands with the full power of the canadian state demanding that any country where canadian firms wish to invest tailor its laws to enable the maximum extraction of profits the recent history of barrick gold in tanzania illustrates these relationships in stark detail profits dependent on the canadian state when the tanzanian government inspected barrick s gold concentrate shipments a semi processed ore requiring special refining techniques bound for export in the port of dar es salam in early 2017 it allegedly found that the quantity of gold and other minerals in the concentrates was much larger than the company s officials had declared barrick s then tanzanian subsidiary acacia mining reported that each shipping container of gold concentrate contained 3kg of gold but the tanzanian government s audit determined that the gold content was 7 3 kg per container because the tanzanian government s agreement with barrick and other gold miners levied a royalty of 4 percent of the gold value exported long term under reporting of the gold content in concentrates would mean that the tanzanian government was being cheated of significant royalties for decades significant at least in terms of the pittances offered to it by its old contract with barrick the tanzanian audit determined that the total value of the gold in concentrate really being exported from the country by barrick was in excess of 1 8 billion per year as opposed to the 1 045 billion as declared by the company and for which the tanzanian government would have been paid approximately 72 million instead of the 42 million it actually received this came on top of ongoing tax disputes dating back to 2000 worth 500 million acacia had claimed to be non resident in tanzania for tax purposes as it was incorporated in the uk and that tanzanian law therefore did not require it to pay any taxes in response to the findings of the audit the tanzanian government enacted a ban on the export of gold and copper concentrates seeking to pressure the miners to establish gold smelting resources in tanzania there was then only a single gold smelter capable of refining 999 pure gold on the entire african continent in south africa the tanzanian government next levied a bill of 190 billion in back taxes royalties and penalties on acacia causing barrick s stock value to plummet this crisis for barrick s shareholders immediately became the business of the canadian state email communications of canadian government officials obtained by ottawa based researcher ken rubin many highly redacted document the relentless pressure applied by the canadian government to force the tanzanian government into compliance at each step canadian officials translated barrick s demands into their meetings with tanzanian officials barrick gold s executives pointed canadian trade officials towards the canadian government s foreign aid to tanzania including 2 9 million for the minerals audit agency which had challenged barrick s claims the federal officials seemed ready to cite this funding in their discussions with the tanzanian government although the details are redacted from the released e mails reports the globe the verb cite is more likely a polite euphemism for threaten to cut off the canadian trade commissioner met about the matter with the tanzanian minerals minister sospeter muhongo who was himself fired only weeks later accused of being party to a much larger tax evasion scheme together with domenik rwekaza the head of the tanzanian minerals audit agency muhongo was previously dismissed in 2015 in connection with the embezzlement of up to 800 million from the tanzanian central bank in the tegeta escrow scandal talking points for the meeting prepared by a canadian trade commissioner suggested the high commissioner could try to resolve the tax dispute by promoting acacia s offer to pay for a study of a possible copper smelter in tanzania and by urging the minister to consider using a canadian funded legal support facility to settle the tax issue according to the globe this refers to a 1997 tax treaty which favours canadian investors knowing the legacy of violence and state repression against the local population at barrick s north mara gold mine might come up the trade commissioner also made the ridiculous assertion that the situation there had normalized barrick president kevin dushinsky also met with canadian deputy trade minister timothy sargent to plan a joint strategy while the globe mail article states canadian officials said mr sargent could suggest that barrick should spell out to tanzania that the dispute might cause a loss of jobs and revenue and could damage tanzania s reputation as an investment destination this is another euphemism what they were really referring to are canadian government threats of an investment strike against tanzania and the cut off of government aid canadian officials went all the way up to then tanzanian president magufuli to advocate on acacia s behalf specific details of official canadian government advocacy were redacted from the released documents the dispute took nearly four years to resolve with barrick agreeing to pay 300 million of the 190 billion tax claim 0 15 percent and to restructure its operations into a 50 50 joint venture with the tanzanian government which now operates barrick s three tanzanian mines as twiga minerals while the capitalist press in canada has presented the tanzanian push for a gold smelter simply as a question of jobs and economic development this is another cover story the practice of exporting unrefined gold concentrates for refining offshore permits all gold miners in africa not just barrick to lowball their taxes and royalty payments on those exports refining all gold in the country where it was mined would make such practices much more difficult if not impossible that was likely not the entire focus of tanzanian government officials however as most gold concentrates are refined by copper smelters not gold smelting facilities the smelting of partly refined doré gold bars produced by mine refineries into 999 monetary bars is jealously guarded by finance capital switzerland has 70 percent of the world s gold refining capacity followed by germany japan and south africa switzerland is the world center of private banking and most good delivery bars which can back metals futures contracts on the lme are produced by only seven large refiners four of which are swiss there are very lax controls for reporting about the origins of the gold which arrives in switzerland further virtually all the gold bullion banks which make up the london bullion market association and which purchase much of the world s gold including credit suisse bnp paribas citibank goldman sachs hsbc icbc jpmorgan chase and merrill lynch have been convicted in multiple tax avoidance bribery and global money laundering schemes involving billions of dollars many of these scams have been connected to projects in the developing world tanzania s demand for a 999 fine gold smelter needs to be seen in this context tanzanian government officials were likely making a bid to be cut in on yet another lucrative aspect of the global gold trade a joint venture between tanzania and investors from singapore and dubai finally established a 999 gold smelting facility in 2021 in response to the barrick scandal but this will accept mostly doré bars from small scale miners and export refined gold into the middle east barrick s twiga joint venture continues to export its gold concentrates for refining offshore canadian mining profits rely on savage political repression the intense extraction of super profits in tanzania and brutal competition for a share of the spoils at the top levels of the state creates a climate of repression and violence at all levels of society from the political opposition and journalists down to the level of the villagers who are displaced by its operations the violence at north mara stems from the periodic incursions into the mine by impoverished and desperate local villagers who attempt to find bits of gold and also from social protests the mine s tailings pond has poisoned a local water supply mining watch canada documented 22 killings and 69 injuries of locals at the north mara mine between 2014 and 2016 and acacia has acknowledged an additional 28 intruder fatalities from 2014 to 2017 a 2016 tanzanian parliamentary inquiry found 65 killed and 270 injured in released emails canadian officials simply repeated that acacia made a statement fully refuting the reported allegations the allegations continue to pile up the british aid group raid rights and accountability in development has documented four additional deaths and two injuries since 2019 three of those killed were attempting to leave or had been chased from the mine site two were shot with live ammunition while the third was struck with a large projectile possibly a teargas canister or sound bomb in the back of his head according to the globe a former security officer at north mara who worked at the mine for many years said he often witnessed abuses by tanzanian police against trespassers at the mine site on a regular basis you d see them beating up intruders with big long sticks shooting them just abusing them he said he witnessed dozens of incidents in which the police fired live ammunition at trespassers including three shootings that caused deaths the incidents were always reported to the mine s management according to the former officer who now fears for his own life those who speak out against the operations of canadian mining companies in tanzania often have cause to fear for their lives the toronto star reported in 2019 that reporters investigating numerous accusations of fraud related to barrick s tanzanian activities received anonymous threats in july of 2017 tanzanian newspaper mawio was banned by the government the day after publishing an article suggesting that former tanzanian presidents benjamin mkapa and jaya kikwete were parties to fraud in various mining deals struck with foreign firms dating back to the 1990s the ban on the paper was only lifted in february 2022 after the death of magufuli and his replacement by president samia suluhu hassan mining contracts in tanzania signed before january 2021 have been treated as secret by successive tanzanian governments and are often not even reviewed by parliament wikileaks exposure of us diplomatic cables also revealed that tanzania s public prosecutor edward hoseah also received death threats after his investigations into official corruption approached senior officials around former president kikwete and that the upper reaches of the ccm were untouchable the uk s serious fraud office investigated acacia in 2017 in response to whistleblowers who accused acacia employees of bribing tanzanian government officials in september 2017 unknown assassins shot tanzanian opposition leader tundu lissu with more than 32 machine gun rounds lissu who has led multiple campaigns against barrick gold and other foreign miners for the last 25 years survived but only after many surgeries lissu was forced to flee to exile in belgium opposition politicians and activists are regular targets for beatings outright murder trumped up charges and imprisonment emails from canadian officials concerned with barrick s tax dispute expressed concern only about how to best cover all of this up if the canada brand is to accompany this project along with any other work we do on behalf of barrick we ll need to do some serious work on the csr front behold the serious work barrick gold has now committed to spend 6 out of every gold ounce produced at north mara and bulyanhulu on improving healthcare education infrastructure and access to potable water in their communities it has allocated 70 million for projects including training mine workers at tanzanian universities barrick earned 488 million in q2 2022 up from 411 million in q1 2021 in 2018 as it was busy advocating for barrick s tanzanian profits the trudeau government pledged to create a new watchdog with the power to

how twitter fits into mr musk s broader suite of business interests is the subject of much speculation last week he tweeted that buying twitter is an accelerant to creating x the everything app while he didn t go into detail about what that app might be mr musk has previously drawn a comparison with wechat the chinese app that combines social media with payments and games and boasts around 1 billion users in june he told twitter employees that there s no wechat equivalent outside of china you basically live on wechat in china if we can recreate that with twitter we ll be a great success fellow australian twitter investor forager funds says a good management team could grow the social media platform s business markedly without it becoming an everything app twitter the product has a sort of magic that its power users understand but expensive innovations the company has worked on the past decade have rarely done much to improve nor commercialise it gareth brown portfolio manager at forager funds says advertisement while it s a well known issue that twitter s performance lags its potential there have been signs of life that gave public market investors hope as a technology business twitter has spent millions over the last few years establishing high grade server farms in california and on the product front the company has been releasing waves of features designed to monetise its captured users small one time payments via tips monthly subscriptions through super follows and public moderation platforms via ticketed spaces have all contributed to twitter s expanding bottom line add to this digital marketing strategies like prompted ads follower ads and short video ads have emerged with twitter spruiking its geolocation keyword conversation targeting features for digital marketers hungry to pay for eyeballs anywhere on the internet financing the deal but the future of twitter looks to be in mr musk s hands not equity investors though given the rollercoaster of the last few months it s fair to assume the deal isn t done until the money lands in twitter s accounts advertisement indeed how mr musk will finance the deal remains the top question when he bid for twitter in april he offered us54 20 per share at the time morgan stanley led a consortium of banks to provide 13 million of debt financing with mr musk set to provide the other 33 5 billion since that time markets have suffered savage sell offs and there has been a drastic re pricing of technology stocks this affects not only the price of twitter but the expanse of mr musk s personal wealth the majority of which comes from his holding in tesla his electric vehicle company analysts have been calculating how much tesla stock mr musk needs to sell to afford the us33 5 billion price tag as part of the court case twitter brought against mr musk when he tried to back track out of the deal text messages between mr musk and high profile investors including oracle s larry ellison and venture capital investors andreessen horowitz emerged they show he had raised about us7 1 billion in equity commitments but it hasn t been confirmed that that funding will be part of how mr musk ultimately pays for twitter if mr musk decides to terminate the deal entirely without going through the court process that is still ongoing it will cost him us1 billion

k p nayar strategic analyst india has adapted smoothly to the changed circumstances at the ongoing annual united nations general assembly unga in new york this year the leadership of the ministry of external affairs mea made india their priority during the 77th unga s high level segment when heads of state and government took over the world s important pulpit in the third week of september indians across the board in the government who were in new york for the event lectured a lot less to the world than at any time in the last 75 years they offered fewer prescriptions to others instead they tried to obtain for india the most they could from the opportunities thrown up at the large and resourceful gathering jaishankar who led the delegation and stood in for the pm extensively put the 5 s samman samvaad sahyog shanti and samriddhi into practice here is one example sherpas from the relatively new plurilateral group i2u2 india israel uae us decided to meet in new york since they were at the un headquarters for the unga in place of the high minded hyperbole about global problems that such meetings often produce dammu ravi the indian sherpa pushed for consideration at the meeting something that would benefit india and within the group s reach so breaking from precedent the meeting took stock of a 2 billion uae funded project to develop integrated food parks across india ravi also persuaded his three counterparts to review the progress of a project in hybrid renewable energy in gujarat consisting of 300 mw of wind and solar capacity complemented by a battery energy storage system hardcore multilateralists would argue that the unga is an occasion to address global problems especially in a year when the community of nations is facing the gravest crisis since world war ii because of the conflict in ukraine and a global health crisis but ravi s strength is economic diplomacy which has become ever more central to conventional diplomacy precisely because of such crises ravi is the mea s secretary in charge of external economic relations he managed to get the i2u2 to commit to deepening the economic partnership among the four countries instead of unrealistic but noble goals of uplifting an entire region or their larger neighbourhood the food parks to be set up by the uae will incorporate state of the art climate smart technologies to reduce food waste and spoilage conserve fresh water and employ renewable energy sources its global context true to the un spirit should not be missed because the uae will host the un climate change conference of parties in 2023 and it is home to the un s international renewable energy agency the project in gujarat will cost 330 million and its feasibility study is being done by the us trade and development agency as part of an i2u2 process the challenges before new delhi as it prepared for the unga were immense this is the first normal general assembly in three years the pandemic ravaged the unga in 2020 in 2021 it was a nominal event with most world leaders skipping in person attendance as countries battled covid waves for india last year s unga and the ongoing session are exceptional because they run parallel to india s two year elected membership of the un security council india assumed presidency of the council a month before last year s unga pm modi s 5 s approach to the country s role in the world body which would have been spotlighted by the indian delegation in a normal year s unga had to be advanced to coincide with the indian presidency the 5 s approach is india s new panchsheel on the global stage it is made up of samman respect samvaad dialogue sahyog cooperation shanti peace and samriddhi prosperity this year external affairs minister s jaishankar who led the indian delegation and stood in for modi extensively put this approach into practice aside from meeting other delegation heads he hosted or attended a record number of plurilateral meetings one lesson to be learned from his style is that india should abandon the convention of the pm and the external affairs minister not being in new york at the same time during the high level segment india s traditional approach has been for the pm to be at the un during this most important week to be followed by the external affairs minister the week after thereafter a minister of state from the mea takes over and finally a group of parliament members go to the un for the committee level work of the unga process which lasts into the new year as soon as he arrived in new york jaishankar persuaded his counterpart from argentina santiago cafiero to call a meeting to revitalise the india celac community of latin american and caribbean states forum the 32 celac members were pleased with the attention given to them by india a member of the security council india has room for manoeuvre in celac because of its unique composition big powers in the region the us and canada as well as france the uk denmark and the netherlands which have territories there are not allowed to be in celac so as not to dilute its focus another of jaishankar s initiatives was to co host a meeting which commemorated the 15th anniversary of the founding of the l 69 group which stands with india in seeking reform to the council it is so called after the number of the draft assembly resolution l 69 in 2007 which established the intergovernmental negotiation process for reform such meetings were in addition to the routine ones that take place on the sidelines of every unga the india brazil south africa dialogue forum trilateral ministerial commission and the brazil russia india china south africa conclave at the level of foreign ministers overall india s actions during the 2022 unga so far have rallied like minded countries against western attempts to move the world body away from being driven by its members and accord a bigger role to their corporate entities and sympathetic non governmental organisations

and lags of rate hikes fed vice chair lael brainard said at an event in chicago that the central bank was seeing tentative signs of a cooling labor market and acknowledged that lags in transmission mean that the fed s recent rate hikes will have a growing impact on non housing sectors of the economy in the coming months brainard also said the fed was aware of the impact of hikes on the global economy and not just in the u s the combined effect of concurrent global tightening is larger than the sum of its parts the federal reserve takes into account the spillovers of higher interest rates a stronger dollar and weaker demand from foreign economies into the united states as well as in the reverse direction we are attentive to the risk of further adverse shocks for instance from russia s war against ukraine the pandemic or china s zero covid policies brainard said brainard did not reveal her preference for the size of rate hikes going forward nor suggest that the fed pause its tightening process but stocks appeared to rebound slightly after the comments were released brainard also pointed to high profit margins in some sectors such as auto dealerships as proof that rate hikes have not yet had their desired impact monetary policy will be restrictive for some time to ensure that inflation moves back to target over time it will take time for the cumulative effect of tighter monetary policy to work through the economy broadly and to bring inflation down she said jesse pound pharmaceutical companies among stocks with unusual volumes pharmaceutical companies immunic

discontinued therapy due to treatment related aes professor shun lu from shanghai chest hospital of shanghai jiao tong university stated ret is a relatively rare target for nsclc in the context of the high prevalence of nsclc in china s patient population but there exists a certain absolute base of patients whose survival status is equally noteworthy selpercatinib demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with ret fusion positive nsclc in the global libretto 001 phase i ii clinical study with a median pfs of about two years the libretto 321 study further showed that selpercatinib significantly improved the efficacy of chinese patients with advanced ret fusion positive nsclc including patients with brain metastases and the response was clinically meaningful and durable we are thrilled that the approval will bring new treatment options to chinese patients with ret fusion positive nsclc professor cheng ying from jilin cancer hospital stated the current global incidence of ret fusions in nsclc patients is 1 to 2 and the incidence of ret fusion nsclc in china is 1 4 in the past there have been limited therapies available for ret fusion positive nsclc to achieve satisfactory efficacy in recent years the introduction of ret inhibitors has opened a new era of therapy for such patients as observed in the libretto 321 study the orr of selpercatinib in naïve and pre treated patients in the chinese population is very exciting in addition selpercatinib has also shown antitumor activity against brain lesions in preclinical models we believe that the approval of selpercatinib in china will bring more survival benefits to chinese patients with ret fusion positive nsclc professor ming gao from tianjin people hospital stated ret alterations are oncogenic drivers in thyroid cancer mostly seen in mtc selpercatinib is a highly selective and potent ret kinase inhibitor in the libretto 001 study the largest clinical trial ever reported in patients with ret driven cancers selpercatinib demonstrated clinically meaningful and durable responses in ret altered thyroid cancer the libretto 321 study has further demonstrated that the safety and efficacy profile of selpercatinib in the chinese population was consistent with that observed in a previously reported global study its approval is undoubtedly a breakthrough milestone and we hope more tc patients in china will benefit from it in the future dr yongjun liu president of innovent stated globally selpercatinib is the first ret inhibitor approved and we are pleased to see its strong and durable response in line with good tolerability in clinical studies this approval marks another milestone in mainland china for targeted therapies and will bring a new treatment option with high quality to ret fusion positive cancer patients in china for innovent the addition of a high value commercialized product in our tki bu will further enhance the synergistic value in the pipeline portfolio as well as our franchise in certain cancer types we are committed to the partnership with lilly to accelerate the launch of innovative medicines to benefit more cancer patients in china as soon as possible about ret driven cancers genomic alterations in the ret kinase which include fusions and activating point mutations lead to overactive ret signaling and uncontrolled cell growth ret fusions have been identified in approximately 1 2 of nsclc and 10 20 of papillary thyroid cancers activating ret point mutations account for approximately 60 of sporadic mtc and approximately 90 of familial mtc ret fusion positive cancers and ret mutant mtc are primarily dependent on this single activated kinase for their proliferation and survival this dependency often referred to as oncogene addiction renders such tumors highly susceptible to small molecule inhibitors targeting ret activating ret alterations are predominantly mutually exclusive from other oncogenic drivers about non small cell lung cancer nsclc lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and the most commonly diagnosed tumor type in china with an overall five year survival rate of less than 15 non small cell lung cancer nsclc accounts for about 80 to 85 of all lung cancer ret fusions have been identified in about 1 4 of chinese patients with nsclc and the incident cases are above 10 000 every year 8 up to 50 of patients with ret fusion positive nsclc can have tumors that metastasize to the brain about thyroid cancer tc thyroid cancer is a cancer that starts in a person s thyroid gland the most common types of thyroid cancer are papillary and follicular other types include hurthle cell medullary and anaplastic studies show that the positive rate of ret fusion in the chinese tc patient population is about 6 03 with about 3 484 new cases each year in china the positive rate of ret mutations in the chinese sporadic mtc and familial mtc are approximately 42 and 88 8 respectively with about 1 795 new cases each year in china about selpercatinib selpercatinib is a selective and potent ret kinase inhibitor with cns activity in the u s selpercatinib was approved by the fda in may 2020 under the brand name retevmo as the first therapy specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic ret fusion positive non small cell lung cancer nsclc adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older

positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are radioactive iodine refractory if radioactive iodine is appropriate in sep 2022 the fda granted an accelerated approval for a tumor agnostic indication for selpercatinib in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a ret gene fusion that have progressed on or following prior systemic treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options selpercatinib is the first and only ret inhibitor to get this indication in addition to the tumor agnostic approval the fda has granted traditional

the u s economy has little chance of falling into a recession this year or next unless the federal reserve raises interest rates more than they are currently projecting according to a new forecast released yesterday at the 13th annual inland empire economic forecast conference hosted by the uc riverside school of business although there are signs of stress in parts of the economy the wealth created by the excessive fiscal stimulus enacted in 2020 and 2021 continues to drive a consumer consumption binge that will propel the economy forward said christopher thornberg director of the uc riverside school of business center for economic forecasting and one of the forecast authors the only possible thing that could tip things downward in the near term is if the fed applies even more aggressive quantitative tightening to control inflation than they re now projecting if the fed stamps out inflation in the near term by forcefully reducing its balance sheet it will drive up interest rates cool financial markets sharply and possibly create a modest recession next year led by consumer cutbacks according to the new outlook however in the longer term if fed action is inadequate the united states may be looking at several years of very weak growth with consumers in a relatively poor financial position at the end this is now a balancing act said thornberg functionally speaking policymakers went from maximum acceleration the stimulus to maximum braking tightening by the fed over a single year something that would create turbulence in even the healthiest economy although the new forecast is predicting economic growth to continue in the nation california and the inland empire in the short run albeit at a slower pace we ve cooled from white hot to red hot in the longer term the major economic wildcard comes from the growing federal deficit according to the new forecast much will depend on how long bond markets are willing to tolerate the excessive level of today s u s government debt in california the state is on the brink of a milestone recovering all the jobs it lost during the pandemic driven downturn and mass retirement while many states have already reached full recovery as of this writing california still has a 47 300 job deficit however it s increasingly likely that the state s job count will be above water by the end of this year according to the forecast key findings in the united states inflation is moderating and may have peaked but it won t decelerate rapidly expect price growth and interest rates to remain elevated in the near term consumer spending now accounts for the highest share of u s gdp since 2006 this consumption is also apparent in the rapidly growing u s trade deficit which accounts for the largest a share of gdp since the runup to the great recession there is a massive amount of equity in the current u s housing market driven by a decade of low mortgage debt accumulation the industry also has very low inventories of existing homes for sale and vacancy rates are still at a record low level this is not a market that is due for a collapse at least not yet the major problem for new housing is the ultra low mortgage rates homeowners currently enjoy anyone who sells now will have to go from a sub 3 rate to something in the 5 category that is not a move most homeowners make unless they have to the move up market is all but frozen california s employment recovery has been uneven with inland communities faring better than coastal areas the inland empire has 5 percent more jobs today than it had prior to the pandemic while at the other end of the spectrum there are still 3 percent fewer jobs in ventura county california s labor force contracted during the pandemic and employers have struggled to find workers especially in coastal communities the primary reason behind the labor force changes is population growth from 2019 to 2022 population grew in inland communities and declined in coastal communities driven by affordability after two years in which california s housing market went gangbusters and home prices increased an average 43 percent the rising interest rate environment in addition to stretched prices has led to a major slowdown in 2022 a price crash in the market is nowhere in sight although a slowdown in price growth is expected the share of homes purchased by investors in the inland empire is at record highs this parallels the nationwide interest by private equity in purchasing large swaths of residential real estate this forecast expects the share of homes purchased by investors to increase current sale price cuts for homes in the inland empire are more of a reality check than a price decline warranting concern the rate of bidding wars has only dipped to levels seen in the early part of 2020 the inland empire has experienced a tremendous boom in transport and logistics employment 16 6 percent of all jobs in the region are now in this sector the information sector has grown but lags other employment categories highlighting the relative underrepresentation of knowledge workers in the region this forecast expects employment in the inland empire to continue growing although at a tapered pace victoria pike bond uc riverside

supplemental new drug application snda for cyramza ramucirumab in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma hcc also known as liver cancer who have an alpha fetoprotein of 400 ng ml and have been treated with sorafenib in march 2022 cyramza ramucirumab was approved by the nmpa in combination with paclitaxel for second line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro esophageal junction gej adenocarcinoma making it the first and only targeted drug approved for the second line treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro esophageal junction gej adenocarcinoma in china cyramza ramucirumab has been discovered and developed by lilly in march 2022 innovent and lilly expanded their strategic partnership in oncology which includes an agreement for innovent to

of this product with this further expanded oncology product portfolio innovent intends to use its experienced oncology commercial team to leverage its broad commercial coverage in hospitals and pharmacies at various tiers and to provide integrated patient solutions with strong synergies to cancer patients in china this new approval was based on the results of the reach 2 study a global randomized double blind placebo controlled phase 3 clinical trial the reach 2 study is the first phase 3 clinical trial in hcc to obtain positive results in a biomarker enriched population known for poor prognosis on the primary endpoint of overall survival os treatment with cyramza significantly improved the os of patients compared to placebo hr 0 71 95 ci 0 53 0 95 p 0 020 the median os was 8 5 months with cyramza compared to 7 3 months with placebo on the secondary endpoint of progression free survival pfs median pfs was significantly improved with cyramza 2 8 months vs 1 6 months for

is the fourth most common cancer in terms of prevalence and the second leading cause of cancer related mortality in china with only a 12 1 five year survival rate hcc is the main type of plc and most hcc patients with afp 400ng ml experience greater disease progression on or after first line treatment new treatment options are urgently needed to improve outcomes in these patients globally cyramza is the first approved novel medicine specifically evaluated in the biomarker enriched population of hcc patients with afp 400ng ml the study results in chinese patients demonstrated a consistent efficacy and safety profile with the global population i believe the approval will ignite a positive impact on the clinical practice of liver cancer in china bringing a new and efficacious treatment option for chinese patients with advanced hcc dr yongjun liu president of innovent stated hepatocellular carcinoma ranks fifth among the number of new cases in china with approximately 410 000 new cases yearly and the number of deaths each year are nearly the same most patients will experience disease progression after current first line therapy and are left with limited treatment options we are excited about the approval of cyramza the first innovative drug proven to have clinical benefits for a biomarker enriched population of patients with hcc this differentiated product will potentially be an exciting treatment option and bring new hope to patients in china with advanced hcc the successive approvals of cyramza in second line gc gej and hcc this year enable us to provide integrated patient solutions with strong portfolio synergies while enhancing our leading franchise in these two large cancer indications innovent is fully committed to making these new treatment options available to benefit more cancer patients in china as soon as possible about hepatocellular carcinoma primary liver cancer plc is a common malignancy of the digestive system worldwide among which about half of all new cases and deaths occur in china the main pathological types of liver cancer are hepatocellular carcinoma hcc which accounts for 85 to 90 percent and a small number of cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma icc and hcc icc mixed liver cancer in china hcc is primarily caused by hepatitis b virus hbv and or hepatitis c virus hcv infection about cyramza ramucirumab cyramza is an antiangiogenic therapy it is a vascular endothelial growth factor vegf receptor 2 antagonist that binds specifically to vegfr 2 thereby blocking the binding of the receptor ligands vegf a vegf c and vegf d which may slow tumor growth in recent years studies have shown that the vegf pathway is an important signaling pathway involved in tumor angiogenesis and it is also the main target pathway in targeted therapy of liver cancer from the existing research results the single drug use of compounds targeting the vegf pathway can bring survival benefits to patients and is a very promising treatment method in the treatment of liver cancer in march 2022 cyramza ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel was approved by the national medical products administration nmpa for second line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro esophageal junction gej adenocarcinoma in october 2022 cyramza ramucirumab was approved by the nmpa for patients with hepatocellular

the ohio attorney general runs the largest public interest law firm in the state but democrat jeff crossman says incumbent republican dave yost uses the office for political fights rather than to serve all ohioans i think one of the real unfortunate or quite frankly reprehensible things that yost has done in that office is use that office for political purposes said crossman a state lawmaker from parma who is running against yost in the general election i completely and fundamentally disagree that that office should be used to file lawsuits based on political philosophy because as the attorney general you re supposed to represent all the people in the state not just the ones that agree with you politically yost noted that ohio led or joined 23 lawsuits against the federal government but skipped joining 16 other cases during his tenure as attorney general which started in 2019 yost said he is joining lawsuits that seek to push back against inappropriate use of presidential executive power to usurp congress the idea that because congress is divided like the country is divided that the president should just step in and become a monarch is to disassemble the american governance system i m against that yost said during yost s term as attorney general ohio joined a lawsuit that challenged vaccine mandates for federal contractors two lawsuits seeking to block the biden administration from enforcing rules against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation a lawsuit to overturn the federal ban on bump stocks a mechanism for converting firearms into machine gun like weapons the same day the u s supreme court struck down the constitutional right to abortion yost went to court to successfully get the stay lifted against ohio s six week abortion ban law weeks later he cast doubt on the existence of a 10 year old rape victim who traveled to indiana for an abortion yost also said the child could have received an abortion in ohio because state law provides exceptions for when the life of the mother or a major bodily function is at risk some medical experts disagree that the girl would have qualified for one of those exceptions no doctor is going to risk their license on a vaguely written exception that nobody has clarified crossman said yost countered first of all mr crossman is not a doctor or a prosecutor which calls into serious question his qualifications to say that secondly neither i nor he nor any other doctor in this state can offer an opinion you know why because we don t have a case file we don t have a medical history we don t have an examination yost has declined to offer an apology to the 10 year old or her family for questioning the existence of the case or her need to travel to indiana for an abortion i don t even know the 10 year old i ve never mentioned her he said who is dave yost yost 65 served as delaware county prosecutor and state auditor before beating steve dettelbach in the 2018 race for attorney general the ohio state university graduate worked as a newspaper reporter before jumping into politics and the law he earned his law degree from capital university i distrust power i distrust secrecy and i wanted to change the world for the better as corny as it sounds yost said of his career choices yost said the attorney general s office should be used to establish the rule of law for everyone no matter their status if elected to a second term yost said his priorities are increasing accountability for pharmacy benefit managers in medicaid continuing to fight against human trafficking and finding money for annual training for ohio s 35 000 sworn police officers yost maintains that annual training can t be mandated without funding he also supports reforms such as creating a police professional licensing program similar to licensing for doctors engineers and other professions he noted that it requires legislative action it wasn t on the top of the agenda this year apparently he said here is his position on other issues full abortion ban declined to say citing ongoing litigation eliminating training and checks to carry concealed weapons declined to say because his office represents the legislature which passed the new law legalizing recreational marijuana opposed establishing database of police shootings supports who is jeff crossman crossman earned his undergraduate degree from mount union university a master s degree from the university of akron and a law degree from cleveland marshall college of law initially he wanted to be a college professor but shifted to a legal career after he determined it would be a better opportunity to serve and address problems crossman 50 spent five years on the parma city council before joining the ohio house in january 2019 as a state lawmaker he was among 26 democrats who voted for republican larry householder to become speaker a vote he says he regrets and notes he called for householder s removal from office after he was indicted in a federal public corruption case if elected attorney general crossman said he d use the resources of the office to investigate public corruption householder and house bill 6 ohio can be number one in the country for opportunity like it used to be but it can t be number one for opportunity while it s number one in the country for corruption he said yost filed a civil lawsuit to block firstenergy from collecting fees from ohio consumers for two nuclear plants in northern ohio a move crossman called insufficient federal prosecutors are expected to reveal their corruption case in detail when householder and former ohio republican party chairman matt borges go to trial in january crossman concedes that federal authorities may have asked state officials to hold off on investigations but said that doesn t excuse the state attorney general who has specific jurisdiction the power of the office the resources to conduct their own independent investigation here is his position on other issues full abortion ban opposes eliminating training and checks to carry concealed weapons opposed legalizing recreational marijuana says it should be up to the voters to decide establishing database of police shootings supports more what you need to know about voting in ohio

within hours of the attack on the september attack on the nordstream pipelines a consensus emerged that the americans did it in spite of the fact that the mainstream media were united in blaming russia only the americans had the motive and the means the evidence was circumstantial but irrefutable within hours of the attack on nordstream the video of president biden s february 2022 press conference with german chancellor olaf scholz was making the rounds on the internet in response to a question from a reporter in february biden said in no uncertain terms that if russia invaded the ukraine america would take out the nordstream pipelines the video of victoria nuland saying the same thing also started circulating within hours of the attack by e michael jones historically the attack fit into the pattern of anglo american foreign policy like a hand in a glove the nordstream pipelines were a clear violation of the mackinder thesis which has been the hidden grammar of american foreign policy for over a century a fact corroborated by both donald trump who opposed nordstream as president and his opponent ted cruz who said that there was bipartisan agreement on the threat which nordstream posed to american interests ever since halford mackinder wrote the geographical pivot of history at the beginning of the 20th century the goal of anglo american foreign policy has been to thwart any unification of the eurasian landmass because according to mackinder the country which controls eurasia controls the world any rapprochement between russia and germany posed an existential threat to anglo american hegemony when the kaiser and the czar cousins by blood threatened to collaborate winston churchill and lord grey lured both countries into a war which pitted them against each other ensuring a favorable outcome for oceania the name george orwell gave to the island nations which made up the anglo american empire in his dystopian novel 1984 fourteen years into the 21st century the american empire followed the same playbook when nato under the direction of victoria nuland took the first steps into luring russia into a war with germany in the ukraine by overthrowing that country s democratically elected president and installing a puppet regime led by jews and nazis as in the past the point of the current war in the ukraine was to lure germany and russia into a war which would destroy both countries leaving america as the undisputed global hegemon everyone knew that the americans were using ukrainian proxies to wage war on russia but few if any germans knew that the war was being waged against them as well until the attack on nordstream ii made that obvious most americans and most germans perceived russia as the sole enemy in the ukrainian conflict because few if any americans or germans had read the rand corporation s report weakening germany strengthening the u s which revealed the hidden grammar of war pitting russia against germany in a mutually destructive conflict the rand report was simply an updating of the mackinder thesis the real goal in the ukrainian conflict was to bring about the collapse of the european economy by denying germany the russian energy which it needs to survive according to the rand report the eu economy will inevitably collapse after the fall of german industry causing trillions of dollars of european resources to flow back to the united states followed by a flood of well educated young people in europe who will be forced to emigrate because good paying jobs will have vanished in the wake of the energy crisis which was a direct result of the war the american attack on what everyone considered america s main ally in europe was necessary because there is an urgent need for an influx of resources from outside to maintain the overall american economy but especially the banking system which only european countries bound by eu and nato commitments can provide without significant military and political costs for us according to the rand report the main obstacle to the looting of europe on a scale which rivaled the jewish looting of russia in the 1990s was the growing independence of germany which followed britain s exit from the european union brexit the rand report continued has given germany greater independence and made it more difficult for the united states to influence the decisions of european governments the only way to thwart the growing cooperation between germany and russia as well as france which if realized will eventually turn europe into not only an economic but also a political competitor to the united states is to inflict permanent damage on both germany and russian by involving them in a mutually destructive war which will make it impossible for the countries to re establish normal relations later on permanent damage is what happened to both the pipeline and american german relations the immediate consequence was a reduction in russian energy supplies ideally a complete halt of such supplies would lead to disastrous outcomes for german industry the need to divert significant amounts of russian gas for winter heating will further exacerbate the shortages lockdowns in industrial enterprises would cause shortages of components and spare parts for manufacturing a breakdown of logistics chains and eventually a domino effect the total collapse of the eu economy would mean not only that us based companies would have less competition on the world market logistical advantages and the outflow of capital from europe it would also mean that those plundered european economies would be able to contribute to the economy of the united states by an estimated 7 9 trillion dollars in addition it also emphasizes the important effect of many well educated and young europeans being be forced to immigrate to the usa the oligarchs can facilitate this collapse according to the rand report by placing useful idiots in political positions in order to stop russian energy supplies from reaching the continent the german green party is made up of a group of politically naïve individuals who are the ideal useful idiots because the environmental ideology that lies at the heart of their political platform is completely irrational and therefore immune to both rational discussion and political pressure the rand document describes the green parties in europe as being particularly easy to manipulate into running the errands of american imperialism or in the words of the document itself the prerequisite for germany to fall into this trap is the dominant role of green parties and european ideologies the german environmental movement is a highly dogmatic if not fanatical movement which makes it quite easy to get them to ignore economic arguments as examples of useful idiots in positions of leadership the rand report mentions the current foreign minister of germany annalena baerbock who recently claimed that she was determined to support the war in the ukraine no matter what the german voters think and the climate minister robert habeck who is avidly dismantling power plants in the face of the coming energy shortage according to the rand report baerbock is well known for declaring that she will continue the suspension of russian gas even during the winter regardless of what her constituents think about the matter and the consequences for the german population the rand report quotes her as saying we will stand with ukraine and this means that the sanctions will stay also in wintertime even if it gets really tough for politicians counting on the personal characteristics and lack of professionalism which characterize the green party the author of the rand report feels confident that it will become impossible for them to recognize their own mistakes in time it will therefore be sufficient to rapidly form a media image of putin s aggressive war and make the greens into ardent and tough supporters of sanctions a war party this will make it possible to impose the sanctions without any obstacles issued in january 2022 before the start of hostilities the rand report foresaw a speedy end to the war following the collapses of the russian economy under crushing sanctions from the west that speedy victory never happened the sanctions boomeranged hurting the west by causing energy inflation while at the same time benefiting russia whose economy boomed because of higher revenues in the energy sector as the war continued and ukraine lost ground to the russians discontent spread through the european vassal states which were dragooned into a conflict which did not serve their national interests large scale protests in germany in september demanded that the opening of nordstream ii and threatened to bring down the scholz government the failure of ukrainian troops to prevent the absorption of donets and lugansk into mother russia created a sense of desperation in kiev and frustration in washington which called for more direct and reckless measures knowing that nato was losing the war on the ground in the ukraine and the war for the mind of the people in germany the americans blew up nordstream ii blowing up the russo german pipeline stymied both sides in the war depriving germany of energy leading to the collapse of its industry while at the same time depriving the russians of the financial windfall which energy revenue provided less than three months into the war it became obvious that the sanctions which the eu and the us imposed on russia hurt no one but the countries which imposed them driving up energy costs and fueling inflation as the russians laughed all the way to the bank the failure of the sanctions and the failure of the ukrainian army to drive the russians back into their own country necessitated a new and more reckless strategy blowing up the pipeline was a classic example of shock therapy which is the prime instrument of disaster capitalism germany was stunned by the gratuitous ferocity of an attack which severed the main artery of their energy sector even more shocking was the realization that the attack had been perpetrated by their main nato ally eugyppius one of the first germans to respond to the attack characterized it as a real attempt by the us to send a message and or humiliate germany but it was more than that blowing up the pipeline was the culmination of the abusive relationship which america had established with germany after defeating her in world war ii more than that it was a return to the long abandoned morgenthau plan when josef goebbels hitler s propaganda minister got an advance copy of the morgenthau plan he referred to it in one of his most effective radio broadcasts as den plan des juden morgenthaus den 80 millionen deutschen ihre industrie beraubt und aus deutschland ein einzige kartoffelfeld gemacht werde the jew morgenthau s plan to rob 80 million germans of their industry and turn germany into a potato patch when it became clear that the jews who had the upper hand in the roosevelt administration were determined not to drive the nazis from power but to exterminate the german people germans united behind goebbels whose response was niemals das kaeme nicht in frage as in the current situation in the ukraine jewish intransigence made negotiations impossible and resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives the military opposed the morgenthau plan contending that it amounted to adding divisions of german soldiers to the waning years of the war they were proven right after the intransigence of the jews in the roosevelt administration eventually backfired by strengthening the germans in their resolve to fight to the last man on 11 december 1944 oss operative william donovan sent roosevelt a telegraph message from bern warning him of the consequences that the knowledge of the morgenthau plan had had on german resistance so far the allies have not offered the opposition any serious encouragement on the contrary they have again and again welded together the people and the nazis by statements published either out of indifference or with a purpose to take a recent example the morgenthau plan gave dr goebbels the best possible chance he was able to prove to his countrymen in black and white that the enemy planned the enslavement of germany the conviction that germany had nothing to expect from defeat but oppression and exploitation still prevails and that accounts for the fact that the germans continue to fight it is not a question of a regime but of the homeland itself and to save that every german is bound to obey the call whether he be nazi or member of the opposition the morgenthau plan began as a memo entitled program to prevent germany from starting a world war ii which got handed from treasury secretary henry morgenthau jr to franklin delano roosevelt at the quebec conference in 1944 the author of the memo was harry dexter white morgenthau s assistant and like him a jew who was deeply concerned about the plight of fellow jews in europe white was also a communist spy whose jewish animus against the german people was exacerbated by a desire to make their lives so miserable that they would welcome the soviets with open arms the gist of the morgenthau plan was included in the first item of the memo entitled demilitarization of germany which claimed it should be the aim of the allied forces to accomplish the complete demilitarization of germany in the shortest possible period of time after surrender this means completely disarming the german army and people including the removal or destruction of all war material the total destruction of the whole german armament industry and the removal or destruction of other key industries which are basic to military strength the memo deliberately played down the draconian nature of morgenthau s plan in an attempt to calm roosevelt s fear of a revolt against semitic vengeance which was gaining ground in the state department under cordell hull in a book which got published after roosevelt s death morgenthau was more candid about his plans disarming germany wasn t enough germany had to be deprived of the industrial basis that created those armaments in the first place given her people s lust for conquest her heavy industries her shipyards her research laboratories and her shrewd cartel system it would seem rather obvious that to disarm germany in any real sense of the word is to remove the industries that would make rearmament possible echoing morgenthau louis nizer called for the de industrialization of germany in a book which was published in the same year that morgenthau proposed his plan it will not be sufficient to destroy the military caste another can quickly arise germany s capacity to build the tools for another war machine must be permanently removed there must be complete industrial disarmament perhaps we may call it de armament to confiscate ger many s existing weapons may actually be of advantage to her the confiscated equipment thus acquired by the united nations would soon become obsolete while germany could plan a newer and more effective arsenal the reverse was true when germany attacked but even more important the machine tool iron steel aluminum chemical and other industries which provide the possibility of reconstructing these plants must be re moved from german direction either physically or through control of management one method of control would be to place the majority stock of these heavy industries in trust with representatives of the united nations like germany s green party in the 21st century the morgenthau plan also called for depriving germany of the energy she needed for her factories as of 1944 when harry dexter white concocted the morgenthau plan the chief source of german energy was coal morgenthau complained that even after the removal of all ruhr factories that escaped destruction in the war the mines would remain a potential source of german rearmament the coal cannot be taken away from the ruhr except by the trainload as it is mined so the ruhr should be taken away from germany in order to accomplish that morgenthau proposed the ethnic cleansing of germans from the ruhr valley the industrial heartland of germany of course no german should sit on the ruhr s governing commission in fact no germans should be left in the ruhr at all the people would not be under alien rule because they would not be there their places would be taken by french belgian dutch and other workers morgenthau planned to put the 5 million industrial workers his plan displaced from their jobs to work on farms bringing the total agricultural labor force up to 14 000 000 without mentioning the fact that german agriculture was incapable of feeding its population even using modern industrial methods morgenthau s plan amounted in other words to the deliberate starvation of 20 percent of the german people during the run up to the attack on nordstream americans were subjected to a concerted attempt to rehabilitate morgenthau in addition to ken burns documentary the u s and the holocaust politico published an article on morgenthau based on a forthcoming biography by andrew meier claiming that he used his close ties with roosevelt to expose rampant antisemitism in the state department that thwarted america s efforts to provide refuge for jews imperiled by hitler according to the same article morgenthau functioned as franklin s conscience in thwarting an anti immigrant old guard at the state department america first isolationists on capitol hill and enraged zionist leaders desperate for the attention of the white house missing from the politico article is any mention of the opposition of the state department anti semites to the morgenthau plan which allowed roosevelt s secretary of the treasury to present a plan for the post war treatment of german a fantastically complicated subject for which morgenthau had no training at all anthony eden the british foreign secretary and cordell hull the u s secretary of state were both horrified at the plan as were ex president herbert hoover and the american people when they found out about it both hull and u s secretary of war henry l stimson knew that the morgenthau plan would mean the deaths of some twenty million germans by starvation and exposure a german red cross official had predicted an infant mortality rate of 80 90 per cent for winter 1945 46 amid scenes of desolation hard to believe in modern times germans are going to die like flies this winter there is going to be a definite age group elimination of the german population wikipedia says that the morgenthau plan was never implemented based on an overly literal reading of the fact that directive 1067 the government s name for the morgenthau plan got replaced by directive 1779 in the spring of 1947 after the germans had suffered through das hungerjahr of 1946 7 this claim ignores the fact that general dwight d eisenhower was an avid supporter of the morgenthau plan he was in the tent in england at the time of its inception and unlike morgethau he was in germany at the end of the war and in a position to implement it against the captured german soldiers he refused to declare prisoners of war by depriving them of food water and shelter in the notorious rheinwiesenlager even before the hungerwinterof 1946 47 when the morgenthau boys were busy starving german civilians to death eisenhower supported the genocidal morgenthau plan from its inception in august 1944 even though it caused quarrels among the western allies because they feared the communists would exploit the misery the morgenthau plan would create in germany fred smith one of morgenthau s aides who was in the tent when the plan was hatched in southern england on august 7 1944 reported that eisenhower was if anything more eager to implement morgenthau s genocidal plan than morgenthau himself eisenhower like morgenthau felt that the german people not just the nazis were guilty of supporting the regime and that made them a party to the entire german project and he personally would like to see things made good and hard for them for a while he pointed out that talk of letting germany off easy after taking care of the top people came from those who feared russia and wanted to strengthen germany as a potential bulwark against any desires russia might someday have as a consequence of the morgenthau plan well over sixty million people were deliberately pushed to the edge of death by starvation in hamburg in 1946 in the british zone of occupation one touring british writer said that about 100 000 people were in the last stages of starvation with hunger oedema in düsseldorf and many other cities people lived like rats in a few square feet of wet basement under a heap of rubble during a visit to germany in 1946 the jewish philanthropist and publisher victor gollancz witnessed the living conditions of the germans the mother came back while we were there it was 10 30 and she had been queuing for bread since early morning and had returned empty handed bread nowhere one of the children was still in bed none had yet had anything to eat as the last bread had gone yesterday the father was a prisoner of war in russia two of the children had tb there was a tiny stove but no coal or gas only a little wood which they fetched for excretion they used a pail which they emptied every morning into a hole they had dug in the courtyard above they had twice been bombed out on one wall was a small faded photograph of the mother and father at their wedding and on another some prince or king with the legend lerne leiden ohne zu klagen learn to suffer without complaining gollancz visited more residences like this some of which were decorated with crucifixes and in some he found people who were nevertheless cheerful all of them were grateful terribly grateful when they were given something the deaths of children with tb was already nearly three times the pre war rate in düsseldorf about one third of the children in iserlohn had tb proof that eisenhower s ruthless treatment of the german soldiers was in fact his implementation of the morgenthau plan can be deduced from the fact that he began to carry it out on his own initiative in 1944 a year before the germans surrendered the first to suffer were the german prisoners american prison camps under eisenhower s command in france were kept far below the standards set by the geneva convention these camps were described by lt col henry w allard who was in charge of the us camps in france in 1945 the standards of pw camps in the comz in europe compare as only slightly better or even with the living conditions of the japanese pw camps our men tell us about and unfavourably with the germans to maintain such camps was a war crime punishable by death according to the americans after the war they shot japanese general masaharu homma in 1946 for maintaining camps in approximately the conditions described by allard shortly after germany surrendered on 8 may 1945 eisenhower sent out an urgent courier throughout the huge area that he commanded making it a crime punishable by death for german civilians to feed prisoners it was even a death penalty crime to gather food together in one place to take it to prisoners eisenhower s order specified that under no circumstances may food supplies be assembled among the local inhabitants in order to deliver them to the prisoners of war those who violate this command and nevertheless try to circumvent this blockade to allow something to come to the prisoners place themselves in danger of being shot martin brech who served as a guard at the camp at andernach in 1945 testified that he was told by an officer that it is our policy that these men not be fed that meant that the 50 000 to 60 000 men who were held in andernach were starving living with no shelter in holes in the ground trying to nourish themselves on grass brech also confirmed that eisenhower s terror policy was harshly enforced down to the lowest level of camp guard at the time that brech was ordered to stop feeding prisoners on pain of being shot himself it scarcely seemed credible to him that the army intended these prisoners to die now seeing the new evidence in 1995 brech has said that it is clear that in fact it was the policy to shoot any civilians trying to feed the prisoners german prisoner hanns scharf watched as a woman and her two children attempted to bring wine into the camp at bad kreuznach she asked the american guard to give the bottle to her husband who was just inside the wire the guard upended the bottle into his own mouth and when it was empty threw it on the ground and killed the prisoner with five shots most german civilians died from lack of food when world production of food was 97 percent pre war levels and food from german civilians was being burned outside of the camps to prevent popular outrage the germans were told that the famine was worldwide yet they were dying seventeen months to five years after the german surrender while at the same time they were prevented from receiving charitable help and from earning their own bread they went on dying while world food production climbed ever higher the great majority of the dead germans were women children and very old men the allies continued to deprive german women and children of food that was readily available foreign relief agencies were prevented from sending food from abroad red cross food trains were sent back to switzerland all foreign governments were denied permission to send food to german civilians fertilizer production was sharply reduced and food was confiscated during the first year especially in the french zone the fishing fleet was kept in port while people starved british soldiers actually blew up one fishing boat in front of the eyes of astonished germans the deliberate starvation of the german people outraged americans like u s senator kenneth wherry who exclaimed to the truman administration that food was not scarce for there was plenty in the civilian and the military stores the truth is that there are thousands upon thousands of tons of military rations in our surplus stockpiles that have been spoiling right in the midst of starving populations at another point wherry said the american people should know they are being made the unwilling accomplices in the crime of mass starvation germany is the only nation where unrra is not permitted to feed its nationals germany is the only nation subjected to a deliberate starvation policy of 1 500 calories per day at the same time that the americans were depriving the german people of food they were engaged in a massive looting operation which seized between 4 8 billion and 12 billion in intellectual property alone apart from the seizure of foreign assets and shipping and the machinery food timber and coal that flowed out east and west for 50 years evidence documenting allied atrocities committed against the german people was buried both figuratively in the archives and literally in the meadows which housed the camps former prisoners at the rheinwiesenlager are now actively involved in trying to uncover the truth behind the historical forgeries which have been accepted as real up to now sometimes the discoveries are more literal as when excavations for a new power plant at lambach in austria in early 1996 revealed a mass grave on an 80m square site near the river traun revelations like this demand increased repression of the sort which happened when west german farmer otto tullius was prevented by the police from digging his own land for evidence of prisoners on the site of a former american french camp whether the flooding which occurred in july 2021 actually uncovered the bones of the soldiers that eisenhower starved to death was irrelevant compared to the psychic threat any exhumation of the past posed to those whose grip on political power was based on repression of the truth about what really happened to the german people after world war ii over the course of the summer of 1945 patton began to have second thoughts about the enemy he had just defeated and the allies who had contributed to america s victory over nazi germany now that the war was over the american press had found a new enemy in general patton when he told reporters in a press conference in regensburg on may 8 1945 that he planned to treat captured ss troops no differently than other german pows because ss means no more in germany than being a democrat in america america s best general was crucified in the press despite the fact that he asked not to be quoted during the same summer of 1945 eisenhower dragooned patton into implementing the morgethau plan which involved driving germans out of the few dwellings that were left habitable after the allied bombing campaign to make room for more than a million jewish dps in his diary patton noted today we received orders in which we were told to give the jews special accommodations if for jews why not catholics mormons etc we are also turning over to the french several hundred thousand prisoners of war to be used as slave labor in france it is amusing to recall that we fought the revolution in defense of the rights of man and the civil war to abolish slavery and have now gone back on both principles patton s anglo saxon sense of fair play was outraged as well by the nuremberg trials which seemed determined in combination with the morgenthau plan to treat every german who survived the war as war criminal in a letter which was dated september 14 1945 patton told his wife i am frankly opposed to this war criminal stuff it is not cricket and is semitic i am also opposed to sending pows to work as slaves in foreign lands i e the soviet union s gulags where many will be starved to death as his comment indicates the common denominator uniting the policies he was being forced to implement was the jewish desire for revenge against the german people in another letter to his wife he wrote i have been at frankfurt for a civil government conference if what we are doing to the germans is liberty then give me death i can t see how americans can sink so low it is semitic and i am sure of it as a newly created administrator of the country he had just conquered patton was forced to deal with the soviet army in a much more concrete way than when he was a general he soon began to make invidious comparisons between former enemies and current allies on july 21 1945 he told his wife that berlin gave me the blues we have destroyed what could have been a good race and we are about to replace them with mongolian savages and all europe will be communist it s said that for the first week after they took it berlin all women who ran were shot and those who did not were raped i could have taken it instead of the soviets had i been allowed patton became convinced that the military victory he achieved had simply enabled the communist takeover of eastern europe and that that takeover was simply the prelude to allowing stalin to swallow the rest of europe after the war with the help of jews like morgenthau and his assistant harry dexter white another jew who also happened to be a spy for the soviet union on august 31 he wrote actually the germans are the only decent people left in europe it s a choice between them and the russians i prefer the germans and on september 2 what we are doing is to destroy the only semi modern state in europe so that russia can swallow the whole on september 22 the press launched another campaign to portray patton as a crypto nazi and at this point the scales fell from his eyes in a diary entry dated the evening of the same day patton concluded that there is a very apparent semitic influence in the press they are trying to do two things first implement communism and second see that all businessmen of german ancestry and non jewish antecedents are thrown out of their jobs they have utterly lost the anglo saxon conception of justice and feel that a man can be kicked out because somebody else says he is a nazi they were evidently quite shocked when i told them i would kick nobody out without the successful proof of guilt before a court of law another point which the press harped on was the fact that we were doing too much for the germans to the detriment of the dp s most of whom are jews i could not give the answer to that one because the answer is that in my opinion and that of most nonpolitical officers it is vitally necessary for us to build germany up now as a buffer state against russia in fact i am afraid we have waited too long reacting to the press campaign against patton eisenhower decided to remove him from his duties as military governor and kick him upstairs by giving him command of the fifteenth army as a result of what he now saw as a jewish conspiracy against him and the fact that his military superiors were part of it patton made up his mind to resign his military commission and take his case to the american people patton died in a hospital in december 1945 under circumstances which indicated that the fix was already in america would get its war hero president but that president would be dwight d eisenhower who would gain political office with the help of c d jackson and the hollywood cia cabal which had created the holocaust narrative to exonerate him from the war crimes he had committed as administrator of the rheinwiesenlager in the wake of the cia attack on the nordstream pipelines germany now faces a replay of das hungerjahr of 1946 7 as the already cited rand report makes clear the green party is implementing the same policy of energy starvation and de industrialization which treasury secretary morgenthau proposed as the best way to prevent germany from starting a world war iii after the initial shock wore off germans began to connect the dots in a cautious but unprecedented manner as if reluctant to broach a subject that could land him in prison eugyppius mentioned the hungerwinter of 1946 7 and claimed that the greens gave their approval to the attack on nordstream to eliminate political pressure from the german voters the americans were emboldened to attack the pipeline because they were confident that seven generations of jewish vengeance and social engineering had rendered the german population so docile that they were willing to collaborate like sleepwalkers in their own extinction ralph schoelhammer claimed that the attack meant götterdämmerung for the old continent he attributed the general absence of outrage in germany to a mixture of external pressure and internal stupidity without mentioning the fact that the greens attitude toward the pipeline is the fulfillment of the morgenthau plan schoelhammer however did advert to das hungerjahr and the morgenthau plan indirectly when he claimed that there might be actual real famines in europe is food rationing possible in a world war ii scenario yes i think so responding to schoelhammer host clayton morris claimed that we need to study our history but any understanding of historical continuity in american german relations was missing from the discussion identifying the main vehicle of continuity between the winter of 1946 7 and the winter of 2022 3 was illegal because it involved a discussion of jewish influence in recent german history the main instrument which created a nation of sleepwalkers was the sexual corruption of german morals which began with the currency reform of 1948 when the state department abandoned morgenthau s attempt to starve the germans to death and opted for ruthless social engineering instead the results of the so called synodal weg recently issued by the german catholic bishops indicates that sexual deviance has taken up residence at the highest levels of the church sweet are the uses of adversity the main vehicle which god has decreed for the rise in consciousness is suffering because suffering clears the mind and in this particular instance it allows for a repudiation of the decadence for which germany is notorious and a return to the christianity which the germans abandoned when they became willing accomplices to their enslavement to sexual vice in 1890 at a time when the catholic church felt free to discuss the jewish question the editors of civilta cattolica the official magazine of the vatican pointed out the solution to germany s current crisis when they wrote that there will be no cure to the ills which plague europe as long as there are governments which continue to replace the ten commandments the faith and the gospel of christ with the principles glorified by the french revolution if the christian societies having been removed from the church of jesus christ won t return to her they will wait in vain for their liberation from the jews what was true then for the french in the wake of the revolution of 1789 is a fortiori true for the germans today as long as sin will endure punishment also will endure and even intensify the attack on the nordstream pipelines has shown beyond any shadow of a doubt that goal of the jewish social engineering which got imposed on germany after world war ii was not the rehabilitation of the german people but their extinction pipes can be repaired but only if germany abandons its servitude to the gay disco otherwise known as the american empire germany needs to leave nato and make peace with russia but she can only muster the courage to take such a monumental step if she returns to her christian roots until that happens germania delenda est will remain germany s fate read more now the morgenthau plan for the kiddies with peace nobel prizes though not implemented was an extension of the battles between the anglo saxons and the germans it is worthy to note that history as written by the boasting winners is nearly always false for example contrary to the official narrative ww1 was an english conspiracy inculding cecil rhodes to prevent germany walking on the british empire s toes as well the anglo saxon zionist us empire worked deviously hard to prevent an alliance between germany and russia the war criminals are not russian they are those who have blown up the gas pipelines we also know the conspiracy of the anglo sazons to conquer the heartland ukraine s trouble is alos part of this plan after ww2 the us empire chose to absorb germany as a vassal and control the french the us and the french rarely see eye to eye except for the morons like sarkozy and macron via the eu which is controlled by agents of the empire merkel was walking the fine line between the us empire and russia olaf is an idiot what s next russia won t loose but the us empire is trying hard to prevent a russian victory in ukraine so far some pundit think that putin has misread the situation and should have gone harder but as we say here putin is kind and does not want to kill people free julian assange now

you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel from pure vanilla pe deals bain capital is expanding its scope and asset classes in india to include credit real estate stressed special situations and bad loans having deployed 2 billion in last 12 months bain wants to see india at the top of its deal heap in his recent trip to india gross loh managing partner bain capital asia amit chandra chairman bain capital india and pavninder singh md pe bain capital spoke to et s arijit barman bodhisatva ganguli for an exclusive interview edited excerpts we have a hybrid fund structure which is comprised of regional funds as well as a global fund and that actually gives us more flexibility we can therefore do mid size deals but also do some of the biggest of big deals we ve done the largest deal in asia pacific which was kioxia which is the former toshiba memory business a 19 20 billion dollar deal we think that flexibility is important to be able to address all the full set of opportunities in the asian market for example in our fourth asian fund we invested in jm baxi which you know was less than a 200 million india deal but also in citius tech which was over 800 million and one of the larger ones in the recent times and we did the latter in partnership with our global fund very few peers have a pan asian platform like ours or this hybrid structure europe s facing a number of a number of challenges both geopolitical and macroeconomic the us also in many ways is seeing a macroeconomic paradigm shift for a long time there was a paradigm of quantitative easing with low interest rates and ever rising equity markets now we are shifting into a very different environment with higher inflation higher interest rates and potentially more sustained challenges in the equity markets asia is different partially because it is diverse many of the markets and countries in asia are not necessarily correlated with one another nor are they fully correlated to the us and europe not to say that they re completely immune from global issues but they have different cycles and they are also relatively large and have strong domestic markets that can keep them going take a country like japan for example you know it used to be the case that japan was very export driven market but now it s got a large domestic economy and has a big saving surplus and so it doesn t have the same peaks and troughs that you might otherwise have seen i m sure we ll talk a lot about india but you know india is benefiting from a number of secular trends and some structural changes in the economy these are beginning to pay dividends and also helping is the fact that india didn t have the same scale of fiscal and monetary response to covid separately some of the asian economies came out of covid later and so there s still some rebounding in progress so some geographies like japan are still not at their pre covid levels of economic activity and so there s still kind of rebound potential i think india has the potential to show the highest growth in gdp in the next 12 months maybe anywhere i might be missing some small country but 6 8 gdp growth at india s scale will be unique and china s certainly not going to grow at that level i think despite some headwinds on trade imbalance and current account deficit india s macro economic situation is improving and is poised to structurally improve further with the china plus one strategy and the manufacturing push via pli type programmes well the challenge obviously is that the cost of capital locally has always been quite high as has been depreciation over time and so we ve selectively used hedging the currency whenever it made sense however i think for our india investments it also has been more of the portfolio approach of how you do balance of investments that are structurally short on the rupee since a lot of the it services pharma export manufacturing export benefit if the rupee depreciates we have selectively focused there currencies across asia have been quite volatile japan which everyone thought was quite a stable currency has seen a lot of volatility as well recently compared to the japanese yen or the australian dollar for example the rupee has remained quite flat over the last five years the first thing i d say is it s early the first thrust was geopolitical with trump and china and then you had covid which caused people to really rethink supply chain diversity so it s all been pretty recent i would say perhaps some countries in southeast asia were the first to benefit but mainly that was because they already had plants on the ground so it was about taking their capacity utilization from 70 to a hundred percent and maybe building a bigger plant where one already existed whereas in the case of india it is about building afresh new buildings new facilities some countries in southeast asia that infrastructure was already in place and so was the government support for capital intensive industries and like semiconductors malaysia and singapore for example have had pretty well developed government subsidy and support programs for semiconductor facilities people do realise india is a huge market in its own right so unlike many of the asian tigers that thrive on exports in india you could be making for both india as well as the world i think it is increasingly doing so it is a well funded programme that the government is committed to and is focussed on hi tech and manufacturing companies so yes people have taken note and there is a chatter but these are early days many are commitments and some have just broken ground just as we speak right if you just extrapolate the commitments there will be a meaningful lift on virtually everything starting from gdp to jobs and new ecosystems will get built electronics is a good case in point where by our estimates india is going to leapfrog from 18 20 billion to 80 billion over last 5 years and that number based on all the commitments could go up 4 5 times over the next 5 years these are quantum shifts that we are seeing which will actually spur very interesting opportunities and will bring down the trade deficit oil and fertiliser are the two headwinds that can upset the maths but then again oil is coming down though gas prices are high and are negating the gains that is a separate pool of capital and both are investing simultaneously in india the bain piramal india rf fund first fund was around 650 million is nearly fully deployed and has done really well so they have had good deal flow and a few good exits with a few more coming up there will always be opportunity in that space in such a huge banking system it s in fact much tougher for mainstream investing where even in times of strong growth you know it is pretty crowded india rf is thinking of a much larger new fund i think in the case of india there could be some secondary effects from global markets hitting indian companies and you might also have some businesses that are particularly dependent upon healthy export markets to survive or are more exposed to commodity prices therefore there will be some pressures in pockets of a large system and some companies m me ay need some form of capital to grow or in the form of rescue capital or it could be stressed or or distressed but the bigger point is the new bankruptcy code and all infrastructure around that is relatively new has made it all a transparent process a more streamlined process and is going to provide for a greater flow of actionable opportunities than what we ve seen in the last five years so even leaving aside any cyclical opportunities i think just the fact that now there are more companies could kind of take advantage of the bankruptcy code or i know and it is going to lead to more opportunities we have deployed 600 million 700 million in the last 12 months in special situations alone in india overall across pe special situations and other pools we ve deployed close to 2 billion in the same period bain capital credit is encompassing special situations they also have some other kinds of liquid credit like publicly traded high yield bonds but that s not very relevant to the india market but within that arm we have got ability to invest in both stressed and distressed type situations in the case of india we re doing that largely through this joint venture with the piramal group you have kind of mezzanine financing which would come at a higher rate types but would be junior financing and then you have these kind of structured equity solutions we talked about that are very bespoke to fit special need and then the opportunity to purchase some non performing loans from banks all those products are in what s called bain capital credit when we thought of india we started with pursuing private equity opportunities which includes buyouts and large minority positions the piramal jv which is more focused on stress and distressed and then the special situation s part of credit is that we talked about real estate will also be included included in that area to help you quantify we can say from the various global pools of capital 10 billion will be available for india to be deployed across asset classes over the next few years i would think it would go up and it would at least be at that level or grow based on the flow of activity we have been seeing in india with that kind of growth india is becoming more prominent for sure it s been a strong market and a strong contributor for sure ever since we started here we have had a pretty clear set of the industry sectors and the types of opportunities we also focused on those which were really good fits with our model that leverages our industry expertise are global platform deals like genpact and hero we have preferred deals where you needed to have strong local presence the ability to work closely with indian management teams but we could help them expand their global operations and help them expand their global sales in the case of genpact we really got to interact with the company both in india and the united states where the management was located and it was listed and it hit a sweet spot for our platform approach tech services and pharma emcure but i would add also say we like the deals we have done in financial services and industrials too from our perspective while we would have liked to see it do better we have done fine since we sold a small portion our stake in l t finance for most of our investment value long ago axis we came in at sub rs 600 share now it s around rs 750 importantly the bank is growing its book value in the mid teens and seeing strong growth now from the point of our entry to the point that we are today the fact that these companies actually leveraged the capital that we infused managed to survive a black swan event actually standing today with a much higher roe a much greater you know capital adequacy ratio ratio we must not forget that both these investments were hit by a black swan event in the form of covid which impacted the financial services sector the hardest it is not just an india question right this is just the nature of that type of investment whether it s the united states or any other geography i think you have to be incredibly clear on what your investment thesis is the company you are backing in terms of management and what s the level of engagement that that you re getting if it s too structured then there can be an overhang on the stock and so it s not necessarily always good for the ultimate outcome you re seeking but as one of the tools in the toolbox sometimes such structured solution could work but then again not all structures are created equal right i think some structures whether it s downside protection whether it s very sort of narrowly defined ways to bridge differences i think work but we ve generally not been fans of very broad structures cause we think they create a bit of misalignment between partners and often no one s happy at the end of the day so we ve tried to do transactions in a way where we have as perfect alignment as possible with our partner as opposed to highly structured deals so we do have a couple pools of capital that look at that part of the market and so there s bain capital ventures and bain capital technology opportunities ventures is doing more early stage venture deals traditional ones and technology opportunities would consider more growth kind of growth capital we are looking at opportunities in the asia region you know in the last several years valuation was a challenge for every geography again i m not singling out india because the united states and china had extremely high valuations i think we took a sceptical eye to those valuations everywhere and now you a major revision i think i think this could be a really interesting opportunity india s got an incredible number of innovative companies i think a number are going to need capital and so it s one of the sectors one of the sub strategies that we re that we re focused on i would say if we have deployed 2 billion in the last 12 months then 10 billion if not more it s a large economy we ve got the capital we have the capital base we have the people

the show m a s h was about saving people now fort myers beach has its own mash unit and it s about saving the island saving the community repumping life into its battered soul with town hall hammered by hurricane ian an encampment is becoming the government hub on the beach for awhile the center of activity mayor ray murphy said city hall is shot it s ruined like everywhere else murphy said what we have is we ve got a whole city hall complex command center being set up right next door he said the fire district owns the piece of the property of the former topps grocery store property that s one huge slab so all these assets have been coming in the contractors have set up all kinds of housing over there for people showers bathrooms offices trailers biden visits joe biden brings rebuilding help to hurricane ravaged swfl picking up the pieces amid rising death toll more glimmers of light in the ian aftermath for swfl fpl update most in swfl should have power back by weekend but not others murphy compares the setup to the popular cbs program that ran for 11 seasons and featured the most watched tv episode in the history of television you ve watched the show m a s h temporary camp that s what it s like people feeding everybody down there there s people bringing in supplies there s people bringing in water there s a lot going on it s like feeding an army it s like taking care of an army murphy said of the 24 hour operation it just goes on and on and on the crushing magnitude of last week s catastrophe can be measured by the level of expertise that president biden has sent to fort myers beach they were at katrina they were at oklahoma city they were at the world trade center in new york city murphy said not to mention the urban search rescue us r task force established under fema s authority the us r teams alone are hundreds of guys there s a lot of assets down on the beach when you start talking about law enforcement from all over the state that comes in from the various counties from the various sheriffs various persons that are assisting you re talking about fire units from all over the state the search and rescue guys i guess it could very well be in the thousands and in a meeting with biden during wednesday afternoon s visit the president told him help would keep coming he assured us he would be there for us and wouldn t leave us that was music to our ears yes indeed murphy said when you have the president reassuring and that he s got your back it doesn t get any better than that the biggest message i got out of it is reassurance that he was going to stay with us and if that meant that fema would have to be extended for longer periods of time that they certainly were going to do that federal officials say fort myers beach damaged much worse than mexico beach was by hurricane michael the assistance is key for a rebuilding fort myers beach which had 7 000 full time residents before hurricane ian that s huge to a small community like ours murphy said just the trash removal and the stuff could gut our budget it s a monumental undertaking that we re looking at and he s reassured us that he ll be there for us the scale of the damage is so immense so widespread that federal experts quantified it for him what they re calling us mexico beach times eight or mexico beach times seven murphy said we re kind of that devastation that many times more in the panhandle s mexico beach 1 584 of 1 692 buildings were damaged by a category 5 storm in 2018 and 809 of those were destroyed according to the national hurricane center fort myers beach fire marshal jennifer campbell put it this way when it comes to her island of 10 400 housing units absolute devastation there s barely anything left i got an aerial tour of fort myers beach said jared moskowitz former director of the state division of emergency management most of it will need to be completely rebuilt this one is off the charts murphy said just like mexico beach during hurricane michael when they took those aerials all those hundreds and hundreds of buildings that were knocked down every once in awhile you d see one structure standing why because it was made of concrete block reinforced concrete murphy said the same thing happened in this storm on fort myers beach all the newer constructed buildings they did exactly what they were supposed to do the surge came in it blew out the bottom the bottom of the building that s enclosed but there s nothing down there and the rest of the building stood fine on the pilings and the house above that s the beauty of the newer construction that s what happened anything that was made out of sticks and two by fours all that they re gone why can t fort myers beach residents return yet murphy wouldn t speculate on how many of the 54 official southwest florida deaths as of thursday afternoon occurred on the island from ian and the state s data is incomplete it s brutal it s brutal murphy said it s been a tough little stretch here it is all about dignity dignity for the deceased dignity for the families and that s a main reason residents haven t been allowed on the island yet by the authority of fema and the beach fire department murphy said they closed the island until they re done with the search they are completing the work they have to do and at this point that s recovering the bodies he said i do talk to these guys see them daily and it s a few more days a few more days a few more days you know i can t nail them down but on the other hand as much as i want to know to be able to tell people it s their call it s their schedule they re getting closer and closer from what i understand as soon as they give us the word that they re done we can go in there with our equipment and start removing things then we can start letting our people back on the island until we get that word from them it s their call and leaders are considering concepts to try for a smooth transition along the roughed up two lane lifeline of estero boulevard i m hoping that we can set up some sort of trolley system whereby we d have maybe two three four of those running up and down the island murphy said they can go back into their homes take pictures pull stuff out do whatever they want to do and then get them back out there are some logistics that have to be worked out in that respect because if we just open it up willy nilly to everybody and their brother to come down there it ll be as bad as the boulevard during the peak hours there s just so many people down there working i ve never seen anything like this before and that s where that patience business comes in again you just have to remain patient he knows that isn t easy for pained residents who have lost everything or nearly all i m constantly reassuring people do hang in there be patient it is going to get better that s our job that s my job to keep people s spirits up keep people engaged i don t want despair to set in it could easily fall into despair in this situation the devastation that we ve encountered out there you could easily fall into that i m trying to keep people s spirits up i m trying to keep them patient be patient with the process it s all going to work out it s just keep moving keep moving forward keep moving forward power still out in fort myers beach but lee county slowly coming back successes and milestones will be measured differently for the beach than the less damaged areas of southwest florida you have to take them where you get them murphy said biden s visit was one of them i m sure this whole recovery process will be marked by days like this but this was huge even though there is no power on the island he is encouraged that more in the rest of the region are getting electricity back as of thursday afternoon collier was down to 2 7 in the dark while lee was at 28 however it s only 6 of florida power light s lee customers and murphy said a lot of those are on the island the next thing i can see is fpl trucks down here there will be an army of them down here said murphy who was scheduled to meet with fpl ceo eric silagy on the island thursday that grid they ll be working on that that was encouraging fpl s outages from across the state due to ian are down to 2 allowing the utility to focus its 21 000 member team on areas such as fort myers beach as we continue to collapse resources in from all the counties we have restored we re moving people and moving equipment across the state and collapsing them into southwest florida opening up these staging sites and putting more resources to bear on rebuilding that system said silagy who has conceded it could be months before all have power there are pockets that need our help for a long period of time the owners of margaritaville which by comparison didn t receive as much damage have vowed to move forward in construction others were not as fortunate everybody from cottages of paradise point is safe but cottages of paradise point is no more it has been destroyed said dennis greenspon who ran the rental community on the beach s north side with his wife lisa we will miss all the close friendships that we have formed over the past 20 years we will not be rebuilding cottages of paradise point is now a beautiful cherished memory fort myers beach mayor optimistic about rebuilding we re getting through it one day at a time murphy remains optimistic remembering when he first ran for office some 25 years ago and was asked whether there was one thing he could change about the beach if he could turn back the clock we all love it the way it is but there is one thing that i would do differently i said i would try to bring the building stock up from the 1930s and 1940s and 50s up to the 1990s and that was back then he recalled all the old stuff the existing stuff that was still standing was vulnerable and that was never more demonstrated than it was eight days ago punta gorda was able to rebuild its community into more of a destination after hurricane charley s 2004 destruction but fort myers beach faces a larger redo we re getting through it one day at a time said murphy who like four of the five town council members lost their homes or close to it as you say it s an opportunity it s an opportunity to start off with a fresh palette and recreate the beach the way everybody wants it it could be fantastic and i look forward to it based at the naples daily news phil fernandez pfernandez gannett com writes the in the know column as part of the usa today network which supplemented this report

shanghai oct 10 smm according to media reports lme launched a discussion paper on the possibility and conditions of banning new deliveries of russian metals china securities pointed out that this sanction was likely to change the global supply demand structure of aluminium if the russian aluminium companies are prohibited from lme the suppression on aluminium prices might be lifted at the same time the aluminium smelters in southwest china continued to reduce the production which will not resume the normal level until the middle of 2023 at the same time overseas aluminium smelters already suffered substantial losses and further decline in aluminium prices will jeopardising their following operation therefore it is expected that aluminium prices will begin to rise russia is rich in mineral resources and a major producer of metals in particular it supplies 5 8 aluminium worldwide with trades accounting for about 12 in addition rusal is the largest supplier of aluminium for europe as 40 of european aluminium supplies come from rusal the current fall in aluminium prices was mainly attributed to the weaker demand for lme aluminium from europe meanwhile the market participants were worried that the stocks of rusal s undelivered long term orders will be delivered to lme warehouses further weighing on the lme prices the continuous weakening of lme prices has led to the opening of china s import window for aluminium ingots which was the major reason for dropping shfe aluminium prices despite the constantly falling domestic aluminium inventories smm data shows that the overseas aluminium capacity cuts during 2021 2022 amounted to 1 476 million mt according to the international aluminium association iai the global aluminium output with china excluded was down 1 in the first seven months of 2022 among them aluminium output in western europe slumped by 11 year on year and annualised run rates are now consistently below the 3 million mt for the first time since this century the aluminium output in north america dropped 5 1 over the same timeframe the increase in south american output was overshadowed by the output cuts in western europe and america huatai securities said that as the prices of electricity and natural gas in europe remained high the overseas aluminium smelters were forced to shut down due to high costs from 2021 to 2022 the cumulative overseas production reduction may reach 1 35 million mt accounting for about 1 7 of global production capacity what s worse the chances are little that the production will recover in the short term and more cuts are still likely according to citic securities the growth rate of aluminium supply slowed down significantly due to factors such as overseas energy crisis unexpected production reduction of domestic aluminium smelters and the shortage of power supply although the demand for aluminium is at the seasonal low it is likely to rise driven by the increasing consumption in the fields of automobile photovoltaics and power grid therefore the aluminium prices are expected to grow in the future

from september 24 to 27 the socialist equality party in australia held its sixth national congress after extensive discussion the following resolution and three others were unanimously adopted the wsws will publish the other resolutions over the coming weeks 1 american imperialism aided and abetted by all its allies including australian imperialism is plunging the world headlong into a global conflict between nuclear armed powers that threatens the very existence of humanity the escalating military conflict in ukraine instigated by the united states is neither isolated nor temporary it is the opening front of a war to not only fragment and subjugate russia but achieve its longstanding ambition of dominion over the eurasian landmass and its vast human and natural resources even as the us and nato fuel the war in europe by funnelling tens of billions in arms to their far right ukrainian allies the biden administration is deliberately stoking a second front on the other side of eurasia against china by threatening to incorporate taiwan into its web of alliances every country and every corner of the globe is being drawn into this geo political maelstrom 2 the socialist equality party sep joins with its sister parties of the international committee of the fourth international icfi in fighting to build a unified anti war movement of the international working class as the only means for ending the conflict in ukraine and preventing a nuclear holocaust the war will not be stopped through moral and pacifist appeals because it is rooted in the immense economic social and political crisis of capitalism intensified by the global covid 19 pandemic that is wracking every country the same crisis however is fuelling the class struggle as workers are driven to resist the efforts of the ruling class to make deeper and deeper inroads into living conditions including to pay for the escalating arms race and the broader impact of the war the sep will strive to imbue the working class with the understanding that its immediate struggles to defend wages and conditions are inexorably bound up with a unified political fight against imperialist war and for the abolition of capitalism ukrainian tanks move down a street in irpin on the outskirts of kyiv ukraine monday april 11 2022 3 the sep rejects with contempt the farrago of lies and misinformation spewing from washington its allies and the media to justify the proxy war with russia the us and nato are not responding to unprovoked russian aggression nor are they defending ukrainian democracy rather us imperialism is using the neo nazi infested ukrainian regime to weaken russia and bring down putin s government with utter indifference to the death and suffering inflicted on the ukrainian and russian peoples 4 the war against russia can be traced to the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 and the consequent us drive to seize the unipolar moment to reverse its historic decline through military means and establish its untrammelled global dominance the us led invasion of iraq in 1991 has been followed by one neo colonial war after another intensified through the war on terror after 2001 aimed in particular at monopolising the vast energy resources of the middle east and central asia and thereby controlling supplies to rival powers three decades of war have produced a series of disasters for us imperialism including in afghanistan iraq syria and libya far from pulling back however the united states is doubling down the war on terror has been pushed into the background as the pentagon openly prepares for great power conflict in the first instance this means weakening breaking up and subordinating russia while simultaneously preparing for war against china 5 the global covid 19 pandemic the criminal let it rip response of the ruling classes and the resultant worsening economic and financial crisis internationally have greatly intensified both geo political and internal social tensions at the heart of world imperialism washington is driven with utter recklessness to risk nuclear war to not only advance its predatory ambitions on the world stage but to divert enormous social tensions at home outward and justify the suppression of the rapidly emerging struggles of the working class 6 as lenin explained in his works on imperialism written amid the death and destruction of world war i imperialism is not simply a policy that can be reversed it is a definite stage in the evolution of capitalism that of monopoly capitalism parasitic or decaying capitalism moribund capitalism in which finance capital has asserted its domination of the world market any temporary agreement between imperialist powers for the peaceful sharing of the spoils inevitably gives way to imperialist conflicts and wars for the division and redivision of the world 7 at the most fundamental level the driving forces for war are rooted in the irresolvable contradictions of capitalism between world economy and the reactionary division of the world into competing nation states on the one hand and socialised production and the private ownership of the means of production on the other these contradictions erupted in two catastrophic world wars in the 20th century and now threaten a third global conflagration with all the imperialist powers rapidly remilitarising the globalisation of production over the past four decades has not lessened but exacerbated these contradictions the world remains within the epoch of imperialism that led to the eruption of world war i characterised by trotsky as the death agony of capitalism and is hurtling toward disaster unless the international working class puts an end to this outmoded and reactionary social order 8 while the war in europe has been instigated by us imperialism the sep unequivocally opposes the russian invasion of ukraine the socialist equality party us explained in the resolution mobilise the working class against imperialist war adopted at its 2022 national congress our opposition to russia s invasion is from the socialist left not the imperialist right it stated while rejecting claims that russia is imperialist a definition embraced by the pseudo left agents of the pentagon and nato to legitimize their support for the proxy war the sep gives no support whatsoever to the national defence policies of the reactionary russian ruling class that came to power through the dissolution of the soviet union in 1990 91 and the systematic plundering of its assets putin himself stands atop a semi bonapartist autocratic regime that rules precariously over a country seething with social contradictions as the war waged by the us and nato is a continuation of imperialist expansion the invasion of ukraine is a continuation of the reactionary policies of the russian oligarchy and its repudiation of the entire progressive heritage of the russian revolution and of the democratic principles embodied in the original founding of the union of soviet socialist republics in 1922 the encirclement of russia by imperialism is the disastrous outcome of the stalinist regime s final betrayal of the legacy of the october revolution australian imperialism a frontline state in us led wars 9 the australian government both previously under the liberal national coalition and today under the labor party has given its full support to the us nato war against russia and has made the largest military contribution of any non nato ally to assisting and arming ukrainian forces at the same time the labor government of anthony albanese is accelerating australian imperialism s military build up and integration into the decade long us preparations for war against china 10 australia s centrality to pentagon strategy is underscored by its longstanding military alliance with the us and membership of the top level five eyes intelligence network it has been further strengthened more recently by the biden administration s revival and elevation of the quadrilateral security dialogue quad with india japan and australia and the establishment of the aukus pact between the us britain and australia moreover australia along with new zealand plays an essential role in policing and countering chinese influence in the tiny island states of the southwest pacific which have a strategic significance far outweighing their size in the event of a us led war with china and or russia australia would automatically be involved as it hosts key us bases such as the pine gap satellite tracking station which are irreplaceable components of us global military operations and make the country a prime target for nuclear attack president joe biden right shakes hands with australian prime minister anthony albanese during the quad leaders summit meeting at kantei palace tuesday may 24 2022 in tokyo 11 australian imperialism however is not simply a puppet of the united states and has its own independent strategic and economic interests the latter include significant stakes in multi billion dollar energy and mineral reserves within the formerly colonised countries in australia s immediate region including gas in east timor oil and gas in papua new guinea gold in solomon islands and rare earth minerals across the region that are the target of the emerging deep sea mining industry australian governments have signed up to the us led confrontation with china the country s largest trading partner despite the inevitable damage to the country s economy for definite reasons australian imperialism due to its relative weakness has always relied on the major power of the day first britain then the us for assistance in prosecuting its interests and defending its patch in the southwest pacific and thus has actively supported the predatory wars of its more powerful partners australia is not only dependent on the us strategically but also economically the united states remains the largest source of investment in australia and access to wall street is essential for australian finance capital for the dominant sections of the ruling class the commitment to the us military alliance and therefore to a us led war with china is beyond question 12 moreover as in the united states the australian political establishment increasingly views war as the means of diverting mounting domestic social tensions outward against a foreign enemy the vilification of china is well underway with the continual outpouring of anti chinese propaganda the unprecedented anti foreign interference legislation passed with bipartisan support in 2018 provides the anti democratic legal framework to intimidate arrest and potentially round up chinese born citizens and residents as well as anyone opposed to the us war preparations against beijing 13 as the us increased tensions with china australian governments initially attempted to balance between the two powers but that came to an end in 2010 when labor prime minister kevin rudd was ousted in a us orchestrated inner party coup and replaced by julia gillard rudd was a staunch defender of the us australia military alliance but he advocated a deal between the us and china right at the point when obama was ramping up a confrontation with china on every front obama announced the pivot to asia in 2011 in an address to the australian parliament without a voice of opposition the critics within the political establishment of australia s integration into us war plans who reflect powerful sectional interests particularly those heavily reliant on mineral and agricultural exports to china have increasingly been silenced or sidelined the bipartisan support for the escalating us war drive against china is an expression above all of the dominant position of finance capital and its dependence on and integration into the us financial markets the looming us war with china 14 us imperialism regards china as the chief threat to its global hegemony the chinese economy is already larger than the american measured by purchasing parity power and is predicted to overtake it in absolute terms by the turn of the decade if not sooner moreover the us is fearful that china no longer simply functions as a vast cheap labour platform for american corporations but is challenging us predominance in multiple hi tech areas from 5g technology to green energy a us jet flies over the flight deck of the aircraft carrier uss ronald reagan credit us navy 15 the us has been preparing for conflict in the indo pacific for the past decade the obama administration s pivot to asia involved a comprehensive strategy aimed at aggressively isolating china diplomatically and economically while strengthening military alliances strategic partnerships and basing arrangements throughout asia this was accompanied by a huge military restructuring and build up throughout the region focussed on enabling the us to mount a massive air and missile attack on the chinese mainland accompanied by a naval blockade aimed at strangling the chinese economy trump heightened the confrontation with china by imposing massive trade sanctions that have been maintained by the biden administration at the same time the pentagon has mounted military provocations with increasing frequency in waters and airspace close to the chinese mainland under the false banner of freedom of navigation 16 having provoked military conflict with russia in ukraine the us has also turned to war with china biden following trump had already deliberately inflamed tensions with china over taiwan potentially the most explosive flashpoint in asia by increasing arms sales to taipei sailing us warships through the narrow taiwan strait and stationing american troops in taiwan for the first time in decades under the guise of defending taiwan the us is turning the island into a military trap for china in order to weaken destabilise and ultimately break up china 17 the us has been priming the trigger for war over taiwan step by step by eroding the one china policy that underpinned the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the us and china in 1979 the us de facto recognised beijing as the legitimate government of all china including taiwan broke diplomatic ties and ended its military alliance with taipei withdrawing all us military forces from the island now biden following trump has torn up longstanding diplomatic protocols authorising official contact with taipei at the highest levels all of this is encouraging taipei to declare formal independence from china a step that the us knows will lead to war taiwan is not only vital to china strategically but also economically given its dominant position in the global manufacture of semi conductors just what is at stake was underlined by us house speaker nancy pelosi s provocative visit to taiwan in august sparking the most dangerous confrontation in decades as chinese and us warships and warplanes faced off in waters surrounding the island 18 the sep rejects the utterly cynical claims by the us and its allies including the australian government that the preparations for war are to defend taiwan s vibrant democracy from chinese aggression time and again us imperialism has selectively exploited the banner of democracy and human rights to demonise political leaders and governments targeted for coups and military aggression while turning a blind eye to the gross abuses of human rights of its allies 19 the relentless vilification of china by the us and its allies proceeds across the board washington not only blames beijing for the covid 19 pandemic based on the lie that the virus was manufactured in a wuhan laboratory the us accuses china of destabilising the global economy through its zero covid strategy all of which is designed to obscure washington s own criminal let it rip policies the entire australian political and media establishment has joined this anti china propaganda war aimed at poisoning public opinion and creating the political climate for military conflict from the highly paid pundits of commercial and state owned media to the various strategic think tanks and academics linked to the intelligence and military apparatus and establishment politicians of every stripe 20 the us ambitions to break up russia into weak statelets referred to as decolonising russia finds its counterpart in the cynical championing of human rights in support of right wing separatist tendencies in xinjiang tibet hong kong and mongolia aimed at weakening and fragmenting china the us remains silent on the chief target of the vast chinese communist party ccp police apparatus the chinese working class which is the source of huge profits for american corporations the sep opposes the ccp s anti democratic methods but insists that democratic rights in china can be defended only through a unified movement of the working class aimed at overturning the ccp regime and abolishing the capitalist system that it has spawned since 1978 on the basis of a socialist and internationalist program 21 the role of the pseudo left organisations such as socialist alternative and socialist alliance in backing us and thus australian imperialism in the proxy war against russia is mirrored by their alignment with the us led preparations for war with china which they characterise as imperialist and expansionist the sep rejects the designation of russia and china as imperialist imperialism as both lenin and trotsky explained is the domination and expansion of finance capital that domination is based on the supremacy of the us dollar not the russian rouble or the chinese renminbi moreover financial power is in the hands of the banks and financial conglomerates of the us the uk the western european powers and japan as it has been since the emergence of imperialism at the beginning of the 20th century 22 the designation of russia and china as imperialist powers has no foundation in either economic or historical analysis but it does serve a very definite political purpose it is used in one way or another to minimise or cover up completely the central role of us imperialism in recklessly instigating a third world war it also serves to legitimise the us policy of decolonising russia and china by promoting the right to self determination for the so called oppressed nations within their borders no attempt is ever made to explain by what historical and economic processes these bureaucratically degenerated and deformed workers states have been transformed into imperialist powers indeed the weakness and vulnerability of china and russia in the face of the imperialist thuggery is underscored by the devastating impact on the russian economy of us orchestrated sanctions that effectively excluded russia from the international financial system the position of the pseudo lefts who represent privileged layers of the upper middle class in australia and internationally in favour of war against russia and china is the culmination of their backing for previous imperialist wars including against libya and syria 23 the ccp regime has no progressive response to the mounting us provocations that find their sharpest focus on taiwan sections of the bureaucratic apparatus continue to appeal for a deal with us imperialism even as it becomes ever plainer that washington demands nothing less than its complete economic and strategic subservience at the same time beijing is engaging in an arms race with washington that can only end in disaster not only for the chinese people but for humanity as a whole while it continues to maintain the fiction that it is building socialism with chinese characteristics the ccp has increasingly based itself on the promotion of chinese nationalism and chauvinism which only serves to divide the international working class the only social force capable of preventing world war the tasks of the sep 24 the same contradictions and crisis of world capitalism are also propelling the working class into struggle providing the basis for the building of an international anti war movement as the 2016 icfi statement entitled socialism and the fight against war explained imperialism seeks to save the capitalist order through war the working class seeks to resolve the global crisis through social revolution the strategy of the revolutionary party develops as the negation of imperialist nation state geopolitics the revolutionary party as trotsky explained follows not the war map but the map of the class struggle 25 the war against russia has already contributed to skyrocketing inflation and severe shortages of energy grains and other essentials this is fuelling mass protests and strikes in the advanced capitalist countries including the united states as well as in the less developed the acute social crisis is being exacerbated by the response of the central banks which have raised interest rates to induce recession and render millions jobless governments that have sacrificed the lives of millions to maintain corporate profits through their let it rip pandemic policy will not hesitate to sacrifice tens of millions more in an imperialist war for global domination the sep resolves to intervene aggressively in the struggles of the working class to build a powerful anti war movement in unity with workers and youth around the world the international youth and students for social equality iysse in australia will play a central role in building such an anti war movement in collaboration with iysses around the world a determined and persistent political fight must be waged on campuses particularly against the pro war pseudo left organisations to win students to the perspective of world socialist revolution and to turn them to the working class the only social force capable over overturning capitalism and preventing a catastrophic third world war 26 the 2016 icfi statement set out the fundamental political principles that must guide the anti war struggle the struggle against war must be based on the working class the great revolutionary force in society uniting behind it all progressive elements in the population the new anti war movement must be anti capitalist and socialist since there can be no serious struggle against war except in the fight to end the dictatorship of finance capital and the economic system that is the fundamental cause of militarism and war the new anti war movement must therefore of necessity be completely and unequivocally independent of and hostile to all political parties and organizations of the capitalist class the new anti war movement must above all be international mobilizing the vast power of the working class in a unified global struggle against imperialism the permanent war of the bourgeoisie must be answered with the perspective of permanent revolution by the working class the strategic goal of which is the abolition of the nation state system and the establishment of a world socialist federation this will make possible the rational planned development of global resources and on this basis the eradication of poverty and the raising of human culture to new heights 27 the sep demands an immediate end to the us nato war against russia as well as us led aggression and provocations against china all of which are being carried out behind the backs of the population we call for the immediate disbanding of all imperialist alliances including nato aukus the quad and the anzus pact between the us new zealand and australia the sep also calls for the liquidation of the entire military apparatus on which the australian government has already committed to spending more than 300 billion on armaments over the next decade on top of the growing annual defence budget these massive funds will be extracted from the working class through further deep inroads into social spending and living standards 28 the political struggle against war goes hand in hand with the defence of the democratic rights of working people which will come under increasingly ferocious attack as popular opposition to war mounts the persecution of wikileaks founder julian assange by us administrations in league with the australian british and swedish governments for exposing the war crimes and diplomatic intrigues of imperialism is a sharp warning that war will be accompanied by the shredding of basic democratic rights 29 the broad anti war sentiment among workers and youth has deep historic roots but lacks a political perspective program and leadership the task of the sep is to develop within the working class the understanding that the root cause of war lies in the profit system which is also the source of its class oppression in the process the sep aims to build a revolutionary leadership within the working class based on the fight for a workers government committed to the socialist reorganisation of society as a component part of the world socialist revolution

the ohio attorney general runs the largest public interest law firm in the state but democrat jeff crossman says incumbent republican dave yost uses the office for political fights rather than to serve all ohioans i think one of the real unfortunate or quite frankly reprehensible things that yost has done in that office is use that office for political purposes said crossman a state lawmaker from parma who is running against yost in the general election i completely and fundamentally disagree that that office should be used to file lawsuits based on political philosophy because as the attorney general you re supposed to represent all the people in the state not just the ones that agree with you politically yost noted that ohio led or joined 23 lawsuits against the federal government but skipped joining 16 other cases during his tenure as attorney general which started in 2019 yost said he is joining lawsuits that seek to push back against inappropriate use of presidential executive power to usurp congress the idea that because congress is divided like the country is divided that the president should just step in and become a monarch is to disassemble the american governance system i m against that yost said during yost s term as attorney general ohio joined a lawsuit that challenged vaccine mandates for federal contractors two lawsuits seeking to block the biden administration from enforcing rules against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation a lawsuit to overturn the federal ban on bump stocks a mechanism for converting firearms into machine gun like weapons the same day the u s supreme court struck down the constitutional right to abortion yost went to court to successfully get the stay lifted against ohio s six week abortion ban law weeks later he cast doubt on the existence of a 10 year old rape victim who traveled to indiana for an abortion yost also said the child could have received an abortion in ohio because state law provides exceptions for when the life of the mother or a major bodily function is at risk some medical experts disagree that the girl would have qualified for one of those exceptions no doctor is going to risk their license on a vaguely written exception that nobody has clarified crossman said yost countered first of all mr crossman is not a doctor or a prosecutor which calls into serious question his qualifications to say that secondly neither i nor he nor any other doctor in this state can offer an opinion you know why because we don t have a case file we don t have a medical history we don t have an examination yost has declined to offer an apology to the 10 year old or her family for questioning the existence of the case or her need to travel to indiana for an abortion i don t even know the 10 year old i ve never mentioned her he said who is dave yost yost 65 served as delaware county prosecutor and state auditor before beating steve dettelbach in the 2018 race for attorney general the ohio state university graduate worked as a newspaper reporter before jumping into politics and the law he earned his law degree from capital university i distrust power i distrust secrecy and i wanted to change the world for the better as corny as it sounds yost said of his career choices yost said the attorney general s office should be used to establish the rule of law for everyone no matter their status if elected to a second term yost said his priorities are increasing accountability for pharmacy benefit managers in medicaid continuing to fight against human trafficking and finding money for annual training for ohio s 35 000 sworn police officers yost maintains that annual training can t be mandated without funding he also supports reforms such as creating a police professional licensing program similar to licensing for doctors engineers and other professions he noted that it requires legislative action it wasn t on the top of the agenda this year apparently he said here is his position on other issues full abortion ban declined to say citing ongoing litigation eliminating training and checks to carry concealed weapons declined to say because his office represents the legislature which passed the new law legalizing recreational marijuana opposed establishing database of police shootings supports who is jeff crossman crossman earned his undergraduate degree from mount union university a master s degree from the university of akron and a law degree from cleveland marshall college of law initially he wanted to be a college professor but shifted to a legal career after he determined it would be a better opportunity to serve and address problems crossman 50 spent five years on the parma city council before joining the ohio house in january 2019 as a state lawmaker he was among 26 democrats who voted for republican larry householder to become speaker a vote he says he regrets and notes he called for householder s removal from office after he was indicted in a federal public corruption case if elected attorney general crossman said he d use the resources of the office to investigate public corruption householder and house bill 6 ohio can be number one in the country for opportunity like it used to be but it can t be number one for opportunity while it s number one in the country for corruption he said yost filed a civil lawsuit to block firstenergy from collecting fees from ohio consumers for two nuclear plants in northern ohio a move crossman called insufficient federal prosecutors are expected to reveal their corruption case in detail when householder and former ohio republican party chairman matt borges go to trial in january crossman concedes that federal authorities may have asked state officials to hold off on investigations but said that doesn t excuse the state attorney general who has specific jurisdiction the power of the office the resources to conduct their own independent investigation here is his position on other issues full abortion ban opposes eliminating training and checks to carry concealed weapons opposed legalizing recreational marijuana says it should be up to the voters to decide establishing database of police shootings supports more what you need to know about voting in ohio
