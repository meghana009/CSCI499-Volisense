us president joe biden has hailed the extraordinary success of the withdrawal of us forces and nationals from kabul as the war in afghanistan officially ended after 20 years mr biden praised the incredibly skill and bravery of us soldiers diplomats and intelligence professionals who carried out the operation the president touted one of the biggest airlifts in history noting more than 120 000 individuals who were airlifted from kabul he said no nation has ever done anything like it in all of history president joe biden speaks to the united states at the end of the war in afghanistan picture supplied the us began the final phase of its chaotic withdrawal from the country in may as the taliban seized much of the country in a lightening blitz kabul fell on august 15 and a suicide attack at kabul airport killed 13 us service members and more than 170 other people taliban celebrates return to power the hard line islamist taliban have celebrated their total return to power on with gunfire after the last us troops flew out of afghanistan to end two decades of war the united states longest military conflict drew to a close on monday night when its forces abandoned kabul airport where it had overseen a frenzied flight that saw more than 123 000 people flee taliban fighters then quickly swept into the airport and fired weapons into the sky across the city in jubilation an astonishing return after us forces invaded in 2001 weeks after the september 11 attacks and toppled them for supporting al qaeda congratulations to afghanistan this victory belongs to us all taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid told reporters hours later on the runway of the airport we highlight to every occupier that whoever sees afghanistan with an evil eye will face the same fate as the americans have faced we ve never given up to pressure or force and our nation has always sought freedom mujahid said ouths supporting the taliban wave taliban flags and shout slogans while marching along a street in kandahar on august 31 mujahid said the taliban s victory was a lesson for other invaders many afghans are terrified of a repeat of the taliban s initial rule from 1996 2001 which was infamous for their treatment of girls and women as well as a brutal justice system the taliban have repeatedly promised a more tolerant brand of rule compared with their first stint in power and mujahid continued that theme we want to have good relations with the us and the world we welcome good diplomatic relations with them all he said mujahid also insisted taliban security forces would be gentle and nice taliban fighters guard outside the airport in kabul the taliban face a daunting challenge of transforming from an insurgent group to a government in war ravaged nation dependent on foreign aid the united nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe with food stocks running low because of disruptions caused by conflict as well as a severe drought some afghans appealed to the islamist movement to keep their promise of a softer rule fawzia koofi a rights activist and former negotiator for the ousted government who has twice survived assassination attempts called on the taliban via twitter to include all afghans as they turn to governing the country taliban hear us out we must rebuild together she wrote this land belongs to all of us other activists struggled to find hope amid the gloom if i let my thoughts linger on what we have lost i will lose my mind muska dastageer who lectured at the american university of afghanistan wrote on twitter members of the taliban badri 313 military unit take a position at the airport in kabul the withdrawal came amid the august 31 deadline set by us president joe biden to end the war one that claimed the lives of more than tens of thousands of afghans and over 2400 american service members the slightly early finish followed a threat from the regional offshoot of the islamic state group rivals of the taliban to attack the us forces at the airport thirteen us troops were among more than 100 people killed when an is suicide bomber late last week attacked the perimeter of the airport where desperate afghans had massed in the hope of getting on board an evacuation flight us president joe biden the us led airlift began as the taliban completed an astonishing rout of government forces around the country and took over the capital on august 15 their victory came after mr biden withdrew nearly all american troops then was forced to send back about 6000 more to conduct the airlift mr biden said he would address the nation today in washington as his critics continued to savage him for his handling of the withdrawal we can t fight endless wars but the scope consequence of biden s failure here is staggering republican senator rick scott said mr biden s top diplomat secretary of state antony blinken was able to offer little more than stern words for the taliban any legitimacy and any support will have to be earned sec blinken said as he announced the united states had suspended its diplomatic presence in kabul and shifted its operations to qatar a member of the taliban badri 313 military unit runs to take up his position at the airport in kabul all eyes will now turn to how the taliban handle their first few days with sole authority over the country with a sharp focus on whether they will allow free departure for those wanting to leave including some foreigners sec blinken said a small number of us citizens remained in the country under 200 but likely closer to just 100 britain says the number of uk nationals inside afghanistan are in the low hundreds many thousands of afghans who had worked with the us backed government over the years and fear retribution also want to get out western allies have voiced heartbreak in recent days that not all afghans who wanted to flee could get on the evacuation flights the un security council adopted a resolution on monday requiring the taliban to honour a commitment to let people freely leave afghanistan in the days ahead and to grant access to the un and other aid agencies talks are ongoing as to who will now run kabul airport which german chancellor angela merkel warned tuesday was of existential importance because it is a lifeline for aid the taliban have asked turkey to handle logistics while they maintain control of security but president recep tayyip erdogan has not yet accepted that offer originally published as afghanistan war is over us president joe biden calls troop withdrawal extraordinary success
the important thing to know about an assassination or attempted assassination is not who fired the shot but who paid for the bullet eric ambler the mask of dimitrios 1939 after going off duty these crews return to their families so that they might be bathing their children within forty minutes of killing a stranger in a foreign country michael burleigh throughout human history the assassin has stalked the shadows of political and quotidian life from the murder of julius caesar to modern day targeted us military drone strikes as well as the cold blooded butchering of washington post correspondent jamal khashoggi inside the saudi consulate in istanbul in 2018 it is clear we are a consistently homicidal species apart from whether assassinations work or result in a predicted political outcome there are the ethical and moral dimensions to this violent method of political warfare that endures into the 21st century franco american philosopher george steiner often began lectures by asking students what they would do should adolf hitler walk into the room and they had the opportunity to kill him knowing what we do now plato and aristotle argued that tyrannicide the murder of a tyrant could be justified it was the british statesman benjamin disraeli in 1865 after the assassination of abraham lincoln who opined that assassination has never changed the history of the world the english historian michael burleigh who has written extensively on world war 2 has just published a massively readable tome day of the assassins a history of political murder picador in which he warns in many democracies politics have become so angry and polarised that one wonders why it is still a comparatively rare occurrence south africans are deeply aware that in this neck of the woods assassinations are not a rare occurrence they have featured as a more or less permanent trope in south african politics including post apartheid south africa sacp leader chris hani s assassination by right wing zealot janusz walus in 1993 was one of the most high profile assassinations there have been a reported 450 political assassinations in kwazulu natal alone since 1994 the assassination on 23 august of gauteng health department official babita deokaran a key witness in an siu probe into ppe procurement irregularities in the department falls within the category of a political assassination as it implicates officials deployed to the department by the governing party burleigh s deep and detailed dive into the world of assassins their conspirators and masterminds debunks disraeli s quip and shows that in some instances assassinations can prompt catastrophic political consequences the murder in 1934 in leningrad of sergei kirov stalin s potential rival by a stranger was used by the soviet strongman as an excuse to begin the first great purge from 1936 to 1938 in which millions were persecuted tortured and killed in rwanda the assassination of president juvenal habyarimana and burundian president cyprien ntaryamira both hutus in a plane crash in 1994 triggered the devastating genocide in which almost a million tutsis died burleigh sets out how the event did not end with the genocide hutus in zaire launched attacks on rwanda and as the us and french backed dictator mobutu sese seko s power waned angola burundi uganda and zimbabwe invaded zaire mobutu was deposed and laurent kabila installed the historian s chapter on putin s russia where assassinations are as commonplace as matryoshka dolls finds some resonance with contemporary south africa and its political organised criminal nexus in relation to organised killings as countries go putin s russia already topped the assassination stakes with 750 actual or attempted assassinations between 1998 and 1999 this was just as putin resigned from the kgb to focus on public administration and stimulating the economy in leningrad the plan involved building casinos and driving a scheme for the sale of oil scrap metal and cotton in exchange for food for the starving citizens of leningrad who received not a morsel turning to the us a country that has consistently ignored suggests burleigh a body of evidence that terrorist organisations tend to collapse more quickly by not assassinating their leaders because of internal factionalism and war weariness the historian laments a cia that has twice been fashioned into a paramilitary force rather than an intelligence gathering organisation the cold war resulted in several authorised killings including that of the independent republic of congo s first democratically elected president patrice lumumba in 1961 lumumba s assassination was particularly diabolical after an attempted poisoning he was shot buried exhumed hacked to pieces and dissolved in sulphuric acid cuban leader fidel castro too was a frequent target of successive us presidents the list of us targeted executions is long and burleigh explores many of these from osama bin laden to al qaeda s military head muhammad atef in his chapter targeted assassinations since 2010 drones have been used to kill between 7 584 and 10 918 people including between 751 and 1 555 civilians the author notes burleigh asks who are the young americans who control these predator drones and what is the impact on their lives the bureaucratic politics of drone warfare should not distract from the reality of young men and women sitting in trailers steering drones with a joystick and pressing a button to kill people seven or eight thousand miles away he writes thousands of men and women have flown drones notes the author further adding a few of them have written or spoken of what they do he sets out how there are usually three personnel in the drone flying trailer who are in constant communication with up to 20 people like any bureaucracy involved in killing responsibility is compartmentalised and dispersed the drone teams writes burleigh work 12 hour shifts which can be scheduled so that they see the target country in daylight while it is night outside in nevada the most common feeling amongst the drone crews is tedium interspersed with brief adrenaline rushes he notes after going off duty these crews return to their families so that they might be bathing their children within forty minutes of killing a stranger in a foreign country israel s record of assassinations harks back to the killing in 1944 of lord moyne churchill s friend in cairo and the blowing up of the king david hotel in jerusalem in 1946 mossad israel s intelligence agency says burleigh holds the world record for external assassinations with around 2 700 victims mossad has a semi acknowledged campaign of assassinating iranian nuclear scientists when burleigh does make a quick turn to south africa it is to unpack the assassination of apartheid prime minister hendrik verwoerd inside the house of assembly by a parliamentary messenger and member of the sa communist party dimitri tsafendas in september 1966 a previous attempt on verwoerd s life in 1960 at the rand easter show by millionaire farmer david pratt had failed in both cases the pretoria government had attempted to paint the assassins as insane verwoerd s death by multiple stabbing did not however lead to the demise of apartheid tsafendas s act in fact strengthened the resolve of hardcore racial nationalists like verwoerd who were prepared to racially politically socially and economically rearrange south africa by force julius caesar was 56 the same age as abraham lincoln when he was assassinated when on the morning of 15 march 44 bc more than 20 senators drew their daggers and plunged them into him as he sat on his gold and ivory throne the emperor was so convinced he was untouchable that he had dispensed with his spanish bodyguards personal protection beloved by former south african president jacob zuma and so many other politicians was a pretension warned aristotle of one who is aiming at tyranny in the author s almost 500 page excavation of political murders there are scores of individual killers and collective political conspiracies to choose from there are many standout assassins including fanny kaplan the half blind socialist revolutionary who survived 11 years of hard labour in tsarist labour camps and who attempted to assassinate lenin in august 1918 for her deed kaplan was shot in the neck by the bolsheviks and burnt in a barrel then there was alexander orlov the spanish head of the people s commissariat for internal affairs nkvd and a specialist in organising the deaths of those to be liquidated orlov noticed that nkvd officers summoned to moscow seemed to disappear he and his wife slipped away on board a boat to canada after embezzling 68 000 from the nkvd it was orlov who first exposed soviet spies kim philby and donald maclean inside british intelligence burleigh enlivens the history on the pages the reader is transported to the senate in rome with caesar s killers or to mexico as trotsky s killer stealthily plots his way into the heart of the soviet exile s home as with ancient religious wars the advent of modern pseudo religious ideologies says the author licensed any number of symbolic murders targeting monarchs prime ministers judges and policemen as well as such symbols as opera houses and stock exchanges when these ideologies captured powerful states then the number of assassinations skyrocketed since states have many murderers at their disposal and their rulers sometimes operate with a different morality from that of ordinary men and women dm please join marianne thamm and michael burleigh at noon on thursday 2 september for the online south african launch of day of the assassins a history of political murder

year emphasizing that officials have set a different and substantially more stringent test for raising rates than they have for the coming reduction in asset purchases the fact that the fed is willing

for stock market investors of a superstitious nature october is the most feared month in the financial calendar if we include september the two autumnal months have encompassed some of the most notorious stock market sell offs of the modern age the bank panic of 1907 the great crash of 1929 black monday 1987 the 9 11 atrocities of 2001 and of course the lehman brothers collapse that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008 the superstition is to some extent justified by the record using the dow jones industrial average as the measure october claims the highest number of severe stock market downturns in the last 130 years however it is quite closely followed by march when the last really big one the covid 19 crash happened january and may are also relatively common months for stock market corrections global sharemarkets are at record highs even as economies show signs of faltering credit ap the high level of october crashes can therefore be dismissed as little more than coincidence anticipation can on the other hand be an incredibly powerful influence and if enough investors believe in the october effect then in an overbought market it stands some chance of self fulfilment whether acting rationally or not the crowd determines the outcome stock market crashes nevertheless generally require some kind of a spark or external shock to set them off the crash of 1929 and black monday in 1987 the latter of which turned out to be no more than a brief aberration were unusual in that there was no obvious catalyst beyond a hike in interest rates
in his urgent new book jonathan rauch shows that western civilization s capacity for ascertaining testing and sharing the truth depends in no small part on four key institutional communities expert researchers mainstream journalists government agencies and the legal community these are the institutions of his constitution of knowledge their rules and norms he writes create a system of mechanisms of public decision making and social adjudication which resembles the u s constitution the key word is resembles rauch takes care not to overdo the constitutional analogy and so should we his constitution of knowledge is a framework for knowing the world the u s constitution by contrast is a framework for shaping the world this is a fundamental difference even when the goal of both constitutions is the advancement of an objective standard for one constitution the truth for the other the public good still the analogy helps to illuminate many aspects of the problems facing us today but recall how the u s constitution s institutions were supposed to advance the public good less by redundancy than by specialization congress is vested with legislative powers the president with executive power and the courts with judicial power the branches of government differ in what they are meant to do and how to do it while we often talk loosely of checks and balances our constitutional system requires not just checks and balances generally but the three institutions specifically checking and balancing one another in inherently different ways and this is why institutional drift among the three branches of government is such a problem for our constitutional system the more that a given branch of our government confuses its purpose for that of others the more the executive branch becomes our legislature or the more the legislature becomes an adjunct of administration or the more judges become politicians then the more that the constitutional system as a whole suffers even when the adrift branch intended to do good so in considering rauch s constitution of knowledge we need to focus not just on the general purpose of the entire system but rather on the specific purpose of each part of the system for each of his four main informational institutions professional research mainstream journalism government agencies and the legal community we can see the superficial differences among them but can we safely say that each of these four institutions has a distinctive purpose that defines its work its norms and its limits we can easily spot superficial differences between say academics journalists federal agency leaders and public interest lawyers yet we often see them doing very similar things look no further than cable news shows or newspaper op ed pages where you ll find a jumble of each group all making completely interchangeable contributions so what actually distinguishes the four groups contributions to rauch s constitution of knowledge do these institutions still have well defined purposes that shape limit and channel their members toward each institution s particular contributions to knowledge or more likely does each suffer from varying degrees of institutional drift of the constitution of knowledge s four institutions journalism probably faces the best known problems from market incentives driving major news organizations to pursue ever more polarized subscriber bases to the ideological fervor roiling newsrooms but it is not the only informational institution with such problems the community of expert researchers for example faces unprecedented uncertainty especially on college campuses about its proper purpose powers and limits too often we see researchers trying to treat questions of value judgment as questions of science or fact but here let us focus especially on government agencies their inclusion in rauch s discussion of knowledge formation is itself a contribution on his part for he reminds us of government s crucial and historical role in the processes of information this role dates back to the very beginning of our republic to the expeditions that built our nation but also built our stock of knowledge as rauch explains federal agencies relationships to the constitution of knowledge actually vary some agencies gather discrete facts some conduct general research and compile statistics some use information to create regulatory policies but many do all of the above and at the same time finding facts and making policy in a unified process an agency identifies a general policy goal then proposes a specifically regulatory initiative then invites the public to submit information and arguments and then finalizes the policy with justifications rooted in the record that has been built along the way the fact value distinction is thin enough in theory in administrative practice it s practically nonexistent rauch sees things somewhat differently he credits the administrative procedure act of 1946 for requiring agencies to subject to public comment and criticism justify them with objective evidence and analysis and make sure the evidence and analysis can stand up in court but the apa now marking its 75th anniversary does this only gently and malleably if at all it nominally forbids agencies from making regulations that are arbitrary or capricious but this prevents only the most poorly reasoned policies similarly the apa sometimes requires agencies to support their policies with substantial evidence a standard that might seem onerous but actually requires only more than a mere scintilla of evidence to clear the bar such standards do little to incentivize informational rigor if anything they disincentivize it instead of evidence based policymaking we get too much policy based evidence making as oren cass aptly put it and even when policymakers try to be as factually rigorous as possible while pursuing policy aims they risk undermining the public credibility of their factual findings by intertwining them with their newly proposed policies upon winning the nobel prize in economics in 2018 paul romer urged congress to protect the independence of the federal government s scientific advisers who must be uncompromising in their pursuit of facts by set them apart from regulators who rely on facts but must compromise to balance competing interests when they write regulations this strikes me as correct and urgently needed yet i must confess that i have yet to see how the line might be perfectly drawn in modern agencies when congress has built them to be both factfinders and policymakers perhaps the madisonian approach in such circumstances would be to strive for the separation of fact and policy even if the ideal is unattainable by first looking for the particular institution s ideal contribution to the pursuit of truth and then asking how we can practically structure the institution to achieve it such an approach could take inspiration from the founding era s great government supported expeditions which built both the nation and the nation s stock of scientific knowledge it could also take inspiration from the early informational agencies like the census bureau and the u s geological survey and from more recent examples like the energy information administration created in 1977 and the white house s own office of information and regulatory affairs 1980 all of these are reminders of the nation s capacity for building credible informational institutions even in difficult times or on controversial subjects again the goal is to remove as much policymaking power from the regulatory factfinders as practically possible and to remove as much factfinding power from the regulatory policymakers the policymakers would be entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts and by the same token government factfinders must not become de facto policymakers themselves the work of institutional design would also require thinking hard about whether the informational agencies should remain concentrated in the executive branch and independent agencies or if more of them should be reformed as legislative commissions again these considerations are just facets of the more fundamental constitutional question how do government agencies either contribute to knowledge or rely on it and how do we shape them to best undertake those particular constitutional roles we can and should ask similar questions about rauch s other informational institutions research journalism and law in order to reform each of them to advance their respective institutional purposes in the constitution of knowledge

to year to customers as a credit in their monthly electric rates the benefit avista will receive from bpa starting in october 2021 will result in a higher level of benefits than is currently being passed through to qualifying customers as a result of the higher level of benefits the proposed rate change for residential and small farm customers is designed to decrease revenues by approximately 0 8 million or 0 1 purchased gas cost adjustment pga the second adjustment is the annual purchased gas cost adjustment pga filing if approved avista s request is designed to increase annual natural gas revenues by approximately 17 5 million or 10 6 effective nov 1 2021 the increase is primarily driven by wholesale natural gas costs that are higher than the level presently included in rates over the last decade wholesale natural gas prices have remained very low however in recent months wholesale natural gas prices have risen substantially the market factors attributing to the rise in prices is an overall increase in demand and lower supply today s wholesale gas prices are lower than they were even 20 years ago even as costs fluctuate from year to year the pga is filed each year to balance the actual cost of wholesale natural gas purchased by avista to serve customers with the amount included in rates this includes the natural gas commodity cost as well as the cost to transport natural gas on interstate pipelines to avista s local distribution system about 30 of an avista natural gas customer s bill is the combined cost of purchasing natural gas on the wholesale market and transporting it to avista s system these costs fluctuate up and down based on market prices and are not marked up by avista the remaining 70 covers the cost of delivering the natural gas the equipment and people needed to provide safe and reliable service customer bills overall changes in electricity prices have been approximately 0 5 lower per year and natural gas prices 1 7 higher on average since january 2016 this is lower than the rate of inflation during this time period when compared to the consumer price index on average the total monthly cost of avista s residential electric service is 35 lower than the national average for investor owned utilities electric if approved residential electric customers in washington using an average of 914 kilowatt hours per month would see their

home news woke capital giant bows to china the largest asset manager in the world is doubling down on china actually make that tripling down despite blackrock s busy schedule of hamstringing the domestic energy sector ensuring demographic equity in the fortune 500 and trying to put gun manufacturers out of business they have found the time to tell everyone that we ought to triple financial investments in china this comes amidst a serious financial crisis in china which i wrote about here triggered by an intervention in the growing education industry in order to make schooling more affordable all part of a scheme to lift their abysmal population growth the origin of which is in part the widespread infanticide of girls caused by china s decades long one child policy there s more than a hint of irony in blackrock s bullishness on chinese investments considering the former s investing philosophy and the latter s governing philosophy blackrock aggressively advocates for esg environmental social and governance investing the karma theory of investing which operates under the assumption that companies that do good meaning whatever activists want will do well meaning produce higher returns than their peers get our latest news for free subscribe to get daily weekly email with the top stories plus special offers from the christian post be the first to know subscribe while blackrock evangelizes for esg investing in the us it ignores it completely in china they are in essence serving two masters at home they serve woke capital requiring moral purity among their investments abroad the myriad human rights abuses of the chinese state are simply swept under the rug inclusive capitalism for washington social darwinism for beijing blackrock is one of the foremost proponents of stakeholder capitalism a philosophy that states corporate management s obligation is not to their shareholders but to their stakeholders a company s stakeholders are their clients their employees the society where they work and operate according to ceo larry fink stewards are not to be faithful to owners as st paul would have us believe but to everyone the implication of blackrock s philosophy is that nothing special is owed to the owner for example blackrock recently ensured the success of a coup at exxon that put two climate change activists on the board and backed a shareholder resolution at chevron forcing them to disclose lobbying efforts and ensure that they support international goals to combat global warming as apparently emitting too much carbon is bad for investors of course the country that blackrock thinks we should have two to three times as much money invested in emits massive amounts of carbon they are in fact the world s largest polluter their enthusiasm for chinese stocks notwithstanding blackrock argues domestically that companies falling short of their environmental social and governance standards will end up underperforming but we just saw an example of how the chinese governments own missteps hurt investors and blackrock appears to not have the slightest concern carbon emissions from exxon must be squashed for the good of shareholders and stakeholders but a financial crisis in china triggered by politically motivated interventions in the economy is apparently not worth considering investing risks domestically are invented while actual ones overseas are ignored ultimately blackrock is embodying an attitude which christ warned us about in matthew 7 5 they are hypocrites literally under the critics they must constantly signal their agreement with the social objectives of domestic elites who neither care about nor know about anything outside the anglosphere which necessarily entails magnifying injustices in the us while ignoring china s far greater sins at home it s diversity equity and inclusion stakeholder capitalism inclusive capitalism bipoc representation living wages net zero carbon emissions voting rights sustainability doing well by doing good and corporate pride parades in china it s drill baby drill forget about child labor sterilizing the muslim minority before sending them to concentration camps banning bibles and destroying churches cutting down rainforests and hollowing out mountains or poisoning lakes and rivers our financial elites are characteristically unperturbed by any of this they neither advocate for divesting from chinese assets nor have any interest in using their substantial financial leverage to change anything we and the persecuted church in china deserve much better than faithless stewards and hypocrites who serve two masters they are horrified by gender inequities in corporate boardrooms and utterly sanguine about religious genocide they are incorrigible in the destruction of our fossil fuels industry and silent as the grave about china s fossil fuels industry they constantly proclaim the virtues of environmental social and governance investing at home while declaring that we ought to invest even more in the country that destroys its environment shreds its social fabric and governs with abject tyranny

by mike newman director parhelion underwriting special to the digest the oil industry is under pressure on many fronts in the climate change era and faces an existential threat from alternative renewable sources of energy but the industry is also best positioned to win the prize in energy s green future it s code red for humanity as the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change shouted last month in only the most recent dire climate report and the oil industry is under pressure on many fronts in the climate change era not least of which is from their shareholders first the background from the investors perspective over the past 15 years the annual total returns to shareholders trs for the average oil and gas company has lagged the s p 500 by seven per centage points oil stocks accounting for more than a tenth of the bellwether index barely a decade ago now account for just 4 of the s p 500 this suggests the sector s traditional business model has been under stress for some then add to that the existential threat posed by the sort of competitor that the industry has never faced in the past an industry based on renewable sources of energy an alternative to fossil fuels that is being heavily supported by governmental carbon emissions reduction mandates around the world it s not hard to foresee a world where renewable energy will increase and fossil fuels decline the prediction by bp energy s outlook 2020 so investors are putting the oil industry under the microscope and are increasingly seeking out positions that reduce their exposure to climate change as well as the risk of stranded assets figure 1 the world s energy transition bp energy outlook 2020 financial times it s even changing the concept of financial resilience financial resilience has historically been judged by the position of oil and gas assets on the industry cost curve as the physical risks from a changing climate are better understood and transition risks such as societal pressure technological disrup tion or shifting consumer preferences become more widespread financial resilience is increasingly becoming a function of climate resilience at last year s un climate summit an alliance of the world s largest pension funds and insurers repre senting 2 4 trillion in assets committed themselves to transitioning their portfolios to net zero emissions by 2050 now investors are pushing companies to disclose consistent comparable and reliable climate data a new breed of activist shareholder challenges oil majors on their climate policies and emissions reduction plans earlier this year climate change hedge fund investors managed to elect three new directors to exxonmobil s board in a rebuke to exxon s oil centric investment plans compounding the issues for oil companies according to the winds of change report from s p global ratings is the real possibility they may be held legally responsible for their role in climate change yet the oil industry has natural advantages in this time of transition the global economy still relies on fossil fuels for 80 of its power and the transition to those alternatives will happen over time and there is a big chance that big oil will own this transition as well as the renewable future that follows by playing to core strengths so what does this mean and what might it look like to begin with oil companies have existing infrastructures resources and technologies that give them advantages in a green present and future while there are competitors from other sectors en tering each of these markets the oil industry has natural advantages that will allow it to leverage capabilities adjacencies and investments to date which will put them in a leading role here we identify seven areas where the oil industry has inherent natural advantages wind oil companies and the oilfield service businesses that support them have unique expertise in how to build and operate in an offshore environment which are key to this type of power the instal lation of wind turbines in the sea especially in deep waters is pretty similar to installing oil platforms especially floating platforms the latest research shows that within the renewable power sector solar and wind energy are ex pected to show the highest growth rates over the next ten years wind energy projects are an oppor tunity to develop new energy service markets and even activate idled onshore and offshore infra structure oil companies will increasingly invest in these sectors as a way to reduce their carbon in tensity energy mix solar oxy eog resources exxonmobil and chevron have all added solar energy projects in recent years many oilfields such as the permian basin in texas and new mexico are coincidentally well suited to renewable energy with lots of cheap flat land good irradiance and a regulatory framework favorable to project development whether oil and gas or renewables figure 2 an oil pump operates in the permian basin oil field near carlsbad new mexico joe raedle hulton archive getty images hydrogen hydrogen production through the electrolysis process has become both more technically advanced and less expensive than most of the alternatives bloomberg new energy finance esti mates that the cost of hydrogen could drop as much as two thirds by 2050 using renewable energy rather than steam methane reforming smr to power the electrolysis could offer refineries a way to utilize and re purpose existing technology equipment and physical plants while at the same time reduce emissions further the oil industry has decades of experience with petrochemicals the in house expertise to support the development of hydrogen related innovations and knows how to build energy production at scale the industry s existing pipeline infrastructure is adaptable to transport hydrogen biofuels the appeal of stacking the 1 per gallon biodiesel tax credit on top of california s low car bon fuel standard credits while reducing rin exposure for those that have it has encouraged a race for renewable diesel production capacity in the oil industry that will likely transform america s bio mass based diesel industry over the next few years the federal tax credit is guaranteed only through 2022 but that s enough for developers to continue transforming half a dozen u s oil refineries into renewable diesel plants even as two existing renew able diesel producers proceed with massive expansions there are currently four operational renewa ble diesel plants in the united states the two expanding facilities capable of producing 365 million gallons year mg y prior to upsizing and two newly commissioned plants that will produce another 190 mg y that existing 553 mg y of capacity will soon be eclipsed by six more renewable diesel plants under construction plus the expansions this first big wave of construction represents over 2 billion gallons of biobased diesel capacity what s poised to come next could be even more extraordinary at least five additional proposed renewable diesel facilities including oil companies marathon petroleum and phillips 66 represent another 3 3 billion gallons of potential capacity altogether this is nearly 5 5 billion gallons of new or potential capacity which is double the u s biodiesel industry s current size government support has created the low carbon fuel markets that are developing rapidly across the country not only are these markets proving to be profitable for oil refineries that have preexisting production infrastructures equipped to deliver qualifying fuels but also the currency of these gov ernment markets lcfs credits and rins are increasingly valuable assets and often provide the income stream that enables renewable project finance albeit with the risk of regulatory change carbon capture utilization and storage ccus this is a natural fit for the oil industry and it s where it can reduce its carbon footprint while at the same time qualifying for decarbonization credits and getting government support ccus has also offered a politically appealing opportunity to reach con sensus on climate change the energy industry and many republicans who oppose other solutions support carbon capture and storage as do unions that represent people who work in the fossil fuel sector to accelerate ccus development the u s offers incentives like the blenders tax credit btc and the 45q tax credit that power plants and industries can take for either storing or using captured carbon the oil industry was one of the earliest adopters of ccus technology beginning in the 1970s the industry originally developed and used many of the techniques integral to ccus separating co2 from natural gas is required before it can be transported by pipelines and separated co2 is occa sionally pumped back into geological formations to reduce the emissions intensity of operations or into reservoirs to enhance oil production figure 3 carbon capture and sequestration offshore metals and minerals the international energy agency calculates that an electric car needs six times the mineral content of one with an internal combustion engine manufacturing wind tur bines electric vehicles solar panels and batteries for energy storage requires resources often scarce metals like cobalt copper lithium and nickel the reality is that the clean energy transition is not possible without taking billions of tons of metal from the planet both onshore and offshore offshore exploration gives the oil industry a clear advantage and the seafloor holds great riches it has been estimated that the ocean seabed contains six times as much cobalt three times as much nickel and four times as much of the rare earth metals as there is on land geothermal producing geothermal energy involves deep well drilling just like oil and gas but in stead of producing hydrocarbons geothermal wells release steam that is captured funneled into pipes to spin turbines that generate electricity then pumped back underground the only emission is water vapor while carbon free electricity is generated around the clock geothermal power plants currently account for a small portion of u s electricity generation but a surge is underway the u s department of energy projects that the share of electricity produced by geothermal plants could swell to 16 rivaling the aging u s nuclear sector as well as all renewable energy sources combined achieving that kind of growth could put drilling rigs and oil field service companies to work almost overnight and for the long term free of the boom bust cycle dictated by the global oil market it would also catalyze 200 billion in new investment roughly the same amount of money invested by u s fracking companies over the last 10 years oil companies have a long history of innovative drilling advancements and the experience they pos sess could be a difference maker in bringing deep dry rock geothermal systems to market embracing change will push the oil industry to tap into the vast pool of knowledge skills and indus try expertise gained over more than 150 years daniel yergin the oil industry s historian the author of the prize the epic quest for oil money power and now ihs markit vice chairman said it s an important turning point for the fossil fuel sector which has been anticipating big changes with president biden s climate focused clean energy poli cies the oil and gas industry is calibrating itself to what has become the new benchmark net zero carbon by 2050 there s a lot of variation in strategies and thinking about what the new map will be to get there said yergin but the themes that jump out are hydrogen carbon capture innovation and the need for large companies with engineering capabilities that can operate at scale which is where the oil and gas industry happens to be the oil industry should play to its strengths and use its natural advantages to position itself to win energy s green future the best opportunities are a short stretch from the industry s core competen cies and will be critical for some key capital intensive clean energy technologies to reach maturity the resources and skills of the industry can play a central role in helping to tackle emissions from some of the hardest to abate sectors about the author mike newman is a consultant and

for stock market investors of a superstitious nature october is the most feared month in the financial calendar if we include september the two autumnal months have encompassed some of the most notorious stock market sell offs of the modern age the bank panic of 1907 the great crash of 1929 black monday 1987 the 9 11 atrocities of 2001 and of course the lehman brothers collapse that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008 the superstition is to some extent justified by the record using the dow jones industrial average as the measure october claims the highest number of severe stock market downturns in the last 130 years however it is quite closely followed by march when the last really big one the covid 19 crash happened january and may are also relatively common months for stock market corrections global sharemarkets are at record highs even as economies show signs of faltering credit ap the high level of october crashes can therefore be dismissed as little more than coincidence anticipation can on the other hand be an incredibly powerful influence and if enough investors believe in the october effect then in an overbought market it stands some chance of self fulfilment whether acting rationally or not the crowd determines the outcome stock market crashes nevertheless generally require some kind of a spark or external shock to set them off the crash of 1929 and black monday in 1987 the latter of which turned out to be no more than a brief aberration were unusual in that there was no obvious catalyst beyond a hike in interest rates

the national asset monetisation also known as the national monetisation pipeline has been launched with the release of the two volume mini tome of the niti aayog national monetisation pipeline volume 1 monetisation guidebook and national monetisation pipeline volume 2 asset pipeline by finance minister nirmala sitharaman on august 23 attributing as usual the entire initiative to the vision of prime minister narendra modi she summarised the rationale of it all saying asset monetisation based on the philosophy of creation through monetisation is aimed at tapping private sector investment for new infrastructure creation the hegelian formulation when deconstructed seems to say that by monetising the existing public sector assets by offering them to the private sector and use the money raised through this process to create new infrastructure will ease the standard of living of everyone in india and meet the sustainable development goals sdgs in simpler words the government needs more money to create fresh infrastructure greenfield assets and it will raise the money by leasing out existing infrastructure assets the brownfield assets in the railways airports and power the niti aayog booklet explains that the national infrastructure pipeline nip is to be financed through the national monetisation pipeline nmp in so many words the government is looking for private sector funding of public infrastructure it will be argued that creation of public infrastructure will help the private sector to grow and increase their profits the private sector is quite aware of this but it has always argued that it is the government s job to create the infrastructure and that it must be created through government finances the private sector in india is not too keen to get into infrastructure projects the prime minister and the finance minister had exhorted the private sector to embrace risks to spur economic growth when they addressed the confederation of indian industry cii meeting to mark the 75th year of indian independence the captains of industry heard them out but they did not seem to be too enthused the niti aayog has invoked the australian and indonesian examples to show that this is something that has been tried elsewhere too and it can be replicated it is the asset recycling initiative in australia and the leasing of melbourne port to a private consortium has been offered as an example in indonesia it is the limited concession scheme lcs which is seen as an alternative to the public private partnership ppp given that the governmental does not have the money this appears to be an understandable proposition especially in the covid stressed years of 2020 21 and 2021 22 the situation was quite bad in 2019 20 as well but neither prime minister modi nor finance minister sitharaman had ever candidly admitted the financial crunch they could not have done that because that would have been seen as a declaration of failure and this government hates to admit that it has failed in any area but it is understood that to create fresh assets you may have to find different ways of raising resources the government usually does this through tax revenues the tax revenues have not been good enough in the past two years and there was also the additional burden of welfare spending but there is not much transparency in the government s welfare expenditure in 2020 and in this current year the government spent on distributing foodgrains doling out money to the poor old people and farmers there is a suspicion that the government has spent less than what it claims to have because the distribution of foodgrains is from the buffer stocks and the budget for grain procurement is a regular one what is spent by way of old age pensions and payment to farmers is not really a drain because it is a shared expenditure between the centre and the states in a normal year tax buoyancy gives that elbow room to governments to invest in new infrastructure and the market provides the other source the reserve bank of india has been telling us about bond markets and how the rbi hopes to keep the financial flows going this is apart from the record foreign direct investment fdi inflows that the government has been boasting about private investment including foreign investment does not seem to be taking off in india and no one wants to ask the question as to why this is so the nmp is meant to dovetail into the nip or national infrastructure pipeline as the niti aayog observes but the crux of infrastructure creation through private sector investment seems to be a dead end the government may have to go back to the old school approach of raising taxes and attracting funds through the markets to build infrastructure and hope that the economic growth that this would trigger will help the government to get back the money it had spent through tax revenues what is needed is huge governmental spending something that the united states is trying to do through its trillion dollar budget allocation for infrastructure including social welfare governmental spending is the imperative of the day though the indian government has claimed in successive budgets that its capital expenditure has increased it really has nothing much to show for it the central vista development redevelopment project apart from its debatable aesthetics is the kind of approach that the narendra modi government needs to adopt across the broad spectrum of the economy and instead of free rations the government should create employment so that people can buy quality foodgrains than what is offered in the government run fair price shops people want jobs and not doles the government should take up infrastructure projects on its own and create jobs which will in turn create demand in the economy the attempt to shift the responsibility on to the private sector does not seem to be working the private sector is turning out to be a better shirker than the government instead of convoluted expenditure growth models like the nmp the government should just go and do the job itself the private sector might then be tempted to follow suit the government and the private sector trying to push each other into the pool is simply a delaying tactic the writer is a delhi based commentator and analyst

us president joe biden has hailed the extraordinary success of the withdrawal of us forces and nationals from kabul as the war in afghanistan officially ended after 20 years mr biden praised the incredibly skill and bravery of us soldiers diplomats and intelligence professionals who carried out the operation the president touted one of the biggest airlifts in history noting that more than 120 000 people who were airlifted from kabul he said no nation has ever done anything like it in all of history president joe biden speaks to the united states at the end of the war in afghanistan picture supplied mr biden said the real decision in afghanistan was between leaving and escalating i was not going to extend this forever war and i was not extending a forever exit he said the us began the final phase of its chaotic withdrawal from the country in may as the taliban seized much of the country in a lightening blitz kabul fell on august 15 and a suicide attack at kabul airport killed 13 us service members and more than 170 other people taliban celebrates return to power the hard line islamist taliban have celebrated their total return to power on with gunfire after the last us troops flew out of afghanistan to end two decades of war the united states longest military conflict drew to a close on monday night when its forces abandoned kabul airport where it had overseen a frenzied flight that saw more than 123 000 people flee taliban fighters then quickly swept into the airport and fired weapons into the sky across the city in jubilation an astonishing return after us forces invaded in 2001 weeks after the september 11 attacks and toppled them for supporting al qaeda congratulations to afghanistan this victory belongs to us all taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid told reporters hours later on the runway of the airport we highlight to every occupier that whoever sees afghanistan with an evil eye will face the same fate as the americans have faced we ve never given up to pressure or force and our nation has always sought freedom mujahid said ouths supporting the taliban wave taliban flags and shout slogans while marching along a street in kandahar on august 31 mujahid said the taliban s victory was a lesson for other invaders many afghans are terrified of a repeat of the taliban s initial rule from 1996 2001 which was infamous for their treatment of girls and women as well as a brutal justice system the taliban have repeatedly promised a more tolerant brand of rule compared with their first stint in power and mujahid continued that theme we want to have good relations with the us and the world we welcome good diplomatic relations with them all he said mujahid also insisted taliban security forces would be gentle and nice taliban fighters guard outside the airport in kabul the taliban face a daunting challenge of transforming from an insurgent group to a government in war ravaged nation dependent on foreign aid the united nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe with food stocks running low because of disruptions caused by conflict as well as a severe drought some afghans appealed to the islamist movement to keep their promise of a softer rule fawzia koofi a rights activist and former negotiator for the ousted government who has twice survived assassination attempts called on the taliban via twitter to include all afghans as they turn to governing the country taliban hear us out we must rebuild together she wrote this land belongs to all of us other activists struggled to find hope amid the gloom if i let my thoughts linger on what we have lost i will lose my mind muska dastageer who lectured at the american university of afghanistan wrote on twitter members of the taliban badri 313 military unit take a position at the airport in kabul the withdrawal came amid the august 31 deadline set by us president joe biden to end the war one that claimed the lives of more than tens of thousands of afghans and over 2400 american service members the slightly early finish followed a threat from the regional offshoot of the islamic state group rivals of the taliban to attack the us forces at the airport thirteen us troops were among more than 100 people killed when an is suicide bomber late last week attacked the perimeter of the airport where desperate afghans had massed in the hope of getting on board an evacuation flight us president joe biden the us led airlift began as the taliban completed an astonishing rout of government forces around the country and took over the capital on august 15 their victory came after mr biden withdrew nearly all american troops then was forced to send back about 6000 more to conduct the airlift mr biden said he would address the nation today in washington as his critics continued to savage him for his handling of the withdrawal we can t fight endless wars but the scope consequence of biden s failure here is staggering republican senator rick scott said mr biden s top diplomat secretary of state antony blinken was able to offer little more than stern words for the taliban any legitimacy and any support will have to be earned sec blinken said as he announced the united states had suspended its diplomatic presence in kabul and shifted its operations to qatar a member of the taliban badri 313 military unit runs to take up his position at the airport in kabul all eyes will now turn to how the taliban handle their first few days with sole authority over the country with a sharp focus on whether they will allow free departure for those wanting to leave including some foreigners sec blinken said a small number of us citizens remained in the country under 200 but likely closer to just 100 britain says the number of uk nationals inside afghanistan are in the low hundreds many thousands of afghans who had worked with the us backed government over the years and fear retribution also want to get out western allies have voiced heartbreak in recent days that not all afghans who wanted to flee could get on the evacuation flights the un security council adopted a resolution on monday requiring the taliban to honour a commitment to let people freely leave afghanistan in the days ahead and to grant access to the un and other aid agencies talks are ongoing as to who will now run kabul airport which german chancellor

i have not come across any studies or evidence that proves that ivermectin is effective against covid 19 patel said so i would definitely not recommend using it it s not officially approved to be used as a covid 19 treatment or prevention measure by health canada not that this has stopped people from asking about it according to patel he has fielded a lot more requests lately for information about the drug pharmacists do not have any authority to prescribe ivermectin at this moment so i haven t had any requests to prescribe it he said but definitely people have phoned me asking for information my answer is always to say it s not something that s been studied thoroughly with covid 19 and it s not recommended by health canada in some extreme cases when people can t get ivermectin from their local pharmacist they ve been trying other means of getting it this includes contacting animal nutrition stores to see if they can get the kind used for horses and cattle i ve had a few calls said tara kennedy owner of kennedy s animal nutrition centre in prince albert they haven t said that covid treatment is what they re using it for but typically the way they re asking for it leads me to believe that s what they re using it for not for horses and cattle kennedy does sometimes stock ivermectin but said she happens to be out of it at the moment much like it does for humans ivermectin helps get rid of parasites in cattle and horses both internal and external with the horse paste it s something that you squirt into their mouth and is an anti parasitic that helps get rid of all sorts of worms kennedy said according to patel side effects of the kind of ivermectin used for humans can range from low blood pressure and dizziness to symptoms similar to asthma and even include damage to the liver poison control calls in the united states related to the drug went up dramatically this year including as much as 550 per cent in texas according to usa today the fda lists even more serious consequences for an overdose of ivermectin on their website some of these side effects include seizures coma and even death it is a poison kennedy said that s why it has to be regulated on the dosing and everything else to use it without knowing what that dosing should be and not using it for the intended use which is for livestock with the stuff we sell to me is very dangerous rob mahon pattisonmedia com on twitter robmahonpxp

lansing mi wkzo am fm michigan attorney general dana nessel has filed a petition with the macomb county circuit court seeking authorization to issue a subpoena to facebook to learn the identity of an apparent scammer who claimed to be selling blank coronavirus vaccination cards in an online marketplace the filing made under the michigan consumer protection act details how a fake persona was used to solicit buyers on mom2momswap macomb county the solicitation has since been removed from the site a complaint about the blank cards filed by a macomb county resident with the department s consumer protection team prompted the petition the special agent investigating the matter determined the identity in the facebook profile claiming to be someone named kristin holliday was itself a fake the profile contained stock photos including one commonly used to advertise hawaiian vacations while kristin holliday is a common name for real people in michigan and throughout the country inquiry into the biographical information connected with the profile showed no association with any of the real people sharing that name the use of stock photos and common names are noted in the petition as hallmarks of fraudulent activity let this be a warning to those who take a shot at buying or selling fake vaccination cards in michigan nessel said although this one looks to be just a money for nothing scam we will dig into complaints like this and vigorously pursue those who put lives in danger with fake vaccination cards the petition filed monday asks the macomb circuit court to issue an order authorizing an investigation that will begin with a subpoena to facebook for information about the person creating the online profile under the proposed order submitted with the petition the attorney general would then have discretion to issue additional subpoenas based on what is learned from facebook in april nessel joined a bipartisan group of attorneys general to call on twitter ebay and shopify to act immediately to prevent people from offering to sell fraudulent centers for disease control cdc vaccination cards on their platforms

buck that is what he said on national tv very clear you heard him he is the commander in chief for better for worse we know for worse is the reality clay this is a broken promise this is an obligation that he has to get out all of the americans we got out a lot of afghans as we know how could we leave americans behind in the battlefield clay joe biden is done i think as a viable candidate to the extent that he was at all in 2024 based on these clips it is the very foundation if you combine that with the july 8th i believe it was clips where joe biden said there was no way the taliban will be able to take over afghanistan we ll play that clip and just think about listen to this in conjunction with what you just heard these are two different fundamental failures by joe biden they go to the very essence of what the commander in chief is supposed to do and i believe they will be the foundation of a lot of 2022 campaign ads and i think that effectively destroys joe biden s chances to be the nominee in 2024 i really do listen to this think about these in concert together biden no it is not reporter why biden because you have the afghan troops have 300 000 well equipped as well equipped as any army in the world and an air force against something like 75 000 taliban it is not inevitable buck that s a really well armed taliban by the way just by the numbers there so we had 300 000 on the books we got them all armed up we got 75 000 taliban guess what we can all do the math on that one clay but the intelligence failure here and it s not just the intelligence community it s the white house it s the national security apparatus in general on the dissolution it s not that the afghan national security force is lost clay it s that they disappeared clay yes buck there were no afghan national security forces after the biden administration said they re leaving between that and breaking the promise you would think he would pay a very high political price but i actually have some concerns about whether that s actually going to happen clay well you think they re going to try to pivot and i think they certainly are and there are going to allies in the media that now that there isn t the day to day reaction of afghanistan shots where we can see all of the chaos going there much of the media will leave we know that people have short attention spans and this is really the question that we have debated i think the general argument buck is that foreign affairs don t dictate success or failures of presidents general argument i think the problem for joe biden is all of the failures in afghanistan the way we left the leaving people behind how quickly the country collapsed in total contravention to everything that joe biden had told the american public ties in with the covid failures it ties in with the inflation rate skyrocketing it ties in with the border being a sieve and nobody stopping anything there and the ongoing murder rates in other words it sells the message of incompetence and it s like hey joe biden is not just incompetent in the domestic sphere he s also completely incompetent internationally and i think those audio and video in commercials are devastating to joe biden to put them back to back because it just brings home that incompetence on a different level buck it s amazing for those of us and i know you are in this camp who thought the biden presidency would be a disaster for day one clay but this first year has been a lesson on how it can always be worse clay eight months buck that s what we ve seen from biden however the timing of this unfortunately may work in his favor in some way as you know a year from now who knows what s going to be going on right clay he s so bad so early buck that s right clay it s like a sporting event when you re down 35 0 in the first quarter it probably won t get worse you re probably not going to lose 100 to nothing it s an interesting argument buck here s how i think this goes i say give it a week i think some people are saying it s already happening i think there s some evidence of that but give it a week and the democrat corporate media is going to be talking and get ready for this everybody the gas lighting is going to be thermonuclear it s going to be rough in a week they re going to be talking about biden s bravery in ending this war and the amazing improvisation and on the spot leadership his team showed under tremendous pressure and they ll look at anybody who questions what will be a soviet style rewriting of history like they are crazy clay it s just going to turn into biden got us out it doesn t matter how he did it he s the best because he did it and anybody who says wait hold on a second what about the whole collapse what about the leaving americans behind what about the 13 service members that we lost because we were reliant and let s never forget this on taliban checkpoints for our last foothold of evacuation territory in afghanistan they re going to be saying nothing s perfect biden they re going to be dismissive about it clay i think there s some truth to it i don t even think they re going to argue it i think they re going to rely on the american people having in many ways the memory spans of goldfish buck and i think they will just stop talking afghanistan at all and expect and hope that much as for the last 20 years most of the time nobody talked about afghanistan they re going to hope this is going to fade i think a good campaign will use these clips and keep recirculating them to reemphasize look what was the number one thing that biden sold to the american people i ll be normal things are going to be back to normal and you can trust me things are not back to normal buck and you can t trust him the very foundation of his electoral legitimacy and then you re toss in covid he said you can trust me i m going to get things back to normal i will beat covid he s fundamentally failed on all of those issues buck yeah i m going to question the virus not the economy which is what he said and i know right now the stock market s really high but that s because people are getting ready for inflation and if you have assets if you have hard assets if you have money in stocks this is what you re going do clay you have nowhere else to put them buck you re going to put money into places where asset values will rise with the rest as a result of our monetary policy which is also a tax on wage earners is a tax on people that they don t see but that s also before the huge spending bill is coming but i just feel like clay we are seeing already the pivot is coming biden is going to be speaking today it s supposed to be 1 30 eastern time folks we will join it in progress if we can who knows how late it will be but i will say this for us we know and we saw the true weighing of the biden administration and its team in a moment of crisis and they have been found wanting clay no doubt buck they are not up for this they are not the smartest guys and gals in the room they re not some team of timeless experts as they rely on clay they are not the adults as they claim buck exactly so because we know this going forward we can assess everything else they do with the full confidence that this is a buffoon squad these are the people that couldn t figure out which way was up in afghanistan let s not pretend like they know how to secure the border or how to handle crime in cities or how to be good stewards of the economy or how to push back against the socialists that are overtaking their own ranks really the socialist party is the democrat party now that s what we can all remember clay i also am curious whether the failures in afghanistan are going to immediately translate into the biden s budget the bernie budget and how that is going to play out as both the house and the senate because the pivot that is going to happen after labor day when the congressmen and the senators come into d c and that budget policy begins to be debated in earnest has biden lost some moderate support in the house have sinema and manchin being looked at this and said man we don t really want to tie our electoral futures to joe biden s regime this is a one term president we re going to lose the majority next year those are all big questions directly connected to what happened in afghanistan but first what you got for us buck buck well also clay we should look at there are still americans on the ground clay oh there s no doubt we ve got audio to prove it buck what are we going to do to get them out and what s the administration going to do clay yeah buck that s the piece that i think is delaying the pivot play because while there are americans in harm s way they can t fully get the spin cycle going break transcript clay now we were talking as we went to break there about joe biden breaking his promises and some people already buck to your point are saying well there s not really any americans left on the ground or anybody that s left in afghanistan at this point well they just didn t want to go back to america that s not true at all buck buck yeah the bull crap machinery is underway here clay yeah and there are people making those arguments already but i got to give credit clarissa ward who has been doing a fantastic job on the ground in kabul for cnn a legitimate reporter she analyzed this and said hey i can talk about a family that expressly wants to get out of afghanistan and has not been able to do so this is her telling their story ward i spoke earlier on in the day with a family of four from houston texas they told me they had been going through the airport for two weeks trying desperately to get out they all had american passports they had gone to afghanistan to visit the mother s family and essentially the issue was they couldn t get past the taliban they were in touch with the u s military the military was trying to facilitate their departure i spoke to another u s citizen a translator female translator worked with the military she was actually told she could leave but her friend who was a siv holder special immigrant visa holder would not be allowed to leave and so she made the decision to stay clay we re leaving people behind directly even cnn at least right now buck sexton is reporting that buck not even just as we re discussing this she mentioned siv holders the special immigrant visa clay yes buck some of those are translators a lot of them are people who worked for a u s contractor there were two tranches of siv holders there s the immediate military assistance siv those are the terps those are the people that guys i know in special operations are going over there i mean they ll go to the ends of the earth to save those guys because they view them as their brothers in arms and they want them to get out there were people that worked in construction for a u s based contractor or they worked at the embassy as a clerk or whatever but they re also under a different tranche of siv but we re talking about american citizens clay families buck blue passport holders families that were left behind clay yes buck how and you think how is this possible the brits the french were sending out convoys we saw the video of it the brits were sending out their guys saying we re coming to get our people i know the american military if they re told here s your objective go pick up american citizens clay especially a family buck buck in the gates of hell clay they will go and get them if asked to what happened how is that possible we didn t get them out clay it s utter incompetence it s utter incompetence it s relying on the fricking taliban and i have to be careful using the words in front of taliban there buck nobody would be mad if you slipped up talking about the taliban clay laughing buck maybe the fcc clay yeah the fcc would be mad our audience would not be mad but the idea that we are relying on a terrorist organization to safely get our people out of that country is again i m going to keep beating the drum the biggest foreign policy failure of most of our lives certainly the biggest foreign policy failure going all the way back to the vietnam war i don t think there s any doubt maybe past saigon when you really start to think about that buck clay you remember when we were talking about the saigon moment clay yes buck and we were thinking oh gosh we could be i think we all believed that we could be heading to something like that this felt worse than the saigon moment clay way worse it s way worse we are letting taliban shoot off fireworks while they fly around in our helicopters dangling people who are being hanged from the underside of american helicopters it s crazy

this article is sponsored by etoro when most people think of electric cars they think of tesla and for good reason led by the controversial genius or downright insane depending on who you ask elon musk tesla has been dominating the electric vehicle market for years to the point where owning a tesla has become somewhat of a status symbol with strong sales in china and europe and the opening of its new gigafactories in berlin shanghai and texas it seems like the only way is up for the dominant global electric vehicle manufacturer coming off its eighth successive profitable quarter tesla has solidified itself as arguably the most popular investment in the ev industry but the ev pie is a big one set to only continue to grow as the world transitions to a greener way of living and there s no reason why you shouldn t get a slice of that action with some shrewd investing sure tesla has a huge share of that sweet pie right now but they re not the only kids on the block with exciting prospects for more insight we asked etoro market analyst josh gilbert for his top ev stocks to look out for that aren t tesla nio chinese ev manufacturer nio is a giant in china like tesla it has also dominated ev trading stocks in australia over the past couple of years nio has been one of the most popular ev stocks with australian investors over the last 18 months thanks partly to its 1000 increase in 2020 says josh in its recent earnings report nio s net loss narrowed to usd 90 million which indicates the company is on track to become profitable by 2023 if it continues on this trajectory nio s next step is its launch into europe which will be essential for continued growth volkswagen according to josh electric vehicle sales surged in 2020 particularly in europe even amidst the pandemic which puts the german powerhouse volkswagen in a great position with no signs of slowing down vw is the only vehicle manufacturer to have two electric vehicles on the top 10 selling ev list in europe for 2020 says josh this simply shows how popular volkswagen is within europe the largest ev market in the world in 2020 volkswagen produced a power day similar to tesla s battery day it unveiled its roadmap to longer range evs cheaper batteries and better charging all of which were a hit with investors with this i believe volkswagen poses the biggest threat to dethroning tesla from its number one sales perch ford as the world transitions to a more environmentally friendly way of commuting with many countries planning to cut the number of combustion engine vehicles down heavily over the next decade ford has shown no plans of being left in the dust one of the more traditional brands moving into ev aggressively is ford says josh the company recently announced its usd 30 billion pledge towards ev with popular vehicles such as the f150 and mustang all receiving electric vehicle models ford also plans to go fully electric in europe by 2030 in line with government plans to ban combustion engine vehicles along with ford s strong brand recognition these pledges will ensure strong sales continue for many years to come
a recent report jointly released by three chinese think tanks titled america first the truth about america s fight against covid 19 points out that in response to the failure of the u s government s pandemic prevention and control measures the federal reserve has been indiscriminately issuing money flooding the market to alleviate the crisis if you were to rank countries by the amount of money issued the u s would win the title of leading nation for indiscriminate issuing of currency in fact america s massive injection of liquidity into the market is creating a negative spillover effect and people all over the world will have to pick up the tab for some time now the fed has been taking unconventional steps to increase the monetary supply the u s government and congress passed a number of bailout packages releasing trillions of dollars in new money in the short term these initiatives have somewhat stabilized the market but the accompanying negative effects have to be shared by the rest of the world the u s is currently exporting inflation around the world dollar liquidity is an important driver of rising global commodity prices putting pressure on business production and operation as well as on livelihoods in many countries the glut of u s dollars has triggered depreciation leading to an increase in the price of commodities sold in dollars an increase in global commodity prices has in turn pushed up the producer price index of various countries resulting in higher production costs and operational difficulties for businesses according to media reports so far this year the price of flour in lebanon has risen 219 year on year and the price of corn in mexico has risen 60 people in many countries around the world are facing a sharp rise in food prices at the same time because the u s dollar is the world s main reserve currency it can move a lot of liquidity in and out of other countries this has caused great uncertainty and instability in the capital markets of various countries leading to turmoil in international financial markets the international monetary fund warned last month that persistently high inflation data could lead the fed and central banks of other developed nations to reassess the monetary policy outlook currently the international community is watching closely to see when the fed will reduce bond purchases and raise interest rates any shift in the fed s monetary policy or even any hint of it could lead to capital outflows from emerging economies which would deal them a heavy blow emerging market economies and developing countries have had to enact painful measures to deal with the spillover effects of the floodgates opened by the u s and other countries emerging market countries such as brazil russia turkey and mexico have all raised interest rates this year even though doing so could stifle economic recovery in brazil for example the central bank announced a 100 basis point interest rate hike the largest single increase since 2003 it was also the fourth consecutive interest rate increase by brazil s central bank however according to expert analysis brazil s current gross domestic product is lower than it was before the deep recession of 2014 with current economic growth below its potential monetary policy should have adopted stimulus measures in fact excessive currency issuance has created problems for the u s itself including soaring inflation and a widening gap between rich and poor data released by the u s department of labor on aug 11 showed that the u s consumer price index year on year growth rate in july remained at the same level as it was in june with a 13 year high of 5 4 this was up four percentage points from the end of the previous year these days the international media are full of ordinary americans grumbling about the high price of goods at the same time wealthy people in the u s benefited from the stock market increase brought about by the excessive release of currency as their assets grew sharply this offers a clearer picture of the social reality in america the rich get richer and the poor get poorer at the moment people all over the world are suffering from the pandemic america s excessive issuance of currency has placed additional economic and social pressures on countries around the world and has also created greater hazards for global economic security the world s number one currency spammer is making the world suffer immensely it should adopt a more responsible monetary policy and contribute to the recovery of the global economy rather than beggar thy neighbor strategies

don t miss out on the headlines from world followed categories will be added to my news us president joe biden has hailed the extraordinary success of the withdrawal of us forces and nationals from kabul as the war in afghanistan officially ended after 20 years mr biden praised the incredibly skill and bravery of us soldiers diplomats and intelligence professionals who carried out the operation the president touted one of the biggest airlifts in history noting that more than 120 000 people who were airlifted from kabul he said no nation has ever done anything like it in all of history president joe biden speaks to the united states at the end of the war in afghanistan picture supplied mr biden said the real decision in afghanistan was between leaving and escalating i was not going to extend this forever war and i was not extending a forever exit he said the us began the final phase of its chaotic withdrawal from the country in may as the taliban seized much of the country in a lightening blitz kabul fell on august 15 and a suicide attack at kabul airport killed 13 us service members and more than 170 other people taliban celebrates return to power the hard line islamist taliban have celebrated their total return to power on with gunfire after the last us troops flew out of afghanistan to end two decades of war the united states longest military conflict drew to a close on monday night when its forces abandoned kabul airport where it had overseen a frenzied flight that saw more than 123 000 people flee taliban fighters then quickly swept into the airport and fired weapons into the sky across the city in jubilation an astonishing return after us forces invaded in 2001 weeks after the september 11 attacks and toppled them for supporting al qaeda congratulations to afghanistan this victory belongs to us all taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid told reporters hours later on the runway of the airport we highlight to every occupier that whoever sees afghanistan with an evil eye will face the same fate as the americans have faced we ve never given up to pressure or force and our nation has always sought freedom mujahid said ouths supporting the taliban wave taliban flags and shout slogans while marching along a street in kandahar on august 31 mujahid said the taliban s victory was a lesson for other invaders many afghans are terrified of a repeat of the taliban s initial rule from 1996 2001 which was infamous for their treatment of girls and women as well as a brutal justice system the taliban have repeatedly promised a more tolerant brand of rule compared with their first stint in power and mujahid continued that theme we want to have good relations with the us and the world we welcome good diplomatic relations with them all he said mujahid also insisted taliban security forces would be gentle and nice taliban fighters guard outside the airport in kabul the taliban face a daunting challenge of transforming from an insurgent group to a government in war ravaged nation dependent on foreign aid the united nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe with food stocks running low because of disruptions caused by conflict as well as a severe drought some afghans appealed to the islamist movement to keep their promise of a softer rule fawzia koofi a rights activist and former negotiator for the ousted government who has twice survived assassination attempts called on the taliban via twitter to include all afghans as they turn to governing the country taliban hear us out we must rebuild together she wrote this land belongs to all of us other activists struggled to find hope amid the gloom if i let my thoughts linger on what we have lost i will lose my mind muska dastageer who lectured at the american university of afghanistan wrote on twitter members of the taliban badri 313 military unit take a position at the airport in kabul the withdrawal came amid the august 31 deadline set by us president joe biden to end the war one that claimed the lives of more than tens of thousands of afghans and over 2400 american service members the slightly early finish followed a threat from the regional offshoot of the islamic state group rivals of the taliban to attack the us forces at the airport thirteen us troops were among more than 100 people killed when an is suicide bomber late last week attacked the perimeter of the airport where desperate afghans had massed in the hope of getting on board an evacuation flight us president joe biden the us led airlift began as the taliban completed an astonishing rout of government forces around the country and took over the capital on august 15 their victory came after mr biden withdrew nearly all american troops then was forced to send back about 6000 more to conduct the airlift mr biden said he would address the nation today in washington as his critics continued to savage him for his handling of the withdrawal we can t fight endless wars but the scope consequence of biden s failure here is staggering republican senator rick scott said mr biden s top diplomat secretary of state antony blinken was able to offer little more than stern words for the taliban any legitimacy and any support will have to be earned sec blinken said as he announced the united states had suspended its diplomatic presence in kabul and shifted its operations to qatar a member of the taliban badri 313 military unit runs to take up his position at the airport in kabul all eyes will now turn to how the taliban handle their first few days with sole authority over the country with a sharp focus on whether they will allow free departure for those wanting to leave including some foreigners sec blinken said a small number of us citizens remained in the country under 200 but likely closer to just 100 britain says the number of uk nationals inside afghanistan are in the low hundreds many thousands of afghans who had worked with the us backed government over the years and fear retribution also want to get out western allies have voiced heartbreak in recent days that not all afghans who wanted to flee could get on the evacuation flights the un security council adopted a resolution on monday requiring the taliban to honour a commitment to let people freely leave afghanistan in the days ahead and to grant access to the un and other aid agencies talks are ongoing as to who will now run kabul airport which german chancellor angela merkel warned tuesday was of existential importance because it is a lifeline for aid the taliban have asked turkey to handle logistics while they maintain control of security but president recep tayyip erdogan has not yet accepted that offer originally published as afghanistan war is over us president joe biden calls troop withdrawal extraordinary success
on the evening of august 14 jürgen behrend spokesman for the owning families hueck and röpke announced that the car supplier hella would be sold to the french group faurecia the two families own 60 percent of the shares in the listed lippstadt based group these will now become the property of faurecia by the beginning of 2022 six weeks after an earlier interested party the munich based company knorr bremse surprisingly withdrew its purchase offer due to pressure from its investors the two families have finally succeeded in flogging their share treasure at speculatively high stock market prices they will receive no less than 4 billion us 4 7 billion from the french group with its headquarters in nanterre near paris another 2 8 billion will go to the other share owners in total shares worth 6 8 billion euros will be converted into cash faurecia pays 3 4 billion of this in cash the other half the company finances with new debt in the form of bank loans and bonds what this tremendous orgy of enrichment for one or two dozen members of the owning families means for the employees of both groups hella and faurecia is the prelude to fierce struggles for plant locations jobs and wages this is not only in germany and france but worldwide both companies have development and production sites in the usa and in countries like mexico india throughout eastern and south eastern europe in south east asia and china according to the automotive news list of top 100 suppliers to the global auto industry faurecia was eighth before its takeover of hella which was listed as number 41 the move is part of the global restructuring of the global auto industry as corporations vie for control of the emerging electric and self driving vehicle markets and accelerate the attack on workers the german financial daily handelsblatt wrote on 16 august the transaction is a response to the rapidly changing automotive industry the turnaround in drive technology and the increasing importance of electronics and software are triggering a wave of consolidation and mergers that industry experts have been expecting for some time consolidation like restructuring is mckinsey lingo these euphemistic terms stand for massive job cuts extended working hours and wage reductions they stand for the closure or sale of sites and lines of business that workers have often built up over years or decades of hard work now however their disposal is supposed to bring the company and its shareholders a quick big buck faurecia s ceo patrick koller justified the takeover by saying among other things i am convinced that faurecia and hella are an excellent fit because we share a common vision values and culture if there was any truth in the flowery press statements of hella s owners and faurecia s board of directors about the rosy future of the corporation after the takeover it was this consolidation in permanence the culture of both companies is indeed the same it can best be characterised as consolidation in permanence hardly a year goes by without the management proclaiming a new streamlining or recapitalization programme for the entire group or for individual locations ceo rolf breidenbach had moved to hella from the management consultancy firm mckinsey in 2004 to this day together with family representative jürgen behrend until 2017 he manages the operative business development production and sales of headlamps and other lighting systems as well as electronic components for the world s major car manufacturers his first major cultural deed was a brutal streamlining programme named lion light on which he pushed through with the energetic help of the owner families as the manager magazin revealed on april 27 2007 jürgen behrend sent a threat to the workforces and managers of all locations via all the company s computer monitors turnover and profits from the lighting business had collapsed within 12 to 18 months the success of lion had to be proven by surplus numbers otherwise he would propose to the owner families in november 2007 to sell hella as soon as possible a sale under these conditions would inevitably have meant breaking up the group and selling off individual parts to locusts this is the name given to financial investors and hedge funds who raid companies pick out the best parts to streamline and recapitalize them for a highly profitable sale while the rest is to be shut down the programme lion was forced through within a year turnover and profits rose steeply again nevertheless soon after as an answer to the financial crisis of 2008 09 the streamlining continued there were massive relocations of production to eastern europe and china german locations like paderborn 700 employees were shut down or thinned out the number of jobs in germany fell from 14 000 in 2004 to 9 500 in 2021 whereas the number of employees worldwide rose by 50 per cent to 36 000 today all this happened thanks to the support of the betriebsrat works council and the trade union ig metall which organised some hollow protests to deflect and prevent serious measures of struggle like strikes or factory occupations the consolidation in permanence which keeps the workforce in a permanent state of fear and anxiety and drives them to work harder and harder can only be forced through with the help of the works councils and the union as the most recent events show streamlining phoenix in 2019 20 200 jobs were cut at the main plant in lippstadt a little later in august 2020 breidenbach announced the phoenix streamlining programme like the mythical figure phoenix rising from his ashes the company was to rise again to financial splendour after a year of some decline in sales and profits nine hundred jobs will be wiped out this year and next in administration at the headquarters in lippstadt and 450 more by the immediate closure of the regensburg and würzburg sites and other measures investments in the development site for software and electronics in romania and lithuania however are being expanded engineers and production workers there receive only 27 percent 2020 of the wages paid in germany both gross and net in poland the figure is 32 percent as a result according to the latest annual report from august 19 the corporation is in better shape than ever and better off than any other automotive supplier in the world it is completely debt free and has an equity ratio of more than 40 percent in the entire automotive supplier industry this ratio is on average 21 percent at faurecia only 18 percent despite the coronavirus pandemic revenue has risen by 13 percent to 6 5 billion while profits have more than doubled to 510 million euros in technological terms only 10 percent of revenue is still dependent on the installation of hella components in vehicles with combustion engines from this point of view hella is also prepared for the changeover of the automotive industry to electric drives in addition lighting systems are no longer the main drivers of sales but electronic components such as radar sensors and driver assistance systems the company is making big money on the road to highly automated driving the owner families can therefore already chalk up a complete success for the phoenix streamlining programme and crown it with the sale of hella the share prices have risen by 50 per cent this year and so the price of sale has also skyrocketed from the point of view of technological orientation and profitability for hella the takeover by faurecia makes no sense the sole and all dominant motive of the owner families is the unbridled greed to profit from the current stock market bonanza and to make as much money as possible before the prices collapse again at some point there is no other reason we didn t want to wait was the answer of family spokesman jürgen behrend to the astonished question of the handelsblatt of why the family was selling hella now despite its impressive technical and financial position the 150 000 employees of the newly merged group permanent production workers on staff temporary workers as well as development engineers and administrative staff and finally hundreds if not thousands of external engineering service providers are to pay for this the fact that faurecia is financing half of the takeover with new debt bringing the total debt mountain to 6 5 billion indicates that rapidly a cruel restructuring programme will start the workforces of hella and faurecia are to finance the repayment of the debt through intensified exploitation faurecia has already announced the sale of sites and lines of business worth 500 million but this is only the beginning mckinsey hatchet man and hella ceo rolf breidenbach is waiting in the wings he like other executives is to play a prominent role in the management of the group after the merger according to the press release of august 15 consolidation in permanence at faurecia since 1999 when it was founded as a subsidiary of french carmaker psa faurecia has grown from a company with 32 000 employees to a global group with 114 000 employees exclusively through a large number of acquisitions of rival companies these always followed the same pattern financed by the parent company psa and loans and then followed by massive job and wage cuts in the plants taken over here too the trade unions and their works councils played a decisive role a typical example is the plant in scheuerfeld rhineland palatinate in 2011 over 530 workers were still producing car interiors there in 2012 faurecia s management announced it wanted to close the site because it was not making enough profit ig metall and the works council agreed to cut 30 jobs and to extend the working week from 35 to 37 5 hours without wage compensation as the price for saving the site but the job slashing continued today less than 200 jobs remain holiday and christmas bonuses have been cut by 25 percent and the workweek increased to 38 5 hours according to a report in the rhein zeitung the union s first representative in charge proudly commented on this result at a works meeting on september 7 2020 saying scheuerfeld is one of the most successful faurecia plants in europe the plants in unna stadthagen and lohr have already been completely closed after similar years of wage sacrifice when the union ig metall now announces negotiations on the preservation of the lippstadt site and the first authorised representative of ig metall of lippstadt britta peter accompanies this with the words we must become more agile in germany to remain competitive alarm bells should be ringing for all workers at hella and faurecia the socialist equality party sgp is urgently warning workers not to put the slightest trust in the hollow speeches of trade union officials about concepts for the future and saving the site becoming more agile to stay competitive that s mckinsey rhetoric for longer and flexible working hours on call job cuts and lower wages role model faurecia usa the model for this agility is the conditions in the faurecia plants in the usa when the corporation acquired operations at the former ford plant in saline michigan to become one of the largest parts makers in north america the company imposed across the board pay cuts and massive job destruction this was followed by a shop floor regime of ruthless speed ups and unsafe conditions enforced with the full collusion of the united auto workers uaw at the gladstone plant in columbus indiana the company has just announced it will lay off one of three shifts and introduce a 12 hour working day for the other two the working hours will be flexible and will depend on demand from day to day the assembly lines will also run on weekends this agile production programme is fully supported by the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew the union in charge of the gladstone plant a year ago the gladstone rank and file safety committee was formed by workers at the plant to fight against the dangerous working conditions produced by the pandemic because the union is also fully on the side of the company on this issue as well the rank and file committee responded to the attacks announced with an appeal to their colleagues and other faurecia plants to take up a fight independently of the uaw the ibew and other pro company unions the last two years have seen a growing wave of struggles by auto and auto parts workers in western and eastern european countries mexico korea the united states and other countries this includes the current struggle by dana workers the socialist equality party sgp in germany proposes to all workers at hella and faurecia to follow the example of their class brothers and sisters at gladstone and other faurecia locations in the us don t waste any time prepare the formation of action committees to take up the fight to unconditionally defend wages working conditions and every job into their own hands independent of the unions and works councils get in touch with the action committees that have already been formed in the usa with the same aims the sgp and wsws can support you and establish the connection take up the fight for the international unification of the working class in the struggle for a socialist transformation of society where everything revolves around the interests of the lives of billions of working people rather than around the profits of a few millionaires and billionaires

don t miss out on the headlines from news followed categories will be added to my news us president joe biden has hailed the extraordinary success of the withdrawal of us forces and nationals from kabul as the war in afghanistan officially ended after 20 years mr biden praised the incredibly skill and bravery of us soldiers diplomats and intelligence professionals who carried out the operation the president touted one of the biggest airlifts in history noting more than 120 000 individuals who were airlifted from kabul he said no nation has ever done anything like it in all of history president joe biden speaks to the united states at the end of the war in afghanistan picture supplied the us began the final phase of its chaotic withdrawal from the country in may as the taliban seized much of the country in a lightening blitz kabul fell on august 15 and a suicide attack at kabul airport killed 13 us service members and more than 170 other people taliban celebrates return to power the hard line islamist taliban have celebrated their total return to power on with gunfire after the last us troops flew out of afghanistan to end two decades of war the united states longest military conflict drew to a close on monday night when its forces abandoned kabul airport where it had overseen a frenzied flight that saw more than 123 000 people flee taliban fighters then quickly swept into the airport and fired weapons into the sky across the city in jubilation an astonishing return after us forces invaded in 2001 weeks after the september 11 attacks and toppled them for supporting al qaeda congratulations to afghanistan this victory belongs to us all taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid told reporters hours later on the runway of the airport we highlight to every occupier that whoever sees afghanistan with an evil eye will face the same fate as the americans have faced we ve never given up to pressure or force and our nation has always sought freedom mujahid said ouths supporting the taliban wave taliban flags and shout slogans while marching along a street in kandahar on august 31 mujahid said the taliban s victory was a lesson for other invaders many afghans are terrified of a repeat of the taliban s initial rule from 1996 2001 which was infamous for their treatment of girls and women as well as a brutal justice system the taliban have repeatedly promised a more tolerant brand of rule compared with their first stint in power and mujahid continued that theme we want to have good relations with the us and the world we welcome good diplomatic relations with them all he said mujahid also insisted taliban security forces would be gentle and nice taliban fighters guard outside the airport in kabul the taliban face a daunting challenge of transforming from an insurgent group to a government in war ravaged nation dependent on foreign aid the united nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe with food stocks running low because of disruptions caused by conflict as well as a severe drought some afghans appealed to the islamist movement to keep their promise of a softer rule fawzia koofi a rights activist and former negotiator for the ousted government who has twice survived assassination attempts called on the taliban via twitter to include all afghans as they turn to governing the country taliban hear us out we must rebuild together she wrote this land belongs to all of us other activists struggled to find hope amid the gloom if i let my thoughts linger on what we have lost i will lose my mind muska dastageer who lectured at the american university of afghanistan wrote on twitter members of the taliban badri 313 military unit take a position at the airport in kabul the withdrawal came amid the august 31 deadline set by us president joe biden to end the war one that claimed the lives of more than tens of thousands of afghans and over 2400 american service members the slightly early finish followed a threat from the regional offshoot of the islamic state group rivals of the taliban to attack the us forces at the airport thirteen us troops were among more than 100 people killed when an is suicide bomber late last week attacked the perimeter of the airport where desperate afghans had massed in the hope of getting on board an evacuation flight us president joe biden the us led airlift began as the taliban completed an astonishing rout of government forces around the country and took over the capital on august 15 their victory came after mr biden withdrew nearly all american troops then was forced to send back about 6000 more to conduct the airlift mr biden said he would address the nation today in washington as his critics continued to savage him for his handling of the withdrawal we can t fight endless wars but the scope consequence of biden s failure here is staggering republican senator rick scott said mr biden s top diplomat secretary of state antony blinken was able to offer little more than stern words for the taliban any legitimacy and any support will have to be earned sec blinken said as he announced the united states had suspended its diplomatic presence in kabul and shifted its operations to qatar a member of the taliban badri 313 military unit runs to take up his position at the airport in kabul all eyes will now turn to how the taliban handle their first few days with sole authority over the country with a sharp focus on whether they will allow free departure for those wanting to leave including some foreigners sec blinken said a small number of us citizens remained in the country under 200 but likely closer to just 100 britain says the number of uk nationals inside afghanistan are in the low hundreds many thousands of afghans who had worked with the us backed government over the years and fear retribution also want to get out western allies have voiced heartbreak in recent days that not all afghans who wanted to flee could get on the evacuation flights the un security council adopted a resolution on monday requiring the taliban to honour a commitment to let people freely leave afghanistan in the days ahead and to grant access to the un and other aid agencies talks are ongoing as to who will now run kabul airport which german chancellor angela merkel warned tuesday was of existential importance because it is a lifeline for aid the taliban have asked turkey to handle logistics while they maintain control of security but president recep tayyip erdogan has not yet accepted that offer originally published as afghanistan war is over us president joe biden calls troop withdrawal extraordinary success
archaeologists examining artifacts collected from a site in italy found that an archaic hominin species had made elephant bone tools including pointed tools for carving meat and wedge shaped tools for cracking open large femurs and other long bones 400 000 years ago this is hundreds of thousands of years before such a thing had been considered possible these innovative toolmakers lived in the middle pleistocene epoch at least 100 000 years before modern man first appeared in far off africa fig 12 from the study showing unifaces and pointed tools made with elephant bones found at the castel di guido site rome italy a c unifaces with a side scraper edge d pointed wedge base is battered e f pointed tools on bovid diaphysis fragments catalogue numbers 326 2807 g h pointed tools plos one a total of 98 flaked elephant bone tools were found this astonishing discovery was made by a team of researchers from italy france south africa and the united states headed by university of colorado boulder archaeology professor paola villa they studied elephant bone tools excavated between 1979 to 1991 from the castel di guido site near rome and in the process revealed fascinating details about the craftsmanship involved in making these bone tools writing about their findings in the plos one journal study the archaeologists note that the 98 verified elephant bone tools found at castel di guido represent the highest number of flaked bone tools made by pre modern hominids published so far acknowledging the advanced techniques used to make these rare tools the archaeologists credit the ancient toolmakers with completing the first step in the process of increasing complexity of bone technology in the middle pleistocene there was a stream running through castel di guido an extinct eurasian straight tusked elephant species used the stream as a source of fresh water and archaic humans were drawn to the area as well and likely settled very nearby occasionally one of these 13 foot four meter tall elephants would die of natural causes and the local hominins would then scavenge the massive remains for hides meat and bones these elephant bones were strong and sturdy which made them suitable for use as tools they were often broken randomly into pieces and used as they were but sometimes toolmakers would customize the bones by using rocks or other pieces of bone to break off flakes or chunks carefully working the bone s shape until it was just as they wanted not all the bone tools found at the castel de guido site were made from elephant bones fig 14 from the study shows the polished tip of an aurochs a species wild cattle bone compared with an ancient horse bone tool from germany bottom right these tools are known as lissoirs which ancient humans used to treat leather with plos one in this case the tools were modified in ways that were unusual 400 000 years ago we see other sites with bone tools at this time professor paola villa who is also the adjoint curator at the cu boulder museum of natural history explained in a university of colorado boulder press release but there isn t this variety of well defined shapes at castel di guido humans were breaking the long bones of the elephants in a standardized manner and producing standardized blanks to make bone tools villa continued this kind of aptitude didn t become common until much later much later in this instance means up to 100 000 years later until recently the generally accepted idea was that early bone technology was essentially immediate and expedient based on single stage operations using available bone fragments of large to medium size animals villa and her colleagues wrote in their plos one article only upper paleolithic bone tools would involve several stages of manufacture with clear evidence of primary flaking or breaking of bone to produce the kind of fragments required for different kinds of tools the discovery of the work of the castel di guido toolmakers has shattered the previous timeline it s left archaeologists questioning everything they thought they new about the development of human toolmaking practices on the eurasian continent it seems that the process was not linear and that it progressed much faster in at least one small part of the world did the neanderthals live at castel di guido the lead author of the study archaeology professor paola villa colorado university boulder believes the neanderthals as the likely makers of these extremely old elephant bone tools gorodenkoff adobe stock did neanderthals or homo erectus live at castel di guido so far archaeologists working at castel di guido have failed to find the fossilized remains of ancient humans such a discovery could have helped them to pin down the true identity of the ancient toolmakers nevertheless paola villa has a theory about who they might have been she believes they were neanderthals the long extinct cousin of modern humans who were in eurasia during the middle pleistocene about 400 000 years ago you start to see the habitual use of fire and it s the beginning of the neanderthal lineage villa explained this is a very important period for castel di guido it is hardly surprising that villa would identify the neanderthals as the likely toolmakers she is considered one of the world s top experts on the neanderthals and her contributions have helped reverse previous negative judgments about their intellectual capacities and their level of cultural and social development another possible candidate for who made these bone tools would be homo erectus york adobe stock another possible toolmaking candidate would be homo erectus this ancient ancestor of homo sapiens modern man first emerged more than two million years ago and by 400 000 years ago they were living throughout europe and asia they were the first hominin species to demonstrate impressive toolmaking skills although they would have had to have been more advanced than believed to have produced the elephant bone tools found in italy whoever the manufacturers were the tools they created were impressively diverse the crafted objects found at castel di guido included tools with sharp points which could have been used to cut meat there were also bone wedges that could have been used to splinter large long and heavy elephant bones into smaller pieces one tool was especially sophisticated long and smooth at one end this object was identified as a lissoir which ancient humans used to treat leather all previously discovered lissoirs have been dated to 300 000 ago or later and of all the tools discovered at castel di guido this is the one that pushes the archaeological record back the furthest interestingly this particular tool was not made from an elephant bone it was shaped from a wild cattle bone instead the ancient toolmakers at castel di guido were obviously happy to use elephant bones whenever possible but they didn t rely on them exclusively as a source of raw material professor paola villa lead author of the study doesn t think the castel di guido hominins who made the elephant bone tools were unusually smart compared to neanderthals living in other areas leakey foundation innovation determined by circumstance paola villa doesn t think the castel di guido hominins were unusually smart compared to neanderthals living in other areas she believes they used the resources that were available to them as best they could and because they didn t have access to large pieces of flint at their location they turned to elephant bones as an alternative elephant bones weren t so easy to find elsewhere so other hominin groups wouldn t have had the opportunity to explore the tool manufacturing possibilities so thoroughly at other sites 400 000 years ago people were just using whatever bone fragments they had available villa noted the castel di guido people had cognitive intellects that allowed them to produce complex bone technology at other assemblages there were enough bones for people to make a few pieces but not enough to begin a standardized and systematic production of bone tools the castel di guido hominins were pioneers but they remained relatively isolated with limited chances to pass on what they d learned to others consequently the techniques they perfected would need to be rediscovered independently by others at various times in the future top image a closeup of a few of the 98 verified elephant bone tools found in rome italy which have been attributed to an archaic hominin species based on a recent study

social security s revenue will begin to decline this year crossing a critical fiscal threshold as the program begins a slide toward depletion of its trust funds in little more than a decade the program s trustees said in a stark report tuesday and both of social security s benefit programs old age survivors insurance for older adults and disability insurance for those unable to work failed the trustees tests of short range financial adequacy the revenue decline had been predicted in previous reports but its arrival is still a stark warning sign in the federal government s fiscal health checkup the trustees said that while the trajectory has been grim for some time the coronavirus pandemic and the economic downturn it spawned took a significant toll on social security slicing a year off the deadline for when the trust funds will be depleted and the program will no longer be able to pay out full promised benefits the new deadline is 2034 and payments will be reduced to 78 of what was promised the trustees said the pandemic and precipitous recession have clearly had significant effects on the actuarial status of the oasi and di trust funds and the future course of the pandemic is still uncertain the trustees said medicare was also slammed by the pandemic said the trustees as income plummeted and expenses surged with payments for testing and treatment of an older population particularly ravaged by the disease but medicare beneficiaries also put off procedures amid the pandemic more than offsetting the new costs the trustees said in a separate report on medicare the federal health program for those 65 and older the trustees didn t calculate the impact of higher death rates on medicare but said otherwise the pandemic is expected not to change the program s outlook where it faces a substantial financial shortfall the 2021 reports are the first to take full stock of the pandemic for social security the trustees said covid 19 deaths have cut into the projected growth of old age beneficiaries it also said people were chased out of the workforce sapping the program of income and a birth dearth has cut into the future workers the program had projected in previous reports last year s report came early in the pandemic and didn t include much of the economic chaos the virus has caused social security is funded by a payroll tax applied to wages earned it is not a welfare program but is instead supposed to be a type of pension in which americans across the income spectrum pay into it and get benefits commensurate with those payments the program s finances have been declining for years with annual payroll tax income insufficient to cover the program s benefit payments since 2010 but the program has been coasting on interest paid into the trust funds over the previous 25 years when revenue was greater than payouts and the excess income was pumped into the trust funds earning interest from intragovernmental loans this year will be the first that the combined income from payroll taxes and interest won t be enough to cover promised benefits the trustees said that imbalance will continue for the rest of the century with the two combined trust funds depleted in 2034 under the law social security then will have to cut its payments to meet income and will pay out 78 cents on each dollar the program has promised to pay by 2095 the end of the 75 year actuarial period the trustees studied the program will pay out 74 cents of each dollar promised if we wanted to fix the system and we wanted to act immediately we would have to cut benefits 21 next year said chuck blahous who used to serve as one of the public trustees for social security underlying the imbalance is the ratio of workers supporting retirees from 1974 to 2008 the ratio was 3 2 to 3 4 workers per beneficiary that began to decline with the great recession and is now down to 2 7 workers per beneficiary by 2035 when baby boomers will mostly have retired it will be 2 3 workers per beneficiary efforts to overhaul social security have gone nowhere on capitol hill over the years with democrats demands for bigger benefit checks sunk by the fiscal realities of paying for them on tuesday a key democrat said it s time to try again it has been 50 years since congress has done anything to improve benefits said rep john b larson chairman of the house ways and means committee s social security subcommittee the covid 19 pandemic has underscored just how important this program is to our country never missing a payment even during economic downturns we must work to expand benefits now and strengthen the program for today s seniors and generations to come even before talk of expanding benefits though budget watchdogs said it s time congress fixes the existing imbalance it makes no sense that we allow programs as essential as social security and medicare to remain on such shaky and uncertain fiscal ground said michael a peterson ceo of the peter g peterson foundation he said the solutions are known and it is fully within our lawmakers control to put these programs on a more sustainable path mr blahous said the numbers are so bad that both sides of the

opened quietly and tracked a relatively steady path to be up 50 points with 20 minutes to go then in came some profit takers while a close of up 0 4 did actually match the s p500 overnight and it was the final day of individual stock influence from earnings reports the session smacked largely of end of month window dressing hence the late sell off and noting the fact the futures are down 33 points this morning for no obvious reason so we reset for september historically the weakest month of the year ahead of october historically the most volatile with our earnings season now out of the way and the long us earnings season all but over we head into a bit of a dead period in september at least until the fed meeting in three weeks otherwise vaccination rates will be clearly in the spotlight and on that count we finally seem to be doing quite well sector wise we saw technology up 1 9 yesterday following the nasdaq industrials up 1 2 property up 1 2 staples up 1 1 and with more index clout

the last few days of the summer break which unofficially ends with the labor day long weekend this weekend there will nevertheless be the august jobs numbers to deal with on friday night not providing much impetus was the conference board s monthly consumer confidence index which has slid to a six month low of 113 8 from 125 1 in july economists had forecast 123 1 so it s a significant miss driven according to the survey by delta and inflation fears this survey corroborates michigan uni s separate survey numbers which fell in each of its fortnightly surveys in august to also miss expectations the question for wall street now is can the market book yet another month of gains in the seasonally weakest month of the year there has not been one 5 pullback all year the bears suggest a pullback

edmond h fischer a nobel prize winning biochemist whose work with a colleague on cellular enzymes led to major advances in the treatment of disease died aug 27 at his home in seattle he was 101 the death was confirmed by his granddaughter elyse fischer who said there was no specific cause dr fischer who was born in shanghai and spent much of his youth in switzerland settled in seattle in 1953 almost immediately he began to work on research projects with a university of washington colleague edwin krebs known as ed krebs and eddy dr fischer the scientists approached their research on cellular properties from different directions dr fischer was trained as a chemist and the iowa born krebs had been a navy doctor during world war ii the scientists were interested in studying the enzymes that contribute to muscle contraction they focused on phosphorylase an enzyme that exists in active and inactive forms but at the time it was not known how or why those forms were different advertisement we never found out but what we stumbled on was a totally different type of reaction dr fischer said in 1992 when he and krebs were announced as winners of the nobel prize in physiology or medicine sharing an award of 1 2 million they discovered a biochemical phenomenon called reversible protein phosphorylation in which a natural process adds or removes phosphates in cell proteins dr fischer and krebs identified an enzyme that carries out the process of phosphorylation and also determined that the process is reversible the significance of their discovery was not immediately recognized when we found out this reaction we didn t know if it was something very unique very unimportant dr fischer told the associated press in 1992 by the 1970s however it had become the basis for far reaching research and their work has been cited in thousands of studies by other scientists advertisement it s a very widespread mechanism dr fischer told the new york times this is how hormones work it s how a cell grows how a cell differentiates how a cell dies how cancer proceeds and so forth the discovery has helped scientists explain cellular division and metabolism the release of hormones and the conversion of glycogen stored in the body to glucose the energy source of physical activity through the work of dr fischer and krebs researchers have gained a better understanding of alzheimer s disease diabetes and certain forms of cancer including leukemia it has also led to the development of drugs that reduce the body s rejection of transplanted organs dr fischer and krebs who died in 2009 continued their laboratory work together for many years you know where you start but you never know where you ll end up dr fischer told the seattle times describing the sometimes unexpected results of basic scientific research advertisement before you can cure a disease he added you have to understand the mechanism of the disease share this article share edmond henri fischer was born april 6 1920 in shanghai his father was an austrian born lawyer who was also in the import export business his mother was from a cultured french family that had previously lived in hanoi his maternal grandfather started a french language newspaper and school in shanghai young edmond spoke french at home and learned english on the streets of shanghai where it was widely used by the city s large european population beginning at age 7 he was educated at swiss boarding schools his father had tuberculosis and eventually died of it prompting his son to want to study science in an effort to find a cure for the disease at the university of geneva dr fischer received degrees in biology and chemistry followed by a doctorate in chemistry in 1947 he also studied at a music conservatory and considered a career as a concert pianist before settling on science advertisement in the early 1950s dr fischer had a postdoctoral fellowship to caltech in pasadena he was soon offered a faculty position at the university of washington s medical school accepting the job in part because the region reminded him of switzerland he had dual u s and swiss citizenship and was affiliated with the university for 68 years dr fischer s first wife nelly gagnaux died in 1961 his second wife beverly bullock whom he married in 1963 died in 2006 survivors include two sons from his first marriage a stepdaughter from his second marriage and four grandchildren in recent years dr fischer often spoke to students as part of the lindau nobel laureate meetings a program in which nobel recipients discuss their experiences in june he sat at his piano and played the opening lines of beethoven s ode to joy from memory as part of the lindau organization s virtual orchestra advertisement dr fischer said he learned that he had been awarded the nobel prize when he was awakened by a phone call from a journalist at 3 45 a m my first thought was who is this guy he said in a university of washington biographical sketch does he want to sell me stocks or replace the gutters on the house later the muscular dystrophy association which partially supported the research done by dr fischer and krebs invited them to appear on a television program how has your life changed since the nobel prize they asked us dr fischer recalled we said here s how you see that limo waiting for us downstairs two years ago it would have been a yellow cab instead
emmanuel addeh in abuja with agency report the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec and its allies expect the oil market to be in deficit at least until the end of 2021 and stocks to stay relatively low until may 2022 sources told reuters yesterday opec led by russia meets today to set policy during which it is likely to roll over existing policies despite pressure from the united states to pump more oil still the forecast for a tighter market strengthens the case for a speedier output increases by opec as benchmark brent oil prices traded close to 73 per barrel not far off their multi year highs on tuesday the comments from sources came as experts from the opec joint technical committee jtc presented an updated report on the state of the oil markets in 2021 2022 according to the sources the report which has not been made public forecasts a 0 9 million barrel per day bpd deficit this year as global demand recovers from the coronavirus pandemic while opec gradually brings back production initially the report had seen a surplus of 2 5 million bpd building in 2022 but it was later revised to a smaller surplus of 1 6 million bpd according to the sources as a result commercial oil inventories will remain below their 2015 2019 average until may 2022 as apposed to the initial forecast for january 2022 the jtc presentation showed according to the sources the jtc had expected global oil demand to grow by 5 95 million bpd this year and by 3 28 million bpd next year it was not clear if those figures have been revised up in the latest report the jtc meeting on tuesday took stock of the oil market and made recommendation to the ministerial meeting scheduled for wednesday afternoon the ministers of the opec group are set to discuss market developments and possibly consider whether the planned monthly increases in production by 400 000 bpd are warranted in light of signs that global oil demand recovery could falter with the spike in the delta variant coronavirus cases most analysts as well as opec sources signal that the group will decide on wednesday to proceed with the easing of the cuts opec also sees growing demand despite the covid resurgence according to its latest monthly oil market report momr global oil demand is expected to average 96 6 million bpd this year and exceed 100 million bpd in the second half of 2022 opec said in the report on august 12 keeping its estimates from a month ago unchanged despite the covid resurgence in major economies
file in this may 13 2021 file photo a man walks into central station next to canadian national headquarters in montreal canadian national s 33 6 billion deal to acquire kansas city southern railroad is in jeopardy after federal regulators rejected a key part of the plan tuesday aug 31 2021 and opened the door for a competing 31 billion offer from canadian pacific railroad graham hughes the canadian press via ap file canadian national s 33 6 billion deal to acquire kansas city southern railroad is in jeopardy after federal regulators on tuesday rejected a key part of the plan and opened the door for a competing 31 billion offer from canadian pacific railway the surface transportation board said canadian national won t be able to use a voting trust to acquire kansas city southern and hold the railroad while the board reviews the overall deal it wasn t immediately clear whether kansas city southern will still want to move forward with the deal without a voting trust that would allow shareholders to get paid before the regulatory board embarks on its lengthy review of the deal plus kansas city southern is now free to accept cp s offer which already has regulatory approval to move forward advertisement kansas city southern and canadian national railroads didn t immediately react publicly to the ruling tuesday the surface transportation board said the proposed voting trust is not consistent with the public interest standard under the board s merger regulations now that regulators have rejected canadian national s plan to use a voting trust it wasn t immediately clear whether kansas city southern will go forward with a scheduled sept 3 shareholder vote on the canadian national deal shares in canadian national railroad co rose more than 7 on wall street tuesday canadian pacific railway ltd fell 4 5 and kansas city southern lost 4 4 an investment fund that says it controls more than 5 of canadian national s stock sent a letter tuesday urging the railroad to abandon the kansas city southern deal shake up its top management and board and refocus its efforts on improving its own operations the london based investment firm tci fund said it expects cn s chairman and ceo to both resign in the wake of the failed deal it is time to do the right thing accept the deal cannot be done and withdraw from the transaction said tci which is also a major shareholder in canadian pacific the surface transportation board essentially decided that using a voting trust offered more benefit to the companies than it did to the public said edward jones analyst jeff windau and the deal was likely to face increased scrutiny because of its potential impact on competition the board seem to agree with concerns canadian pacific raised about the competitive impact across the central united states kcs and cn operate parallel rail lines connecting the midwest to the gulf coast so allowing those two to combine would eliminate a shipping option for many companies the stb decision clearly shows that the cn kcs merger proposal is illusory and not achievable cp ceo keith creel said he said cp s aug 10 offer to buy kansas city southern remains on the table the surface transportation board also said that allowing canadian national s acquisition of kansas city southern to move forward could inspire additional rail consolidation canadian pacific originally announced an agreement to buy kcs for roughly 275 per share in march but canadian national intervened with its 325 per share offer and eventually won over kansas city southern s board in may after sweetening its offer to include more stock earlier this month canadian pacific came back with a 31 billion offer that valued kcs at roughly 300 per share that kansas city southern s board rejected cp officials maintained throughout the bidding war that they didn t see a need to outbid canadian national because they didn t think cn s plan would get approved because of concerns about its impact on competition regulators have already approved canadian pacific s plan to use a voting trust to acquire kansas city southern so that deal has a clear path to move forward if kcs accepts cp s offer and shareholders of both railroads approve it there are fewer competitive concerns about that proposed merger because there is little overlap between the two railroads networks even after the deal the combined railroad would be the smallest of the major north american railroads using a voting trust will allow kansas city southern shareholders to be paid upfront before the surface transportation board embarks on its full review of the deal which may take more than 18 months if regulators ultimately reject the deal then the voting trust would sell off kansas city southern so it could remain independent the surface transportation board hasn t approved any major railroad mergers since the 1990s it has generally said that any deal involving one of the nation s six largest railroads needs to enhance competition and serve the public interest to get approved the board has also said it would consider whether any deal would destabilize the industry and prompt additional mergers for more than two decades the railroad industry has been stable with two railroads in the western united states bnsf and union pacific two in the eastern united states csx and norfolk southern and the two canadian railroads that serve part of the united states ____ this story has been corrected to remove reference to a 1 billion breakup fee that kansas city southern was due to receive now that regulators rejected canadian national s plan to use a voting trust in the acquisition there is no breakup fee due at this stage
to hire or not to hire when starting a business that should not be the question rather you would rather want to ask who to hire according to the us small business administration when forming a company as an llc or a corporation in most states in the united states a business must designate a registered agent keeping a registered agent on file becomes an ongoing corporate compliance responsibility for those businesses there are three options to deciding on a registered agent the owner acting as its own registered agent appointing a friend or family member as the registered agent or hiring a registered agent service it is advised to go with the third option here is why advantages to hiring a registered agent service when you choose to be your own registered agent you must be available to receive documents and correspondence during the hours you specify which limits your flexibility and freedom making hiring a registered service to be the better option one of the most significant benefits of using a registered service agent is the ability to keep your business private the company s address will not be registered or listed in a public record avoiding the embarrassment of receiving a lawsuit in front of your employees or customers there are legal requirements for filing reports and other government documents a registered agent is there to keep the company informed of these requirements and to notify them of certain deadlines this ensures that the company is legally compliant running your own company can be time consuming and your attention must be divided among several tasks another benefit of using a registered agent is that they provide assistance this relieves a lot of unnecessary stress and allows you to concentrate on other aspects of the business even though you have to pay a little extra for this service the amount of time you save makes up for it at the end of the day the advantages outweigh the disadvantages registered agent defined a registered agent is a person or company who receives critical information official documents and correspondence from state federal and other government bodies they send this information to your company so that you can respond properly and on time the registered agent serves as the point of contact for all legal documents and communications these legal documents includes official letters and communication from your state s secretary of state division of companies or other state office in charge of llcs and corporations notices of service of process such as when your corporation or llc is sued or must appear in court correspondence information and notices from the federal government taxation forms and payment requests as well as requests for permissions corporate filings or reports to be completed if you choose to be your own registered agent or appoint a friend or family member there are three requirements that needs to be met the individual must be 18 years or older a physical address in the state where the company is formed must be presented the person needs to be available to receive any correspondence during the set out office hours choosing the best option there are many registered agent services available in the u s but the following two are the most popular they are known for their value for money and excellent client service northwest registered agent northwest the more expensive option offers an incorporation package for 225 plus state fees this may appear to be a lot of money but what is included makes it well worth it northwest has corporate guides who handle all of your filing requirements as well as annual report compliance they provide premium registered agent services for free for the first year northwest goes above and beyond to protect your company s data they even set up compliance calendars to remind owners of important dates incfile unlike northwest which only offers one package incfile offers three silver gold and platinum silver is the entry level package and costs nothing you only need to pay the state fee the incfile silver package includes the preparation and filing of your formation articles as well as a full year of registered agent service in addition you will receive a corporate tax consultation which northwest does not provide if you choose the gold or platinum packages you will gain access to additional features a legal form collection as well as a business website and domain name are among the features it does not matter what type of business you want to form to appoint or hire a registered agent should be on the top of your priority list due to the fact that it is a legal requirement in most u s states story by virginia sagal

ever since last year s raucously entertaining and for some massively profitable gamestop and amc entertainment short squeezes investors have been looking for the next hot meme stock for quick returns this year continues to be a banner year for retail investors whose unexpected power to drive and impact markets has now been felt far and wide in total more than 10 million new brokerage accounts were opened by individuals in 2020 just in the first six month of this 2021 more than 10 million new retail clients jumped into the market goldman sachs noted that a few months after the gamestop saga retail investors slowed down but they picked up the investing pace again in may when this all turned into a meme stock megatrend and now both gamestop and ams are back on the radar and have gained more than 1 000 and 2 600 respectively this year in may during a five day meme stock rally those two stocks cost short sellers 930 million their losses extended into the following months as well here are 5 meme stocks worth watching for those looking to get in on this retail trading frenzy 1 gamestop nyse gme this isn t over the poster child of meme stocks gamestop has seen another big rise in the past week topping 209 per share at market close on monday august 30th for these meme stocks there doesn t have to be any fundamental background or special market event for a sudden surge that said there s a lot of excitement swirling around gamestop s q2 earnings report which is due on september 8 some retail investors may be piling in again based on sentiment that q2 earnings may impress but the fact remains that investors aren t even aware of gamestop s plans including the make or break strategy for shifting from brick and mortar to online sales as a primary revenue generator 2 amc nyse amc when reality is no longer reality amc is also popping again presumably due to the fact that theaters have reopened and ticket sales are on the mend after a devastating pandemic shutdown that shouldn t be quite enough for a company that also hasn t let investors know what s supposed to come next the reality from wall street s perspective is that this stock will lose big this year and continue to lose next year too and ticket sales alone won t help it there s too much debt to deal with again this is all apparently irrelevant to retail meme traders 3 palo alto nyse panw cybersecurity specialist palo alto networks has its shares up 65 for the past 12 months even though the company remains unprofitable on top of that the management expects fiscal 2021 revenue to increase by as much as 25 the average price target is 433 222 which means analysts expect the stock to rise by 10 40 over the next 12 months a steady stream of high profile cyberattacks last year and this year indicates that cyber security companies will be busy global ransomware attacks soared in 2020 a 158 spike in north america alone over the previous year the total amount paid at least that which was reported was 350 million a 311 increase over 2019 from a fundamental market perspective any cybersecurity company has potential right now but why palo alto specifically there is more to this one than gamestop and amc in terms of fundamentals most notably palo alto s q4 earnings saw revenue rise 28 yoy and they ended up beating estimates by 50 million in q1 of fiscal 2022 the company is eyeing a 28 jump in revenue yoy 4 peloton nasdaq pton the ride of a lifetime this is a meme stock going in the other direction now pelonton has greatly benefited from the pandemic and also seized on the opportunity early by boosting sales and marketing expenses by over 50 even with a bike price of 2 245 and the pelton treadmill 4 295 revenue skyrocketed 128 to 1 06 billion from 466 3 million a year earlier topping expectations for 1 03 billion the year over year sales increased 232 for the first quarter of its 2021 fiscal year and the company its connected fitness subscribers rose 135 to a record 2 3 million users but it s got some problems not the least of which are a government mandated safety recall after treadmill related deaths and then peloton s initial attempt to ignore complaints and q2 earnings last thursday didn t exactly shine investors saw the company cut the price of its top selling product by 20 but then spend a lot more on marketing growth is clearly slowing and becoming less profitable the meme lovers will be expected to start fighting back now after this week s loss 5 robinhood nasdaq hood the meme of memes robinhood the most popular trading app especially among novice and young traders and especially for meme stocks is also the newest meme stock itself since it started its nasdaq listing in early august saw its shares trading halted several times due to volatility yet shares of the commission free trading app surged nearly 50 in the first few days of trading robinhood was also one of the most commented stocks during its ipo week on reddit s wallstreetbets channel for better or worse the subreddit members the same ones behind the gamestop and amc short squeeze are still angry at the platform s multiple outages and restrictions which left them unable to trade their memes we still expect a lot of volatility to play on this one for anyone who s got meme fever

the benefits of boxing for students have been repeatedly documented despite this critics of the sport continue to condemn it as overtly violent exploring the ample benefits that boxing can provide for students according to one of the most distinguished heavyweight professionals in 2021 the plethora of benefits that extracurricular activities and sport can bring to students are widely acknowledged but this is seldom the case when it comes to the infamous sport of boxing this is because a prolific number of individuals still view boxing as a relatively violent and grotesque sport in fact some have even gone far enough to suggest that it is inherently dangerous outdated and out of place in the 21st century this is not really the case however ample scientific studies have illustrated the numerous health and social benefits that boxing can bring for young students to this day anthony joshua the current wba ibf wbo and ibf heavyweight champion of the world still credits boxing for instilling discipline in him and for consequently allowing him to segue away from any illegal activity that he was previously involved with as it often turns out learning boxing can play a crucial step particularly for underprivileged individuals in developing the necessary skills needed in order to handle a variety of different challenges says jean pierre augustin a former wbo and ibf north american heavyweight champion with decades of experience below we will explore the top five advantages that the sport of boxing can bring to students according to jean pierre augustin regardless of their social economic or racial background 5 advantages of boxing for students boxing improves your health according to jean pierre augustin the physical and mental health benefits of boxing are widely acknowledged for students in particular adopting a relatively active lifestyle that directly increases their metabolism and burns fat can ensure that they remain in shape from a young age and do not suffer from any weight related chronic condition later on in life this is because boxing exercises burn fat proliferate muscle tone and improve a person s cardiovascular health significantly boxing allows you to embrace imperfections as we all know no one is perfect in life boxing can allow young teenagers and students to identify the right approaches towards handling life s inevitable imperfections says jean pierre indubitably not every person is able to accept their flaws and this can create significant obstacles for them in the long run and get in the way of their personal ambitions and professional goals incorporating boxing in your life can allow you to embrace imperfections from a relatively young age and consequently unlock your full potential as an adult it can also help persons to deal with low self esteem issues as confidence levels usually increase significantly through the infamous sport embracing your imperfections and refusing to remain stagnant is undoubtedly a crucial element in succeeding later on in life a fact that boxing inadvertently tends to reinforce boxing propels self confidence learning new skills in life always helps boost self confidence but the effect of this is arguably even greater in the sphere of boxing this is because the sport can provide students and young individuals with transferable skills that are beneficial in all areas of life for example learning a variety of different boxing styles and eventually beginning to compete or spar effectively will likely increase a person s self confidence as they will feel more convinced that they will be able to self defend themselves if they need to if they are exceptionally good they will also be proud of the fact that they will compete for and likely win a plethora of different amateur titles as well as of the fact that they will likely be able to pursue the sport professionally overall boxing tends to allow students to develop a so called fighting spirit that they can then utilize to fight their way out of a plethora of life s challenges whether physical or mental boxing helps you find more friends from a quality of life standpoint and perhaps even an academic one making friends that are like minded and who have similar personalities can be very beneficial if you have ever been in a boxing gym you will know that there is no discrimination there politics race and social background are completely irrelevant the sport of boxing demands inherent respect and this means that it s a great place for finding friends in a controlled safe environment boxing gym friends can give students the necessary push or drive that they need to keep going during adverse times they can provide emotional support and can create a healthy yet competitive setting that incentivizes young individuals to aspire to be great this is a philosophy that is unsurprisingly usually transferred in all areas of life boxing instills self discipline boxing is a sport that inspires self discipline this is because as briefly touched on above it inherently demands respect and it requires all competitors to have enough discipline so as to compete fairly and equally with each other self discipline derived in the sphere of boxing can then be used in all areas of life including academia and can significantly improve student s personalities and professional ethos conclusion a passion for fitness and particularly boxing can seem like quite a challenge if you have never been previously involved with the so called violent chess nevertheless boxing has been proven to provide many benefits for young and teenage children these can usually extend to daily life quite easily and consequently increase the chances that these students will lead a more confident and happy life holistically we hope you enjoyed reading story by giuliana speranza

2016 the company entered into a launch services agreement with a customer to provide three commercial dedicated launches which would deliver the customer s payloads over the period of 2017 through 2020 per the terms of the agreement each dedicated launch shall have a firm fixed price below current launch vehicle costs during the year ended december 31 2018 the company determined that it was probable that the costs to provide the services as stipulated by the launch services agreement would exceed the fixed firm price of each launch as such the company recorded a provision for contract loss for these three dedicated launches during the year ended december 31 2020 one of the three launches occurred and the provision as of december 31 2020 was 5 109 on april 21 2021 the launch services agreement was amended resulting in one additional launch and the potential for price increases on the second and third launches dependent on the customer s desired payload configuration the

ended june 30 2021 and 2020 were computed using the estimated effective tax rates applicable to each of the domestic and international taxable jurisdictions for the full year the company s tax rate is subject to management s quarterly review and revision as necessary the annual effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate due primarily to a full valuation allowance in the united states and partially offset by recurring items such as foreign taxes based on local country statutory rates the effect of stock based compensation and foreign withholding taxes as well as by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year on march 11 2021 the president signed the american rescue plan act of 2021 into law the new law provides extensive and varied stimulus relief meant to mitigate the impact of covid 19 the company will continue to evaluate the impact that the american rescue plan will have if any on its financial position and effective tax rate in 2021 and beyond on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was signed into law the cares act provided numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses temporary changes to the prior and future limitations on interest deductions temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of social security taxes the creation of certain refundable employee retention credits and technical corrections from prior tax legislation for tax depreciation of certain qualified improvement property these and other provisions of the cares act are not expected to have a material impact on the company s income tax expense and effective tax rate on december 27 2020 the united states enacted the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 caa the caa includes provisions extending certain cares act provisions and adds coronavirus relief tax and health extenders the company will continue to evaluate the impact of the caa on its financial statements in 2021 and beyond f 18 the company is not currently under examination by the irs foreign or state and local tax authorities due to the net operating loss nol carryforwards the company remains subject to examination for u s federal and state jurisdictions for

loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period each series of preferred stock is considered to be a participating security therefore the company applies the two class method in calculating its net loss per share for periods when the company generates net income net losses are not allocated to the preferred stockholders as they were not contractually obligated to share in the company s losses diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method or the as converted method or two class method for participating securities whichever is more dilutive potentially dilutive shares are comprised of preferred stock preferred stock warrants common stock warrants restricted stock units and stock options for the six months ended june 30 2021 and 2020 there is no difference in the number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted shares outstanding due to the company s net loss and potentially dilutive shares being anti dilutive the following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of the company for the six months ended june 30 2021 and 2020 six months ended

approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the company s reportable segments the company manages its business primarily based upon two operating segments launch services and space systems each of these operating segments represents a reportable segment launch services provides launch services to customer on a dedicated mission or ride share basis space systems is comprised of space engineering program management satellite components spacecraft manufacturing and mission operations although many of the company s contracts with customers contain elements of space systems and launch services each reporting segment is managed separately to better align with customer s needs and the company s growth plans the company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on gross profit for contracts with customers that contain both space systems and launch services elements revenues for each reporting segment are generally allocated based upon the overall costs incurred for each of the reporting segments in comparison to total overall costs of the contract f 19 the following table shows

have the meaning given to such terms in the report unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires references in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section to rocket lab we us our and other similar terms refer to rocket lab and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the business combination and to new rocket lab and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the business combination overview rocket lab is an end to end space company with an established track record of mission success we deliver reliable launch services satellites and other spacecraft and on orbit management solutions that make it faster easier and more affordable to access space while our business has historically been centered on the development of small class launch vehicles and related sale of launch services we are currently innovating in the areas of medium class launch vehicles and launch services space systems design and manufacturing on orbit management solutions and space data applications each of these initiatives addresses a critical component of the end to end solution and our value proposition for the space economy launch services is the design manufacture and launch of orbital rockets to deploy payloads to various earth orbits and interplanetary destinations space systems is the design and manufacture of spacecraft components and spacecraft as well as on orbit constellation management services and space data applications electron is our orbital small launch vehicle that was designed from the ground up to accommodate a high launch rate business model to meet the growing and dynamic needs of our customers for small launch services since its maiden launch in 2017 electron has become the leading small spacecraft launch vehicle delivering 105 satellites to orbit for government and commercial customers across 18 successful missions through july 2021 in 2020 electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the united states and established rocket lab as the fourth most frequent launcher globally our launch services program has seen us develop many industry innovations including 3d printed rocket engines an electric pump fed rocket engine fully carbon composite first stage fuel tanks a private orbital launch complex a rocket stage that converts into a spacecraft on orbit and the ability to successfully recover a stage from space providing a path to reusability in march 2021 we announced plans to develop our reusable ready medium capacity neutron launch vehicle which will increase the payload capacity of our space launch vehicles to approximately 17 000 lbs 8 000 kg for launches to low earth orbit and lighter payloads into higher orbits neutron will be tailored for commercial and u s government constellation launches and capable of human space flight and cargo and crew resupply to the international space station neutron will also provide a dedicated service to orbit for larger civil defense and commercial payloads that need a level of schedule control and high flight cadence not available on large and heavy lift rockets neutron is expected to have the capability of launching nearly all of the spacecraft that we expect to be launched through 2029 and we expect to be able to leverage electron s flight heritage various vehicle subsystems designs launch complexes and ground station infrastructure f 21 our space systems initiative is centered on the design manufacture and sale of the photon family of small spacecraft which are configurable for a range of low earth orbit medium earth orbit geosynchronous orbit and interplanetary missions our photon family of spacecraft enable us to offer an end to end mission solution encompassing launch spacecraft ground services and mission operations to provide customers with streamlined access to orbit with rocket lab as a single mission partner our space systems initiative is also supported by the design and manufacture of a range of components for satellites and other spacecraft including reaction wheels star trackers magnetic torque rods and batteries and has additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub system functions we entered this market with our acquisition of leading spacecraft components manufacturer sinclair interplanetary which brought incremental vertically integrated capabilities for our own spacecraft and also enabled rocket lab to deliver high volume manufacturing of critical spacecraft components at scale prices to the broader spacecraft merchant market key metrics and select financial data we monitor the following key financial and operational metrics that assist us in evaluating our business measuring our performance identifying trends and making strategic decisions launch vehicle build rate and launch cadence we built approximately three launch vehicles in 2019 and built approximately eight launch vehicles in 2020 we plan to continue growing our build rate in 2021 with 12 launch vehicles in 2021 and believe the growth in build rate is a positive indicator of our ability to scale our manufacturing operations in support of our anticipated growth rate in revenue in the coming years we launched six vehicles in 2019 seven vehicles in 2020 and four vehicles through july 2021 the number of launches is an indicator of our ability to convert mission awards into revenue in a timely manner and demonstrate the scalability of our launch operations growth rates between launches and total revenue are not perfectly correlated because our total revenue is affected by other variables such as the revenue per launch which can vary considerably based on factors such as unique orbit and insertion requirements payload handling needs launch location time sensitivity of mission completion and other factors recent developments business combination on march 1 2021 the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger merger agreement with vector acquisition corporation a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company and cayman islands exempted company vector and prestige usa merger sub inc a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of rocket lab merger sub which was subsequently amended on may 7 2021 and june 25 2021 the mergers will be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap under this method of accounting vector acquisition corporation will be treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes and the company will be treated as the accounting acquirer the mergers closed august 25 2021 and vector became a delaware corporation delaware vector and merger sub merged with and into delaware vector with delaware vector surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of rocket lab the first merger immediately following the first merger rocket lab merged with and into delaware vector with delaware vector surviving the merger second merger and together with the first merger the mergers for form the post transaction combined entity new rocket lab after the mergers the gross amount of cash that that the combined company will receive from vector s trust account and concurrent pipe financing upon the closing of the mergers before transaction expenses will be approximately 777 million in connection with the mergers the shareholders of the company exchanged their interests in the company for interests in the new rocket lab revenue growth six months ended june 30 2021 and 2020 we generated 29 5 million and 8 8 million in revenue for the six months ended june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively representing a year on year increase in revenue of approximately 237 this year on year increase was f 22 driven by growth in both our launch service revenue which experienced higher revenue per launch as well a higher launch cadence as compared to the prior year period ending june 30 2020 as well as strong revenue growth in space systems across spacecraft component sales and spacecraft engineering services which benefited not only from full year to date impact of the acquisition of sinclair interplanetary that closed in april 2020 but also from initial shipments of reaction wheels to a commercial constellation customer as well as contribution from six space systems satellite engineering services programs revenue value per launch revenue value per launch represents the average revenue per launch contract attributable to launches that occurred during a period regardless of when the revenue was recognized revenue value per launch can be a useful metric to provide insight into general competitiveness and price sensitivity in the marketplace revenue value per launch can vary considerably based on factors such as unique orbit and insertion requirements payload handling needs launch location time sensitivity of mission completion and other factors and as such may not provide absolute clarity with regards to pricing and competitive dynamics in the marketplace six months ended june 30 2021 and 2020 in the six months ended june 30 2021 and 2020 our revenue value per launch was 7 8 million and 6 9 million respectively and cost per launch was 5 6 million and 7 3 million for the six months ended june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively backlog backlog represents future revenues that we would recognize in connection with the completion of all contracts and purchase orders that had been entered into by our customers excluding any customer options for future products or services that have not yet been exercised contracts for launch services and spacecraft builds typically include termination rights that may be exercised by customers upon advanced notice and payment of a specified termination fee as of june 30 2021 our backlog totaled 141 4 million we expect to recognize approximately 72 of our backlog over the next 12 months and the remainder recognized thereafter key factors affecting our performance covid 19 pandemic in december 2019 the novel coronavirus covid 19 surfaced in wuhan china the world health organization who declared a global emergency on january 30 2020 with respect to the outbreak and several countries have initiated travel restrictions closed borders and given social distancing directives including instructions requiring shelter in place on march 11 2020 the who declared the covid 19 outbreak a pandemic as a result of the pandemic the united states and new zealand governments shut down various sectors of the respective economies in the united states we were deemed an essential service and no pauses were made to our united states based operations as a result of the shutdown in new zealand we had to delay certain scheduled launches to a later date in addition to existing travel restrictions some locales may impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel which may significantly impact the ability of our employees to get to their places of work to produce products may make it such that we are unable to obtain certain long lead time components on a timely basis or at a cost effective price or may significantly hamper our customers from traveling to our launch facilities to prepare payloads for launch due to a recently discovered number of new covid 19 cases new zealand moved to alert level 4 on august 17th 2021 indicating auckland will remain at alert level 4 for at least 7 days under an alert level 4 in new zealand individuals must stay home other than for essential personal movement rocket lab has significant operations in auckland new zealand and while some employees will be able to continue their work remotely certain business operations that require direct labor and physical presence such as vehicle integration and testing will be suspended during this and any other level 4 alerts the extent of covid 19 s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration spread and intensity of the pandemic all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape at this time it is not possible to determine the magnitude of the overall impact of covid 19 on our business however it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and cash flows rocket lab continues to adhere to all required governmental precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to its employees f 23 ability to sell additional launch services space systems and service and spacecraft components to new and existing customers our results will be impacted by our ability to sell our launch services space systems and services and spacecraft components to new and existing customers we have had success with electron successfully launching 17 times delivering 104 satellites to orbit through june 30 2021 our spacecraft components have flown on more than 100 spacecrafts and our family of photon spacecraft has been awarded missions to the moon mars and venus our growth opportunity is dependent on our ability to expand our addressable launch services market with larger volumetric and higher mass payloads capabilities of our recently announced medium capacity neutron launch vehicle which will address large commercial and government constellation launch opportunities our growth opportunity is also dependent on our ability to win satellite spacecraft constellation missions and expand our portfolio of strategic spacecraft components our ability to sell additional products to existing customers is a key part of our success as follow on purchases indicate customer satisfaction and decrease the likelihood of competitive substitution to sell additional products and services to new and existing customers we will need to continue to invest significant resources in our products and services if we fail to make the right investment decisions if customers do not adopt our products and service or if our competitors are able to develop technology or products and services that are superior to ours our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected ability to improve profit margins and scale our business we intend to continue investing in initiatives to improve our operating leverage and significantly ramp production we believe continued reduction in costs and an increase in production volumes will enable the cost of launch vehicles to decline and expand our gross margins our ability to achieve our production efficiency objectives could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors including among other things lower than expected facility utilization rates manufacturing and production cost overruns increased purchased material costs and unexpected supply chain quality issues or interruptions if we are unable to achieve our goals we may not be able to reduce operating costs which would negatively impact gross margin and profitability government expenditures and private enterprise investment into the space economy government expenditures and private enterprise investment has fueled the growth in our target markets we expect the continued availability of government expenditures and private investment for our customers to help fund purchases of our products and services will remain this is an important factor in our company s growth prospects components of results of operations revenue our revenues are derived from a combination of long term fixed price contracts for launch services and spacecraft builds and purchase order spacecraft components sales revenues from long term contracts are recognized using either the point in time or over time method of revenue recognition point in time revenue recognition results in cash payments being initially accrued to the balance sheet as deferred revenue as contractual milestones are accomplished and then recognized as revenue once the final contractual obligation is completed over time revenue recognition is based on an input measure of progress based on costs incurred compared to estimated total costs at completion each project has a contractual revenue value and an estimated cost the over time revenue is recognized based on the percentage of the total project cost that has been realized estimating future revenues and associated costs and profit is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment including management s assumptions regarding our future operational performance as well as general economic conditions frequently the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and as such revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be affected to the extent that estimated costs to complete are revised delivery schedules are delayed performance based milestones are not achieved or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded accordingly our recorded revenues and operating profit from period to period can fluctuate significantly depending on when the point in time or over time contractual obligations are achieved in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract the total amount of such loss is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated for a description of our revenue recognition policies see the section titled critical accounting policies and estimates f 24 cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of direct material and labor costs manufacturing overhead other personnel related expenses which include salaries bonuses benefits and stock based compensation expense reserves for estimated warranty costs freight expense and depreciation expense cost of revenues also includes charges to write down the carrying value of inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value including on hand inventory that is either obsolete or in excess of forecasted demand we expect our cost of revenues to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we sell more launch services space systems and components as we grow into our current capacity and execute on cost reduction initiatives we expect our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue to decrease over time because direct labor costs and manufacturing overhead comprise more than 60 of cost of revenues increasing our production rate resulting in greater absorption of these costs is our most critical cost reduction initiative increasing our production rate is a cross functional effort involving manufacturing engineering supply chain and finance operating expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development and selling general and administrative expenses research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses consulting and contractor expenses validation and testing expense prototype parts and materials and depreciation expense we intend to continue to make significant investments in developing new products and enhancing existing products research and development expense will be variable relative to the number of products that are in development validation or testing however we expect it to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses for our sales marketing supply chain finance legal human resources and administrative personnel as well as the costs of customer service information technology professional services insurance travel allocated overhead and other marketing communications and administrative expenses we will continue to actively promote our products we also expect to invest in our corporate organization and incur additional expenses associated with transitioning to and operating as a public company including increased legal and accounting costs investor relations costs higher insurance premiums and compliance costs as a result we expect that selling general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods but decline as a percentage of total revenue over time interest income net interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances other expense income net other expense income net primarily relates to currency fluctuations that generate foreign exchange gains or losses on invoices denominated in currencies other than the u s dollar and changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities provision for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states but due to our nol position we have not recognized any provision or benefit in recent years deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized we have established a full valuation allowance to offset our u s net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from our nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets f 25 results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations information and data as a

or 237 for the six months ended june 30 2021 as compared to june 30 2020 driven by strong growth in both launch service revenue which experienced a higher launch cadence and higher revenue per launch as compared to the prior year period ended june 30 2020 as well as strong revenue growth in the space systems revenue across spacecraft component and spacecraft engineering services which benefited from full year to date contribution from the acquisition of sinclair interplanetary that closed in april of 2020 launch services product revenue for the six months ended june 30 2021 was 24 1 million

a net decrease in cash related to changes in operating assets and liabilities of 17 8 million the 13 7 million in non cash adjustments primarily consisted of preferred stock warrants of 5 5 million depreciation and amortization of 4 8 million stock based compensation expense of 2 4 million noncash lease expense of 1 0 million and loss on debt extinguishment of 0 5 million partially offset by 0 6 million of deferred income tax expense the 17 8 million net decrease in cash related to changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of 19 6 million due to lengthened payment terms extended to a strategic customers undergoing a protracted financing process an increase in inventory of 5 3 million a net decrease in the remaining current liability accounts of 1 5 million primarily driven by the release of a loss reserve on commercial launch customer contract and a decrease in non current lease liabilities of 1 2 million which were partially offset by an increase in contract liabilities of 5 0 million resulting from collections received in advance of revenue recognition a net decrease in the remaining current asset accounts of 4 0 million driven by a decline in grant receivables and an increase in employee benefits payable of 0 8 million cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities for the six months ended june 30 2021 of 5 7 million was primarily driven by continued investment towards our second launch pad at launch complex 1 in mahia new zealand and our propulsion development and test facility near auckland new zealand as well as other companywide infrastructure related support initiatives the decrease in cash used in investing activities for the six months ended june 30 2021 as compared to the six months ended june 30 2020 primarily resulted from the 9 9 million year on year decline in cash consumed by property equipment and software for the six months ended june 30 2021 which was primarily driven by the completion of the rocket lab headquarters located in long beach california in the six months ended june 30 2020 and the 12 2 million year on year decline in cash consumed for acquisitions net of acquired cash for the six months ended june 30 2021 which was due to the acquisition of sinclair interplanetary that closed in the six months ended june 30 2020 cash flows from financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended june 30 2021 of 97 4 million was primarily derived from the combined proceeds of two distinct and unrelated debt facilities with hercules capital inc and svb totaling 113 9 million which was partially offset by 15 0 million used in the period to completely retire the svb credit facility and 2 3 million of deferred transaction expenses related to the business combination with vector acquisition corporation capital resources and prospective capital requirements since inception we have funded our operations with proceeds from sales of our capital stock bank debt research and development grant proceeds and cash flows from the sale of our products and services as of december f 28 31 2020 we had 52 8 million of cash and cash equivalents and as of june 30 2021 we had 107 9 million of cash and cash equivalents our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are investment in new products and technologies the expansion of existing manufacturing facilities working capital debt service acquisitions and general corporate needs historically these cash requirements have been met through the net proceeds we received through private sales of equity securities borrowings under our credit facilities and payments received from customers we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and 777 million in gross funds raised in connection with the business combination and the pipe investment and payments from customers will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months with the funds raised in connection with the business combination and the pipe investment we expect no additional capital will be needed to execute our business plan over the next 12 months we will continue to invest in increasing production and expanding our product offerings through acquisitions our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our launch cadence traction in space system the expansion of sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts the introduction of new and enhanced products the continuing market adoption of our products the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses products and technologies we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing in the event that we require additional financing we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued product innovation we may not be able to compete successfully which would harm our business operations and financial condition loan and security agreement hercules

about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates foreign currency exchange risk our reporting currency is the u s dollar and the functional currency of each of our subsidiaries is either its local currency the assets and liabilities of each of our subsidiaries are translated into u s dollars at exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date and operations accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the relevant period decreases in the relative value of the u s dollar to other currencies may negatively affect revenue and other operating results as expressed in u s dollars foreign currency translation adjustments are accounted for as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity gains or losses due to transactions in foreign currencies are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under the line item other income net despite approximately 52 of our cash expenditures in 2020 being denominated in foreign currencies while materially all of our revenues are denominated in u s dollars we have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency risk to date although we may choose to do so in the future as such a 10 or greater move in exchange rates versus the u s dollar could have a material impact on our financial results and position interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents of 107 9 million as of june 30 2021 comprised of operating accounts and money market instruments we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure emerging growth company status in april 2012 the jobs act was enacted section 107 b of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards thus an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies as a result of the accounting standards election we will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of
