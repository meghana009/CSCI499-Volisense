oil prices have been rising steadily for months you ve probably noticed one big consequence average gasoline prices have climbed to seven year highs as early as last week the expectations were that oil prices would either stabilize or rise gradually until an opec meeting that was supposed to be routine ended in an unexpected impasse with no agreement on what to do about oil production now analysts are bracing for everything from a price spike to a price plunge as millions of americans hit the road again there s just no certainty around where crude is headed here s what you need to know about the volatile oil prices demand for oil is finally coming back last year as the coronavirus pandemic spread around the world global oil demand dropped remarkably fast people stopped driving and flying markets were thrown completely out of whack so oil producers slashed their production including ahistoric cut in output from the group of countries collectively known as opec which includes major producers saudi arabia and russia now demand is returning as the u s china and some other parts of the world reopen for business as the impact from the pandemic wanes commutes vacation flights and road trips are all pushing fuel demand up in the u s a record number of people hit the road over the july fourth weekend according to aaa but oil producers are still pumping less oil one huge reason for the supply demand mismatch is that opec has taken a very gradual approach to putting barrels back on the market that s intended to keep prices high increasing revenues for oil producing countries meanwhile u s producers have also been pumping less than expected as they focus instead on making money for investors this was a surprise to everyone as the shale patch is famous for exuberantly producing oil when prices are rising the result is a totally different market from a year ago one that has been driving prices steadily up u s energy information administration u s energy information administration crude prices dropped sharply last spring but have risen steadily over recent months we ve seen a bit of a pivot and now we re actually looking at well what is going to happen if there is a supply shortage says louise dickson a senior analyst at rystad energy then opec met and things got interesting opec members got together for their monthly meeting last week pretty much everybody expected them to gradually increase their combined output but not so much that it would cause prices to drop that would serve the group s best interests and would have matched what the cartel has been doing recently instead the meeting devolved into drama as the united arab emirates wanted to be allowed to produce more oil individually which saudi arabia opposed rbc capital noted there are seemingly shakespearean elements to this drama which suggests a rift between two crown princes who were once extremely close whether it s geopolitics economics or interpersonal intrigue driving the dispute the powerful cartel found itself at an impasse after days of talks the meeting was called off indefinitely with no deal and no set plans to meet again that means the supply demand imbalance is set to grow even more than expected you d expect that to drive oil prices up but the actual consequences have been more complicated because people don t know what this means for opec the opec drama has created two completely opposite concerns if the cartel doesn t clinch a new deal to increase production and if the current deal remains in place that would drive prices up some analysts see 90 a barrel for oil as a possibility such a spike would not be good for many economies worldwide it would lead to a surge in gas prices and hit many sectors that depend on oil such as airlines on the other hand if the infighting causes opec to completely abandon its current production cuts there could be a free for all that would cause a ton of oil to flood the market that would push prices down potentially dramatically a few months from now which could cause chaos for oil producers nasdaq and associated press nasdaq and associated press brent crude prices rose then fell dramatically over the last week weekend dates not shown the two outcomes could not be more different and the uncertainty about which might happen has created an interesting few days on oil markets global crude prices rose to a multiyear high on monday off the news that there was no deal then they plunged on tuesday and wednesday wiping out weeks worth of gains and of course it s still possible that opec will announce a deal that would land somewhere in the middle and potentially stabilize prices in fact many analysts think that s the most likely outcome despite the lack of any public progress toward it because there s a ton of pressure for a compromise in early 2020 opec caused prices to go haywire thanks to a price war between saudi arabia and russia but that was quickly followed by the historic agreement to cut production which is widely credited with rebalancing crude markets and supporting prices for well over a year now there s a lot riding on whether opec can again strike a deal to keep markets balanced either a price spike or a collapse would be bad news for opec members and a spike would be particularly worrying for the world s oil consumers given that prices are already quite high

washington as the white house weighs the potential renomination of jerome powell as chair of the federal reserve officials are discussing the use of openings on the board to reshape the central bank to closer align with administration priorities such as inequality and tighter banking regulations according to people familiar with the matter president joe biden has one vacant fed governor seat to fill and could potentially replace three more top central bank officials in the coming year depending on how much he wants to revamp the fed s leadership powell and fed vice chairs richard clarida and randal quarles all have terms that will expire in coming months with several seats opening up the white house isn t looking at the chairmanship in isolation but rather what mix of governors to appoint so as to reshape policy toward the administration s agenda according to the people who spoke on condition of anonymity while no decision appears imminent the lack of any clear candidates to replace powell along with his expressed interest in keeping his job indicate that a renomination is possible that would be in keeping with a decadeslong tradition of presidents maintaining continuity in fed leadership one that former president donald trump broke one key influencer on fed appointments treasury secretary janet yellen has told those close to her that she has a good relationship with powell and is pleased with how he has steered monetary policy through the pandemic induced crisis according to two people familiar with the matter keeping powell 68 would remove a chance to install someone from a minority in the job for the first time in history however and could stoke criticism from progressive democrats one option to reduce potential tensions could be to present a package of appointments that addresses the need for diversity people familiar with the matter said all fed board nominations are subject to senate confirmation with the right mix of candidates biden may be able to persuade progressive allies in congress and outside the white house to support his choices that s how the white house is approaching a decision that history suggests is expected this fall on whether powell is asked to stay or if the administration proposes a new candidate according to people familiar with the matter spokeswomen at the white house and treasury declined to comment nominations are made in a group but usually the group is made to protect one or more of the nominees said former fed governor laurence meyer in the 1990s meyer and governor alice rivlin were part of package with fed chair alan greenspan who was considered hawkish on policy by senators the nomination of powell a republican to the board in 2011 was yoked with democrat jeremy stein yellen who was powell s predecessor at the fed s helm along with white house chief of staff ron klain and national economic council director brian deese are expected to play key roles in making recommendations to biden as his decision nears the people said cecilia rouse jared bernstein and heather boushey of the white house s council of economic advisers and bharat ramamurti an nec official who previously worked for sen elizabeth warren will also be part of the process they said yellen and powell were colleagues at the fed board for six years before she left in early 2018 after trump replaced her with powell as chair since yellen became treasury chief the pair have kept up a tradition of weekly discussions between the secretary and fed chair the pandemic crisis has highlighted long standing disparities across the u s economy a major focus for biden and his top advisers the unemployment rate for black workers who have a disproportionate share of lower wage jobs and union membership was double that of their white counterparts during much of the past 50 years in part because the fed has historically tightened monetary policy just as the benefits of economic growth began to reach lower income workers powell has overseen the adoption of a new framework for monetary policy incorporating a more inclusive assessment of the labor market and a pledge to allow inflation to overshoot a 2 target to make up for prior underperformance he s also pledged a gradual trajectory for the withdrawal of monetary stimulus as the u s economy recovers from the pandemic moves that have been applauded by many democrats if president biden was asking me which he isn t i would advise to keep jay powell in place alan blinder a former fed vice chair appointed by president bill clinton said wednesday on bloomberg tv not so much as a reward for good behavior although you could say that he deserves a reward but just for the stability that it represents financial markets early this year reflected rising concerns about an inflation surge as the fed held off from signaling any tightening more recently treasury yields have slumped as some economic data undershot forecasts democratic sen sherrod brown of ohio who chairs the banking committee said in a recent interview that powell has rankled republicans with his own tilt toward the issues of inequality and climate don t talk about justice don t talk about poverty don t talk about climate don t talk about things that affect americans brown said in summarizing his take on gop views brown while refraining from saying if he supports or opposes a second term as chair for powell said his disagreements with powell have been mostly about quarles whose tenure as vice chair for supervision ends in october 2021 and about how the fed has been too weak on regulation and making sure banks behave in a public reasonable way including on decisions like stock buybacks quarles has left open the possibility of remaining a governor even if he is no longer vice chair given that his board membership slot doesn t expire until 2032 warren a massachusetts democrat told quarles in may that the u s financial system will be safer when you are gone clarida s term as a fed governor expires in january 2022 he has not publicly discussed his future at the central bank powell s term as chair expires in february 2022 biden met with powell for the first time since becoming president last month when the president hosted the nation s top financial regulators in the oval office on climate change powell has pushed back against any idea that the issue should be a centerpiece of monetary policy saying it is mainly a question for government and elected representatives but he has noted that it has implications for the financial institutions the fed oversees and he did bring the fed into a club of central banks that discusses climate change as for the current vacancy on the fed board many white house officials have agreed that economists lisa cook and william spriggs both black are good candidates the people said

interpretation of the inversion models image 2 caption airborne electromagnetic aem remote sensing is used to collect extensive volumes of data from an aircraft a sensor loop below a helicopter or small plane transmits an electromagnetic signal to the earth based on the subsurface properties a secondary field is created and measured at the aircraft these data are then processed to estimate subsurface electrical properties the ags workbench software is used for processing inversion and visualization of the data collected by aem and other geophysical methods airborne electromagnetic aem remote sensing uses electromagnetic induction to collect extensive volumes of data from an aircraft it is a fast and cost effective way of subsurface mapping can cover large areas 10s 1000s of km2 in a few days requires no new drilling or ground access and using 3d modeling and visualization software has a quick turnaround for mapping the subsurface the technique involves a helicopter or a small airplane towing a sensor loop approximately 100 feet 30 meters above the ground this generates an electromagnetic signal transmitted into the earth based on the subsurface properties thereby a secondary field is created and measured at the aircraft these data are then processed to estimate subsurface electrical properties depending on resistivity or conductivity the returned signal helps geoscientists establish the nature of the subsurface image 3 caption sensing data processed and inverted in ags workbench software can then be combined in seequent s leapfrog works to create a 3d

international and african lgbtq organizations have called for a redirection of aid after an in depth investigative report alleged government and private foreign investments unknowingly fund conversion therapy practices in east africa the investigative report conducted by united kingdom based opendemocracy revealed organizations funded by major international aid agencies usaid pepfar uk aid and global fund inadvertently are supporting conversion therapy undercover reporters allegedly found staffers secretly offering referrals to so called conversion therapy services provided by third party operators in kenya tanzania and uganda opendemocracy published its findings in a series of articles june 30 efforts to cure homosexuality are inherently degrading and discriminatory said kaajal ramjathan keogh africa director at the international commission of jurists human rights organization in response to the opendemocracy s reporting in one of the reports a ugandan lesbian told the story of how she was subjected to electric shock as a part of her therapy at a clinic in kampala uganda s capital that her family brought her to despite the years that have passed since the incident she told an opendemocracy reporter the resentment i felt for my family has never really gone away east african organizations that provided hiv aids mental health and other health care services including services for lgbtq people received millions of dollars in funding from the united states usaid and pepfar programs uk aid and switzerland s global fund donors should make sure that their money does not fund any conversion therapy activities and to withdraw money if it does ramjathan keogh said kenya yvee oduor a gender nonconforming feminist with the gay and lesbian coalition called to redirect funding away from lgbtq non affirming health care providers we already have clinics and health centers run by lgbtqi people all over the country they said why not fund these community initiatives conversion therapy is the practice of attempting to convert or suppress a person s sexual orientation or gender identity to fit into mainstream society the practice has been widely condemned by the united nations world health organization more than 60 counselors psychologists and doctors associations globally and human rights and lgbtq rights organizations brazil ecuador germany and malta banned conversion therapy as have 20 states in the u s including california which prohibits the practice on minors but not adults call for investigations major donors stated they will investigate and act upon their findings in response to opendemocracy s reports international aid agencies and local non governmental organizations operating health care clinics also pledged to launch investigations following the series of articles rosco kasujja director of mental health at makerere university s school of psychology and head of the uganda clinical psychologists association called opendemocracy s findings disturbing it s really frustrating that we don t have any power he told the media outlet in reference to his association s voluntary and nonbinding standards people are playing by their own rules and can t do anything about it the facilities involved in the undercover investigation did not publicly advertise conversion therapy referrals or services usaid the uk aid and the global fund launched investigations in response to the report usaid does not fund or promote anti lgbtqi conversion therapy and will investigate any report that a usaid funded partner is doing so u s embassy spokesman anthony kujawa told opendemocracy pepfar most at risk populations initiative and the uganda catholic medical bureau along with uganda s kisubi hospital and the hiv clinic at mulago hospital did not respond to the reports going undercover opendemocracy undertook a six month undercover investigation of how international funds were being used to support conversion therapy in kenya tanzania and uganda reporters interviewed more than 50 people at 12 health centers including clinics that outreached specifically to gay and bisexual men along with conversion therapy survivors clinic staff and heads foreign embassies and funders representatives in the east african countries they found conversion therapy activities in 12 of the 15 clinics they visited many africans perceive the lgbtq movement and the movement to ban conversion therapy as a western ideology being pushed on the continent as one ugandan clinician stated to opendemocracy reporters it is for whites matthias ssetuba lubaga hospital s self described mental health focal person told the undercover reporters that homosexuality was a mental health issue caused by multiple factors from the internet to peer pressure ssetuba argued that those whites are saying it s normal in our society it is abnormal and it could be changed if the person accepts they need help in converting he told the undercover reporters staff at other clinics throughout uganda expressed similar attitudes and beliefs half of the health centers funded by international aid money serving marginalized communities including the lgbtq community belong to aid funded health networks outside of local governments health care clinic staff in kenya and tanzania held similar beliefs as those in uganda and operated similarly same sex relationships and anal sex are illegal in uganda as well as in kenya and tanzania in may uganda s parliament passed the sexual offenses bill 2019 the bill is awaiting ugandan president yoweri museveni s signature to sign the opendemocracy s petition asking that the u s government investigate its agencies to make sure they are not funding conversion therapy click here gay luxembourg pm hospitalized for covid 19

the world the initial 53 page report leading up to a more in depth examination in 2022 reviews pride events that happen in 102 out of 195 countries around the world including eight new pride celebrations within the past three years the brief examines pride events in bosnia and herzegovina eswatini philippines poland singapore sri lanka south korea trinidad and tobago turkey and uganda as examples of how pride events are being oppressed and rising in resistance the report also examines the impact of covid 19 on pride celebrations around the world digital pride celebrations such as global pride global black pride and pride afrique trends in pride events and the future of pride pride events existing in more than half of the countries around the world symbolize an evolving litmus test for democracy according to the report however some pride events have been lost such as shanghai pride which launched in 2009 and ended in 2019 more than 50 years after the famed 1969 stonewall riots in new york when lgbtq people fought back against police raids some pride events are just as highly politically charged the essence of pride never ends and that we fight for our rights every day said outright action international deputy executive director maria sjödin in the organization s june 30 news release pride protests in croatia s capital zagreb and georgia s capital tbilisi erupted in violence and arrests of more than 20 people in both cities the last two weekends the tbilisi pride office was ransacked and the violence leading up to the celebration was so intense organizers called off the event for the first time in 10 years in zagreb anti gay demonstrators burned the rainbow flag the violence in zagreb was the first since 2011 turkey banned istanbul pride but lgbtq people took to the streets in rainbows in an unauthorized event thwarting police in the narrow streets of istanbul police eventually broke up the celebration with tear gas and rubber bullets and arrested 20

publicly apologize for calling transgender people utterly disgusting on tv last month zeman made it clear to the whole world that he thinks it is ok to hate a certain group of people on the basis of their gender identity viktor heumann director of transparent the country s transgender organization said in a june 28 statement the president fundamentally wrong in his statement heumann said responding to zeman s remarks not all transgender people undergo sex reassignment surgery and self harm does not constitute a crime heumann reminded czech leaders in the statement that the country is one of the last countries in europe to force trans people to undergo surgery for official sex reassignment on june 27 zeman was defending hungarian pm viktor orban and the central european country s new anti lgbtq law while addressing the international outcry and the european union backlash against the country in a sunday night debate on cnn prima news seventeen eu countries condemned the law but the czech republic did not instead zeman called the eu s interference in the internal affairs of any 27 union member countries a gross political mistake reported republic world zeman went on to say that he saw no reason to disagree with orban stating he was completely annoyed by the suffragettes the metoo movement and prague pride it was at that point that zeman turned his attention to the transgender community calling sex reassignment surgery a crime of self harm all these transgender people are utterly disgusting to me he said got international lgbtq news tips call or send them to

oil prices have been rising steadily for months you ve probably noticed one big consequence average gasoline prices have climbed to seven year highs as early as last week the expectations were that oil prices would either stabilize or rise gradually until an opec meeting that was supposed to be routine ended in an unexpected impasse with no agreement on what to do about oil production now analysts are bracing for everything from a price spike to a price plunge as millions of americans hit the road again there s just no certainty around where crude is headed here s what you need to know about the volatile oil prices demand for oil is finally coming back last year as the coronavirus pandemic spread around the world global oil demand dropped remarkably fast people stopped driving and flying markets were thrown completely out of whack so oil producers slashed their production including ahistoric cut in output from the group of countries collectively known as opec which includes major producers saudi arabia and russia now demand is returning as the u s china and some other parts of the world reopen for business as the impact from the pandemic wanes commutes vacation flights and road trips are all pushing fuel demand up in the u s a record number of people hit the road over the july fourth weekend according to aaa but oil producers are still pumping less oil one huge reason for the supply demand mismatch is that opec has taken a very gradual approach to putting barrels back on the market that s intended to keep prices high increasing revenues for oil producing countries meanwhile u s producers have also been pumping less than expected as they focus instead on making money for investors this was a surprise to everyone as the shale patch is famous for exuberantly producing oil when prices are rising the result is a totally different market from a year ago one that has been driving prices steadily up u s energy information administration u s energy information administration crude prices dropped sharply last spring but have risen steadily over recent months we ve seen a bit of a pivot and now we re actually looking at well what is going to happen if there is a supply shortage says louise dickson a senior analyst at rystad energy then opec met and things got interesting opec members got together for their monthly meeting last week pretty much everybody expected them to gradually increase their combined output but not so much that it would cause prices to drop that would serve the group s best interests and would have matched what the cartel has been doing recently instead the meeting devolved into drama as the united arab emirates wanted to be allowed to produce more oil individually which saudi arabia opposed rbc capital noted there are seemingly shakespearean elements to this drama which suggests a rift between two crown princes who were once extremely close whether it s geopolitics economics or interpersonal intrigue driving the dispute the powerful cartel found itself at an impasse after days of talks the meeting was called off indefinitely with no deal and no set plans to meet again that means the supply demand imbalance is set to grow even more than expected you d expect that to drive oil prices up but the actual consequences have been more complicated because people don t know what this means for opec the opec drama has created two completely opposite concerns if the cartel doesn t clinch a new deal to increase production and if the current deal remains in place that would drive prices up some analysts see 90 a barrel for oil as a possibility such a spike would not be good for many economies worldwide it would lead to a surge in gas prices and hit many sectors that depend on oil such as airlines on the other hand if the infighting causes opec to completely abandon its current production cuts there could be a free for all that would cause a ton of oil to flood the market that would push prices down potentially dramatically a few months from now which could cause chaos for oil producers nasdaq and associated press nasdaq and associated press brent crude prices rose then fell dramatically over the last week weekend dates not shown the two outcomes could not be more different and the uncertainty about which might happen has created an interesting few days on oil markets global crude prices rose to a multiyear high on monday off the news that there was no deal then they plunged on tuesday and wednesday wiping out weeks worth of gains and of course it s still possible that opec will announce a deal that would land somewhere in the middle and potentially stabilize prices in fact many analysts think that s the most likely outcome despite the lack of any public progress toward it because there s a ton of pressure for a compromise in early 2020 opec caused prices to go haywire thanks to a price war between saudi arabia and russia but that was quickly followed by the historic agreement to cut production which is widely credited with rebalancing crude markets and supporting prices for well over a year now there s a lot riding on whether opec can again strike a deal to keep markets balanced either a price spike or a collapse would be bad news for opec members and a spike would be particularly worrying for the world s oil consumers given that prices are already quite high in the u s the biden administration is clearly concerned about the prospect that gas prices might rise even further under former president donald trump the white house got unusually involved in opec negotiations and president biden seems to be continuing the tradition the white house has talked directly to multiple opec members and is urging a compromise to boost production it s another sign of how quickly things can change in the oil industry just a few years ago plenty of oil experts were asking if opec was a has been issuing edicts from its headquarters in vienna with no real impact on

reno nev july 07 2021 globe newswire nevada exploration inc nge or the company tsx v nge otcqb nvdef is pleased to provide an update from its 2021 core drilling program at its south grass valley carlin type gold project summary during may the company completed the first hole of the program sgvc012 to a final depth of 1 405 metres successfully sampling the lower plate clm unit that hosts nge s primary east golden gorge target the targeted clm unit in the bottom part of the hole contained some of the most intense carlin type alteration seen to date at the project in many places being reduced to a sulphidic paste which based on xrf analysis includes a 96 metre thick interval containing highly anomalous carlin type pathfinders the upper part of the hole encountered carlin type alteration and pathfinders indicative of a secondary zone of potentially mineralizing carlin type hydrothermal fluid flow through the roberts mountains and hanson creek formations the structural and geologic data collected from the hole continue to support significant district scale structural complexity along the water canyon corridor during june nge completed sampling the sgvc012 drill core and submitted samples from the entire hole for lab analysis for the second hole of the program sgvc013 nge moved the drill rig 3 500 metres to the south to the eastern end of the company s southern fence of drill holes sgvc013 is presently at a depth of 447 metres and approaching the alluvium bedrock contact drilling is currently on hold pending availability of drilling personnel and is expected to continue shortly since completing its june 2021 financing nge has begun negotiations to add a second deep capacity core rig to the program and has strengthened its nevada based logging team with the addition of a new exploration geologist the company plans to extend the expiry date of a total of 5 192 322 share purchase warrants exercisable at 0 45 and 0 50 per share that currently expire on july 13 2021 and october 9 2021 by an additional 12 months a photo accompanying this announcement is available at discussing the ongoing program nge ceo wade hodges it s been an exciting couple months logging what is now the deepest hole on the project and this first hole of 2021 has already significantly de risked our target concept at east golden gorge all of our work to date had pointed to the clm unit effectively providing the dominant fluid superhighway for the mineralizing carlin type fluids to move laterally through the district and quite simply our goal with this current drilling program is to test whether our eastward down dip projection of this superhighway is correct and whether it supported the type and volume of hydrothermal fluid flow necessary to support a globally significant new gold deposit drilling more than 1 000 metres to get down to our target in this part of the project took fortitude especially through the middle part of the hole which had seen very little in the way of any hydrothermal fluid flow but as predicted by our geologic model once we approached our target zone the rocks began to change from 1 150 metres onwards the clm unit contained some of the most intense carlin type alteration seen to date at the project in many places reduced largely to a sulphidic paste and based on our xrf analysis we can confirm that this massive zone of alteration contains characteristically high concentrations of carlin type pathfinders given the irregular geometries of carlin type gold deposits we re not betting on any single hole of this program but with sgvc012 we most certainly hit our targeted superhighway which represents a major step in validating our east golden gorge target concept there is still more to learn from sgvc012 and we re continuing to collect additional structural data and while we integrate this data at the north end of the project for our next hole sgvc013 we ve moved the rig to the south end to complete a similarly deep hole to test our targeted clm unit where this favourable geologic setting and the water canyon structural corridor are squeezed along the margin of the grass valley stock in terms of our overall progress with the program so far we are pleased to have been able to complete our first hole to its target depth through some typically challenging and deep carlin type drilling conditions though securing the continuity of experienced personnel has presented some challenges on this second hole the rig is currently on a break while our contractor assembles additional personnel we had been running three crews such that the rig was drilling continuously but once drilling resumes we expect we may need to switch to a schedule that includes days off which is the schedule many of the rigs in the state are employing to help ensure we maintain momentum at this important stage of the project we ve begun the process of contracting a second drill rig as well as strengthened our nevada based logging team with the addition of a new exploration geologist with respect to the new information provided by sgvc012 nge reports from 591 to 734 metres the silty limestones of the roberts mountains formation and the calcareous siltstones of the underlying hanson creek formation contain a thick interval 143 metres of pervasive oxidation de calcification and argillic alteration which based on xrf analysis contains highly anomalous concentrations of carlin type pathfinders together with the results of earlier drilling this new information from sgvc012 provides additional evidence that these upper units in this area of the project proximal to the water canyon structural corridor supported significant volumes of hydrothermal fluid flow which represents a secondary zone of potentially mineralizing carlin type fluid flow separate from that seen in the clm unit at depth whereas the roberts mountains and hanson creek formations at the top of the hole are generally characterized by bedding that is distinct plane laminar and oriented normal to the core axis dipping 20 degrees to the ese the antelope valley ninemile and goodwin formations in the middle part of the hole consist of bedding that is rotated parallel to the core axis dipping 70 to 80 degrees to the wsw which represents a drastic change in bedding angles indicative of a complex structural arrangement of large stratigraphic blocks once into the clm unit below the bedding abruptly flattens and returns to dipping 20 degrees to the ese roughly paralleling the units in the roberts mountains and hanson creek formations above collecting and interpreting structural measurements in the middle units oriented parallel to the core axis requires great care and attention and the structural interpretation of sgvc012 is ongoing however preliminary observations combined with the data from nge s earlier drilling to the west are consistent with a large scale chevron shaped fold oriented along the nnw trending water canyon structural corridor that has been cut by a series of high angle faults nge believes that these high angle faults likely provided the primary vertical control for the hydrothermal fluids that then travelled laterally to source the carlin type mineralization the company is targeting in the clm unit as well as the carlin type features of interest within the roberts mountains above within the mudstones and debris flows of the targeted clm unit hosting nge s east golden gorge target from 1 150 metres to the bottom of the hole at 1 405 metres sgvc012 encountered a thick interval of intense de calcification and brecciation hosting dense silicification with black remobilized carbon veinlets and fine grained sooty pyrite veinlets typical of carlin type hydrothermal fluid flow importantly the thickness and intensity of these alteration features is consistent with the massive volumes of hydrothermal fluid flow associated with nevada s large carlin type gold deposits and within this unit nge s preliminary xrf analyses confirm the presence of highly anomalous carlin type pathfinders at the concentrations known to exist in the bedrock surrounding these large deposits including a 96 metre interval averaging multi hundred ppm arsenic a photo accompanying this announcement is available at for the second hole of the program sgvc013 nge moved the drill rig 3 500 metres to the south of sgvc012 to set up at the eastern end of the company s southern e w fence of drill holes this is an important area of the project where the favourable lower plate bedrock units are compressed between the grass valley stock and the water canyon structural corridor a setting that is well suited to creating the conditions that promote increased carlin type hydrothermal fluid flow as well as an area that is coincident with the highest gold in groundwater anomaly in the gravels above the bedrock just as at the north end of the project here at the southern end the intensity of carlin type alteration features and highly anomalous concentrations of carlin type pathfinders seen in nge s earlier drilling increased markedly towards the east and nge s objective with sgvc013 is to intersect the southern projection of its east golden gorge target where the clm unit dips eastward towards the water canyon structural corridor with a planned depth of 1 450 metres sgvc013 is expected to collect samples much deeper than the earlier drill holes on this southern fence a photo accompanying this announcement is available at drilling began at sgvc013 on may 27 after reaching a depth of 447 metres and approaching what appears to be the alluvium bedrock contact drilling was suspended by nge s drilling contractor due to availability of qualified personnel sgvc013 has been stabilized with pq sized core rods and appropriate drilling fluids and the company expects to continue the hole once its contractor has re assembled the necessary personnel to achieve the deeper drilling depths

nevada s exposed terrains have produced more than 200 million ounces of gold and experts agree there is likely another 200 million ounces waiting to be discovered in the half of nevada where the bedrock is hidden beneath post mineral cover nge has spent more than 15 years developing and integrating new hydrogeochemistry groundwater chemistry and low cost drilling technology to build an industry leading geochemistry focused toolkit specifically to explore for new gold deposits under cover and the company is now advancing a portfolio of projects totalling more than 170 square kilometres nge s most advanced project is south grass valley located approximately 50 kilometres south southwest of the cortez complex operated by nevada gold mines barrick gold corp and newmont corporation joint venture within the specific region of north central nevada that hosts nevada s largest carlin type gold deposits ctgds since acquiring the project nge has completed an infill borehole groundwater sampling program detailed air magnetic and gravity geophysics surveys a soil geochemistry sampling program an initial diamond core drilling program consisting of 10 stratigraphic orientation holes and most recently 2020 a follow up reverse circulation drilling program consisting of 17 holes to increase the density of its bedrock sampling based on the results of its combined exploration datasets nge believes it has discovered a mineral system at south grass valley with the architecture and scale to potentially support multiple ctgds as the company continues to advance the project per ni 43 101 2 3 2 the company must remind its stakeholders that the project remains an exploration target for which the potential quantity and grade of any mineral resource is still

it was hard to decide what was more beautiful the delicate but intense colors of the tropical butterfly or the innocent look of wide eyed wonder on the face of the little boy watching it i had come to the butterfly encounter at the san diego zoo safari park but it was the total joy and rapt attention of the child that caught my eye what a magical moment i briefly felt a similar jolt of child like amazement while sitting in my garden last week and watching orioles nest building nearby when a monarch butterfly silently fluttered by only inches from my face far fewer in numbers than they historically were we still marvel at their delicate beauty when these wildflowers on the wing visit our gardens how can something weighing about the same as a dollar bill survive in the harsh natural world but survive they do and with the help of homeowners who love nature they are slowly increasing in numbers thanks to efforts to add an important plant to gardens that the monarch must have to survive local nurseries that carry native plants have struggled to meet the high demand for milkweed but do try to stock them when available if you are thinking about adding milkweed to your garden do some online research beforehand to avoid the wrong species the best choices are local natives such as california kotolo narrow leaf and skeleton milkweed some milkweeds are harder to get than others and regional climate differences might make one species preferable to your area visit calscape org to get specific range and climate information for the various kinds of asclepias milkweed species since adding several native narrow leaf milkweed plants to my garden a few years ago i have seen more monarchs as i watched this colorful visitor i noticed there were several monarchs dancing from flower to flower as they visited the blooming lantana and bottlebrush i pointed them out to my wife kati soon we were absorbed by these miracles of nature that live such a short life but add so much beauty to ours how long does the monarch butterfly live kati asked that s part of the mystery of these magnificent creatures and the answer is it depends you see it matters when the butterfly is born in general a monarch lives from two to six weeks but that changes for the last generation born each year this last crop of butterflies must live over the winter so they can start the breeding cycle over again in the spring these winter survivors will have migrated to warmer winter places and will return and lay eggs that hatch as the first generation in early spring this vanguard generation will complete their life cycle and lay eggs to produce the second generation arriving in may and june followed by the third generation in july and august as fall shadows lengthen and days get shorter the fourth generation of the year will brighten our gardens in september and october but as winter approaches they will migrate to warmer locations and survive up to nine months until they return home and begin the cycle again another one of nature s miracles of survival unlike eastern populations of monarchs that migrate to warmer forests in the mountains of mexico monarchs west of the rockies mostly journey to coastal locations in california each winter despite dwindling monarch numbers they still arrive for the winter in coastal areas of san diego orange monterey and santa cruz counties while i am fascinated by this mystery of the monarch s lifespan depending on when they are born their life cycle is no less captivating the typical life cycle for the monarch begins with tiny eggs being deposited on the leaves of milkweed these minute little bundles of life less than a millimeter in size will hatch as a caterpillar in three to four days and begin feeding on their host milkweed plant the monarch caterpillar is an eating machine ernie cowan the colorful monarch caterpillar is an eating machine and will develop quickly shedding its skin several times as it grows from about 2 millimeters to 45 millimeters in 10 to 14 days at this point the mature caterpillar begins the work of changing into a butterfly through the process of metamorphosis it will attach itself to a plant using silk it produces and shed for the last time as it encapsulates into a cocoon known as a chrysalis in another 10 to 14 days the fully developed monarch butterfly will emerge i will leave it to the scientists to explain the how but for now i simply take joy that the delicate butterfly has found a way to survive and in the words of the philosopher fredrich nietzsche we must remain as close to the flowers the grass and the butterflies as the child who is not yet so much taller than they are email ernie packtrain com or visit erniesoutdoors blogspot com
as the white house weighs the potential renomination of jerome powell as chair of the federal reserve officials are discussing the use of openings on the board to reshape the central bank to closer align with administration priorities such as inequality and tighter banking regulations according to people familiar with the matter president joe biden currently has one vacant fed governor seat to fill and could potentially replace three more top central bank officials in the coming year depending on how much he wants to revamp the fed s leadership powell and fed vice chairs richard clarida and randal quarles all have terms that will expire in coming months with several seats opening up the white house isn t looking at the chairmanship in isolation but rather what mix of governors to appoint so as to reshape policy toward the administration s agenda according to the people who spoke on condition of anonymity jerome powell chairman of the u s federal reserve pauses while speaking during a news conference following a federal open market committee fomc meeting on dec 19 2018 bloomberg news while no decision appears imminent the lack of any clear candidates to replace powell along with his expressed interest in keeping his job indicate that a renomination is possible that would be in keeping with a decades long tradition of presidents maintaining continuity in fed leadership one that former president donald trump broke one key influencer on fed appointments treasury secretary janet yellen has told those close to her that she has a good relationship with powell and is pleased with how he has steered monetary policy through the pandemic induced crisis according to two people familiar with the matter keeping powell 68 would remove a chance to install someone from a minority in the job for the first time in history however and could stoke criticism from progressive democrats one option to reduce potential tensions could be to present a package of appointments that addresses the need for diversity people familiar with the matter said all fed board nominations are subject to senate confirmation with the right mix of candidates biden may be able to persuade progressive allies in congress and outside the white house to support his choices that s how the white house is approaching a decision that history suggests is expected this fall on whether powell is asked to stay or if the administration proposes a new candidate according to people familiar with the matter spokeswomen at the white house and treasury and white house declined to comment nominations are made in a group but usually the group is made to protect one or more of the nominees said former fed governor laurence meyer in the 1990s meyer and governor alice rivlin were part of package with fed chair alan greenspan who was considered hawkish on policy by senators the nomination of powell a republican to the board in 2011 was yoked with democrat jeremy stein yellen who was powell s predecessor at the fed s helm along with white house chief of staff ron klain and national economic council director brian deese are expected to play key roles in making recommendations to biden as his decision nears the people said cecilia rouse jared bernstein and heather boushey of the white house s council of economic advisers and bharat ramamurti an nec official who previously worked for senator elizabeth warren will also be part of the process they said yellen and powell were colleagues at the fed board for six years before she left in early 2018 after trump replaced her with powell as chair since yellen became treasury chief the pair have kept up a tradition of weekly discussions between the secretary and fed chair the pandemic crisis has highlighted long standing disparities across the u s economy a major focus for biden and his top advisers the unemployment rate for black workers who have a disproportionate share of lower wage jobs and union membership was double that of their white counterparts during much of the past 50 years in part because the fed has historically tightened monetary policy just as the benefits of economic growth began to reach lower income workers powell has overseen the adoption of a new framework for monetary policy incorporating a more inclusive assessment of the labor market and a pledge to allow inflation to overshoot a 2 target to make up for prior underperformance he s also pledged a gradual trajectory for the withdrawal of monetary stimulus as the u s economy recovers from the pandemic moves that have been applauded by many democrats if president biden was asking me which he isn t i would advise to keep jay powell in place alan blinder a former fed vice chair appointed by president bill clinton said wednesday on bloomberg tv not so much as a reward for good behavior although you could say that he deserves a reward but just for the stability that it represents financial markets early this year reflected rising concerns about an inflation surge as the fed held off from signaling any tightening more recently treasury yields have slumped as some economic data undershot forecasts democratic senator sherrod brown of ohio who chairs the banking committee said in a recent interview that powell has rankled republicans with his own tilt toward the issues of inequality and climate don t talk about justice don t talk about poverty don t talk about climate don t talk about things that affect americans brown said in summarizing his take on gop views brown while refraining from saying if he supports or opposes a second term as chair for powell said his disagreements with powell have been mostly about quarles whose tenure as vice chair for supervision ends in october 2021 and about how the fed has been too weak on regulation and making sure banks behave in a public reasonable way including on decisions like stock buybacks quarles has left open the possibility of remaining a governor even if he is no longer vice chair given that his board membership slot doesn t expire until 2032 senator elizabeth warren a massachusetts democrat told quarles in may that the u s financial system will be safer when you are gone clarida s term as a fed governor expires in january 2022 he has not publicly discussed his future at the central bank powell s term as chair expires in february 2022 biden met with powell for the first time since becoming president last month when the president hosted the nation s top financial regulators in the oval office on climate change powell has pushed back against any idea that the issue should be a centerpiece of monetary policy saying it is mainly a question for government and elected representatives but he has noted that it has implications for the financial institutions the fed oversees and he did bring the fed into a club of central banks that discusses climate change as for the current vacancy on the fed board many white house officials have agreed that economists lisa cook and william spriggs both black are good candidates the people said

oil prices have been rising steadily for months you ve probably noticed one big consequence average gasoline prices have climbed to seven year highs as early as last week the expectations were that oil prices would either stabilize or rise gradually until an opec meeting that was supposed to be routine ended in an unexpected impasse with no agreement on what to do about oil production now analysts are bracing for everything from a price spike to a price plunge as millions of americans hit the road again there s just no certainty around where crude is headed here s what you need to know about the volatile oil prices demand for oil is finally coming back last year as the coronavirus pandemic spread around the world global oil demand dropped remarkably fast people stopped driving and flying markets were thrown completely out of whack so oil producers slashed their production including ahistoric cut in output from the group of countries collectively known as opec which includes major producers saudi arabia and russia now demand is returning as the u s china and some other parts of the world reopen for business as the impact from the pandemic wanes commutes vacation flights and road trips are all pushing fuel demand up in the u s a record number of people hit the road over the july fourth weekend according to aaa but oil producers are still pumping less oil one huge reason for the supply demand mismatch is that opec has taken a very gradual approach to putting barrels back on the market that s intended to keep prices high increasing revenues for oil producing countries meanwhile u s producers have also been pumping less than expected as they focus instead on making money for investors this was a surprise to everyone as the shale patch is famous for exuberantly producing oil when prices are rising the result is a totally different market from a year ago one that has been driving prices steadily up u s energy information administration u s energy information administration crude prices dropped sharply last spring but have risen steadily over recent months we ve seen a bit of a pivot and now we re actually looking at well what is going to happen if there is a supply shortage says louise dickson a senior analyst at rystad energy then opec met and things got interesting opec members got together for their monthly meeting last week pretty much everybody expected them to gradually increase their combined output but not so much that it would cause prices to drop that would serve the group s best interests and would have matched what the cartel has been doing recently instead the meeting devolved into drama as the united arab emirates wanted to be allowed to produce more oil individually which saudi arabia opposed rbc capital noted there are seemingly shakespearean elements to this drama which suggests a rift between two crown princes who were once extremely close whether it s geopolitics economics or interpersonal intrigue driving the dispute the powerful cartel found itself at an impasse after days of talks the meeting was called off indefinitely with no deal and no set plans to meet again that means the supply demand imbalance is set to grow even more than expected you d expect that to drive oil prices up but the actual consequences have been more complicated because people don t know what this means for opec the opec drama has created two completely opposite concerns if the cartel doesn t clinch a new deal to increase production and if the current deal remains in place that would drive prices up some analysts see 90 a barrel for oil as a possibility such a spike would not be good for many economies worldwide it would lead to a surge in gas prices and hit many sectors that depend on oil such as airlines on the other hand if the infighting causes opec to completely abandon its current production cuts there could be a free for all that would cause a ton of oil to flood the market that would push prices down potentially dramatically a few months from now which could cause chaos for oil producers nasdaq and associated press nasdaq and associated press brent crude prices rose then fell dramatically over the last week weekend dates not shown the two outcomes could not be more different and the uncertainty about which might happen has created an interesting few days on oil markets global crude prices rose to a multiyear high on monday off the news that there was no deal then they plunged on tuesday and wednesday wiping out weeks worth of gains and of course it s still possible that opec will announce a deal that would land somewhere in the middle and potentially stabilize prices in fact many analysts think that s the most likely outcome despite the lack of any public progress toward it because there s a ton of pressure for a compromise in early 2020 opec caused prices to go haywire thanks to a price war between saudi arabia and russia but that was quickly followed by the historic agreement to cut production which is widely credited with rebalancing crude markets and supporting prices for well over a year now there s a lot riding on whether opec can again strike a deal to keep markets balanced either a price spike or a collapse would be bad news for opec members and a spike would be particularly worrying for the world s oil consumers given that prices are already quite high in the u s the biden administration is clearly concerned about the prospect that gas prices might rise even further under former president donald trump the white house got unusually involved in opec negotiations and president biden seems to be continuing the tradition the white house has talked directly to multiple opec members and is urging a compromise to boost production it s another sign of how quickly things can change in the oil industry just a few years ago plenty of oil experts were asking if opec was a has been issuing edicts from its headquarters in vienna with no real impact on oil markets no one is asking that now copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
our articles depend on you for their effectiveness share with kin coworkers and friends k philippe gendrault a s the press and the media claim the relationship between the united states and russia is particularly tense even at a time when j biden just met with v putin russia russia russia the united states continues to be literally obsessed with that country notwithstanding the new cold war with china russia keeps on being the target of american wrath fears and anxieties seemingly underhanded prone to cyberterrorism constantly challenging and interfering in american affairs both domestic and abroad russia if one listens to the mainstream media persists in remaining a thorn in democracy s side of course at the mere mention of russia most will associate the soviet bear and the moral corruption its communist ideology unleashed onto the benevolent peace loving and freedom loving world i e western social democracies with the us at the helm in light of the fact that the russian federation is no longer socialist one might ponder why the united states and europe carry on this veritable cold war obsession with russia recently j biden answered in the positive whether v putin was a killer a reporter for the atlantic stated i looked into his eyes once and what i saw scared me half to death the atlantic 03 02 14 h clinton stated that putin does not have a soul politico 01 06 08 which was echoed by j biden in 2011 who is claimed to have told the russian leader mr prime minister i am looking into your eyes and i don t think you have a soul the hill 07 21 14 whereas g w bush felt able to see v putin s soul in a more or less positive fashion when asked if he saw what bush saw obama stated i looked the man putin in the eyes and saw the enemy dallas morning post 06 29 10 the russian revolution stoddard asserts set revolutionists everywhere aquiver firing their blood inflaming their will to power and nerving their hearts to victory but stoddard explains russia was more susceptible to revolutionary ardor because of its atavism its veneers of civilization laid thinly over instinctive wildness and refractory barbarism one could certainly wonder why so many people seem so keen on gazing into the russian leader s eyes and more particularly why they assume this will inform them on the man s character and particularly on geopolitical relations between the russian federation and the united states the concern for his soul or rather the concern to figure out whether he has a soul or not appears to be no less important in us politics this is reminiscent of a controversy 2018 surrounding the death penalty case of a black individual that occurred when one of the jurors a certain b gattie expressed his views claiming after studying the bible i have wondered if black people even have souls newsweek 2 22 19 seemingly the enemy is soulless russians or should i say the russian soul clearly remain some mysterious object to the american public and politicians of this country what of russians what is it about the russian people that triggers this let s call it what it is primitive and paranoid reaction whereas all rationality disappears leading parents and children alike to run to the metaphorical shelter shouting people beware the russians are coming russophobia is usually defined by the collins dictionary as follows an intense hatred and often irrational hatred for russia or especially the former soviet union while the first known use of the term russophobia occurred in 1836 russophobia usually associated with the ussr has been burning red hot well before the russian revolution of 1917 in france with the myth of eastern despotism in great britain with the threat of the russian empire in germany where cosmopolitan russia represented the antithesis of the prussian state and finally in the united states who carried on where the french the english and the germans left off creating russophobia clarity press 2017 one cannot escape but notice that russia was already a threat to the great western imperial and colonial powers well before it became socialist of course the nazi ideological handling of populations of eastern europe is sadly well known and is associated with the extermination of poles and russians nazi colonial project generalplan ost deemed racially inferior ethnic groups under the label of untermensch subhuman or under man but the notion of untermensch so appreciated by the nazis is not a german invention the term with its racial connotation was born from the mind of the harvard historian and ku klux klan member lothrop stoddard and expressed in his book the revolt of civilization the menace of the under man published in 1922 the very man whom w e b dubois debated and ridiculed in a famous encounter in chicago in 1929 to really understand the roots of russophobia we must delve into the white supremacist racialist fascist and anti communist mythology constructed about russians in the 20s which we will hypothesize persists to this day the ideological foundation of russophobia is the very same as the one of anticommunism and anti blackness although the white supremacist will ask are russians white people for the sake of clarity we will use all the terms used by white supremacist and fascist authors in order to not whitewash or moderate the obvious and patent racism of their ideology in a text published in 1920 the rising tide of color against white world supremacy for l stoddard the racial impoverishment of russia started with the eviction of nordic populations from their homes stoddard claims that nordic lands including russia after the fall of rome were overtaken by slavs and wends in consequence to mongoloid pressure on top of the partial occupation of russia by slavs and the elimination of nordic populations a series of mongoloid invasions transformed the racial landscape of russian lands thus the various populations of russia and the balkans underwent the influence of asiatic tatar and mongoloid settlements for stoddard the whole land suffered the barbarism of the hordes of the east in this text stoddard does answer the question whether russians are white or not if he precises that in more recent history russia became once again more nordicized i e white through the rise of a russian nobility originating in the baltic region he also clearly asserted that in the rest of the country through bolshevism the half asiatic peasantry of russia became dominant thereby russians are semi asian whatever that means later on stoddard in the text mentioned earlier revolt of civilization attributed the revolutionary unrest in russia not so much to bolshevik propaganda or to prior historical events but principally to what this racial impoverishment implied accordingly russians were more primitive than western europeans and reverted easily to their animal instincts this author follows up analyses of the literary giant tolstoy who finds himself accused of having an instinctive aversion to civilization stoddard writes the first wild impulse which tolstoy felt when he saw a building or any complex whole created by the hand of man was to simplify to level to crush to destroy so that the stone might be left upon the other and the place might again become wild and simple and purified from the work of man s hand russians accordingly wish to simplify complexity and to destroy culture in light of this critique of the russian writer stoddard concludes that the russian people are made up chiefly of primitive racial strains some of which especially the tatars and other asiatic nomad elements are distinctly wild stocks which have always shown an instinctive hostility to civilization communism is thrown into the lot and becomes reduced to an instinctive reaction against the attempt to civilize russia begun by peter the great the whole russian people resist the civilizing endeavor of westernization russians thereby are prone to revolutionary reactions against civilization the embrace of communism is only a symptom of their racial inferiority these primitive hordes have converted russia into a vacant level plan and threatened to do the same with europe and the whole world the establishment of socialism can be attributed to the strength of the forces of chaos and the rise in criminality hooliganism characteristic of the russian races stoddard emphasizes the modern social revolutionary movement dates from about the middle of the eighteenth century ever since that time there has been flowing a continuous stream of subversive agitation assuming many forms but essentially the same and ever broadening and deepening until it has become the veritable flood which has submerged russia and which threatens to engulf our entire civilization its most noteworthy achievement has been the working out of a revolutionary philosophy and propaganda so insidiously persuasive as to wield together many innately diverse elements into a common league of discontent furthering his analysis of this offensive tide stoddard focused his attention on unionism in which he saw for the first time in human history a full fledged philosophy of the under man prologue of that vast revolt against civilization which with russian bolshevism has actually begun for l stoddard these movements of discontent syndicalists in france bolshevists in russia i w w s in america united against civilization as a whole one army enlisted for a single war a war which he called of the hand against the brain the underworld of under men according to him wants to destroy the world for under men despise thought itself their guide is not reason but the proletarian truth of instinct and passion the whole russian character for this fascist writer is fundamentally primitive criminal instinctual violent irrational and un intellectual such accusations thrown at the russian enemy of white civilization are clearly not unique and reveal the stereotypical aspect of these racist analyses of all so called non white or poor uncivilized populations not least of which the african populations in the americas and colonies on the african continent the russian revolution stoddard asserts set revolutionists everywhere aquiver firing their blood inflaming their will to power and nerving their hearts to victory but stoddard explains russia was more susceptible to revolutionary ardor because of its atavism its veneers of civilization laid thinly over instinctive wildness and refractory barbarism from claiming to russian race inferiority stoddard continues a relentless assault on socialist endeavors and its leadership constituted according to him mostly of unstable individuals tainted geniuses paranoiacs unbalanced fanatics unscrupulous adventurers clever criminals etc the russian under man has therefore succeeded in eliminating the racially superior elements of society namely nordic aristocrats czarist intellectuals and the bourgeoisie sole redemptors of barbarian slavs in this latter text stoddard particularly emphasized the inferiority of russians by proclaiming that their adherence to bolshevism socialism and equality reveals such inferiority counter to the natural order of racial inequalities the association between russian racial inferiority and communism imposed by the white supremacist writer is not unlike that found between anti blackness and anti communism burden stelley left voice 2017 as mentioned above and these racial considerations find their ways into national american politics particularly the anxiety around the issue of the russian race which did have an impact on us policies of immigration as shown by a report of the us senate s immigration commission in 1910 j s roucek 1969 slavs sclave slavic or slavonic sometimes wrongly called in the united states hun see magyar to be defined as that aryan race or linguistic group which occupies the greater part of russia and the balkans the russians and the polish see are its leading tongues the slavic the teutonic and the italian or latin are the three great stocks that furnish the most of the population of europe as well as our annual flood of immigrants of these three the slavic and the italic have been greatly replacing the teutonic in american immigration and the slavic is perhaps the most significant for the future because of its great population physically and perhaps temperamentally the slavs approach the asiatic or particularly the tatar more closely than do the peoples of western europe in language they are as truly aryan as ourselves there is some truth in the old saying scratch a russian and you find a tatar especially if he comes from southern russia where once lived the mongol conquerors of the russians if the slav is still backward in western ideas appliances and form of government it is not far distant when he will stand in the lead the race is still young j s roucek notes that this report stood as one of the most important factors contributing to the immigration quota act of 1924 in the american psyche the russian was and remains a confusing character consequent to the uncertainty of his or her location in the racist white supremacist landscape european in language but asian in blood leaving the russian character as mal formed and threatening in the racist mind primitive uncivilized antisocial destructive criminal mentally and intellectually challenged the russian like the black man comes to represent the incarnation of all the anxieties persecutory and paranoid projections of white supremacy onto others in any event the russian character is not trustworthy the integration of such racial barbarism with socialist ideas carried by the lower classes altogether furthers the rationalization of all white supremacist fascist capitalist conservative and reactionary beliefs namely the russians are dangerous no matter what a french fascist and white supremacist françois coty introduced his 1931 text sauvons nos colonies let us save our colonies with the exact same ideological prejudices but in the french colonial context he stated in the book s preamble it is the destiny of asia to periodically rush to the conquest of europe and to set about its destruction this is like some mystical call that barbarians can t resist they hear generation after generation the whispering voice of genseric calling him to ransack rome in the vth century the huns overthrowing dozens of people and taking them in tow already aspired to leave no stones standing in occidental cities and bragged that grass would never grow again in places they had been through in the xiith century the rush started again with genghis khan s mongols who left an indelible asian footprint on russia not particularly curious about the yellow soul westerners generally ignore that memories of the great invasions of past are still today the topics of conversation of mongoloid races and those arouse in them the hope for invasions anew bolshevism twice asiatic through its original conception of hebraic theories and through the recruiting of its most dangerous followers who mostly belong to mongoloid people of russia has come to crystalize all the hopes of the yellow race and to have it understand that the time had come from the urals to the depth of siberia a great chill of excitement overcame the destructive hordes of yesterday the first manifestations of these asian warriors awakening against europe have naturally occurred in the colonies created by the white race on the asian land itself it is there that inevitably the first convulsions would appear allowing the yellow man to take his revenge on the westerner the testimony of the mongol lenin of pure chuvash blood claimed among other things the necessity of throwing europeans out of asia not only would asian forces increase in this final conflict but european nations would come out of this victorious insurrection in their asian colonies demoralized uncertain of their ethnic superiority and materially poorer with the loss of hundreds of billions invested in their possessions the assault on europe would follow we propose to study in our next book how lenin s program is already activated in asia with the undermining of european domination with the progressive conquest by yellows led by bolshevism and with the undermining of the moral ascendency of whites but the threat in asia is not all the world has changed since attila and genghis khan and asia benefits at the expense of europe from the inventions and progresses which europe itself has achieved for centuries the most modern discoveries like the radio are used by bolshevist propaganda as efficaciously as the ancient forces of darkness still holding in some corner of the globe like negro witchcraft revolutionary syndicalism popularized among negroes yellows as well as whites is the vehicle of the revolution under any climate in the face of this rising tide menacing with all sorts of perils the future of our race the only one to which the world owes its moral intellectual and material progress from the white supremacist and fascist perspective the russian may appear white may speak an aryan language like ours but he or she is not white behind russians lurks the invading mongolian hordes the savage asiatic warriors primitive destroyers of civilization but alongside the russian and all his mongoloid associates we might include the chinese who because of such primitiveness have embraced the savagery of socialism and communism to echo the parallel between anti blackness and anticommunism explained by c burden stelley 2017 these white supremacists and fascists writings reveal how the assumed inferior racial status of itself suffices to explain the passions for unionism and communism and reciprocally how unionism and communism come to be embraced by people because they are of inferior racial standing racial inferiority and communism become one and the same therefore within the logic of this white supremacist and fascist ideology racism and anticommunism become both indices of civilization of racial and cultural superiority and of social order a system of beliefs embedded to this day in the euro american bourgeois social self representation for this euro american ideological structuring of social order steeped in this white supremacist and fascist ideology the challenge has been to attempt separating racism from anti communism which liberals still today persist in trying to achieve i e to uphold anti communism while lessening racism clearly to no avail even though these scientific racial theories have been debunked scientifically as well as politically we contend that this white supremacy and fascist ideology expressed blatantly through the systemic racism prevalent in capitalist systems still frames the imaginary blueprint of american culture when it comes to russian culture with its asian connotation the fantasy of facing a russian chinese or north korean invasion as portrayed by hollywood vehicles like red dawn stand as modern versions of the mongoloid hordes of yesterday imaginary scripts speaking more loudly and accurately of the invaded than the invaders as we can observe these fears and anxieties framed through the template of russophobic white supremacist ideology remain as powerful today as they were then so much that they can easily and readily be mobilized to fuel the popular sentiment against russia china or both since behind every russian lurks some primitive asian threat and behind them all lurks some communist insurgency from russiagate to the wuhan virus the blueprint of hatred for all things russian and chinese by extension has already been processed and ready for use a hundred years ago and to this day the american population remains psychosocially primed to take on this soulless enemy the destroyer of civilization whenever the white supremacist and fascist finger of the bourgeoisie points at that enemy be it contemporary russia or socialist china or as noted both k philippe

the singapore ministry of health announced tuesday that only individuals who have received the coronavirus vaccine products developed by american companies pfizer and moderna will count towards official national vaccination statistics excluding those who received chinese made products the chinese communist party has approved five vaccine products for use within the country abroad it has focused on promoting two of them the vaccine candidate developed by the firm sinovac biotech and its competitor from sinopharm sinovac s coronavac has received significant international scrutiny over its apparently low rate of success in preventing coronavirus infections as observed through large coronavirus outbreaks in countries that have relied on it as its main inoculation product both the vaccines by pfizer and moderna tested at upwards of 94 percent effectiveness in clinical trials in preventing coronavirus infections following the administration of two doses in contrast coronavac tested at 50 38 efficacy just barely passing the 50 percent threshold typically considered the standard to declare a vaccine candidate effective sinovac ceo yin weidong later claimed the vaccine was 80 90 percent effective but never offered evidence or cited a study from which that number emerged the sinopharm coronavirus vaccine tested at 79 percent efficacy against only symptomatic coronavirus infections not counting asymptomatic spread according to the world health organization w h o the national vaccination numbers reflect only those vaccinated under the national vaccination programme the singapore ministry of health asserted tuesday according to the country s straits times currently this only includes those vaccinated with the moderna covid 19 and pfizer biontech comirnaty vaccines singapore is only officially using the pfizer and moderna products which use unprecedented mrna technology to create antibodies against the chinese coronavirus in its immunization campaign the sinovac product is in small scale circulation mostly for those allergic to the available options the policy will affect those coming from abroad having received other vaccine products not approved in the country however such as the chinese vaccines and the controversial russian product sputnik v over 17 000 people have received doses of the sinovac product in the country as of this week even though it has not been authorized for widespread use there yet authorities have largely preserved its sinovac stock for individuals who suffer an adverse reaction to the first dose of either the pfizer or moderna vaccines sinovac biotech has not at press time complied with a request from the singapore health ministry for more test data on its coronavirus inoculation according to the straits times the straits times reported last week that singapore government officials have contacted about 3 600 people who were allergic to the first dose of the mrna and more than 1 400 have indicated interest in the programme conversely individuals who received sinovac s product abroad would still be eligible to receive full inoculations with the pfizer or moderna products in singapore meaning the government would treat them as unvaccinated ministry of health director of medical services kenneth mak told reporters wednesday that singapore s government could not vouch for the safety of mixing vaccine products we have not stopped them although data is still lacking considering what the effectiveness is of this strategy using two different vaccines we call this a heterologous vaccination strategy mak said if there are those who are eligible to receive the vaccination from the national vaccination programme we will allow them to register but we will advise them about the fact that evidence is not available concerning how well the response is if they had received other vaccines before the health ministry noted this week that the national immunization registry does keep records of who receives vaccine candidates that the government approved aside from the american products but did not clarify if this record was enough to consider the affected individuals fully vaccinated and thus not subject to any potential limitations on their freedoms as part of the country s efforts to contain the pandemic singapore has one of the lowest chinese coronavirus infection and death rates in the world as of wednesday the government has documented 62 640 cases of coronavirus on the island nation and only 36 deaths about 65 percent of singaporeans have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine according to yahoo news singapore singapore s decision not to officially count sinovac customers as vaccinated against coronavirus is the latest blow to the company which has seen its product become increasingly popular in the developing world but the vaccine candidate s use precede large coronavirus outbreaks among the two most prominent examples are those of seychelles and chile two nations that received international acclaim for their rapid rates of administration of coronavirus vaccines their reliance on the chinese made products some experts have suggested may be to blame for the fact that both countries experienced large surges of coronavirus cases occurring as the number of vaccinations rose chinese officials have admitted the poor quality of chinese made coronavirus vaccine candidates the head of the chinese center for disease control cdc gao fu admitted in april that the chinese products don t have very high protection rates he later insisted his comment was a misunderstanding and that he was merely encouraging chinese companies to pursue the mrna technology used by the american vaccines sinovac biotech itself has suggested that its product may work better if patients receive a third dose the chinese vaccines failures have not stopped the communist party from continuing to promote them on tuesday the chinese government propaganda newspaper global times reported that chinese companies are inking deals with several african countries to manufacture their products on the continent morocco recently signed a deal to domestically

federal reserve board chairman jerome powell testifies on the federal reserve s response to the coronavirus pandemic during a house oversight and reform select subcommittee on the coronavirus hearing on capitol hill in washington on june 22 2021 federal reserve officials started discussing at their meeting last month the timing and mechanics of reducing their huge monthly bond purchases which are used to keep longer term interest rates in check ap reports the debate revealed in the minutes of the fed s june meeting released wednesday reflected a broadly positive outlook on the economy among fed policymakers but also some concern that higher inflation could prove more persistent than the central bank has previously indicated still economists saw little sign that the fed was any closer to hiking interest rates or reducing its bond buys a few policymakers mentioned that they expected the conditions for beginning to reduce bond purchases would be met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated in light of incoming data the minutes said the fed is buying us 120 billion a month in treasury securities and mortgage backed bonds to keep longer term interest rates low and encourage more borrowing and spending those purchases have flooded financial markets with cash potentially fueling asset bubbles some economists have argued the fed has said that it will keep making the purchases until the economy makes substantial further progress toward its goals of full employment and an inflation rate slightly above 2 percent but there is a clear split on the fed s policymaking committee with some officials cautioning that recent economic reports provide a less clear signal about the underlying economic momentum the june 15 16 meeting was held before the most recent jobs report which showed the economy had gained 850 000 new positions last month several of these officials emphasized that the fed should be patient about making any changes to its bond purchase plans the minutes said paul ashworth chief u s economist for capital economics a consulting firm said the minutes were not as hawkish as we suspected in fed parlance hawks typically worry more about inflation and are less concerned with keeping unemployment low while doves take the opposite view there seems to be only limited support for beginning to taper the monthly asset purchases anytime soon ashworth said after the june meeting the fed issued a statement and a set of economic projections that signaled that it would potentially dial back its low interest rate policies earlier than it had previously projected the policymakers forecast that they would hike the fed s benchmark short term interest rate twice by the end of 2023 in march they had indicated no rate hikes would occur before 2024 the minutes showed fed officials expressed optimism about the economy even as they said it was still far from meeting their employment and inflation goals policymakers observed that economic activity was expanding at a historically rapid pace led by robust gains in consumer spending the minutes said most fed officials expected inflation to decline in the coming months as some supply chain bottlenecks eased the minutes said fed chair jerome powell has repeatedly said that recent jumps in consumer prices would be temporary and largely reflected disruptions surrounding the reopening of the economy but a substantial majority of policymakers said that there was a risk inflation could stay higher than expected because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed most economists still expect a reduction or tapering of bond purchases to begin by late this year or early next year with an announcement of the change potentially occurring in late august at the fed s annual conference at jackson hole wyoming some differences over the timing of the tapering have emerged among the fed s regional bank presidents with dallas fed president robert kaplan saying last week that he favored pulling back on the purchases sooner rather than later san francisco fed president mary daly in an interview with the associated press said last week that it would be appropriate to consider tapering later this year or early next year but she cautioned that the economy is far from full employment

update and the threat of some council areas going into even stricter lockdown would be a negative for the stock market but no the asx200 opened higher yesterday and at the 11am confirmation just kept on going there was a bit of a wobble in the afternoon but the index bounced off 7300 and kicked to the close this despite a weak session on wall street the most notable asset price move yesterday was that of the ten year bond yield which fell 10 basis points to 1 36 a day after the rba announced tapering the us equivalent had also dropped overnight and did so again last night rather confounding commentators in australia s case was the rba s announced pace of tapering not as steep as feared unlikely as economists were more surprised in the other direction is it a sign of what i had discussed before year end being the need for 60 40 balanced funds to rebalance after a 24 fy21 gain in equities well no because then bond buying would have been met with stock selling is it a sudden easing of inflation fears unlikely as the drivers of possibly transitory inflation remain firmly in place we have to wait until the end of this month for australia s june quarter cpi result or is it simply a case of demand for yield from abroad foreign sovereigns and large pension funds simply have to find low risk yield somewhere anywhere and australia and the us are seen as safe bets indeed australia has a higher credit rating aaa than the us aa on wall street the latter explanation is being seen as the most plausible but whatever the case it was a good day for australian stocks and in particular the growth stocks found in the technology sector 2 8 technology was sold down on tuesday on the rba tapering news as were all yield paying sectors yesterday the complete opposite was true aside from the swift rebound in technology staples shot back up 1 8 telcos 1 6 and the banks 0 8 even though lower long end yields are a drag on interest margins i noted yesterday the aussie had initially jumped up to us76c on the rba statement but was back down a full cent overnight healthcare fell on the aussie s gain on tuesday but bounced right back 1 7 yesterday even property managed a 0 9 gain despite the impact of lockdowns on retail reits the notable exceptions were utilities flat which suffered from oil price falls and industrials flat which were perhaps the one indicator of the impact of an extended lockdown the energy sector was the only real loser down 1 9 on said oil prices among individual stocks challenger cgf won the day with an 8 8 gain on news apollo global management had taken a 15 stake wall street rebounded somewhat last night from tuesday night s losses and having been down 11 points ahead of yesterday s open this morning our futures are up 11 points minutes to midnight the biggest policy problem for the rba is the balance between needing to keep rates low in order not to upset the economic rebound and the side effect of inducing runaway house prices as a result the rba s qe program is centred only on government bond purchases analysts expect apra to move soon to tighten lending standards to cool the housing market the us is also experiencing a house price surge for the same low rate reason but the fed s qe program includes both government bond and mortgage backed security purchases hence the fed has the capacity to cool the us housing market by backing off on buying mbss while maintaining bond purchase levels and that s what some fomc board members want to do sooner rather than later according to the minutes of last month s fed meeting we recall that the meeting late last month resulted in some confusion with around half of fomc members predicting via their dot plots rate hikes would be needed possibly as early as next year while jay powell at his press conference as good as laughed that prospect off the minutes confirmed division within the fomc of those believing the time is nigh to begin tapering and those wanting to remain patient to wait for the actual data to finally provide the green light while this hawkish leaning should by rights suggest higher us bond yields the ten year yield has done nothing but slide back from its highs over 1 7 in recent months and having fallen 7 basis points on tuesday night fell another 5 basis points last night to 1 32 as noted above foreign buying is assumed as the driver us inflation risk be damned in another unusual move the nasdaq closed only a tick higher last night new high of course while the dow and s p posted 0 3 gains it seems the market is no longer jumping at the shadows of bond price movements when it comes to the growth value rotation the s p s rebound was also good enough for another new high it was nonetheless a choppy session one in which any sense of direction or of exactly which sectors to buy was not evident the only definitive sector move was that of energy which again had a bad night as oil prices continued to fall economic data aside we re getting very close to the

one of two areas covered by a proposed urban renewal authority in craig courtesy nearly 130 acres of craig are on their way to a classification that will make them easier to redevelop and improve the craig urban renewal authority is close to finalizing the first of two areas mostly in the city but also some on the south side that will offer property owners within their boundaries the opportunity to apply for financial help with capital improvements on the property urban renewal authorities are formed to help alleviate blight within certain areas said craig s economic development manager shannon scott who is heading up the project s administrative development that doesn t necessarily mean the buildings are dilapidated or in bad shape it can also mean there s a need for infrastructure improvement things like that essentially by capitalizing on the anticipated increase in property tax revenue generated by an improved property relative to the unimproved existing property the urban renewal authority can to issue bonds or other financial assistance to property owners interested in making those improvements this is called tax increment financing it s utilized from steamboat springs to colorado springs as well as thousands of locations across the country the properties or businesses within the zone if they re looking to do improvements revitalization redevelopment whatever they can apply through the urban renewal authority to see if they re eligible scott said the urban renewal authority has a number of options it can offer such a property owner the money comes from that expected increase in property taxes after the improved property gets reassessed for example if someone bought an empty building on yampa avenue part of which is within one of the urban renewal areas being proposed and that property owner redeveloped the old building into something more valuable to the space that building s property assessment would rise say from 100 000 to 500 000 and its property tax contribution with it the urban renewal authority expecting that 400 000 increase in tax revenue should the building be redeveloped can issue varying degrees of financing to the property owner to help the redevelopment take place where can this happen and what needs to happen first there are two areas being proposed named simply urban renewal area no 1 and urban renewal area no 2 ura 1 is on the west side of town encompassing the mall and stretching south along mack lane and steele street to third street leaving out an island for the former kmart building and its parking lot that won t be part of the area it covers 53 acres the urban renewal area 1 covers the mall and surrounding area not including the location of the former kmart courtesy ura 2 includes a horizontal strip south of the center of town from ranney street along first street and angling up first street to stock drive then back along stock drive into town and covering two little fingers of craig that include downtown along yampa avenue and the area south of the swimming complex it covers 74 acres it s really still in the formation stages a lot of things need to be approved scott said five taxing entities levy property taxes on the two areas the fire district school district city county and community college district and all have to agree to their potential tax dollars being apportioned this way so far that s going well scott said but there are a few remaining hurdles to clear in june we were able to get them all to agree to sharing their percentage she said now we have those intergovernmental agreements approved and the plans have to be approved by city planning county planning board of county commissioners to make sure they re all in line with the comprehensive plans that s a lot of hoops to jump through but scott said it s one of the primary tasks she was given when she was brought on to the city staff who controls the money the craig urban renewal authority is managed by a large board of directors which includes all of craig city council as well as representatives from each of the other four taxing districts the board has the liberty to choose how to finance or whether to finance a project scott said cura can issue bonds as we generate revenue that will be paid back through the revenue generation we can also offer sums that can be used as collateral where an applicant could say they ve got 200 000 agreed to come from cura over the next 5 to 10 years and that helps them get a loan scott said and we re talking about frontloading the fund where if we can find grant money to just put in there and be able to start getting projects going right away but that s iffy at this point the two areas are in varying stages of proximity to being ready to accept applications ura 1 is expected to meet city council approval july 13 which after the formality of notifying property owners in the area will essentially activate that area ura 2 needs a little longer as property owners in the unincorporated parts of moffat county included in the area decide on if they want their properties included or not scott expects that last step to be completed in september the goal is to provide areas that really need some remediation and revitalization with incentives for business and property owners to want to develop in those areas she said that s the bottom line of it all it s a great program and it can do really good work here

the history of cinema as an art parallels its history as a technology ever wondered why the colour in the wizard of oz is so saturated well it wasn t the first technicolor film but it was the first to effectively advertise mgm s new 3 strip colour process to a global audience why advertise something at half mast this kind of technological innovation in cinema is of course spurred by economic motives for instance 3d thrived in three waves in direct response to the economic threats posed by new technologies in the 1950s in response to television in the 1980s responding to vhs and in the 21st century in the face of increased online streaming now we have 4dx a gimmick one suspects won t take off in this era of digital cinema with celluloid virtually replaced by video technology the latest technological battle concerns image resolution a digital image is made up of pixels little shapes usually boxes that are the smallest controllable element of the image resolution refers to the number of pixels appearing in an image and is usually measured in pixels per inch as a rule the more pixels the crisper the image that is the sharper the edges of the subject appear advertisement in digital cinema s resolution wars you will often hear people speak about 4k as in 4000 or 8k or now even 12k resolution this number refers to the number of horizontal pixels a typical 4k digital cinema image for instance has a resolution of 4 096 horizontal x 2 160 vertical pixels image capture resolution is only one factor in how an image looks dynamic range that is difference between the darkest and lightest parts of the image is another but most cinematographers and techies agree the camera s resolution is crucial to the crispness of the image in 2018 netflix were snubbed by the cannes film festival on the basis netflix produced films are not true cinema this year again there are no netflix produced films in the festival competition due to a rule all films selected to compete must have a local theatrical release cannes is right most made for netflix productions don t look like the cinema we re used to why there s a technical answer though the company streams some films that are not netflix originals it requires narrative feature films made for netflix be shot on cameras with a true 4k uhd sensor in other words the sensor which detects and conveys the information required to make an image must be at least 3 840 pixels wide or ultra high definition flat and depthless this technical specification is strikingly evident in david fincher s recent netflix original production mank a black and white biopic about herman j mankiewicz s ghostwriting of citizen kane an old black and white film shot on celluloid has a grainy texture that draws the eye into and around the image this is partly the result of the degradation of the film print which occurs over time but primarily because of the physical processing of the film itself all celluloid film has a grainy look this grain is an optical effect related to the small particles of metallic silver that emerge through the film s chemical processing this is not the case with digital cameras thus video images captured by high resolution sensors look different to those shot on celluloid the images in mank look flat depthless they are too clean and clear this is not as much of a problem on a big screen when the images are huge but the high resolution is really noticeable when the images are compressed on the kind of domestic tv or computer screens most people use to stream netflix the edges look too sharp the shades too clearly delineated compared to what we have been used to as cinemagoers the absurd thing is companies like cinegrain now sell digital overlays of film stock that can endow video with the grainy film look their company motto is make digital more cinematic using cinegrain the natural result of the physical process has been superseded by video but digital cinema makers reintroduce this as one component in achieving a film look gary oldman and amanda seyfried in the netflix film mank netflix does allow limited exceptions to its rule with use of non approved cameras requiring its explicit approval and a more flexible approach to non fiction productions according to y m cinema magazine 30 of netflix s best movies of 2020 were made on non approved cameras still in stipulating the use of 4k or higher sensor cameras netflix radically reduces the aesthetic autonomy of film directors and producers if we think of netflix as a production studio this is not surprising all studios like all major corporations dictate the nature of their products including the aesthetics and feel of their films but this requirement means their productions look similar and the imagery to a cinephile anyway too clinical glorious granularity all film festivals distributors and networks request delivery of films conforming to their specifications but this usually has nothing to do with the source camera behind the delivered file if it looks and plays well it looks and plays well the film open water 2003 for example which made over us 50 million at the box office from a budget of under us 200 000 was shot on mini dv a low quality and now obsolete video format but it perfectly suited the film and thus works netflix in stipulating 4k camera sensors reproduces the assumption higher resolution is necessarily better for all or even most films but one of the reasons american film noir still looks so good or the new hollywood films of the 1960s and 1970s like easy rider and bonnie and clyde is partly because of the celluloid technology itself in all its glorious granularity the beauty of these cinematic images has nothing to do with the sharpness of the edges of the photographed subjects from where is this assumption that sharper images are better and more aesthetically effective art has always sought to say something in its deviation from its realistic reproduction of the world that is in its expression as with all technological innovation in a capitalist context this assumption stems from the competitive impulse to appear to be doing something better than everyone else the

oil prices have been rising steadily for months you ve probably noticed one big consequence average gasoline prices have climbed to seven year highs as early as last week the expectations were that oil prices would either stabilize or rise gradually until an opec meeting that was supposed to be routine ended in an unexpected impasse with no agreement on what to do about oil production now analysts are bracing for everything from a price spike to a price plunge as millions of americans hit the road again there s just no certainty around where crude is headed here s what you need to know about the volatile oil prices demand for oil is finally coming back last year as the coronavirus pandemic spread around the world global oil demand dropped remarkably fast people stopped driving and flying markets were thrown completely out of whack so oil producers slashed their production including ahistoric cut in output from the group of countries collectively known as opec which includes major producers saudi arabia and russia now demand is returning as the u s china and some other parts of the world reopen for business as the impact from the pandemic wanes commutes vacation flights and road trips are all pushing fuel demand up in the u s a record number of people hit the road over the july fourth weekend according to aaa but oil producers are still pumping less oil one huge reason for the supply demand mismatch is that opec has taken a very gradual approach to putting barrels back on the market that s intended to keep prices high increasing revenues for oil producing countries meanwhile u s producers have also been pumping less than expected as they focus instead on making money for investors this was a surprise to everyone as the shale patch is famous for exuberantly producing oil when prices are rising the result is a totally different market from a year ago one that has been driving prices steadily up u s energy information administration u s energy information administration crude prices dropped sharply last spring but have risen steadily over recent months we ve seen a bit of a pivot and now we re actually looking at well what is going to happen if there is a supply shortage says louise dickson a senior analyst at rystad energy then opec met and things got interesting opec members got together for their monthly meeting last week pretty much everybody expected them to gradually increase their combined output but not so much that it would cause prices to drop that would serve the group s best interests and would have matched what the cartel has been doing recently instead the meeting devolved into drama as the united arab emirates wanted to be allowed to produce more oil individually which saudi arabia opposed rbc capital noted

driving the dispute the powerful cartel found itself at an impasse after days of talks the meeting was called off indefinitely with no deal and no set plans to meet again that means the supply demand imbalance is set to grow even more than expected you d expect that to drive oil prices up but the actual consequences have been more complicated because people don t know what this means for opec the opec drama has created two completely opposite concerns if the cartel doesn t clinch a new deal to increase production and if the current deal remains in place that would drive prices up some analysts see 90 a barrel for oil as a possibility such a spike would not be good for many economies worldwide it would lead to a surge in gas prices and hit many sectors that depend on oil such as airlines on the other hand if the infighting causes opec to completely abandon its current production cuts there could be a free for all that would cause a ton of oil to flood the market that would push prices

prices rose to a multiyear high on monday off the news that there was no deal then they plunged on tuesday and wednesday wiping out weeks worth of gains and of course it s still possible that opec will announce a deal that would land somewhere in the middle and potentially stabilize prices in fact many analysts think that s the most likely outcome despite the lack of any public progress toward it because there s a ton of pressure for a compromise in early 2020 opec caused prices to go haywire thanks to a price war between saudi arabia and russia but that was quickly followed by the historic agreement to cut production which is widely credited with rebalancing crude markets and supporting prices for well over a year now there s a lot riding on whether opec can again strike a deal to keep

the history of cinema as an art parallels its history as a technology ever wondered why the colour in the wizard of oz is so saturated well it wasn t the first technicolor film but it was the first to effectively advertise mgm s new 3 strip colour process to a global audience why advertise something at half mast this kind of technological innovation in cinema is of course spurred by economic motives for instance 3d thrived in three waves in direct response to the economic threats posed by new technologies in the 1950s in response to television in the 1980s responding to vhs and in the 21st century in the face of increased online streaming now we have 4dx a gimmick one suspects won t take off in this era of digital cinema with celluloid virtually replaced by video technology the latest technological battle concerns image resolution a digital image is made up of pixels little shapes usually boxes that are the smallest controllable element of the image resolution refers to the number of pixels appearing in an image and is usually measured in pixels per inch as a rule the more pixels the crisper the image that is the sharper the edges of the subject appear in digital cinema s resolution wars you will often hear people speak about 4k as in 4000 or 8k or now even 12k resolution this number refers to the number of horizontal pixels a typical 4k digital cinema image for instance has a resolution of 4 096 horizontal x 2 160 vertical pixels image capture resolution is only one factor in how an image looks dynamic range that is difference between the darkest and lightest parts of the image is another but most cinematographers and techies agree the camera s resolution is crucial to the crispness of the image in 2018 netflix were snubbed by the cannes film festival on the basis netflix produced films are not true cinema this year again there are no netflix produced films in the festival competition due to a rule all films selected to compete must have a local theatrical release cannes is right most made for netflix productions don t look like the cinema we re used to why there s a technical answer though the company streams some films that are not netflix originals it requires narrative feature films made for netflix be shot on cameras with a true 4k uhd sensor in other words the sensor which detects and conveys the information required to make an image must be at least 3 840 pixels wide or ultra high definition read more cannes is right netflix movies just aren t the same flat and depthless this technical specification is strikingly evident in david fincher s recent netflix original production mank a black and white biopic about herman j mankiewicz s ghostwriting of citizen kane an old black and white film shot on celluloid has a grainy texture that draws the eye into and around the image this is partly the result of the degradation of the film print which occurs over time but primarily because of the physical processing of the film itself all celluloid film has a grainy look this grain is an optical effect related to the small particles of metallic silver that emerge through the film s chemical processing this is not the case with digital cameras thus video images captured by high resolution sensors look different to those shot on celluloid the images in mank look flat depthless they are too clean and clear this is not as much of a problem on a big screen when the images are huge but the high resolution is really noticeable when the images are compressed on the kind of domestic tv or computer screens most people use to stream netflix the edges look too sharp the shades too clearly delineated compared to what we have been used to as cinemagoers read more pass the popcorn scorsese cinema boycott will shape the future of movies the absurd thing is companies like cinegrain now sell digital overlays of film stock that can endow video with the grainy film look their company motto is make digital more cinematic using cinegrain the natural result of the physical process has been superseded by video but digital cinema makers reintroduce this as one component in achieving a film look netflix does allow limited exceptions to its rule with use of non approved cameras requiring its explicit approval and a more flexible approach to non fiction productions according to y m cinema magazine 30 of netflix s best movies of 2020 were made on non approved cameras still in stipulating the use of 4k or higher sensor cameras netflix radically reduces the aesthetic autonomy of film directors and producers if we think of netflix as a production studio this is not surprising all studios like all major corporations dictate the nature of their products including the aesthetics and feel of their films but this requirement means their productions look similar and the imagery to a cinephile anyway too clinical glorious granularity all film festivals distributors and networks request delivery of films conforming to their specifications but this usually has nothing to do with the source camera behind the delivered file if it looks and plays well it looks and plays well the film open water 2003 for example which made over us 50 million at the box office from a budget of under us 200 000 was shot on mini dv a low quality and now obsolete video format but it perfectly suited the film and thus works netflix in stipulating 4k camera sensors reproduces the assumption higher resolution is necessarily better for all or even most films but one of the reasons american film noir still looks so good or the new hollywood films of the 1960s and 1970s like easy rider and bonnie and clyde is partly because of the celluloid technology itself in all its glorious granularity the beauty of these cinematic images has nothing to do with the sharpness of the edges of the photographed subjects from where is this assumption that sharper images are better and more aesthetically effective art has always sought to say something in its deviation from its realistic reproduction of the world that is in its expression as with all technological innovation in a capitalist context this assumption stems from the competitive impulse to appear to be doing something better than everyone else the bigger more expensive clearer the better but when it comes to aesthetics this is a redundant form of economy

over to erik erik gershwind chief executive officer thank you john and thank you everyone for joining us i hope you enjoyed your holiday weekend i m excited to update you today on our progress this quarter we are seeing the benefits of the strategic pivot that s been made by our company over the past few years we made significant investments across the organization to transition from a leading spot buy provider to a mission critical partner on the plant floor augmented by our spot buy capabilities with the bulk of the less visible changes completed we outlined our plan to return to historic levels of revenue and earnings growth consistent with the legacy of our company mission critical is our program to translate those investments into superior financial performance and we shared with you two goals that underpin our efforts first to accelerate market share capture with a target growth rate of at least 400 basis points above ip by the end of our fiscal 2023 second to return roic into the high teens powered not only by leveraging growth but also by structural cost takeout of 90 to 100 million also by the end of fiscal 2023 this year our fiscal 2021 began our proof of concept with our fiscal third quarter serving as the latest encouraging data point with respect to revenues we committed to achieve a minimum of 200 basis points of positive spread versus the ip by our fiscal fourth quarter q3 is muted by ppe comps but the non safety and non janitorial business grew about 21 year over year and we expect our total company growth to meet or exceed our fiscal q4 commitment this year with the help of numerous structural cost reductions we increased our customer facing sales headcount and will continue doing so into fiscal 2022 we ve grown share in metalworking through investment and innovation that improve our customers businesses at the tail end of fiscal 2021 and into fiscal 22 we re implementing improvements in e commerce we started with a new production information system earlier this year and are now rolling out enhanced search capabilities new user interfaces for both desktop and mobile a new transactional engine and overall improved functionality we ve committed to maintaining our gross margin through a series of initiatives and excluding the writedown for ppe we have done so the macro environment is driving price increases and given our inventory turns and innovative merchandising and pricing programs we expect strong realization to continue finally we ve picked up the pace on structural cost takeout we ve already exceeded our 25 million cost takeout goal for fiscal 2021 for the full year looking ahead fiscal 2022 is setting up even better than the current year we will build on our momentum and continue making progress toward our goal of 400 basis points or more of market outgrowth as measured against the ip index on the gross margin line we expect inflationary pressures to continue while purchase cost increases are beginning to make their way into our p l they will be offset by ongoing price realization yielding a stable gross margin outlook year over year on the structural cost front we ll deliver roughly 20 million of incremental savings on top of that which has been achieved over the past two years and that will include benefits from existing initiatives which will deliver incremental savings during the first half of 22 plus benefits in the second half from new initiatives that we have yet to execute along with a handful of more transformational projects that will deliver additional savings in 23 and beyond we will once again reinvest a portion of these incremental savings into our five growth initiatives to build upon market share capture nonetheless we expect incremental margins at or above 20 how far north they go will be a function of how high we can get revenue growth and how much price realization we see with all of this as the backdrop i ll now turn to the specifics of the quarter beginning with the external landscape the economic environment improved significantly most of our manufacturing end markets turned positive during the quarter and this evidenced itself in ip readings that turned to double digit growth in april and may and in sentiment readings such as the mbi index which are at very high levels all of this is supported by our customers outlooks which are robust at the same time the industrial economy is experiencing very real supply chain shortages and disruptions these disruptions are evidencing themselves in product scarcity freight delays and extreme labor shortages that are resulting in significant availability and inflationary pressures and we are certainly not immune to these challenges and in fact we re seeing them play out that said we are very well positioned to navigate the current environment particularly when compared to the local and regional distributors who make up 70 of our market msc s broad multi brand product assortment our high inventory levels strong supplier relationships and next day delivery capabilities position us well to accelerate market share capture additionally the supply chain challenges are resulting in significant and growing inflation that is producing the most robust pricing environment we ve seen in years turning now to our performance you can see our reported numbers on slide 4 and adjusted numbers on slide 5 revenues were up 2 2 on an average daily sales basis as we re seeing continued sequential improvement in our sales levels most notably non safety and non janitorial product lines improved through the quarter from mid single digit declines in our second quarter to 21 growth in our third quarter sales of safety and janitorial products as expected given the significant surge during the pandemic last year declined just over 40 for the quarter looking at our performance by customer type and excluding for a moment the safety and janitorial product lines all of our customers all types were up strong double digits however including all product lines and given the extremely difficult comparisons government sales declined nearly 40 national accounts returned to growth by posting a low single digit increase while our core customers improved and grew in the mid teens ccsg grew mid single digits june showed continued improvement with total company year over year growth estimated at 15 4 our non safety and non janitorial growth is estimated at roughly 20 while safety and janitorial are estimated to be down roughly 10 against last year s continued ppe surge we expect strong growth rates in non safety and non janitorial products for the balance of the fiscal year on the pricing front we ve seen solid realization of the march price increase that we mentioned last quarter and as a result we saw a sequential lift in gross margin from our fiscal second quarter s adjusted rate of 42 since that last call we ve seen continued significant pricing activity from our suppliers and as a result we ve implemented a june price increase this is earlier than normal but certainly warranted given the environment we will not hesitate to move again if suppliers continue raising their prices beyond the numbers we had a couple of positive developments during the quarter one was the recovery of the nitrile glove impairment which kristen will touch on in just a bit the other was the acquisition of a majority stake in the william hurst company in june hurst is a metalworking distributor based in wichita kansas with a heavy focus on the aerospace sector and this deal is meaningful to msc in several ways hurst goes to market with a highly specialized and highly technical sales force it fills out a geography in which msc was underpenetrated and more importantly brings technical capabilities that we can leverage across the entire msc business aerospace is roughly 10 of total msc sales today it s an industry that is poised for strong growth coming out of the pandemic and the hurst platform will considerably enhance our effectiveness in serving and growing that portion of our business hurst has been led by ceo john mullen who remains at the helm and retains a meaningful ownership stake in the business i ll now turn things over to kristen to cover the financials and our mission critical progress kristen actis grande chief financial officer thank you erik i ll begin with a review of our fiscal third quarter and then update you on the progress of our mission critical initiatives on slide 4 of our presentation you can see key metrics for the fiscal third quarter on a reported basis slide 5 reflects our adjusted results our third quarter sales were 866 million up 3 8 versus the same quarter last year we had one more selling day this year in our third quarter so on an average daily sales basis net sales increased 2 2 erik gave some details on our sales growth but i ll just reiterate that our non safety and non janitorial sales grew 21 in the quarter while our safety and janitorial sales declined 42 moving to gross margins execution and realization on our midyear price increase was solid our gross margin for fiscal q3 was 42 3 up 30 basis points sequentially after adjusting our inventory writedown from last quarter and down just 10 basis points from last year looking ahead we took our summer increase in early june in response to the continuing inflation we are seeing from our suppliers we expect the recent trending to continue and aim to achieve a gross margin for fiscal 2021 that is flat with fiscal 2020 operating expenses in the third quarter were 257 3 million or 29 7 of sales versus 242 8 million or 29 1 of sales in the prior year our third quarter includes just 400 000 of legal costs associated with the loss recovery which i ll discuss shortly so opex as a percent of sales excluding those costs was the same as the gaap figure or 29 7 let me share a few more details on our third quarter opex as i mentioned on our last call we expected opex to increase sequentially from our second quarter not only by the variable operating expenses associated with higher sales but also due to expected higher incentive compensation as well as growth investments related to mission critical recall that our adjusted opex for q2 was 244 million a 90 million increase in sales means roughly 9 million of variable related opex the remainder of the increase was primarily related to higher incentive compensation while mission critical growth investments did increase sequentially this was offset by an increase in mission critical savings which i ll speak to in more detail in a few moments as you may have seen in our earnings release this morning we had a very positive development regarding the nitrile glove impairment we announced in our fiscal first quarter we re pleased to report that last month we received a 20 8 million loss recovery of the original 26 7 million impairment loss recorded in q1 that recovery is below the operating expense line in the p l but it does increase our gaap operating income such that our gaap operating margin for the quarter was 14 8 excluding the 20 8 million loss recovery and associated legal fees as well as restructuring charges during the quarter of 1 3 million our adjusted operating margin was 12 6 down 70 basis points from the prior year gaap earnings per share were 1 68 adjusted for the loss recovery as well as restructuring and other charges adjusted earnings per share were 1 42 turning to the balance sheet and moving ahead to slide 7 our free cash flow was 3 million in the third quarter as compared to 49 million in the prior year the largest contributors were our increasing inventory and accounts receivable balance as our sales picked up significantly in the quarter i would also note that we repurchased 47 million of stock during the quarter or about 507 000 shares at an average price of 92 92 per share this underscores our ongoing commitment to a balanced capital allocation philosophy and our goal to maximize total shareholder returns in fact to date in our fiscal q4 we repurchased another 229 000 shares at an average price of 89 07 lastly when it comes to cash flows please note that the 20 8 million loss recovery was received in june and will therefore be reflected in our fiscal fourth quarter cash flows as of the end of fiscal q3 we were carrying 598 million of inventory up 66 million from last quarter we re actively managing inventory levels to ensure we can support our customers as sales continue accelerating therefore inventory levels are likely to continue climbing in the fourth quarter we still expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year of approximately 55 million and we still expect our cash flow conversion or operating cash flow divided by net income to be above 100 for fiscal 2021 our total debt as of the end of the third quarter was 759 million reflecting a 75 million increase from our second quarter roughly two thirds of that increase was used to repurchase shares under our ongoing share repurchase program as for the composition of our debt 187 million was on our revolving credit facility about 200 million was under our uncommitted facilities 20 million was short term fixed rate borrowings and 345 million was long term fixed rate borrowings cash and cash equivalents were 27 million resulting in net debt of 732 million at the end of the quarter let me now provide you with an update on our mission critical productivity goals on slide 8 you can see our original program goals of 90 to a hundred million of cost takeout through fiscal 2023 and that is versus fiscal 2019 our cumulative savings for the first half of fiscal 21 were 17 million and we saved another 12 million in our third quarter bringing our year to date savings to 29 million against our goal of 25 million by the end of this year we also had invested roughly to 7 to 8 million in the first half of fiscal 21 and we invested another 7 million in our third quarter bringing our total year to date investments to 15 million which compares to our original full year target of 15 million given the success of the program through the first three quarters we now expect to achieve savings for fiscal 2021 of roughly 40 million regarding total investments for fiscal 21 we now expect roughly 25 million which would result in net savings of 15 million for this year before i turn it over to erik let me leave you with some broad expectations for the coming quarters with respect to sales the difficult safety and janitorial comparisons will ease in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal 22 we expect double digit growth rates for the total business in our fiscal fourth quarter and continued strength into fiscal 22 for fiscal 21 we expect a low single digit total company growth and we aim to achieve gross margins that are flat with fiscal 20 in terms of adjusted operating expenses sequentially from our third to fourth quarters we will see a decline due to volume based expenses from sequentially lower sales dollars and lower incentive compensation with that in mind we remain on track with our adjusted annual operating framework for fiscal 2021 which you can see on slide 9 furthermore and as erik mentioned earlier we expect to achieve 20 or higher incremental margins in both fiscal 22 and fiscal 2023 and i ll now turn it back over to erik erik gershwind chief executive officer thank you kristen fiscal 2021 is finishing on a high note and we expect that momentum to continue into fiscal 22 we are gaining steam internally and our end markets are strengthening as evidenced by ip readings the inflationary environment along with our ongoing price realization should continue to support gross margins on the structural cost front we ve made strong progress on our mission critical program and will deliver further savings over the next two years and beyond all of that should translate into incremental margins at or above 20 for the next two years i thank our team for all of their hard work and dedication and we ll now open up the line for questions questions answers operator and our first question today comes from tommy moll from stephens please go ahead with your question tommy moll stephens inc analyst good morning and thanks for taking my questions kristen actis grande chief financial officer hey tommy erik gershwind chief executive officer hey tommy how are you tommy moll stephens inc analyst doing great doing great erik i wrote down one of your comments and i think i m getting this about right you talked about this being one of the most robust pricing environment you ve seen in years so i wanted to dig in on that talked about another increase in june possible we ll see another one before the end of your fiscal year any way you could frame for us what the june increase looks like quantitatively and if you play this out longer term beyond the next quarter or two in this kind of inflationary environment is this a net benefit net neutral to your platform how does it play out erik gershwind chief executive officer tommy so yes look i think let me start with the macro and the environment and you did capture the my comments accurately if you go back and for those who have been studying our space for long periods of time you go back to different eras that we ve experienced for the past 10 or 15 years and generally strong robust inflation is a distributor s friend and so if you looked at msc s gross margin performance in the 2000s versus what it s been the last several years you d see a noticeable difference and we ve talked about our gross margin formula consisting of three things price cost and mix and we ve talked about the fact that there s generally a mix headwind in the business of somewhere 30 to 50 basis points so to the extent pricing costs were awash we would see erosion of somewhere 30 to 50 basis points and not surprisingly over the past few years that s about what you ve seen from us in a very low inflation environment i think unusually low 2000s may have been unusually strong this is unusually low certainly some of the supply chain issues that we ve we discussed in scarcity are leading to more inflation than we than i ve seen in at least a decade price increases coming from suppliers fast and furious you re right for us to take two moves in a matter of a few months we haven t done that in a while and that s in response to the environment net net tommy we view this as a positive typically what you would see from us is the early stages of an inflation cycle price would outpace cost and we believe that s where we re at right now certainly in the later stages things can flip around but to the extent that this inflationary cycle has some legs to it as it appears we would expect price to outpace cost so if you look the proof in the pudding will obviously be in our numbers but you think about yes we re going to begin to start seeing cost in our p l yes that ll begin to happen as early as this quarter but you sort of zoom out and say ok fiscal 2021 we re calling to be plus or minus flat with prior year and as best we can tell now and of course we ll come back next quarter with a framework as we normally do but as best we can tell now we re giving you sort of a look ahead to 22 and saying we re seeing a roughly flat picture that would imply positive price cost in each of those years to offset mix and then you take it a step further and i ll stop talking tommy but if this business can produce roughly flat gross margins and ip does what it is forecast to do and we continue to build on our internal momentum and outpace ip you re looking at strong top line growth roughly flat gross margins enhance that with some cost takeout and we think we have a really compelling picture tommy moll stephens inc analyst thank you erik that s all very helpful i wanted to follow up with a question on inventory which you provided some helpful comments on in the script what has the philosophy changed at all in the appropriate level there i mean you ve got potential supply chain issues that you may want to protect against i think you referenced in the script the opportunity to deploy or to put your balance sheet to work with some inventory to take market share has anything changed in your mind about how to manage that or what do you want us to know about how you re thinking about inventory right now thank you erik gershwind chief executive officer tommy i would say this no change in philosophy some change in tools and tactics and keeping up with the times but in terms of philosophy no change and again going back being in this business now over two decades times of growth and times of product scarcity create really compelling opportunities for distributors like msc bottom line is if you have stuff on the shelf you re going to capture share so i think what you re seeing the big build in inventory you re seeing over the past quarter and we telegraph we expect it to continue we would have liked it to be even bigger if it weren t for scarcity issues we re going all in on making sure that we have product on the shelves for our customers at a time when product is scarce and it s critical as the economy now ramps back up the industrial economy that our customers keep their lines running so we are going all in on inventory and it sort of is a reflection of our view on the outlook of the economy and a view on the importance of having product to capture share tommy moll stephens inc analyst thanks erik i ll turn it back operator our next question comes from hamzah mazari from jefferies please go ahead with your question ryan gunning jefferies analyst hey this is actually ryan gunning on filling in for hamzah could you just talk about your current vending initiative and how much of your customer base or what percent of revenue is vending and what kind of growth you re seeing there erik gershwind chief executive officer yes sure good morning ryan and what i ll do is just connect back to if you recall we are right now laser focused on restoring the kind of market share capture rates that this business had become accustomed to and so we put our first marker out there 400 plus basis points by 23 the first sort of goalpost in getting there is going to be our fiscal fourth quarter at least 200 basis points and then if you recall we outlined five growth initiatives that are going to get us there one of those is what we refer to as solutions and in solutions it s specifically it s three things it s vending it s vendor managed inventory and it s our in plant program all of which are aimed at bringing us closer to the customer and embedding us onto the plant floor so what i would say is vending is picking up steam we definitely saw not surprisingly ryan we saw a lull in our new account signings the growth rate of course the growth rate of the installed base came down with covid and has bounced back as the business has the new signings took a lull during the pandemic because of the inability to get into plants we are seeing it come storming back so we re measuring size of funnel dollars in funnel close rate all of those are doing what we wanted to see happen as the years gone on they ve gotten stronger and stronger so what i would say is remains an important growth driver along with bmi and in plant as part of this solutions initiative ryan gunning jefferies analyst got it that s helpful thank you and then i guess kind of switching gears can you talk about what you re seeing in terms of metalworking markets from a growth perspective and just the competitive dynamics there erik gershwind chief executive officer yes so i think from a market standpoint what we re seeing is and particularly ryan this quarter if you think about metalworking and our end market exposure they re very tightly coupled and so not surprisingly nearly half of our sales are tied into five heavy manufacturing end markets that are the bulk of where the metalworking consumption happens those heavy manufacturing end markets went down deeper than most of the economy and quite frankly have been a little slower to recover we saw that start to flip in the past quarter and so if you take a look at below the ip reading you can see some of the sub indices we are starting to see the heavy manufacturing markets come back and we think that s a great opportunity for us in terms of share capture we re still sitting so leadership in metalworking but still sitting in the neighborhood of 10 market share so we ve got a big runway ahead of us in terms of share capture and we have end markets that we think have legs to them in terms of this recovery so we re excited by our metalworking outlook and what i would say is to capture that share there s a few things that are powering it investment into people so you see our head count taking up that s investment into metalworking talent we did it both organically in the past quarter through acquisition we re really excited about hurst joining the family we re doing it through technology with initiatives like msc millmax that are combined with our people are really helping customers take cost out of their operations and then i mentioned earlier to tommy s question sort of the old fashioned way of just having product on the shelf when others don t we think that really matters as well so all of those sort of feed into what we think is an exciting metalworking outlook ryan gunning jefferies analyst great that s all super helpful thank you very much operator our next question comes from adam uhlman from cleveland research please go ahead with your question adam uhlman cleveland research analyst hi guys good morning erik gershwind chief executive officer hey adam kristen actis grande chief financial officer hey adam erik gershwind chief executive officer good morning adam adam uhlman cleveland research analyst hey can we go back to the price increase discussion we were having earlier i guess in the operational stats it looks like there was 1 million attributed to price which seems kind of low and i understand there s some other offsets that you call out in there like customer mix and product mix and discounting can you maybe parse that apart between what were the headwinds that offset the price increase from march and then as we put this price increase through in june how should we be tracking that contribution to total sales growth i guess maybe you could just mention it too it sounds like low single digits but maybe you could clarify that kristen actis grande chief financial officer sure so going back to the first part of your question the first thing i d say is price realization i think as erik touched on is solid we re pleased with what we re seeing around realization and then the second metric that you mentioned which is what we see in the growth decomposition composition of the op stats that has about 0 1 of growth assigned to both price and mix so to your point it s a combination of things that are in that metric normally that s a pretty good indicator for how you could think about price growth in the business but what s happening in the second half of this year in q3 and q4 is if you look at the large amount of ppe volume that we had in the base so in the second half of 20 it s really making it not a very meaningful metric to think about how price is impacting the business so that s kind of what you see near term i think if you zoom out and you look at what s happening sequentially we did grow margins from q2 to q3 so that s an indicator that we re seeing the price benefits that we had expected to see coming into the numbers and then beyond that like erik touched on we re seeing about flat margins 20 to 21 which is not something we typically see in the business that means we re offsetting the cost coming down to the p l and that traditional mix headwind that we see in the business and we re expecting to do the same thing again in 2022 adam uhlman cleveland research analyst ok gotcha thanks that s helpful and then for mission critical i guess there s 40 million of gross savings remaining over the program for the next couple of years could you dimension some of the bigger buckets that you expect those savings to come from and then have you changed your thoughts at all on your reinvestment appetite of those savings kristen actis grande chief financial officer yes so for the few for the following two years on the program 22 and 23 we ve got programs that are working across all areas of the p l i think we re you think about kind of the transformational work that we have ahead of us sort of like the bigger longer term projects to execute you ll probably see us pivoting a little bit more to the operations side of the business we did a lot of work around the sales side of the business that you saw us execute in 21 so there ll be a bias toward operations on the transformational work but then the pipeline of projects really touches every part of the p l there s a lot of small things that are going to deliver benefits particularly in kind of 22 second half of 22 we ll got carryover in the beginning of 22 from what happened with in particular the sales program or the sales restructuring that you saw us execute in fiscal 21 and then those transformational projects are going to kind of position us for 23 and beyond and in terms of the reinvestment i ll give you guys some firmer guidance on that next quarter when we publish the framework but one of the things that we re looking at right now is kind of which projects we want to bring online and when on the growth side and we re really committed to delivering that incremental margin of greater than 20 so we ll probably adjust the investment schedule accordingly based on our other assumptions to make sure we re delivering on that incremental north of 20 that we committed to for fiscal 22 and 23 adam uhlman cleveland research analyst ok thanks kristen actis grande chief financial officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from david manthey from baird please go ahead with your question david manthey robert w baird analyst hi good morning everyone erik gershwind chief executive officer hey dave david manthey robert w baird analyst first off kristen in your discussion there on price mix if we set mix aside it sounds like you had solid price realization on the march increase and with the glide path from that increase in addition to the new june increase in light of the current inflationary environment should we be reading that your expectation for price realization alone might be on the higher end of low single digits or even in the mid single digits in the coming quarter kristen actis grande chief financial officer no i d say lower single digits is a reasonable expectation dave and i think what s starting to happen too in q4 is the cost or all the inflation we re seeing passed on to us from suppliers are starting to roll onto the p l so it s dampening a little bit of the price cost spread we might have been hoping to see when we looked forward last quarter but generally still really pleased of being able to offset the mix cover the cost and keep the margins flat for the full year david manthey robert w baird analyst ok and i know you ve always been hesitant to talk about price realization specifically but if based on your comments it sounds like from your price realization forgetting about mix and forgetting about the cost side it sounds like you re seeing good realization which might imply a little bit higher than low single digits is that in the ballpark kristen actis grande chief financial officer we are seeing our realization come online as expected yes david manthey robert w baird analyst ok fair enough erik gershwind chief executive officer yes and dave just to put color on that as kristen mentioned so the metric that s the public metric she mentioned because of last year the ppe surge the mix component of that metric is so distorted compared to what it typically is a normal time that will correct itself in a quarter or two as you could imagine inside the company our pricing team has 10 ways til sunday in which they re looking at more micro price realization metrics and yes we re seeing just as kristen said just as we would have expected in terms of the outcomes david manthey robert w baird analyst ok sounds good and second on the e commerce front it seems like that metric lost momentum during the pandemic and has since reaccelerated i think trailing 12 months you re back over 60 e commerce what does that tell us about the trends in the business if anything as we come out of the downturn here erik gershwind chief executive officer yes dave so i think important to understand just sort of what makes up sort of the buckets under that 60 e commerce obviously there s a big chunk over half of that is mscdirect com and that s the part right now i mentioned investments into digital most of the investments are directed there to take mscdirect com to another level and certainly i would expect over time that portion of the business to grow as a percentage of revenues the total 60 includes other buckets like vending things flowing through a vending machine e procurement with large accounts which so there was sort of a lot of mix dynamics going on underneath the covers because as you can imagine i mentioned earlier vending dropped considerably during the pandemic and is now climbing back for us what i m going to be looking at is the quality of the experience on mscdirect com going to be looking at retention average order size and some sort of the micro measures and then yes i think for you over time seeing a 60 grow will be the way to look at it and evaluate it david manthey robert w baird analyst great thanks erik operator our next question comes from ryan merkel from william blair please go ahead with your question ryan merkel william blair company analyst hey everyone nice job on gross margins this quarter kristen actis grande chief financial officer thank you ryan erik gershwind chief executive officer hey ryan thank you ryan merkel william blair company analyst so my first question is on sg a leverage i know you expect strong leverage in 22 but should we expect sg a leverage in the fiscal fourth quarter kristen actis grande chief financial officer yes so fiscal fourth quarter is going to we re going to come down sequentially ryan relative to where we were in q3 a little bit of that coming with a decline in sales and then we re also going to see a bit of a normalization on the sales incentive compensation so we will see a more favorable opex rates coming in q4 better leverage coming in q4 and then for the year feeling confident that we ll land inside that low single digit framework i d say probably on the lower end of that given where we think revenue is going to land and kind of given what we see happen in the inflationary environment really we ve talked a lot about kind of what s happening on the cost of goods sold with inflation but we re also seeing some costs start to creep into the business on the sg a side around things like labor inflation wage increases things like that ryan merkel william blair company analyst all right so it sounds like sg a leverage will improve in 4q and then it will improve more so in 2022 is that right kristen actis grande chief financial officer correct ryan merkel william blair company analyst ok and then my second question june average daily sales growth that was a nice number i know you re not giving guidance but i m hopeful to get your view on what inning of the macro recovery we re in and then if sales growth can accelerate from the june level erik gershwind chief executive officer so ryan i look i think from our perspective we are encouraged i think for me june as sort of one data point we re looking at sort of at a bigger story here and i am encouraged by the momentum we re seeing and i think that goes for macro but also sort of from micro meaning how is the company doing relative to ip we had a pretty good quarter in q2 obviously ppe noise here but we are starting to see progress in terms of the macro recovery again ryan we re coming from a fairly slanted view where we re heavily exposed to heavy manufacturing which have been hit hard at a later stage so we think there s plenty of room here we re kind of hitting a speed bump as an economy an industrial economy with the supply chain and labor constraints right now no question impacting growth with our customers anyway but we think there is a nice recovery here particularly in certain end markets where we think there s a ways to go to answer your question early innings and then i feel the same about internally we still feel like we re in the early innings we think this year has kind of been a proof point that we re on the right track but we have sights set high in terms of share capture and spread above ip and still feel like we re early innings there too ryan merkel william blair company analyst sounds good erik thanks erik gershwind chief executive officer thanks ryan operator our next question comes from michael mcginn from wells fargo please go ahead with your question michael mcginn wells fargo securities analyst hey everyone good quarter i was hoping to get a little more color hi i was hoping to get a little more color on the recent acquisition is there can you frame for us what aerospace is like roundabout percentage of your business today is there ever a point from a portfolio management standpoint where you think you cap yourself erik gershwind chief executive officer mike so we re sitting at around so i ll touch on what hurst brings to us so aerospace roughly a 10 of msc s revenues we think that it is a really good fit in terms of an end market for msc for a number of reasons first and foremost of which we can really move the needle for our customers productivity using metalworking our metalworking experts metalworking technology like millmax our product portfolio etc so we think it s a good fit in terms of capping it at some point that will be a very high class problem we think we have a ways to grow and penetrate in that market we really like the timing of hurst because aerospace obviously has been on its back and we think has a long way to go in recovery and what really excites us is the team there is really technical and really focused so they re bringing something in some sense expanding our metalworking capabilities for sure but they re really bringing something that we don t have organically in the business which is a metalworking focus specific to aerospace and we think that s a capability not just to build out and cross selling to their customer base but for john and his team we think we can leverage that team across msc s broader aerospace customers to increase penetration so we see bottom line is we see a ways to go with aerospace and at some point we ll be in a high class position to have to try to cap it but we got a long runway in front of us there michael mcginn wells fargo securities analyst got it and then going back to the earnings algorithm you outlaid earlier in the call mentioning if we can get flat gross margins just in terms of that how back to how much runway do we have to get back to normal in terms of gross margin rebates and in terms of the local core customer catching up to that national account erik gershwind chief executive officer so here s what i d say mike so let me break apart gross margin into three buckets price cost and mix what i would say is we still see so over the past few years price and costs have more or less been awash and what you re hearing is that price is now outpacing cost and we think that as long as the inflation cycle continues and by all measures given product scarcity labor scarcity etc etc it does feel like we re in the early stages of an inflation cycle to the extent that continues while costs are going to creep into the p l we think we can stay ahead of it with price that brings us to mix mix has a lot of you mentioned a couple of moving parts mike there s a lot of moving parts to mix in terms of which product lines are growing faster which end markets are growing faster size of customers you said national accounts etc net net when you put it in the wash and you put all of the mix components in the wash we still see a negative sort of a headwind coming from mix and we do still see it somewhere in the 30 to 50 and it s tough to give you a precise number it moves around but somewhere 30 to 50 bps per year so the way we get to sort of an out the way we get to flat and take 21 as for instance is some mixed headwind yes but price outpacing cost and loans being awash michael mcginn wells fargo securities analyst got it appreciate the time thank you operator our next question comes from kevin marek from deutsche bank please go ahead with your question kevin marek deutsche bank analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question kristen actis grande chief financial officer good morning kevin marek deutsche bank analyst a lot has been asked i guess maybe wondering if you could give some more color on some of the supply chain constraints what are you seeing in terms of labor product availability and have things gotten better or worse for you and for your customers and kind of how are you managing that erik gershwind chief executive officer yes kevin so let me talk about i ll talk about sort of broad marketplace which would include customer and supplier i would say over the past quarter the supply chain issues have become more acute not less and i think that in particular the one that is just white hot is access to labor everybody i m talking to is feeling the pinch and what that means is it s really at this point constraining growth i think the exciting thing is to the extent this is a speed bump the long term prognosis outlook is really good but what it means for our suppliers and inability to hire people who are needed to produce stuff and ship stuff to distributors like msc for our customers it s much the same their order backlogs are massive and they can t keep up and they can t get product out the door i think from our standpoint kevin we think we re really well positioned to navigate this first of all it should be temporary i mean who knows how long it takes to relieve but it should be temporary the second thing is we think we re well positioned number one is that whatever issues we re facing and we are facing them and we mentioned we would like inventory levels to be even higher than they are we re facing issues from our suppliers but whatever we re facing remember 70 of our market is made up of local distributors who really struggle in gaining access to product so we think there s a tremendous market share capture opportunity and then the second thing i d say is that all of these constraints and scarcities are what is fueling the inflation that is then fueling the ability to take price so we think we re well positioned to navigate this we think the outlook is really good but to be clear absolutely the issues are acute and labor is at the top kevin marek deutsche bank analyst got it that s really helpful maybe just one more getting back to kind of the mission critical commentary is there scope to by the time we get through fiscal 23 to be above 90 to 100 million given that you re executing on a chunk of it kind of faster than originally anticipated i m wondering if there are other things or other initiatives that maybe didn t make the first round of planning for mission critical that you now feel like you may have the ability to pursue kristen actis grande chief financial officer yes i think we re definitely optimistic that that s possible we re clearly at the higher end of that 90 to 100 million range right now and one of the things we ve talked a lot about internally is that we communicate mission critical as kind of time sense between 19 and 2023 but really what we re doing here is changing the culture of the company to make this idea of driving these costs out of the business and ongoing an ongoing part of what msc does year after year so we do have a long pipeline of projects i think it s always possible we shuffle timing on some things pull some things forward that could provide the potential to go above that but one of the things we are thinking through for 22 is you ve got some big projects to execute in 21 the carryover the smaller new things we re going to execute to help us in 22 and then you re going to see us really reload and kind of recharge on the transformational projects that ll hit in 23 and beyond so to the extent that we could bring those big transformational things on faster or maybe to a greater extent than we re originally contemplating that would be the path to going above that 90 to 100 million range right now kevin marek deutsche bank analyst got it understood thanks a lot appreciate it kristen actis grande chief financial officer you re welcome operator and our final question today comes from patrick baumann from j p morgan please go ahead with your question patrick is it possible your phone is on mute patrick baumann j p morgan analyst hello sorry about that can you hear me now erik gershwind chief executive officer oh there we go kristen actis grande chief financial officer yep erik gershwind chief executive officer hey patrick patrick baumann j p morgan analyst it was on mute i apologize for that erik wondering if you could talk some more about what you re doing to the website and why is this just basic upgrades or is it something more transformational in the way you interact and then on this front how would you benchmark yourself the website capabilities i guess msc direct versus kind of leaders in the industry at this point erik gershwind chief executive officer so patrick what i would say and i ll answer your question on e commerce so to do it i just want to underscore something kristen said and it was in relation to mission critical and that was about a cultural change happening inside the company and i bring this up in the context you asked me about e commerce because what kristen described happening in mission critical with it becoming a way of life and kind of like constantly raising the bar on ourselves the same thing is happening everywhere in the company across our commercial organization across marketing across structural costs you name it so i think what s happening here and the investments being made is we re raising the bar on ourselves and it s certainly we benchmark peers inside and outside of the industry for capabilities but i have to tell you the north star for us that s driving these changes is the customer how we can make their lives better how their expectations with a younger millennial influence workforce growing as a percentage of total workforce we this is about raising the bar on ourselves and doing better for customers so what we re doing is and i d call it somewhere between an upgrade and transformational but really changing the technology stack we use and what that means is moving certainly more cloud based where we can capture changes that happen overnight as opposed to needing to do upgrades we re talking about using capabilities like ai powered intelligence and logic that allows our search engines our website our whole digital experience with the customer to constantly improve so i think some of this is around technology and then some of it is flat out just around customer experience and reducing friction and creating a better experience a stickier experience for the customer so that s really what s going on it will happen so we re beginning to put things into market in flight this quarter that ll continue so we ll continue to launch sort of iterations along the way it will be a big bang into the first couple of quarters of 22 and obviously we ll be watching carefully for performance but i think this all goes back to the idea of raising the bar on what we expect out of ourselves and for our customers patrick baumann j p morgan analyst what do you use to track kind of the progress is it it sounds like some voice of customer or maybe there s there s got to be some metrics you mentioned stickiness like site visits is it sales metrics is it revenue per visit i don t know what do you use erik gershwind chief executive officer yes so one of the things that are new and we ve really upgraded our digital team it s a strong group and one of the things they ve implemented is a weekly business review process where they re managing through a whole bunch of metrics a couple of them you ve mentioned whether that s average order value whether that s number of unique visits whether that s conversion from the top of the funnel meaning people coming to the site to the bottom of the funnel ordering and looking at all points along the funnel so there s a bunch of metrics they re meeting weekly and literally when they see metrics move one way or another they re adjusting by week so if it s good doubling down on it if they see sort of a negative break in the trend getting to root cause and then making adjustments real time so that s happening on a weekly basis patrick baumann j p morgan analyst great helpful color erik and maybe one for kristen really quick a follow up on opex you mentioned variable comp incentives as positive sequentially in the fourth quarter do you also expect any sequential net savings from the various programs that you have in plant and then also what about freight cost any update on what you re seeing in the p l there going into year end kristen actis grande chief financial officer sure so sequentially for mission critical no impact from investments and savings on a net basis it will be flat sequentially and then on the freight side sequentially not really seeing any headwinds freight is a bit more of a story for us on a year over year basis and that really has more to do with lower freight rates that we saw in the second half of 20 last year due to how we were shipping the ppe out to our customers where the customers were taking possession of that product so we are seeing a bit of freight inflation creep in sequentially it s not an impact it s maybe a million to 2 million on a year over year basis in the fourth quarter but we feel like freight is relatively well controlled given what s happening in the macro environment we do a lot of small parcel shipment and that is the sort of terms of how we pay for that are pretty well bound by our contract expect to see a little bit more pressure coming in from our ltl shipments next year but i think given what could be happening with freight from what we know of the macro environment we re in a pretty good position patrick baumann j p morgan analyst great helpful thanks a lot and appreciate

french gates are giving themselves a two year trial period to see if they can co parent their multibillion dollar charitable foundation baby when the couple announced their divorce two months ago they said they would both stay on as co chairs of the gates foundation which they set up together more than 20 years ago but on wednesday the foundation s ceo announced a contingency plan to ensure the continuity of the foundation s work that s a nice way of saying they realize the capital t truth that working with one s ex is an exceptionally terrible idea here s the deal they ll try running this thing in parallel for a bit but if they can t stand it bill will essentially buy melinda out so that she can do her own philanthropic work she would receive personal resources from her ex husband resources that would be completely separate from the foundation s endowment the foundation s ceo said why it matters the gates foundation is one of the world s largest charities and it s given away more than 55 billion much of it from the gateses personal wealth to a wide range of initiatives related to global health poverty alleviation and more recently the global rollout of covid 19 vaccines but its reputation has been under scrutiny since the couple announced their divorce in may soon after media reports emerged about bill gates alleged improper behavior with microsoft employees decades

the windows print spooler service basically the thing that manages computers access to printers and lets you keep working while the printer does its thing hilariously the main reason we know about the flaw is because a bunch of researchers at cybersecurity company sangfor accidentally published a how to guide for exploiting it whoops the vulnerability could allow hackers to install programs view and delete data or even create new user accounts with full user rights in other words they could do a bunch of damage again this is yet another security headache from microsoft last year the nsa

the longest active nursing strike in over a decade arrived in north texas wednesday outside the headquarters of hospital operator tenet healthcare at tenet owned st vincent hospital in worcester mass 800 nurses walked off the job march 8 to demand improvements in staffing represented by the massachusetts nurses association the striking nurses say the problem has only gotten worse during the covid 19 pandemic advertisement one day longer one day stronger was wednesday s rallying cry from 20 st vincent nurses who flew from massachusetts to deliver a 16 foot long petition signed by over 700 nurses to tenet s farmers branch headquarters advertisement a 16 foot long petition signed by 700 striking nurses was delivered to tenet healthcare s headquarters shelby tauber special contributor business briefing become a business insider with the latest news sign up or with google facebook by signing up you agree to our terms of service and privacy policy nurses and supporters took turns speaking into a megaphone airing their grievances with tenet to a group of around 50 nurses and supporters the event was livestreamed on facebook to over 150 virtual attendees essentially what brought us out on strike is unsafe patient care in st vincent hospital said marie ritacco a registered nurse and vice president of the massachusetts nurses association we felt we really needed to bring the message to headquarters to ron rittenmeyer the ceo of tenet healthcare corp to say it is time to get to the table and resolve this advertisement in an emailed statement from spokeswoman lesley bogdanow tenet said it wants the nurses to return to work we ve received the petition but as the mna knows there is only one path to the best outcome for the nurses of saint vincent hospital and that is to sit down at the negotiating table with the hospital team in massachusetts to bring this to a resolution the statement said ritacco said the nurses are asking to have four patients assigned to them most of the time advertisement on occasion they may have to accept a fifth patient as long as we have the appropriate ancillary and support staff in place she said so it s a very reasonable ask it s what s going on at the other two hospitals in the city that we live in and work in advertisement david schildmeier the union s communications director said tenet wants nurses to be responsible for five patients at all times he said that s been especially problematic when dealing with covid 19 patients they would have five covid patients which is unheard of in our state most hospitals if you had a covid assignment you would have at most three covid patients you would never have five and you would never ever have a mix of covid and non covid patients he said it s medical malpractice to force nurses to do that but they did that every day tenet maintains it has followed its collective bargaining agreement with the nurses union that calls for staffing ratios of one nurse to four to five patients advertisement marie ritacco massachusetts nurses association vice president and a nurse of 38 years speaks at a demonstration outside of the tenet healthcare headquarters shelby tauber special contributor ritacco said hospital leaders refused to meet in person to negotiate staffing until the day before the nurses arrived in north texas negotiations have been held over zoom instead tenet said the union is needlessly prolonging the strike we put a new offer on the table which includes enhanced staffing on several nursing units and maintains generous wage and benefits improvements bogdanow said we are working in earnest to reach an agreement but the mna refuses to meet with us until late in the week to discuss the improved terms of our latest offer instead sending part of its delegation to dallas advertisement the nurses who began planning their d fw trip two weeks ago will meet face to face with hospital negotiators in massachusetts on friday at the union s heavily promoted protest striking nurses found an ally in one of organized labor s leading voices sara nelson international president of the association of flight attendants joined the nurses in a sign of solidarity she said tenet s offer to negotiate was a direct result of the nurses trip they have to continue to weigh the risks of what s going to be worse for them making the deal or continuing to hold out nelson said and i think the risks are starting to become too great to tenet advertisement association of flight attendants international president sara nelson joined with the striking nurses on wednesday shelby tauber special contributor ritacco said the strike has been costly for tenet the eighth largest public company headquartered in d fw with 17 6 billion in revenue last year they spent over 80 million on this strike she said what we were asking for from day one would have cost them a fraction of what they have spent on keeping the strike going it s very disturbing what they re doing it s all about profits and it needs to be focused on our patients schildmeier said the nurses came up with the idea to create a massive petition and deliver it to the tenet headquarters after the company threatened in may to permanently replace the nurses advertisement that set off a bomb in the labor movement because that hasn t been done in years schildmeier said the next day was national nurses day and had its annual shareholders meeting where they touted that the stock price had tripled that s moral deafness tenet said it had no choice but to seek replacements it also said 218 nurses have crossed the picket line since the strike began without a signal that the mna was willing to compromise and reach resolution we began hiring permanent replacement nurses to help ensure continuity of care as the strike continues the company s statement said wednesday s protest was exhilarating to ritacco but the reality of the strike has not been without its challenges advertisement nurse carla leblanc sheds a tear outside tenet healthcare headquarters it really is like post traumatic stress the anxiety of this i don t know if i ll ever get over it she said shelby tauber special contributor registered nurse jessica deyo a single mother with two daughters aged 7 and 9 said she saved the 4 000 stimulus check she got from the government this year to help prepare for the strike so that was very helpful i kept that all tucked away deyo said my parents have helped me out my friends that work on my unit fellow nurses that i m good friends with have lent me money i ve gone to food banks after 15 weeks without a regular paycheck deyo finally received a lump sum unemployment payment of 11 000 which would have been great to just have every week like i should have been from the beginning advertisement the nurses say they re hoping for what they describe as a satisfactory proposal from tenet at friday s negotiating session i can t wait for it to be over i miss being at the bedside deyo said being a nurse to all of us it s not just a job it s our life when you can t go to work and do what you re supposed to do it makes you feel lost

oil prices have been rising steadily for months you ve probably noticed one big consequence average gasoline prices have climbed to seven year highs as early as last week the expectations were that oil prices would either stabilize or rise gradually until an opec meeting that was supposed to be routine ended in an unexpected impasse with no agreement on what to do about oil production now analysts are bracing for everything from a price spike to a price plunge as millions of americans hit the road again there s just no certainty around where crude is headed here s what you need to know about the volatile oil prices demand for oil is finally coming back last year as the coronavirus pandemic spread around the world global oil demand dropped remarkably fast people stopped driving and flying markets were thrown completely out of whack so oil producers slashed their production including ahistoric cut in output from the group of countries collectively known as opec which includes major producers saudi arabia and russia now demand is returning as the u s china and some other parts of the world reopen for business as the impact from the pandemic wanes commutes vacation flights and road trips are all pushing fuel demand up in the u s a record number of people hit the road over the july fourth weekend according to aaa but oil producers are still pumping less oil one huge reason for the supply demand mismatch is that opec has taken a very gradual approach to putting barrels back on the market that s intended to keep prices high increasing revenues for oil producing countries meanwhile u s producers have also been pumping less than expected as they focus instead on making money for investors this was a surprise to everyone as the shale patch is famous for exuberantly producing oil when prices are rising the result is a totally different market from a year ago one that has been driving prices steadily up u s energy information administration u s energy information administration crude prices dropped sharply last spring but have risen steadily over recent months we ve seen a bit of a pivot and now we re actually looking at well what is going to happen if there is a supply shortage says louise dickson a senior analyst at rystad energy then opec met and things got interesting opec members got together for their monthly meeting last week pretty much everybody expected them to gradually increase their combined output but not so much that it would cause prices to drop that would serve the group s best interests and would have matched what the cartel has been doing recently instead the meeting devolved into drama as the united arab emirates wanted to be allowed to produce more oil individually which saudi arabia opposed rbc capital noted there are seemingly shakespearean elements to this drama which suggests a rift between two crown princes who were once extremely close whether it s geopolitics economics or interpersonal intrigue driving the dispute the powerful cartel found itself at an impasse after days of talks the meeting was called off indefinitely with no deal and no set plans to meet again that means the supply demand imbalance is set to grow even more than expected you d expect that to drive oil prices up but the actual consequences have been more complicated because people don t know what this means for opec the opec drama has created two completely opposite concerns if the cartel doesn t clinch a new deal to increase production and if the current deal remains in place that would drive prices up some analysts see 90 a barrel for oil as a possibility such a spike would not be good for many economies worldwide it would lead to a surge in gas prices and hit many sectors that depend on oil such as airlines on the other hand if the infighting causes opec to completely abandon its current production cuts there could be a free for all that would cause a ton of oil to flood the market that would push prices down potentially dramatically a few months from now which could cause chaos for oil producers nasdaq and associated press nasdaq and associated press brent crude prices rose then fell dramatically over the last week weekend dates not shown the two outcomes could not be more different and the uncertainty about which might happen has created an interesting few days on oil markets global crude prices rose to a multiyear high on monday off the news that there was no deal then they plunged on tuesday and wednesday wiping out weeks worth of gains and of course it s still possible that opec will announce a deal that would land somewhere in the middle and potentially stabilize prices in fact many analysts think that s the most likely outcome despite the lack of any public progress toward it because there s a ton of pressure for a compromise in early 2020 opec caused prices to go haywire thanks to a price war between saudi arabia and russia but that was quickly followed by the historic agreement to cut production which is widely credited with rebalancing crude markets and supporting prices for well over a year now there s a lot riding on whether opec can again strike a deal to keep markets balanced either a price spike or a collapse would be bad news for opec members and a spike would be particularly worrying for the world s oil consumers given that prices are already quite high in the u s the biden administration is clearly concerned about the prospect that gas prices might rise even further under former president donald trump the white house got unusually involved in opec negotiations and president biden seems to be continuing the tradition the white house has talked directly to multiple opec members and is urging a compromise to boost production it s another sign of how quickly things can change in the oil industry just a few years ago plenty of oil experts were asking if opec was a has been issuing edicts from its headquarters in vienna with no real impact on

global depression also encouraged portfolio managers to return to emerging markets where they could earn higher returns subscribe to the post most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from the washington post advertisement advertisement the resumption of private financial flows to africa asia and latin america staved off the anticipated wave of debt defaults and restructurings but it did so at the cost of adding to an already swollen debt pile total emerging market borrowings topped 86 trillion at the end of march up more than 11 trillion during the pandemic further debt increases are inevitable as countries in the developing world struggle to repair their battered economies and to pay for coronavirus vaccines international efforts to lighten the debt load thus far have achieved little with private creditors and the chinese government remaining on the sidelines now signs that the federal reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected risks triggering a fresh bout of capital flight that could shake both emerging market borrowers and the u s economy there s just an enormous amount of debt out there external financing to roll over that debt right now it s abundant but we all know how volatile capital flows can be daleep singh u s deputy national security adviser told a think tank last week advertisement advertisement for now many emerging markets are enjoying some of the lowest lending costs on record according to oxford economics ghana raised 3 billion in march by selling bonds to investors including one zero coupon bond that pays no interest for four years investors receive the face value of the bonds when they mature after buying them at a discount similar to the way u s savings bonds work story continues fed policymakers last month raised their inflation forecast and said the central bank could hike rates in 2023 a year earlier than anticipated some fed officials have expressed support for moving sooner to cool off rising prices which could cause global financial flows to abruptly reverse course once more higher u s rates would act as an incentive for fund managers to sell securities in emerging markets and invest the money in the united states countries that borrowed heavily during the pandemic would suffer a double whammy paying higher interest charges on a larger stock of debt since much of this borrowing is in dollars these nations would be faced with a choice between two evils either raise their own interest rates to prevent capital from fleeing and to protect the value of their currency which could cause a recession or allow their currencies to sink and see the cost of repaying their dollar based loans soar that is bad bad really bad news for the emerging markets said carmen reinhart chief economist for the world bank advertisement advertisement developing country debt will be on the agenda when the group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meet in venice july 9 to 10 the g 20 last year coordinated an agreement to suspend interest payments that poor countries owed government creditors after being extended twice that deal will expire at the end of the year and be replaced by a broader debt restructuring plan called the common framework i don t think we have expectations for major breakthroughs they re struggling with the details of implementation i think it s going to be a long haul said scott morris a senior fellow at the center for global development which hosted singh last year s debt service suspension initiative dssi saved 43 struggling countries a modest total of 5 7 billion which reinhart called disappointing developing countries this year are scheduled to pay 1 1 trillion in debt service costs including 373 billion for public debt according to the united nations development program over the next three years those interest charges will hamstring governments that should be spending to battle the pandemic as well as to address long term problems such as the effects of climate change the agency said advertisement advertisement interest payments already eat up an enormous share of government budgets in some developing countries leaving little money for education and health in lebanon sri lanka and zambia close to half of government revenue is siphoned off by creditors according to world bank data as the fed and other major central banks begin raising rates some emerging market central banks would be forced to follow suit otherwise capital would flee and their currencies would plunge in value further aggravating inflation you could have a crisis if investors all decide to run for the exits at the same time said douglas rediker chairman of international capital strategies an investment advisory firm if the dollar follows u s interest rates higher some emerging markets credit ratings would probably also be cut raising their borrowing costs and potentially making financial bailouts necessary agustin carstens general manager of the bank for international settlements in basel switzerland said in a recent speech advertisement advertisement central banks in brazil mexico russia and turkey already have hiked interest rates in response to localized inflation caused by weakening currencies and rising commodity prices this is something the imf and world bank really need to watch vigilantly because these things can turn quickly said brent mcintosh former undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs and now an adjunct senior fellow at the council on foreign relations as the debt load grows in the developing world additional risks are appearing of total developing country borrowing during the pandemic 60 has ended up on the balance sheet of local banks which geoffrey okamoto the international monetary fund s first deputy managing director labeled concerning that financial link means that a debt default or restructuring could punch a hole in a nation s financial system at the same time it upends the government budget raising the risk of a more destabilizing crisis advertisement advertisement trouble for emerging markets ultimately could boomerang on the u s economy the federal reserve warned in its most recent financial stability report bank finances could be damaged if corporations and governments in the developing world default on loans or american clients with significant exposure to such countries lose business so far the g 20 s efforts to ease the developing economies mounting debts have satisfied few last year s dssi helped countries such as pakistan afghanistan angola and uzbekistan by deferring interest payments but the effort failed to secure sufficient participation from bondholders who have supplanted commercial banks as the largest source of private capital for emerging economies and it received only limited backing from china now the world s top government lender many eligible countries also were reluctant to participate fearing that they would subsequently lose their access to private capital markets advertisement advertisement in november the g 20 agreed to replace the dssi with the common framework intended to enable up to 73 low income countries to reduce what they owe in return for agreeing with the imf on an economic reform plan that would position them to meet future bills three nations chad ethiopia and zambia already have requested debt restructurings under the new arrangement the biden administration is willing to allow other slightly more affluent countries with debt problems to participate though the g 20 has yet to consider that possibility according to a senior u s treasury department official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity clay lowery executive vice president of the institute of international finance an industry group said banks are more likely to participate in the new program the framework however is likely to be dogged by the same questions that bedeviled the dssi independent analysts said advertisement advertisement any effort to overhaul developing countries debt must make sure that official creditors such as the u s government and the imf and wall street fund managers who buy emerging market bonds in the financial markets are all part of the same bargain the real risk right now is that whatever liquidity we provide countries to manage the crisis some of it is going toward paying creditors and allowing private creditors to continue to free ride which is a really bad situation said lars jensen an economist with the undp china s role may be even more vexing beijing has signed on to the new g 20 plan but u s officials say it needs to do much more despite china s public support for the common framework its participation has been sorely lacking singh the deputy national security adviser said last week china s lending activity remains highly opaque and it self classifies a lot of its lending as commercially driven even though it s very clearly directed by the government advertisement advertisement indeed one chinese institution the china development bank is a major lender across africa chinese officials insist the cdb is akin to a private sector lender but the bank operates under the direct leadership of the state council of china its website says referring to the government s senior policymaking body more than 70 of the bank s shares are owned by the chinese ministry of finance and a state backed investment company related content queen elizabeth ii opens her front lawn to picnics for the first time will the mass

it s 2021 and we are hopefully approaching the tail end of a global pandemic that shuttered businesses and eliminated thousands of jobs despite these factors the packaging and processing workforce continues to struggle to fill career providing positions oem magazine editor in chief stephanie neil joins the inaugural unpacked with oem magazine and goes beyond the numbers and data points to get to the real crux of the issues causing manufacturing to continue to have a hard time filling well paying positions she also provides added perspective with her expert level knowledge of women in the workforce due to her prominent leadership role in pmmi s packaging and processing women s leadership network to subscribe rate review and find more unpacked podcast episodes visit pmmi org podcast or find us on apple podcasts spotify or iheart radio read the full transcript below sean riley steph today i want to talk about the workforce with this always being an issue that is manufacturing having a hard time despite having these pretty good career level jobs open for what feels like years i can t imagine that the last 16 months or 17 months has helped the situation at all to start with how has that impacted the manufacturing workplace the it being this little pandemic thing we re going through stephanie neil well i hate to be the bearer of bad news but unfortunately the workforce situation has gone from bad to worse riley awesome neil i m actually working on a story right now that is looking at this 2021 manufacturing talent study that just came out in may from deloitte and the manufacturing institute the pandemic erased 1 4 million u s manufacturing jobs that is after it took us about six years to successfully add 600 000 jobs we ve recouped some of those jobs but there s still about a half a million jobs that are unfilled in u s manufacturing that keeps us on track to that number that s always bandied about about the 2 1 million unfilled jobs by 2030 we hear that all the time but the study also talked about the fact that and this went out between december and february to about 800 manufacturing professionals in all different industries not just packaging and processing so we have to think about all the different segments but the executives at these manufacturing companies are saying it s 36 harder to find the talent than it was back in 2018 neil we re talking about entry level jobs sean we re not talking about something that you have to have this engineering degree for you would just have to have a good attitude you have to show up you have to have a good work ethic you have to be able to take instructions that s all they re looking for there s a lot of people that have been displaced because of the pandemic in the restaurant business in the hospitality business there s just really the sense of what is going on why can t we find these people it s not new when you were a wee lad growing up sean and your teacher said what do you want to be when you grow up did you say a packaging professional riley no we say that a lot i get that but i m also sitting here thinking as you said that with people being displaced from restaurants and jobs like that the little difference we ve always talked about especially with the manufacturing type they re not necessarily low wage jobs there s a lot of these like you said while entry level it s for a pretty good salary that could eventually again it leads to a career that s the part that still seems to be hard to get across to the public neil actually in the study it says despite entry level jobs in manufacturing average 15 55 an hour which is double the minimum federal wage they can t find people this is me just thinking about what s going on first of all we re not telling our kids we re telling them you can be a doctor or a lawyer or a fireman we re not telling them that you can be a machine operator it doesn t have to be an engineer it can be a very lucrative career but that s the second part this gen z this zoom generation does not look at this as a lucrative career they re more into playing the stock market and investing in bitcoin and being social media influencers they re not even considering this seriously so something has to happen neil the other thing is i want to go back you recently had a conversation with tom morrison he s this expert on market disruption it was fascinating to me because he was talking about we re coming out of the pandemic our industry s positioned for an economic boom but how do you grow the company 40 over the next several years when we are only adding about 5 more employee how do you do that obviously everybody s turning to automation the big fear has always been automation is going to take our jobs i m still saying it s not but for some people it might if you d rather collect your unemployment check than go and get in this entry level job and start to create new skillsets that are going to be actually cool because the digital transformation and the workforce 4 0 movement is meaning that people are going to not just be pulling things off an assembly line and pick and place they re going to be doing things that are a little bit more interesting neil they re going to be learning about robots and artificial intelligence deloitte was talking about these new personas that will depict the future versions of manufacturing roles that s like a digital twin engineer or a predictive supply network analyst or a robot teaming coordinator the role of a robot teaming coordinator is to train humans and robots to work together collaboratively that sounds like a pretty interesting job to me but you got to get your foot in the door first so how do we get these people in the door that s still a big problem that we re trying to solve riley from that conversation we had with tom morrison which is available for people who want to listen to previous podcasts that was one of the things he i think highlighted pretty well was that it s changing those early or entry level type positions from you re not like you said picking things off and putting them in a box you re more controlling for lack of a better word digital workflow you re controlling these now high end controls just by having the ability to control a cell phone because this generation is so used to using computers and cell phones and stuff like that they can come in and they re not doing it s manual but it s not manual lifting things and stuff like that it s working these screens and stuff that s much more of a it paints a better picture than a dusty dirty old manufacturing facility neil most definitely it s not just the individuals that we have to turn to and say why aren t you taking these jobs we as an industry have to come together and figure out how we re going to make this industry more attractive then companies themselves have to do it because even though they understand they need to do this re skilling according to this deloitte survey only 10 of the respondents are addressing this right now then i point a finger at all right what company is doing it well i just did a story on mars the food and pet care company they have just teamed up with microsoft and accenture to create this cloud first digital infrastructure across every business segment using ai and digital twins and iot all the acronyms that we like to throw around but they ve been doing it in pockets of the organization but now it s more of a widespread thing neil but i think what s more important here to this discussion is that they re focusing on improving the digital skills of their global workforce they re taking the time to make sure that they re being trained in this they re putting the tools in place like microsoft teams and other sort of things that can help them do their job they re making an effort to make sure that their employees are moving forward with this digital transformation just as the company is that s the example that has to happen across the board really riley you spoke about how and it s true everyone got caught in this generation of you re going to get out of high school you have to go to college you have to be like you said a doctor lawyer et cetera versus trade schools really being something as an option or training out of high school being more of an option which was different than previous generations when you have someone like a microsoft or a mars coming to a high school or a community or junior college painting this picture it s a lot better than the versions that they were showing people 20 years ago again where you re just going into this manufacturing facility i think these workers will recognize those names for lack of a better word again as people that they want to work alongside neil i actually wanted to add onto what you were saying because there s other programs that are starting to pop up there s this nonprofit organization called amskills right now they re in the tampa area they re doing these hands on workshops for high school students where they ll go in with bringing the teachers i think they ve got a grant from the department of education and they ll replicate these real world scenarios of time clock tracking hands on skills training then they also offer another scenario it s more of an in depth boot camp this is for adults and for veterans they ll provide them with how to read a blueprint measuring using hand tools working on computers doing writing exercises and working on the soft skills too the reason that they re seeing this work is because they re very strategic about where they go neil they re making sure that there s a lot of manufacturers in the area first and then they re rolling in these mobile boot camps recruiting the people getting the manufacturers involved then at the end of it they re assessing the projects and the soft skills and they re setting them up with interviews they re actually being a catalyst and being a bridge from the individual who s just dabbling in with yeah i could see myself doing this and then actually setting up the interview and saying okay well maybe there you ll get your opportunity riley i know a little bit about it but i didn t know as much as you just explained that s something to me that s fantastic that s interesting because you re bringing it to kids that have no idea that this is even an opportunity if it s in the tampa area there could be people in the inner city that aren t aware that there are these type of manufacturing facilities that have these like we said career worthy jobs touching off of that how is this affecting we could spend an hour and even longer just talking about the issues that women have faced in the workplace and diversity in the workplace and equity and inclusion not only in manufacturing but in this industry it s coming along but it s not where it is in some other industries let s say that it s definitely something that we re working on how has covid affected that what kind of changes or improvements just give me a little bit on what s happening with women in the world neil unfortunately i don t have good news there either riley this is tons of fun neil i m hoping we re going to turn it around we re going to be the champions of this first of all having a diversity equity and inclusion program is an imperative for manufacturers right now they know they have to do it there s things that are going on like the national association of manufacturers has this pledge for action which is basically a commitment where they go and they sign the commitment online they re saying they re going to take some tangible actions to increase equity and parity for underrepresented communities and create pathways and job opportunities the goal is to reflect the diversity of the overall u s workforce by 2030 this is important because having this diverse network drives business performance that s proven there s an analysis of fortune 500 manufacturing companies that said companies fostering diversity and building inclusive environments are more likely to have stronger financial performance neil if you remember sean last march at pack expo east in philadelphia we had kelly coyne who s the vp of global women s strategies at pax ellevate she oversees the pax ellevate global women s leadership fund she talked about the fact that gender diverse leadership teams have better business results that s the good news the bad news is that the pandemic has forced more women out of the workforce and that s not good neil we were making some good gender parity progress between 2015 and 2020 women in senior vp positions grew from 23 to 28 c suite grew from 17 to 21 we can t lose that momentum unfortunately we are there s a new study from mckinsey it says this covid crisis could set women back by half a decade because one in four women are contemplating downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce completely many are citing childcare responsibilities you think about it it also said that more women were negatively impacted by covid they were more likely to get laid off or furloughed add onto that the pressure of maybe homeschooling their kids or financial insecurity or isolation in the pandemic and now we have a problem it s concerning riley it has to be we re laughing and joking in the being of it but it s serious covid in particular has hit women harder and diverse groups harder and different ethnic groups harder i assume that your answer was not going to be something where this was wonderful situation for women and how they ve grown what can we do what options do we have to try to get back what we ve lost and even surpass that going forward neil i think it s the normal engage with the local community and seek to hire more military and tie leadership performance to maybe to diversity equity and inclusion metrics these are all the things that organizations or folks like deloitte are checking off this is what you need to do but i don t know the answer if i did i d be very very successful right now riley yes you would not be on this podcast neil i would not be talking to you right now sean riley no you would not be wasting your time neil but you know what we re doing stuff inside pmmi with the packaging and processing women s leadership network which as you know we re here to recruit and retain and advance women s careers in the packaging and processing industry we ve been doing it for about four years now we have got so much great momentum growing the network is expanding just recently because our executive council has ended their four year term we ve let some of them go if they wanted to move away from our organization and we ve brought new council members on we ve got 10 new executive council members who are there to advise and help guide us and drive the programs based on our pillars which are networking communication and alignment we have a great mix of members now pmmi members cpgs and groups we re aligned with such as the institute of packaging professionals as well as university we have an instructor from the school of packaging at michigan sate neil so we have a balance of different roles of people at different stages of their careers like emerging leader versus seasoned leader i think we have a really great group we are so grateful to the council members who have helped us over the past few years and for those who ve stayed on including our co chairs like sharron gilbert who s the ceo of septimatech and jan tharp who s the ceo of bumble bee seafoods we re grateful for all of the efforts that have happened to date we are trying to raise the visibility of what women can accomplish in packaging and processing that is a reflection of the entire manufacturing industry as a whole we re doing our little part to make sure that women are well represented in the future riley awesome i keep thinking back to and not just because you mentioned it but those statistics that came out of the last networking event you guys had at pack expo east that you spoke about where the numbers showed a diverse executive branch or executive level with women is better it s better for your business it s a fact that the numbers back up that s something that hopefully as we re coming out of this and we are coming out of this that you guys can continue to push forward i know we ve talked about it in general terms but if i m an oem i m making packaging equipment how am i helping my customers or how can my customers help me deal with this skill shortage how are we working together as a packaging and processing community to get through this neil that s an excellent question i reflect back to the executive leadership conference back in april the cpg panel we had folks from t marzetti and schwan s company and crest food of course matt reynolds editor of packaging world was moderating he had asked that question too how can oems help you with the needs that you see in terms of the workforce they originally were just talking about the things that we always talk about we need more machine flexibility we ve been hearing that for years but surprisingly they also asked for help training the next generation workforce on existing machines because people are retiring they knew the machine inside and out new people are coming on board the oems will need to be reengaged to train the next generation that s what they re asking for neil it doesn t have to be onsite it could be virtual like an on demand training just like we have on demand streaming of tv you engage when you want but the cpgs are really leaning on the oems to do this for new technology they need help with that too obviously these machines are getting more sophisticated more complicated more integrated they need help dealing with that so there s going to be opportunity to be there and have hands on help i think sean last time i was on the podcast with you we talked about oems getting creative and coming to the tables with some new services maybe it sounds farfetched at the time but if you can make a business case for it the cpg will say sure let s try it and you just might have a new revenue stream i ll circle back to the conversation about tom morrison talking about taking advantage of the marketplace disruption set your sights where you want to be in five to ten years and then figure out how to get there riley if we ve heard it once we ve heard it a million times about it needs to be a partnership with you and oems and cpgs it needs to be more than just a one off buying a machine and then only talking to them when you need maintenance or something like that it needs to evolve as we ve all had to evolve through this again citing what he just said about the market disruption if there is this disruption we have to get through it together because if you try to get through it on your own you re not going to know what everybody else is doing and if other people are getting through it together you re going to fall behind that s why he basically said it is an opportunity to have a competitive advantage neil yep it is riley we ve talked longer than we should have which usually happens when you and i start talking about this which is great to wrap up is there anything else that you want to get out there that you can share neil honestly the takeaway for me as i m looking at this research from deloitte and from mckinsey and just scanning the manufacturing landscape and talking to people i think that we re so focused on the digital transformation and we re not looking closely enough at how that impacts the workforce we re not going to replace people with automation people are going to be working side by side with robots there s going to be some great new job opportunities out there but organizations have to be more flexible neil just like cpgs are asking oems to be more flexible with machines organizations have to be more flexible they have to be more empathetic to the fact that the pandemic really did a number on a lot of people they have to be flexible with their work hours and making sure they have maybe a hybrid workload for these moms that are worried about what are they going to do they can t get back to work because maybe they have childcare issues there s a lot that has to be addressed moving forward and i think we can do it riley the interesting thing again you say that is we are for the most part at least in the packaging end and with a lot of the food and the beverage and things like that and especially food processing did pretty well from a dollars and cents point of view throughout this pandemic because some businesses unfortunately yes were lost but for the most part as a whole these are all things that people needed every day as an industry it thrived while the workers may have been suffering that is like you said there needs to be some empathy involved to bring that around where you guys did

file in this june 22 2021 file photo federal reserve board chairman jerome powell testifies on the federal reserve s response to the coronavirus pandemic during a house oversight and reform select subcommittee on the coronavirus hearing on capitol hill in washington federal reserve officials began debating at their june meeting when and how they would reduce the monthly bond purchases that they have used to keep longer term interest rates in check graeme jennings pool via ap federal reserve officials started discussing at their meeting last month the timing and mechanics of reducing their huge monthly bond purchases which are used to keep longer term interest rates in check the debate revealed in the minutes of the fed s june meeting released wednesday reflected a broadly positive outlook on the economy among fed policymakers but also some concern that higher inflation could prove more persistent than the central bank has previously indicated still economists saw little sign that the fed was any closer to hiking interest rates or reducing its bond buys a few policymakers mentioned that they expected the conditions for beginning to reduce bond purchases would be met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated in light of incoming data the minutes said advertisement the fed is buying 120 billion a month in treasury securities and mortgage backed bonds to keep longer term interest rates low and encourage more borrowing and spending those purchases have flooded financial markets with cash potentially fueling asset bubbles some economists have argued the fed has said that it will keep making the purchases until the economy makes substantial further progress toward its goals of full employment and an inflation rate slightly above 2 but there is a clear split on the fed s policymaking committee with some officials cautioning that recent economic reports provide a less clear signal about the underlying economic momentum the june 15 16 meeting was held before the most recent jobs report which showed the economy had gained 850 000 new positions last month several of these officials emphasized that the fed should be patient about making any changes to its bond purchase plans the minutes said paul ashworth chief u s economist for capital economics a consulting firm said the minutes were not as hawkish as we suspected in fed parlance hawks typically worry more about inflation and are less concerned with keeping unemployment low while doves take the opposite view there seems to be only limited support for beginning to taper the monthly asset purchases anytime soon ashworth said after the june meeting the fed issued a statement and a set of economic projections that signaled that it would potentially dial back its low interest rate policies earlier than it had previously projected the policymakers forecast that they would hike the fed s benchmark short term interest rate twice by the end of 2023 in march they had indicated no rate hikes would occur before 2024 the minutes showed fed officials expressed optimism about the economy even as they said it was still far from meeting their employment and inflation goals policymakers observed that economic activity was expanding at a historically rapid pace led by robust gains in consumer spending the minutes said most fed officials expected inflation to decline in the coming months as some supply chain bottlenecks eased the minutes said fed chair jerome powell has repeatedly said that recent jumps in consumer prices would be temporary and largely reflected disruptions surrounding the reopening of the economy but a substantial majority of policymakers said that there was a risk inflation could stay higher than expected because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed most economists still expect a reduction or tapering of bond purchases to begin by late this year or early next year with an announcement of the change potentially occurring in late august at the fed s annual conference at jackson hole wyoming some differences over the timing of the tapering have emerged among the fed s regional bank presidents with dallas fed president robert kaplan saying last week that he favored pulling back on the purchases sooner rather than later san francisco fed president mary daly in an interview with the associated press said last week that it would be appropriate to consider tapering later this year or early next year but she cautioned that the economy is far from full employment

it s 2021 and we are hopefully approaching the tail end of a global pandemic that shuttered businesses and eliminated thousands of jobs despite these factors the packaging and processing workforce continues to struggle to fill career providing positions oem magazine editor in chief stephanie neil joins the inaugural unpacked with oem magazine and goes beyond the numbers and data points to get to the real crux of the issues causing manufacturing to continue to have a hard time filling well paying positions she also provides added perspective with her expert level knowledge of women in the workforce due to her prominent leadership role in pmmi s packaging and processing women s leadership network to subscribe rate review and find more unpacked podcast episodes visit pmmi org podcast or find us on apple podcasts spotify or iheart radio read the full transcript below sean riley steph today i want to talk about the workforce with this always being an issue that is manufacturing having a hard time despite having these pretty good career level jobs open for what feels like years i can t imagine that the last 16 months or 17 months has helped the situation at all to start with how has that impacted the manufacturing workplace the it being this little pandemic thing we re going through stephanie neil well i hate to be the bearer of bad news but unfortunately the workforce situation has gone from bad to worse riley awesome neil i m actually working on a story right now that is looking at this 2021 manufacturing talent study that just came out in may from deloitte and the manufacturing institute the pandemic erased 1 4 million u s manufacturing jobs that is after it took us about six years to successfully add 600 000 jobs we ve recouped some of those jobs but there s still about a half a million jobs that are unfilled in u s manufacturing that keeps us on track to that number that s always bandied about about the 2 1 million unfilled jobs by 2030 we hear that all the time but the study also talked about the fact that and this went out between december and february to about 800 manufacturing professionals in all different industries not just packaging and processing so we have to think about all the different segments but the executives at these manufacturing companies are saying it s 36 harder to find the talent than it was back in 2018 neil we re talking about entry level jobs sean we re not talking about something that you have to have this engineering degree for you would just have to have a good attitude you have to show up you have to have a good work ethic you have to be able to take instructions that s all they re looking for there s a lot of people that have been displaced because of the pandemic in the restaurant business in the hospitality business there s just really the sense of what is going on why can t we find these people it s not new when you were a wee lad growing up sean and your teacher said what do you want to be when you grow up did you say a packaging professional riley no we say that a lot i get that but i m also sitting here thinking as you said that with people being displaced from restaurants and jobs like that the little difference we ve always talked about especially with the manufacturing type they re not necessarily low wage jobs there s a lot of these like you said while entry level it s for a pretty good salary that could eventually again it leads to a career that s the part that still seems to be hard to get across to the public neil actually in the study it says despite entry level jobs in manufacturing average 15 55 an hour which is double the minimum federal wage they can t find people this is me just thinking about what s going on first of all we re not telling our kids we re telling them you can be a doctor or a lawyer or a fireman we re not telling them that you can be a machine operator it doesn t have to be an engineer it can be a very lucrative career but that s the second part this gen z this zoom generation does not look at this as a lucrative career they re more into playing the stock market and investing in bitcoin and being social media influencers they re not even considering this seriously so something has to happen neil the other thing is i want to go back you recently had a conversation with tom morrison he s this expert on market disruption it was fascinating to me because he was talking about we re coming out of the pandemic our industry s positioned for an economic boom but how do you grow the company 40 over the next several years when we are only adding about 5 more employee how do you do that obviously everybody s turning to automation the big fear has always been automation is going to take our jobs i m still saying it s not but for some people it might if you d rather collect your unemployment check than go and get in this entry level job and start to create new skillsets that are going to be actually cool because the digital transformation and the workforce 4 0 movement is meaning that people are going to not just be pulling things off an assembly line and pick and place they re going to be doing things that are a little bit more interesting neil they re going to be learning about robots and artificial intelligence deloitte was talking about these new personas that will depict the future versions of manufacturing roles that s like a digital twin engineer or a predictive supply network analyst or a robot teaming coordinator the role of a robot teaming coordinator is to train humans and robots to work together collaboratively that sounds like a pretty interesting job to me but you got to get your foot in the door first so how do we get these people in the door that s still a big problem that we re trying to solve riley from that conversation we had with tom morrison which is available for people who want to listen to previous podcasts that was one of the things he i think highlighted pretty well was that it s changing those early or entry level type positions from you re not like you said picking things off and putting them in a box you re more controlling for lack of a better word digital workflow you re controlling these now high end controls just by having the ability to control a cell phone because this generation is so used to using computers and cell phones and stuff like that they can come in and they re not doing it s manual but it s not manual lifting things and stuff like that it s working these screens and stuff that s much more of a it paints a better picture than a dusty dirty old manufacturing facility neil most definitely it s not just the individuals that we have to turn to and say why aren t you taking these jobs we as an industry have to come together and figure out how we re going to make this industry more attractive then companies themselves have to do it because even though they understand they need to do this re skilling according to this deloitte survey only 10 of the respondents are addressing this right now then i point a finger at all right what company is doing it well i just did a story on mars the food and pet care company they have just teamed up with microsoft and accenture to create this cloud first digital infrastructure across every business segment using ai and digital twins and iot all the acronyms that we like to throw around but they ve been doing it in pockets of the organization but now it s more of a widespread thing neil but i think what s more important here to this discussion is that they re focusing on improving the digital skills of their global workforce they re taking the time to make sure that they re being trained in this they re putting the tools in place like microsoft teams and other sort of things that can help them do their job they re making an effort to make sure that their employees are moving forward with this digital transformation just as the company is that s the example that has to happen across the board really riley you spoke about how and it s true everyone got caught in this generation of you re going to get out of high school you have to go to college you have to be like you said a doctor lawyer et cetera versus trade schools really being something as an option or training out of high school being more of an option which was different than previous generations when you have someone like a microsoft or a mars coming to a high school or a community or junior college painting this picture it s a lot better than the versions that they were showing people 20 years ago again where you re just going into this manufacturing facility i think these workers will recognize those names for lack of a better word again as people that they want to work alongside neil i actually wanted to add onto what you were saying because there s other programs that are starting to pop up there s this nonprofit organization called amskills right now they re in the tampa area they re doing these hands on workshops for high school students where they ll go in with bringing the teachers i think they ve got a grant from the department of education and they ll replicate these real world scenarios of time clock tracking hands on skills training then they also offer another scenario it s more of an in depth boot camp this is for adults and for veterans they ll provide them with how to read a blueprint measuring using hand tools working on computers doing writing exercises and working on the soft skills too the reason that they re seeing this work is because they re very strategic about where they go neil they re making sure that there s a lot of manufacturers in the area first and then they re rolling in these mobile boot camps recruiting the people getting the manufacturers involved then at the end of it they re assessing the projects and the soft skills and they re setting them up with interviews they re actually being a catalyst and being a bridge from the individual who s just dabbling in with yeah i could see myself doing this and then actually setting up the interview and saying okay well maybe there you ll get your opportunity riley i know a little bit about it but i didn t know as much as you just explained that s something to me that s fantastic that s interesting because you re bringing it to kids that have no idea that this is even an opportunity if it s in the tampa area there could be people in the inner city that aren t aware that there are these type of manufacturing facilities that have these like we said career worthy jobs touching off of that how is this affecting we could spend an hour and even longer just talking about the issues that women have faced in the workplace and diversity in the workplace and equity and inclusion not only in manufacturing but in this industry it s coming along but it s not where it is in some other industries let s say that it s definitely something that we re working on how has covid affected that what kind of changes or improvements just give me a little bit on what s happening with women in the world neil unfortunately i don t have good news there either riley this is tons of fun neil i m hoping we re going to turn it around we re going to be the champions of this first of all having a diversity equity and inclusion program is an imperative for manufacturers right now they know they have to do it there s things that are going on like the national association of manufacturers has this pledge for action which is basically a commitment where they go and they sign the commitment online they re saying they re going to take some tangible actions to increase equity and parity for underrepresented communities and create pathways and job opportunities the goal is to reflect the diversity of the overall u s workforce by 2030 this is important because having this diverse network drives business performance that s proven there s an analysis of fortune 500 manufacturing companies that said companies fostering diversity and building inclusive environments are more likely to have stronger financial performance neil if you remember sean last march at pack expo east in philadelphia we had kelly coyne who s the vp of global women s strategies at pax ellevate she oversees the pax ellevate global women s leadership fund she talked about the fact that gender diverse leadership teams have better business results that s the good news the bad news is that the pandemic has forced more women out of the workforce and that s not good neil we were making some good gender parity progress between 2015 and 2020 women in senior vp positions grew from 23 to 28 c suite grew from 17 to 21 we can t lose that momentum unfortunately we are there s a new study from mckinsey it says this covid crisis could set women back by half a decade because one in four women are contemplating downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce completely many are citing childcare responsibilities you think about it it also said that more women were negatively impacted by covid they were more likely to get laid off or furloughed add onto that the pressure of maybe homeschooling their kids or financial insecurity or isolation in the pandemic and now we have a problem it s concerning riley it has to be we re laughing and joking in the being of it but it s serious covid in particular has hit women harder and diverse groups harder and different ethnic groups harder i assume that your answer was not going to be something where this was wonderful situation for women and how they ve grown what can we do what options do we have to try to get back what we ve lost and even surpass that going forward neil i think it s the normal engage with the local community and seek to hire more military and tie leadership performance to maybe to diversity equity and inclusion metrics these are all the things that organizations or folks like deloitte are checking off this is what you need to do but i don t know the answer if i did i d be very very successful right now riley yes you would not be on this podcast neil i would not be talking to you right now sean riley no you would not be wasting your time neil but you know what we re doing stuff inside pmmi with the packaging and processing women s leadership network which as you know we re here to recruit and retain and advance women s careers in the packaging and processing industry we ve been doing it for about four years now we have got so much great momentum growing the network is expanding just recently because our executive council has ended their four year term we ve let some of them go if they wanted to move away from our organization and we ve brought new council members on we ve got 10 new executive council members who are there to advise and help guide us and drive the programs based on our pillars which are networking communication and alignment we have a great mix of members now pmmi members cpgs and groups we re aligned with such as the institute of packaging professionals as well as university we have an instructor from the school of packaging at michigan sate neil so we have a balance of different roles of people at different stages of their careers like emerging leader versus seasoned leader i think we have a really great group we are so grateful to the council members who have helped us over the past few years and for those who ve stayed on including our co chairs like sharron gilbert who s the ceo of septimatech and jan tharp who s the ceo of bumble bee seafoods we re grateful for all of the efforts that have happened to date we are trying to raise the visibility of what women can accomplish in packaging and processing that is a reflection of the entire manufacturing industry as a whole we re doing our little part to make sure that women are well represented in the future riley awesome i keep thinking back to and not just because you mentioned it but those statistics that came out of the last networking event you guys had at pack expo east that you spoke about where the numbers showed a diverse executive branch or executive level with women is better it s better for your business it s a fact that the numbers back up that s something that hopefully as we re coming out of this and we are coming out of this that you guys can continue to push forward i know we ve talked about it in general terms but if i m an oem i m making packaging equipment how am i helping my customers or how can my customers help me deal with this skill shortage how are we working together as a packaging and processing community to get through this neil that s an excellent question i reflect back to the executive leadership conference back in april the cpg panel we had folks from t marzetti and schwan s company and crest food of course matt reynolds editor of packaging world was moderating he had asked that question too how can oems help you with the needs that you see in terms of the workforce they originally were just talking about the things that we always talk about we need more machine flexibility we ve been hearing that for years but surprisingly they also asked for help training the next generation workforce on existing machines because people are retiring they knew the machine inside and out new people are coming on board the oems will need to be reengaged to train the next generation that s what they re asking for neil it doesn t have to be onsite it could be virtual like an on demand training just like we have on demand streaming of tv you engage when you want but the cpgs are really leaning on the oems to do this for new technology they need help with that too obviously these machines are getting more sophisticated more complicated more integrated they need help dealing with that so there s going to be opportunity to be there and have hands on help i think sean last time i was on the podcast with you we talked about oems getting creative and coming to the tables with some new services maybe it sounds farfetched at the time but if you can make a business case for it the cpg will say sure let s try it and you just might have a new revenue stream i ll circle back to the conversation about tom morrison talking about taking advantage of the marketplace disruption set your sights where you want to be in five to ten years and then figure out how to get there riley if we ve heard it once we ve heard it a million times about it needs to be a partnership with you and oems and cpgs it needs to be more than just a one off buying a machine and then only talking to them when you need maintenance or something like that it needs to evolve as we ve all had to evolve through this again citing what he just said about the market disruption if there is this disruption we have to get through it together because if you try to get through it on your own you re not going to know what everybody else is doing and if other people are getting through it together you re going to fall behind that s why he basically said it is an opportunity to have a competitive advantage neil yep it is riley we ve talked longer than we should have which usually happens when you and i start talking about this which is great to wrap up is there anything else that you want to get out there that you can share neil honestly the takeaway for me as i m looking at this research from deloitte and from mckinsey and just scanning the manufacturing landscape and talking to people i think that we re so focused on the digital transformation and we re not looking closely enough at how that impacts the workforce we re not going to replace people with automation people are going to be working side by side with robots there s going to be some great new job opportunities out there but organizations have to be more flexible neil just like cpgs are asking oems to be more flexible with machines organizations have to be more flexible they have to be more empathetic to the fact that the pandemic really did a number on a lot of people they have to be flexible with their work hours and making sure they have maybe a hybrid workload for these moms that are worried about what are they going to do they can t get back to work because maybe they have childcare issues there s a lot that has to be addressed moving forward and i think we can do it riley the interesting thing again you say that is we are for the most part at least in the packaging end and with a lot of the food and the beverage and things like that and especially food processing did pretty well from a dollars and cents point of view throughout this pandemic because some businesses unfortunately yes were lost but for the most part as a whole these are all things that people needed every day as an industry it thrived while the workers may have been suffering that is like you said there needs to be some empathy involved to bring that around where you guys did pretty good during this so now you might want to take that into consideration when you re working things out with the workforce that has helped you profit from this neil absolutely riley is there

translation of those sales into significant earnings growth for our shareholders said randall white president and ceo this quarter s results reflect the positive impacts from several strategic changes that were made during our fourth quarter last year we restructured our freight contract with our small package carrier to reduce price increases and increased the minimum charges on customer orders to further offset our overall net shipping costs on each package these changes along with increased discounts and rebates on longer print runs with our publishers have driven increased profitability for the quarter we expect continued profitability from these changes and other future strategic improvements to further drive shareholder returns commented mr white net revenues for the direct sales division usborne books more ubam totaled 37 6 million for the fiscal first quarter ended may 31 2021 an increase of 1 9 from 36 9 million for the same quarter a year ago this increase in revenues over the same quarter last year is especially relevant as the 36 9 million for quarter ended may 31st 2020 was the company s largest revenue quarter at that time and reflected an increase of 41 8 over the quarter ended may 31st 2019 also last year s record quarter was achieved during the covid 19 pandemic which suffered approximately 8 million in lost revenues from school book fairs and booth sales due to closures we estimate the combined missed revenues from these two sales streams exceeded 30 million for the year ended february 28 2021 the company is confident that revenues from these two channels are returning during this fiscal year as restrictions are lifted from schools and group gatherings net revenues in the publishing division increased 128 6 to 3 2 million for the fiscal first quarter ended may 31 2021 from 1 4 million for the same quarter a year ago the publishing divisions gross sales grew by over 132 3 reflecting the resurgence of increased sales through retail stores per mr white during the first and second quarters last year we saw an increase in demand for our products from parents needing additional content in the home this increased demand resulted in unusually large sales volumes for what are not typically our largest quarters of the year due to the seasonal nature of our business the increase in revenues over the first quarter last year indicates that this increase in usborne books more is sales consultant driven rather than driven by the issues associated with the covid 19 pandemic mr white concluded the company has a strong financial position and is and expects an increase in revenues and profitability for the fiscal year ending february 28 2022 once again the board approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0 10 per share which will be paid on or

gates are giving themselves a two year trial period to see if they can co parent their multibillion dollar charitable foundation baby when the couple announced their divorce two months ago they said they would both stay on as co chairs of the gates foundation which they set up together more than 20 years ago but on wednesday the foundation s ceo announced a contingency plan to ensure the continuity of the foundation s work that s a nice way of saying they realize the capital t truth that working with one s ex is an exceptionally terrible idea here s the deal they ll try running this thing in parallel for a bit but if they can t stand it bill will essentially buy melinda out so that she can do her own philanthropic work she would receive personal resources from her ex husband resources that would be completely separate from the foundation s endowment the foundation s ceo said why it matters the gates foundation is one of the world s largest charities and it s given away more than 55 billion much of it from the gateses personal wealth to a wide range of initiatives related to global health poverty alleviation and more recently the global rollout of covid 19 vaccines but its reputation has been under scrutiny since the couple announced their divorce in may soon after media reports emerged about bill gates alleged improper behavior with microsoft employees decades

immediately install an update after security researchers found a serious vulnerability in the operating system the security flaw is called printnightmare not to put too fine a point on it and affects the windows print spooler service basically the thing that manages computers access to printers and lets you keep working while the printer does its thing hilariously the main reason we know about the flaw is because a bunch of researchers at cybersecurity company sangfor accidentally published a how to guide for exploiting it whoops the vulnerability could allow hackers to install programs view and delete data or even create new user accounts with full user rights in other words they could do a bunch of damage again this is yet another security headache from microsoft last year the nsa alerted microsoft to a major windows flaw that could let hackers pose as legitimate software companies earlier this year hundreds of thousands of exchange users were targeted after four
