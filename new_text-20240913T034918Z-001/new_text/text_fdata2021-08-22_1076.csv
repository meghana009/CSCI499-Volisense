here s what you need to remember in the 1990s israel developed an innovative new rifle designed specifically for the urban middle eastern battlefield a compact weapon that moved freely indoors the tavor was one of the few so called bullpup assault rifle designs to enter service with a modern military force the unique design of bullpup weapons allows them to have a shorter overall length but the design comes at a cost the 1990s saw a fundamental change in the nature of israel s wars the first palestinian intifada protests in the israeli occupied west bank and gaza strip ran from 1987 and 1993 the first intifada was in many ways an insurgency with nearly three hundred israeli and approximately two thousand palestinians killed over the span of six years the israeli army was at the forefront of israel s response but found itself somewhat unprepared for the dense urban battlefields of the first intifada although the israeli army had fought in urban terrain before most notably in the 1967 six day war and the 1982 invasion of lebanon this was different the six year campaign was almost entirely conducted in urban terrain on israeli territory and required israeli defense forces idf forces to repeatedly enter mosques homes and other buildings often on a daily basis most modern assault rifles are often owing to their overall length ill suited for urban operations assault rifles that are shouldered in order to use iron or optical sights for precise fire can easily run into walls doorways and other objects slowing their use and rendering the user vulnerable the m16a1 assault rifle is 38 81 inches long meaning soldiers must take care to avoid getting hung up on objects in their path while at the same time anticipating contact with the enemy one way to make a weapon more indoor friendly is to shorten the barrel length this has the unfortunate side effect of increasing muzzle flash gunshot noise and perhaps most importantly shortening a firearm s effective range this is not advantageous for a country that could find itself fighting in both cities and deserts fortunately for israel there was one firearm design that offered the best of both worlds the bullpup bullpup rifles are designed with the weapon s action far to the rear and the magazine behind the trigger this places the action near or even in the stock of the rifle greatly shortening the weapon s overall length this method allows full length or near full length rifle barrels israeli military industries began working on a new infantry weapon in 1991 and by 1998 was field testing working prototypes the tavor went through two years of field trials before being adopted by the idf in 2003 and it replaced the m16a1 and galil assault rifles across the israeli armed services the tavor has since participated in a number of wars and minor actions including the 2006 lebanon war 2008 2009 gaza war 2012 s operation pillar of defense and operation protective edge in 2014 the tavor uses the long stroke piston operated system common to many modern assault rifles including the ak 47 and israeli galil the tavor encloses the barreled action in a one piece polymer chassis including pistol grip and handguard this results in a durable weapon that can take abuse the tavor has fold down post sights but is normally expected to be used in conjunction with an optic typically the meprolight mepro m21 sight tavor has an overall length of 28 35 inches making it more than ten inches shorter than the m16a1 at the same time it had a barrel length of 18 5 inches just 1 5 inches shorter than the m16a1 the tavor weighed just 7 21 pounds with iron sights slightly less than the m16a1 and fired up to 800 rounds per minute using nato standard 5 56 millimeter magazines in the early 2010s the idf began purchasing an even smaller more compact weapon the tavor x95 the x95 weighs just six pounds has an overall length of 22 8 inches and a 13 inch barrel the tavor s bullpup design is not without its flaws bullpup weapons cannot adjust their length of pull meaning soldiers with long or short arms may find them less than ergonomically ideal bullpups are also not friendly to left handed shooters as the ejection port is right where a left handed user s face would be aiming down sights finally as one american reviewer noted the tavor s design means the weapon s weight is concentrated to the rear making it in his opinion ungainly despite these shortcomings israeli forces are apparently satisfied with the tavor and the gun has achieved limited success in the export market to countries such as thailand and india while not every country is willing to commit to the controversial bullpup platform the deployment of the even shorter x95 represents a doubling down by the idf on the concept israel will probably field the compact lethal assault rifles for decades to come kyle mizokami is a defense and national security writer based in san francisco who has appeared in the diplomat foreign policy

in 2019 the last normal year on earth simon kennedy went to guantanamo bay detention camp in cuba and stared into the soul of one of the men who murdered his mother he found nothing there kennedy s mum yvonne was just 63 when she boarded a plane from washington dc to los angeles it was the morning of september 11 2001 yvonne was supposed to be on a dream trip celebrating her retirement instead american airlines flight 77 was ploughed into the pentagon by the same group of terrorists who flew two planes into new york s twin towers at the world trade center and crashed another into a field in pennsylvania picture paul suesse it s a cliché to say that the world changed for everyone that horrible day but for kennedy it changed intimately immediately and irreversibly he knew the flight his mother was on and so as he watched the news with horror alongside the rest of the world he knew she was gone he went numb but eventually all the shock and grief gave way to something else an almost missionary zeal to fight the anger and fear and hatred that are the natural responses to such a cruel and evil act this resolve was put to the ultimate test when kennedy finally laid eyes upon the terrorist who masterminded the attacks khalid shaikh mohammed as he faced pre trial hearings at the us naval base in cuba in 2019 i went to guantanamo bay kennedy tells stellar matter of factly it was in september just after the 18th anniversary through the glass of the courtroom in camp justice i actually got to eyeball khalid shaikh mohammed and the four other accused conspirators i was there with other 9 11 families from the us all at different stages of repair i guess and some i could see just feeling the hatred and being angry and i get that but i looked at and i felt some sort of pity for them i thought you ve done this to yourselves you ve hurt us but you ve achieved nothing and you re going to rot here probably die here i felt a humanity for these men who some might describe as monsters kennedy with his mother yvonne in 1998 it is an extraordinary act of grace for someone whose mother was taken so suddenly from him when he was just 26 but kennedy is quite an extraordinary man albeit in an extraordinarily mild mannered way after the attacks and as he still grieved his mother whom he was incredibly close to he set about trying to learn and understand more about islam and the middle east it was as though he was deliberately setting up a bulwark to stop any poisonous prejudice seeping in it s not that he forgives the men who killed his mother i m not sure if forgive is the right word for it he says and besides he notes wryly it s not as if the terrorists have actually asked for forgiveness but it s a determination to not hate and not just a pontificating virtue signalling commitment but one that s critical for his sanity and survival for me the more important thing than forgiveness is just not carrying hatred towards somebody he explains i think that s better for the world but it s also in a selfish way better for me and my family it s really bad for you to walk around in a bubbling rage and hate for someone i ve seen other people in my situation and i ve seen how it looks and i don t like it i don t want to be it kennedy who s a comedian by trade documented his attempts to navigate this voyage in his thoughtful 2014 book 9 11 and the art of happiness he also gives regular talks at schools to help kids learn how to cope with trauma now with the 20th anniversary of september 11 coming up his most private and personal moment of grief is again irrevocably chained to this most public and global moment in history it definitely doesn t feel like 20 years it feels like yesterday but it also feels like a long time ago it s all that and then some he tells stellar but i ve got to say that when you reach these landmark sort of anniversaries you do a lot of taking stock and go wow ok i was 26 years old when it happened and now i m 46 i ve got more skills to cope with it than i did back then i m a very different person and i can process it all i m also a father and i look at the world very differently because of that kennedy and his wife tahnee have two children daughter adelaide 13 and son fletcher 11 they live in a quiet middle class suburb in sydney almost a different universe to the violent geopolitical and ideological struggle that took his mum he wishes he could ask his mother s advice on raising them ask her questions about his own childhood but most of all he just wishes his children knew their grandmother i talk about her and she s an abstract concept to them i suppose he says quietly that s the saddest part but kennedy still draws strength from her and it s an almost limitless well his father barry died of a heart attack when he was young leaving yvonne to raise him and his brother leigh simon kennedy features in this sunday s stellar and throughout all that she was tirelessly dedicated to helping others through more than three decades of service to the australian red cross both as a volunteer and staff member even today kennedy often uses the red cross guiding principle of humanity as a touchstone she was very well travelled and she was well aware of what the world had to offer good and bad he says but she was also very pragmatic very practical and so what would his mum tell him if she were there to guide him through his darkest days just get on with it kennedy says with a smile we ve got to get on with it an updated edition of simon kennedy s book 9 11 and the art of happiness which includes his trip to guantanamo bay is available at amazon com au originally published as 20 years ago australian comedian simon kennedy lost his mum in 9 11
tropical storm henri socked the northeast with strong winds as it made landfall sunday on the coast of rhode island and sent lashing bands of rain westward knocking out power to over 140 000 homes and causing deluges that closed bridges swamped roads and left some people stranded in their vehicles the storm was downgraded from a hurricane before reaching new england leaving many to breathe a sigh of relief but the national hurricane center warned the slow moving storm would continue dumping heavy rains on wide swaths of the region well beyond the weekend over two days heavy sustained rains flooded areas as far southwest as new jersey even as it took on tropical depression status the storm threatened to stall near the new york connecticut border overnight before pivoting east and moving out toward the atlantic ocean on monday some of the highest rain totals were expected inland there were few early reports of major coastal damage due to wind or surf president joe biden on sunday promised to provide federal help to the residents of affected states the president declared disasters in much of the region opening the purse strings for federal recovery aid biden earlier had offered his condolences to the people of tennessee after severe flooding from an unrelated storm killed at least 22 including young children and elderly people and left dozens of others missing when it made landfall near westerly rhode island henri had sustained winds of about 60 mph and gusts of up to 70 mph according to the national hurricane center by late sunday henri had sustained winds of about 30 mph 48 kph as it moved across connecticut toward the new york state line some of the worst rain arrived well before the storm s center in helmetta new jersey some 200 residents fled for higher ground taking refuge in hotels or with friends and family as floodwaters inundated their homes it came so quick in the blink of an eye said the town s mayor christopher slavicek whose parents were spending the night after fleeing their home now there s clean up so this is far from over the mayor said some communities in central new jersey were inundated with as much as 8 inches 20 centimeters of rain by midday sunday in jamesburg television video footage showed flooded downtown streets and cars almost completely submerged in newark public safety director brian o hara said police and firefighters rescued 86 people in 11 incidents related to the storm he said significant flooding led to multiple vehicles submerged in flooded areas this could have been a lot worse particularly as it relates to wind new jersey gov phil murphy said sunday evening connecticut gov ned lamont said henri was close to being in the rear view mirror but said there s still more work to do even as mandatory evacuations were being lifted in some communities about 250 residents from four nursing homes on the shoreline had to be relocated to other nursing homes several major bridges in rhode island which stitch together much of the state were briefly shuttered sunday and some coastal roads were nearly impassable in newport paul and cherie saunders rode out the storm in a home that her family has owned since the late 1950s their basement flooded with 5 feet of water during superstorm sandy nine years ago this house has been through so many hurricanes and so many things have happened said cherie saunders 68 we re just going to wait and see what happens rhode island has been hit by hurricanes and tropical storms periodically including superstorm sandy in 2012 irene in 2011 and hurricane bob in 1991 the city of providence sustained so much flooding damage from a hurricane in 1938 and hurricane carol in 1954 that it built a hurricane barrier in the 1960s to protect its downtown from a storm surge coming up narragansett bay that barrier and newer gates built nearby were closed for hours sunday before reopening the national weather service recorded what could be the wettest hour ever in central park with 1 94 inches of torrential rainfall pelting the park between 10 p m and 11 p m saturday earlier in the evening thousands attending a homecoming concert at the park were forced to disperse because of heavy rainfall after passing back through new england and sweeping out into the atlantic over the next couple of days the hurricane center predicted henri will lose its identity until then areas from northeast pennsylvania through new england braced for heavy rains marshall shepherd director of the atmospheric sciences program at the university of georgia and former president of the american meteorological society said henri was reminiscent in some ways of hurricane harvey a slow moving storm that decimated the houston area in 2017 to the west side of the storm you have a banding feature that has literally been stationary sitting there and dumping rain that will be a significant hazard for the new york and new jersey area shepherd said after tropical storm irene roared up the coast in august 2011 many were relieved when the new york city area largely was spared but then the storm settled over the green mountains and irene became the biggest natural disaster to hit vermont since an epic 1927 flood parts of the state got 11 inches of rain in just 24 hours irene killed six in vermont left thousands homeless and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway i remember irene and media outlets outside vermont brushing it aside as if no big deal while it hit vermont robert welch a podcaster tweeted sunday i ll relax when i see it at sea on radar in one of his final appearances as governor before he is set to step down at the end of monday over a sexual harassment scandal new york gov andrew cuomo said the state s primary concern were inland areas like the hudson river valley north of new york city which was projected to get inches of rain over the next few days in the hudson valley you have hills you have creeks the water comes running down those hills and turns a creek into a ravaging river cuomo said major airports in the region remained open as the storm approached though hundreds of sunday s flights were canceled service on some branches of new york city s commuter rail system was suspended through sunday as was amtrak service between new york and boston power outages affected power to 130 000 homes across rhode

plight in herat gunfire outside scared children inside they are afraid of the intruders on motorbikes with long beards and carbines the darwaza malik square in herat with the taliban flag on thursday file picture sudeshna banerjee hiding in his home in herat with his small children haider abdullah name changed on request prays that the gunshots do not resume my children are scared there was such terrible sound of weapons outside that they did not come out for three days the afghan liver transplant patient in his mid 30s said when the telegraph called him on friday abdullah is one of the several afghan patients whose treatment was done in india advertisement they are scared of the intruders on motorbikes with long beards and carbines it had been over a week since herat afghanistan s third largest city had fallen to the taliban it happened on thursday august 12 evening they entered on motorbikes there were clashes everywhere on the main road near our house since then abdullah an employee of a humanitarian organisation has not ventured into the city abdullah has been instrumental in tracing the forced marriage of underage girls or widows in taliban controlled areas if i go into the city i might get recognised abdullah has deleted his facebook account the biggest source of his insecurity is that it s no longer possible to know who is police who is army and who is taliban all are with guns using motorbikes or former military vehicles the anxiety of not knowing who to trust is so deep that abdullah mentions this three times during the one hour conversation all businessmen and government employees are in hiding or have escaped to iran or elsewhere my friends who worked with the embassies reached kabul on wednesday and are awaiting evacuation the economic situation is dire exports and imports have stopped prices are rising the exchange rate for the us dollar has shot up to 83 84 afghanis a month ago it was 67 68 afghanis abdullah does his shopping in his immediate neighbourhood on the city s outskirts in the city there was taliban everywhere it was frightening the taliban s numbers have reduced since muharram after the taliban governor instructed the soldiers to return to their villages they are present only in the town squares now abdullah said he deeply resents pakistan when the clashes started between the government and the taliban the pakistan borders were open local people got evidence of an inflow of pakistanis in afghan clothes he said these former commandos of the pakistani army provided leadership to the taliban we saw that in herat they often got lost as they didn t know the local roads many of them were killed by the government forces the government posted some of their faces on social media with proof of their identity but the world never paid attention abdullah flared up at the suggestion that the local army had caved in easily when the taliban started entering the army went back to their base about 10km outside the city near the airport and kept asking for instructions he said i was in touch with people across the city and men in the national army with pakistanis getting in it was not an internal matter and they wanted to fight but the government leadership was weak they did not let them launch an operation abdullah believes that herat may not have fallen had the army been allowed to act our army is very well equipped there were 8 000 10 000 of them against 500 taliban in each area only five to 10 motorbikes had entered carrying two taliban each but the police were few and did not resist herat fell in two hours he said bitterness apparent in his voice abdullah thinks the taliban and pakistan exerted influence on the political leadership the politicians are rich people their families live in foreign countries and they have already fled there what is it to them the taliban families also live in pakistan it s we the poor who are stuck in our land and suffer he said a local warlord ismail khan had tried to resist there were uprisings against the taliban in many areas but lacked leadership abdullah said in herat ismail khan collected his former commandos and tried to build resistance but he was not supported by the local government the taliban too sent him a message saying he would not be detained or harmed but he should not fight abdullah sees no hope of us action all of us feel this was political play with the afghan people they had a deal in secret in doha the americans the taliban and pakistan he pointed to the water issue with pakistan all our rivers flow into pakistan if we have a strong government we will stop the water there is also the border issue so they do not want peace in our country he said also we import a lot of pakistani goods a strong government will make those things locally and stop import where will imran khan the pakistani prime minister sell his goods then neither does he trust the taliban to work for the country s good they are under the influence of the pakistani intelligence service they transferred to pakistan all the army tanks given by foreign countries the army also had modern guns like the m4 and the m16 donated by the us the taliban looted the military bases and are just selling the guns everybody has a gun now abdullah said the army men are angry that they could not fight they are hiding and living in uncertainty they have not been recalled by the taliban they don t have a future they were trained for 20 years now nobody values them afghanistan vice president amrullah saleh has laid claim to the presidency in president ashraf ghani s absence but abdullah does not want any internal fighting saleh has gone back to panjshir to start a resistance this will lead to internal fighting and harm civilians we will be back where we were 20 years ago there will be no development instead the taliban should give all parties a share in power the schools reopened on thursday the taliban have said girls can wear decent clothes and attend school abdullah said he took his boys to school they passed an exam girls have to wear a hijab it has been ruled though the burqa is not mandatory nor can women work in humanitarian organisations all such international organisations have asked their female staff to stay home donors who were supporting these organisations are not interested in a restart they are waiting for a government to be formed but the taliban are not recognised by the international community abdullah said this also means he is jobless now other than my wife and children i support the niece who donated me her liver i m the sole earning member as a liver transplant patient abdullah needs protection against covid 19 when he steps out he also needs his medicines from india these expensive medicines are not sold in afghanistan this is why his surgeon ramdip ray who is now based in calcutta the operation was done in another indian city sent him a text message asking if he had medicines in stock my afghan patients depend on their india trips for check ups and medicines it will be terrible if they cannot travel although my male patients responded i failed to connect with a lady in mazar e sharif and am worried dr ray said abdullah wants to visit in december which is when his medicines will run out but i need the indian embassy to reopen to get my visa everything is uncertain he said

anna turner s family moved from hugo to oakdale in july hoping to find a melting pot as she and her daughter perused stands selling hair bows and vegetables at the oakdale farmers market on wednesday she said they found what they were looking for here turner who is white and whose husband is african american said they landed in a diverse neighborhood with more amenities and one where they finally secured a home after being outbid on nine other properties a couple of stalls down oscar hernández sold burritos and tortas from his taqueria los paisanos food truck and reflected on his changing community i ve been living here for almost 18 years and i can see how the population has more diversity said hernández there s more asian people around more hispanic people all different cultures oakdale is among a cluster of suburbs north and east of st paul that have seen some of the biggest jumps in diversity in the metro area according to new census data but racial and ethnic diversity have not climbed just around the twin cities over the past decade the percentage of people who identified as a race other than white increased in every region of the state from farm country along the iowa border to small towns hugging the north shore nearly a quarter of minnesotans are black indigenous or a person of color compared with just 10 of the state s population in 2000 minority residents accounted for all of the state s growth over the past decade as the number of non hispanic white residents decreased for the first time ever a change that may be due in part to more people identifying as multiracial some cities and counties are diversifying much faster than others suburbs like maplewood north st paul landfall and oakdale saw some of the biggest metro increases in their diversity index scores that index measures the likelihood that two randomly selected people from a community would be different races and ethnicities maplewood mayor marylee abrams said that in her 2 ½ decades living in the city she has seen examples of increasing diversity everywhere everywhere in the local school district two thirds of students identified as a race other than white or two or more races at the maplewood mall the number of businesses owned by people of color has climbed city leaders and local vendors and shoppers at the oakdale farmers market listed many of the same reasons that more people of color are living in the area including good schools proximity to family and as abrams described very attractive affordable housing opportunities here on the east side that they may not have been able to find in minneapolis and st paul but even more than the northern metro waite park saw the highest jump in its diversity index score the st cloud suburb went from 18 nonwhite in 2010 to 42 in 2020 st cloud also saw a major boost in diversity with its population of color doubling to 32 about half of waite park s housing stock is multifamily units and that housing appeals to many families of color along with the city s retail commercial and industrial presence and many minority owned businesses city administrator shaunna johnson said an influx of somali immigrants and somali americans accounts for much of the change in st cloud and waite park said political science associate professor pedro dos santos who is on the board of unitecloud an organization aimed at resolving tensions around racial religious and other differences his family moved to st cloud four years ago from a small town in iowa the city s increasing diversity was part of what drew him to a job there said dos santos a brazilian immigrant who said he wanted his children to see there s different ways of being a kid and growing up there are growing pains that happen when there s demographic changes he said of his community i moved here knowing that there are problems but excited that these are actually problems that have solutions and eventually will get better because people will realize they just have to live with each other in the southwest corner of the state nobles county home to worthington saw the biggest percentage jump of any county in its nonwhite population county commissioner gene metz said the area started to change with an influx of southeast asian refugees after the vietnam war and now many hispanic and karen immigrants are moving to nobles county the local meatpacking industry has expanded over the past 10 years continuing to draw workers along with other farm and construction work metz said the number of different languages and dialects spoken at meatpacking plants and schools has created challenges he said but we would not survive without it he said because the labor force we need to keep our farm economy robust depends on it while census data show diversity climbing experts say communities of color have historically been undercounted and 2020 was likely no exception minnesota had the country s highest census response rate at 75 helping it narrowly hang on to its eight congressional seats the highest in the nation yeah clap clap clap but guess who are the 25 that didn t do the self response people of color because of fear or people in rural areas too because of lack of connectivity to internet said mónica hurtado one of many people who urged historically undercounted communities to participate she almost did not get involved fearing it would lead to homeland security raids or deportations in the latino community but when she found out more about the data confidentiality and heard one key fact she changed her mind in 2010 she said there was a significant undercount in north minneapolis where she lives as a result she said the community lost out on millions of dollars in government funding something she wanted to ensure did not happen again hurtado who s from colombia looked into her ancestry and found she was indigenous and european she was among a growing number of people across the nation who noted they are more than one race in their census form minnesota saw the number of people who described themselves as multiracial climb from 1 of the population in 2000 to 2 a decade later it s now at 4 i see the number of multiple race people and i think those people were there we haven t had a huge baby boom said carolyn liebler an associate professor of sociology at the university of minnesota but she said heightened racial awareness after george floyd s killing may have changed things people who were identifying as white the thing about the 2020 moment made it so they decided to report their multiple races liebler said fewer people identifying solely as white likely contributed to the number of white non hispanic minnesotans declining slightly for the first time the census bureau also provided people with more space to describe their race minnesota remains significantly less diverse than the nation as a whole but of the 25 most populous metro areas in the u s metropolitan council researchers said the twin cities was 10th highest in percentage growth of people of color racial minorities made up the majority of residents in 17 cities statewide with populations of 500 or greater including st paul and pelican rapids and in the metro area alone there are 24 cities where the majority of children are black indigenous or people of color said met council research manager joel huting overall the region s youth or people under 18 are 46 bipoc huting said if you want to know what the future is going to look like look to the youth data editor maryjo webster contributed to this report jessie van berkel 651 925

here s everything to know about this weekend s weather that s tropical in name but far from its titular home huh a hurricane is hitting new england maybe rare tropical weather is making its way up off the atlantic coast of the u s destined for new york and new england two regions that don t often play host to tropical storms who is henri who is bob get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters a stormy pair henri is the tropical storm that s expected to strengthen into a hurricane and perhaps become new england s first in 30 years bob was its predecessor responsible for the deaths of 17 and 1 5 billion in damages in august 1991 these storms have human names courtesy the world meteorological association which draws up a list of 21 names for each atlantic hurricane season which areas is henri supposed to affect right now it s looking like new york s long island and southern new england particularly connecticut if it makes landfall in new york that would be the first time the state s sustained a direct hit during a hurricane season since 2012 s superstorm sandy the effects of which are still plaguing new york so what are the conditions needed for an henri or bob there are two ingredients needed for a storm to track this far up north a tropical system itself and steering currents most tropical systems in the northern hemisphere run out or recur before they can make their way north according to the national weather service ok so this is pretty rare is henri s path connected to climate change no perhaps surprisingly it s just a tropical weather phenomenon the national weather service says we shouldn t necessarily expect to see more frequent new england tropical storms what do people need to do to prepare for henri this isn t new england or new york s first rodeo with weather writ large after all a nor easter is just a hurricane with a boston accent it s not too different in the long island dialect either so the usual protocols apply get boats out of the water gas up cars stock the pantry and batten down the hatches be prepared for power outages too we re in the dog days of august are there still tourists on the atlantic coast oh yes school is back in session in parts of the east coast but there are still thousands of tourists enjoying the beaches of cape cod the hamptons and elsewhere is henri a fast or slow moving storm henri isn t winning any races its slow churn could be a good thing increasing the chance it will falter quickly but it could also mean a lot of concentrated rain it s the first time since hurricane irene in 2011 that a hurricane watch has been issued for parts of the tri state nhc said nbc new york s pei sze cheng and lynda baquero reports wait was hurricane bob the same as the perfect storm nope though both storms were in 1991 the so called perfect storm also known as the halloween storm hit new england about two months later it started as a nor easter in which form it inflicted the most damage a hurricane eventually formed at its center but it purposely went unnamed because meteorologists worried it would be distracting say it had been named what would it have been known as henri seriously yep atlantic hurricane names are recycled every six years unless they re retired out of notoriety we re never going to see another hurricane named katrina or even bob again and the h name henri in 1991 was next on the list when the storm struck as tropical storm henri which could become a hurricane by saturday afternoon is expected to clip the far eastern reaches of long island the area is already making preps including clearing drains to prevent flooding and securing boats nbc new york s pei sze cheng reports so that movie isn t about bob correct the perfect storm was a 2000 movie starring george clooney and new england s own mark wahlberg based on a book of the same name by sebastian junger we re getting a little off topic here though ok you said henri is expected to be the first hurricane to hit new england in 30 years but what about irene irene was indeed tropical and a hurricane but by the time it ravaged vermont it was technically a tropical storm
photo credit rabbi david zahtz during a regular year the summer months are a whirlwind of activity for students preparing for a year in israel yeshiva boys arrange dirahs apartments and chavrusahs seminary girls shop for clothes and stock up on american tissue boxes their frantic parents meanwhile navigate the legal maze of passport renewal and entry permits this year however is no regular year compounding the usual flurry of preparation that goes with sending a teenager abroad is an entirely new phenomenon the vaccine rush not only must incoming students follow a complex set of covid guidelines but just a month before the rosh chodesh elul deadline the yeshiva and seminary coalition for bnai chul commonly known as the igud conveyed a firm ultimatum no recovery or vaccine no entry advertisement this slideshow requires javascript as per the state of israel s new laws the letter stated everyone entering the country must be vaccinated or recovered from corona rabbi nechemya malinowitz director of eretz hakodesh and founder of the igud explained that antibody results are not accepted due to the countless tests available when one standard unit is recognized antibodies may be enough to be fair the vaccine stipulation was not a total surprise although previous statements regarding the country s covid guidelines were vague incoming students knew to expect some form of a vaccine policy nevertheless for many the vaccine mandate was a drastic letdown students with high antibody counts yet without proof of exposure in the form of a positive pcr could not attend their programs unless they got the inoculation and quickly for rabbi reuven taragin dean of overseas students at yeshivat hakotel getting foreign students into israel has been challenging he says that the circumstances created extra work for yeshivas in terms of collecting documentation and arranging permits however the pressure on institutions was greatly mitigated by the tireless efforts of the igud founded by rabbi malinowitz the igud helps students gain entry to israel by serving as a political intermediary rabbi malinowitz says that the organization is unique in that it represents institutions from across the religious spectrum originally launched to give charedi schools a voice during covid 19 the igud quickly earned the trust of the israeli government who granted them the exclusive right to provide entry permits to students rabbi malinowitz admits that the development was unexpected previously institutions were required to follow covid guidelines but did not need to officially join the igud rabbi malinowitz believes that the change in policy was in response to the hefker environment last year in which any school could freely admit students with the new approach institutions must use the igud s portal and students need to submit a specific set of documents rabbi david zahtz director of the overseas program at yeshivat kerem b yavneh believes that the new protocol actually simplifies entry into israel having remained in business throughout covid rabbi zahtz is able to compare these guidelines to previous restrictions whereas last year s students struggled with last minute changes he says current expectations are clear cut rabbi taragin explains that the process of traveling to israel has two components the first is to obtain the documents necessary for boarding a plane such as a negative pcr within 72 hours of flight the second is the state s policy governing entry into israel which includes proof of vaccination or recovery as well as a serological test for antibodies upon arrival because yeshivat hakotel began before the rosh chodesh elul deadline students had a relatively easy time entering israel for future students though the process will include a week of quarantine kerem b yavneh likewise commenced before the cutoff date some almost missed it but israel s three day extension from sunday to wednesday enabled their entry without quarantine rabbi zahtz feels that the deadline was extended because of media pushback the government agreed to alter the date to accommodate the start of the new zman did the vaccine requirement pose an obstacle for kerem b yavneh rabbi zahtz says that the yeshiva anticipated the vaccine mandate long before guidelines for entry were finalized thus they were able to advise incoming students to submit their vaccination records in advance not everyone was so lucky with merely four weeks until d day nervous teenagers flocked to covid vaccination sites others debated their course of action ad nauseam pressing their luck until frighteningly close to the cutoff date blimi a high school graduate who asked that her last name not be used was in the second category her parents were initially concerned about the lack of vaccine related research after asking around they decided to proceed with vaccination this slideshow requires javascript people who needed it were getting it blimi said adding that in her community those with pressing circumstances were being inoculated apparently seminary attendance was considered pressing with merely four weeks left blimi received the moderna vaccine she will receive her second dose exactly ten days before departing for israel gavriel chasky a second year student at yeshivat hakotel was among the first group to receive the vaccine at his institution having no previous exposure to covid he experienced two long periods of quarantine the second of which he describes as draconian and pretty brutal as such he had no qualms about taking the vaccine which he viewed as an opportunity how does blimi feel about the israeli vaccine mandate her initial reaction was dismay i think it s communism she joked after mulling it over though she understood the necessity of the requirement that s not to say that it hasn t been an overwhelming decision process what prompted the onslaught of last minute covid guidelines rabbi taragin says that the stricter rules were in reaction to the new variant that is circulating maybe people should fly el al and then we won t have the delta strain he quipped in a statement to the jewish press eyal carlin tourism commissioner to north america in israel s tourism ministry shed light on israel s border policy the decision to mandate proof of recovery or vaccination was influenced by the similar policies of neighboring countries he explained when pressed as to why immunized foreigners require further pcr and antibody testing he responded that the additional tests are merely a measure of caution as there is no formal method to verify overseas vaccination the testing is a means of ensuring that the documents are legitimate rabbi taragin supports the government s approach although he s aware that there are students who are reluctant to inoculate his student body is generally pro vaccination he feels that halacha follows the prevalent medical opinion which is to get vaccinated despite this view the vaccine mandate has posed a dilemma for some and an obstacle for others bina roth a prospective student of bnos chava seminary was one of the lucky ones having received a positive pcr earlier this year she was able to complete her application process relatively quickly she possesses antibodies and will quarantine upon arrival not everyone finds the decision so straightforward however roth says her good friend got vaccinated despite her reluctance and that others won t be attending seminary because of the vaccination requirement when asked whether she would have taken the vaccine if not for the positive pcr roth admitted that she likely would have for now though she prefers to wait i don t know enough about it she explained i m not a doctor this approach has been echoed by other applicants the parent of a potential student who prefers to remain anonymous says that her daughter likely won t be going to seminary despite acceptance to bnos jacob jerusalem a competitive program she is quick to clarify that she is not an anti vaxxer but due to the limited research regarding the covid vaccine she prefers to take a passive approach following religious guidance not to put oneself in unnecessary danger does she feel that the vaccine is dangerous good things don t have to be forced the parent responded she feels that the national and media pressure where the vaccine is concerned is a red flag patients have the right to make uninfluenced decisions she said carlin agrees in his statement he emphasized that the vaccination requirement is completely voluntary non israeli travelers always have the option of postponing or canceling plans to visit israel if they feel the vaccination requirement is something they can t comply with he said the guidelines for entry to israel are transparent and those who feel reluctant to vaccinate are entitled not to do so and to stay home carlin says that the tourism ministry doesn t expect these guidelines to severely impact the number of incoming students although the past year saw a drop in seminary and yeshiva attendance he estimates that the number will increase for the following year indeed rabbi malinowitz says that 7 000 students have already arrived and thousands more are expected not all institutions are filled to capacity however according to shayna katz head of admissions at neve yerushalayim the covid guidelines have impacted neve greatly ordinarily participants can attend at their own convenience with the new requirements many applicants have been forced to withdraw because of the lengthy legal process overwhelming to anyone the process of enrolling in seminary can be especially daunting for newcomers to judaism on a lighter note rabbi taragin says that current concerns that the government might close its borders due to rising covid cases are baseless he foresees no immediate closure on the contrary rabbi taragin predicts that the past year s challenges will have strengthened students ability to overcome obstacles indeed chasky notes that the pandemic really made our year more serious rabbi taragin anticipates an even more powerful year of learning noting that being in israel during such a time is a privilege not to be taken for granted rabbi malinowitz adds that he has received a lot of positive feedback for his work with the igud he hopes that the igud will continue to support incoming students in the future whether with insurances army exemptions student visas or funding he feels that the message of the endeavor is that when everyone works together unbelievable things can happen
for years the sage of omaha has been the king of investors but has his crown slipped revealed how 186 funds are even better than warren buffett for decades berkshire hathaway the conglomerate run by the sage of omaha warren buffett has been the benchmark for successful investing buffett the world s seventh richest person is courted by politicians economists and most of all investors of all levels for his pearls of often witty wisdom but what s this it seems that the sage may not be the undisputed investment king that many of us had believed in fact wealth manager aj bell has found 186 investment funds and stock market listed investment trusts of various types and sizes that have returned more than buffett s investment business berkshire hathaway since 2001 five fund managers including one investing duo who have been at the helm of their respective funds over this entire period have performed better than buffett what is warren buffett s secret since 1964 when buffett became a majority owner berkshire hathaway has delivered an extraordinary return of 2 810 526 per cent to investors that means 100 invested at the time would now be worth 5 724 854 taking into account the fall in the value of the pound by comparison 100 invested in an index of the 500 biggest us companies would now be worth 47 976 buffett s strategy has been remarkably simple he buys good companies at a fair price and holds on to them over the long term rob morgan analyst at investment platform charles stanley says hold great companies forever is the overarching philosophy that tends to stand investors in very good stead economic historian john butler adds that buffett s investment style is very unsexy but is the only one that has proven to work through multiple economic cycles famously buffett has always sought relatively safe industries with steady revenues that generally have high dividend yields that occupy leading positions in what are generally mature and established industries says butler although consistent buffett hasn t been scared to adapt his investing style over the years when necessary when he started out he invested in companies that were on the rocks and sold up when their share prices improved however he now also invests in companies that may not look cheap but could still have a long way to run laith khalaf analyst at aj bell says he now combines growth and value in his approach which he sees as two sides of the same coin for example recently he s taken a big position in apple which is hardly a value stock investment styles that beat buffett most of the 186 funds and trusts that have outstripped buffett over 20 years invest in small companies emerging markets or specialist themes you would expect these to produce high returns because they are risky investments and investors need to be compensated for taking a chance by comparison buffett s genius is the way he has produced consistently high returns while investing in solid companies that are unlikely to be very volatile no investment is ever risk free but the types of blue chip firms buffett invests in are likely to perform in all kinds of environments the comparison with funds and investment trusts is not perfect as berkshire hathaway doesn t quite fit into either category jason hollands a director of wealth manager tilney smith williamson explains while warren buffett is revered as the world s most famous investor berkshire hathaway is a multinational conglomerate with an extensive range of subsidiaries across a variety of industries these range from battery firm duracell to restaurant group international dairy queen and american freight railroad bnsf it also owns a number of insurance businesses and has significant minority stakes in a portfolio of companies such as bank of america american express and coca cola managers who have eclipsed buffett of the funds and trusts that have outperformed buffett four have managers who have been at the helm throughout the entire 20 year period and can therefore be said to have gone head to head with buffett and come out on top the most successful is scottish mortgage trust which james anderson has run since 2000 and has built a reputation for picking out the most promising growth companies tech stocks such as tesla amazon and alibaba have been particularly rewarding investments anderson will be leaving scottish mortgage next year but his fellow managers tom slater and lawrence burns will continue with the same investment philosophy an investment of 1 000 in 2001 would now be worth 24 688 next up are investment trusts lindsell train investment trust and finsbury growth income trust which are run by nick train and michael lindsell the duo s success is down to investing in durable cash generative businesses their philosophy is much closer to buffett s says morgan it s about holding great companies forever they have a lot of consumer staples that are huge companies such as kraft foods heineken and mondelez the idea with stalwarts like these is that nobody stops buying beer and sweets in a recession a 1 000 investment in lindsell train investment trust and finsbury growth income in 2001 would now be worth 18 131 and 8 519 respectively alexander darwall has run devon equity management european opportunities since 2000 and has turned 1 000 into 10 693 over the past 20 years he invests in companies across the uk and europe with strong balance sheets and low levels of debt and which have the resilience to prosper no matter what economic conditions prevail max ward has been running independent investment trust since 2000 and invests where he sees opportunities in any sector or country he ran scottish mortgage investment trust from 1989 to 2000 before james anderson took over ward has been a long term backer of uk housebuilding stocks but has also embraced technology a 1 000 investment in 2001 would now be worth 8 286 khalaf adds that just because these fund managers have performed well over a long period doesn t mean they are guaranteed to continue doing so however he believes they have to be credited with having excellent skills you have some managers here who have been performing very well for 20 years he says inevitably they will have some luck but you have to be a very fanatical disciple of passive investing to suggest that having outperformed for two decades they haven t exercised remarkable skill
blackrock greater europe investment trust top managers scour europe for hidden gems european shares are considered undervalued by many investment experts but it hasn t prevented some europe focused fund managers from generating strong returns through astute stock picking two stock market listed european investment trusts stand apart from their rivals baillie gifford european growth has achieved returns of 150 per cent over the past five years from a concentrated portfolio of companies that the edinburgh based managers have identified as well run growth businesses but the pick of the bunch is blackrock greater europe a 633million trust that has delivered a five year return of 162 per cent the trust has a number of twists that make it different foremost is the ability to hunt down companies in emerging european countries such as greece israel poland and russia which represent value for money in share price terms and are fast growing but its overarching modus operandi is identifying companies that are run by top grade management teams and have the ability to generate high returns and then holding them long term stefan gries portfolio manager says we like to find exceptional companies early in their journey businesses infused with the right management culture then as holders of these businesses shares we want to behave as owners not traders and make long term returns the result is a portfolio comprised of just 39 holdings businesses that are not dependent upon the health of the european economy but have a specialism that gives them pricing power in the markets they operate in leading to healthy profits and strong share price performance a classic example is switzerland listed lonza a pharmaceuticals and biotechnology company with production facilities across europe north america and south east asia we invested in the company in 2015 and it s now our third largest holding says gries quite early on in the pandemic it signed a deal with us biotech company moderna to manufacture its coronavirus vaccine given its strong market position it was also able to secure funding from its clients for more production capacity over the past year lonza s share price has risen by 36 per cent the trust s biggest sector position is in technology stocks 26 per cent gries says this reflects the digitalisation of economies worldwide a trend given an impetus by the pandemic and enforced lockdowns one of the fund s top 10 holdings is danish firm netcompany the business only listed on the stock market in 2019 says gries but it is still run by andre rogaczewski who founded the firm 21 years ago he adds netcompany has been successful in helping numerous danish organisations both public and private to embrace digitalisation its clients have included the danish government and copenhagen airport despite the pandemic its revenues grew by nearly 16 per cent in 2020 gries believes netcompany is a creator of value and views it as a long term holding he also likes that it is a company that most other european fund managers have overlooked although blackrock greater europe pays a dividend half yearly gries says it is incidental it s a bonus for shareholders but not our main focus which is to deliver long term growth in shareholders capital in the last financial year the dividend was 6 15p a share a five per cent rise on the year before the interim dividend for the current financial year was 1 75p a share the same as for the previous year the stock market identification code is b01rdh7 and ticker code is brge the annual management charges total 1 per cent

disney wants the scarlett johansson lawsuit filed against them to move to arbitration but her lawyer isn t having it the company filed a motion in los angeles on friday to move the lawsuit to a private arbitration in new york et confirms per the american bar association arbitration is a private process where disputing parties agree that one or several individuals can make a decision about the dispute after receiving evidence and hearing arguments last month the black widow star sued disney over the release of the marvel movie claiming the theatrical and disney premier release model was a breach of contract per the latest motion obtained by variety attorney daniel petrocelli argued that disney held up its obligation to give the film a wide theatrical release but noted that nothing in her contract required the release to be exclusive to theaters johansson s attorney john berlinski responded to disney s filing claiming the company is trying to hide its misconduct after initially responding to this litigation with a misogynistic attack against scarlett johansson disney is now predictably trying to hide its misconduct in a confidential arbitration berlinski said in a statement to et why is disney so afraid of litigating this case in public because it knows that marvel s promises to give black widow a typical theatrical release like its other films had everything to do with guaranteeing that disney wouldn t cannibalize box office receipts in order to boost disney plus subscriptions yet that is exactly what happened and we look forward to presenting the overwhelming evidence that proves it et confirmed in july that johansson is suing disney for intentional interference with contractual relations and for inducing breach of contract she also demands a jury trial johansson alleges in the docs which were submitted to the los angeles superior court late last month that the simultaneous release of black widow in theaters and on disney was a breach of contract the actress claims in the docs that she agreed her compensation for starring in black widow would be largely based on box office receipts generated by the film and agreed to a theatrical release exclusive to movie theaters in order to maximize her pay johansson claims disney violated its pledge by releasing black widow on disney on july 9 2021 the same day it was released in theaters there is no merit whatsoever to this filing a walt disney company spokesperson said in a statement to et the lawsuit is especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the covid 19 pandemic disney has fully complied with ms johansson s contract and furthermore the release of black widow on disney with premier access has significantly enhanced her ability to earn additional compensation on top of the 20m she has received to date berlinski also released a statement to et at the time reading it s no secret that disney is releasing films like black widow directly onto disney to increase subscribers and thereby boost the company s stock price and that it s hiding behind covid 19 as a pretext to do so but ignoring the contracts of the artists responsible for the success of its films in furtherance of this short sighted strategy violates their rights and we look forward to proving as much in court the statement continued this will surely not be the last case where hollywood talent stands up to disney and makes it clear that whatever the company may pretend it has a legal obligation to honor its contracts disney boss bob chapek later stood up for the company s movie distribution model reportedly speaking with investors and analysts during an earnings call where he addressed disney s dual distribution plans which involve releasing films in theaters and on disney at or around the same time this model of release was reportedly one reason for johansson s lawsuit after black widow dropped off in earnings significantly following its debut chapek didn t mention johansson or black widow by name during the conference call but reportedly explained we value flexibility in being able to make last minute calls he also said that during the studio s initial plans to release films in theaters once more they didn t anticipate the resurgence of covid additionally earlier this month executive chairman endeavor patrick whitesell expressed that disney would protect artists and align studio s interests with talent when announcing emma stone s attachment to the cruella sequel while the media landscape has been disrupted in a meaningful way for all distributors their creative partners cannot be left on the sidelines to carry a disproportionate amount of the downside without the potential for upside whitesell told et in a statement this agreement demonstrates that there can be an equitable path forward that protects artists and aligns studios interests with talent we are proud to work alongside emma and disney and appreciate the studio s willingness to recognize her contributions as a creative partner we are hopeful that this will open the door for more members of the creative community to participate in the success of new

here s what you need to remember still if the defense establishment in the united kingdom south korea or norway decide they need a long range strike platform it can wield against distant land and sea targets that capability may now only be an upgrade away rather than requiring some fantastical bomber design that simply is not being produced anywhere in the world and that would be too expensive to develop domestically a january 28 2020 solicitation by the naval air systems command indicating it may modify its p 8 poseidon patrol planes to carry a wide range of long range missiles mines and bombs has brought about an epiphany of sorts in the defense analysis community the sea warfare service appeared to be gearing up to convert its fleet of 122 submarine hunting patrol planes into bombers and moreover a bomber based on the boeing 737 airliner the reason that s possible for a modified airliner to become a deadly weapons platform today is that new glide bombs and missiles allow an airplane to fly well outside the range of enemy air defense weapons and still unleash devastating standoff range attacks all that s needed is a large missile truck that can carry a lot of fuel of weapons as well as the sensors and datalinks to acquire and engage targets for that reason i wrote in a 2017 profile of the p 8 that there was a distinct possibility the navy might adapt its submarine hunters to serve as a sort of b 52 bomber substitute but there s another interesting implication in the decision to adapt the p 8 the u s might effectively have an export bomber on its hands for the first time in decades the overlap between bombers and maritime patrol planes focused on tracking and attacking enemy ships and submarines and bombers dates back to world war i in world war ii liberator heavy bombers armed with depth charges and rockets played a major role in hunting german u boats while catalina patrol planes were often employed to bomb land and sea targets the important quality bombers and patrol planes had in common were the range to fly across huge distances on long endurance missions the poseidon is hardly toothless in its current configuration capable of employing mark 54 torpedoes and harpoon anti ship missiles against both ships and submarines but the navy upgrade would dramatically improve anti ship lethality with the agm 158c long range anti ship missile lrasm which possesses over twice the range of the harpoon at an estimated 300 miles a stealthier radar cross section and an advanced multi mode seeker the upgrade may also outfit the p 8 to deploy mark 62 63 and 65 naval mines 500 and 2 000 pound jdam gps guided bombs and the gbu 53 b stormbreaker small diameter bomb ii a small 105 pound weapon combining gps with laser infrared or radar guidance which can be carried in greater numbers and is intended to have much less potential for collateral damage these weapons have more modest stand off range capabilities and the gbu 53b could be employed against small boats that lack high altitude air defense weapons like those employed by the iranian navy however jdams and stormbreakers would also enable p 8s to provide long endurance air support to ground forces in the much the same way that air force b 1 and b 52 bombers are routinely called upon today a final unusual payload to under consideration is the mald air launched decoy which is designed to so convincingly emulate the performance and signature of a jet fighter that it draws away fire from deadly enemy air defense missiles the navy foremost likely intends p 8 launched malds to help its carrier based jet fighters overcome enemy integrated air defense systems undoubtedly some in the navy will contend that expanding the p 8 s mission will inevitably come at the expense of the anti submarine warfare mission which is high in demand as china s rapidly expands its submarine fleet but the demand for bombers that can both support troops on the ground and bring long range anti ship capabilities remains high particularly as the air force is considering early retiring its b 1 bombers that brought both capabilities to the table due to their operating costs and low maintainability an export bomber for the 21st century the u s has exported very few bombers since world war ii though not a few bombers leftovers from that conflict did indeed go on to see colorful cold war careers in the middle east asia and latin america that s not only because multi engine bombers are expensive but they re associated with aggressive offensive warfare and by the cold war era nuclear warfare besides some b 57 canberra jet bombers sold to pakistan one of the few exceptions to that rule was australia which between 1973 and 2010 operated the speedy f 111 aardvark swing wing bomber australia s interest in the aircraft it dubbed the pigs of the pacific was driven by its need to project forces across long distances to foist off pressure from its military rival indonesia australian aardvarks have since been superseded by super hornet and lightning fighters that despite their other virtues simply can t fly nearly as far but the royal australian air force already operates a dozen p 8 and it also has stocks of agm 158 jassm stealth cruise missiles from which the lrasm is derived as well as jdam bombs converting australian p 8 to carry standoff range cruise missiles and glide bombs would be a very simple way to restore canberra s ability to project force further into the pacific as it comes under increasing pressure from an expanding china india also operates over a dozen customized p 8i poseidons which play a critical role in enabling the indian navy to monitor ship and submarine movements in the indian ocean the p 8i differs in that it incorporates a sub hunting magnetic anomaly detector mad sensor an export variant apy 10 radar and an indian navy specific datalink a report by the center for new american security suggested that a logical step to improve the indian navy s sea control capabilities by integrating its highly capable domestic brahmos supersonic cruise missile for launch from its p 8is however it may not be all that simple to jury rig integration of a weapon with largely russian origins onto an american military platform the soon to be existence of the american upgrade kit might give india a simpler route to beefing up its anti ship firepower though undoubtedly a costly one three other operators of the p 8 norway south korea and the united kingdom might be interested in the capabilities offered by upgraded poseidons the uk fundamentally has an expeditionary military but no longer has any long range strike jets norway has come under increasing pressure from russian ships and land based missile systems and south korea is of course locked in into its long lasting security competition with its northern brethren of course training and equipping p 8 units for a larger surface strike role would necessarily come at the detriment of time spent combing the seas for submarines which pose significant security challenges to all three countries thus it s far from given that these nations will pursue the ability to convert their poseidon s into de facto bombers nor is it guaranteed that the upgrade will necessarily be authorized for sale abroad though neither is it unlikely still if the defense establishment in any of the above countries decide they need a long range strike platform it can wield against distant land and sea targets that capability may now only be an upgrade away rather than requiring some fantastical bomber design that simply is not being produced anywhere in the world and that would be too expensive to develop domestically that change could have important

in the global economy therefore about 60 of these funds will go to rich countries that do not need them african countries will receive 33 6 billion with the lion s share going to the five largest economies on the continent south africa nigeria algeria morocco and egypt the imf and many countries recognise that this division of the new resource is both inequitable and inefficient they are talking of creating a mechanism for reallocating some of the funds an amount of 100 billion is mentioned to developing countries if done effectively the reallocation could help african countries deal with covid 19 climate change and their many other economic and social challenges it is also an opportunity for african countries to begin reforming their relationship with the imf but this will require them taking the initiative to ensure that the reallocation mechanism is fully responsive to african needs and is accountable to africans to understand what africa needs to do it s helpful to review the history of special drawing rights a short history in 1969 the imf member states authorised the organisation to issue special drawing rights at the time the leading member states were becoming concerned that countries might not be able to obtain enough dollars to meet their trade and financial needs which would adversely affect the global economy they thought special drawing rights could help overcome this shortage to encourage states to hold special drawing rights they decided that there would be no policy conditions attached to their use however in order to ensure that countries would not use special drawing rights imprudently they decreed that their use would carry an interest charge the membership also decided that the special drawing rights would be allocated to the members according to their quotas in the imf this meant that the majority would always go to the richest and most powerful imf member states which were unlikely to actually use them their use was also restricted to transactions with the imf other imf member states and any other organisations that the imf explicitly authorised to hold special drawing rights today there are 15 such organisations special drawing rights have not played a major role in global finance over the past 50 years one reason is that the imf had the financial resources and bargaining power to convince states to adopt policies that made it unnecessary to issue new special drawing rights this is now changing comparing the imf s role in the 1982 sovereign debt crisis and its role in the current covid pandemic helps illustrate the changes then and now in 1982 many latin american sovereign borrowers were in danger of defaulting on their debts this had serious implications for their largest creditors the big us banks this situation threatened the us banking system as well as the stability of the international financial system and the global economy both debtors and creditors turned to the imf for help it responded by providing financing to the debtor states on condition that they adopted tough policy reforms that their creditor banks provided new financing and that they renegotiated their debts for example the imf provided mexico with us 3 4 billion to meet its debt obligations in exchange for the country substantially cutting its budget deficit and implementing structural reforms and the commercial banks extending 1 5 billion in new funds and rescheduling 23 billion of mexico s total debt forty years later a very different scenario unfolded in the early days of the pandemic the fortunes of most countries were more influenced by the actions of the world s key central banks and by private investors than by the imf unlike in 1982 the imf no longer had the resources or bargaining power to drive the global response to a financial crisis in march 2020 investors panicked by the onset of the covid 19 pandemic withdrew from domestic and international financial markets thereby reducing the financing available to sovereigns corporations and households the major central banks responded swiftly by injecting over us 10 trillion in dollars and other convertible currencies into financial markets and taking actions to support other central banks these actions provided support to commercial banks and other financial institutions which in turn decided how to allocate the trillions among their many sovereign corporate and household clients the imf response was much weaker and slower from the advent of the pandemic until 30 june 2021 it has provided about 115 billion to 85 countries and 726 75 million in debt relief to 29 low income member countries opportunity to gain lost ground this month s issuance of special drawing rights is an opportunity for the imf to regain some of its lost influence in global economic governance it is working with its membership to create a mechanism through which rich countries can reallocate a substantial portion of their special drawing rights to help poorer countries so far these discussions have focused on an existing but controversial imf trust fund the poverty reduction and growth trust the imf has historically used the fund to provide concessional financing to low income countries in return for them adopting harsh policies including raising taxes and cutting social spending there is therefore also talk of creating a new mechanism the resilience and sustainability trust but this would take time and would depend on the outcome of complex and unpredictable negotiations among the imf member states time however is of the essence neither the imf nor developing countries can afford to wait too long for the reallocated special drawing rights to begin flowing and being used effectively to help those most in need this creates an opportunity for africa to work with the imf to ensure that the reallocation mechanism meets africa s needs as closely as possible what should africa do africa should call for reforms that will make the poverty reduction and growth trust more responsive to african needs and more accountable to africans in particular the imf should take the following three actions all can be implemented by the imf management and board on their own initiative

the world s most popular airbnb listing isn t easy to find from san francisco the journey begins with an hourlong drive down interstate 280 and a windy traverse of killer 17 one of the most accident prone highways in california in the small coastal town of aptos you ascend into the santa cruz mountains past centuries old redwood groves and herds of deer a few miles in you lose cell service and have to rely on paper instructions printed out in advance when you spot the cluster of weathered mailboxes you cut right and climb up a steep single lane driveway until you reach an old mint green shed you park and walk up the driveway past black cats clucking chickens and dense thickets of foliage here lies the world famous mushroom dome airbnb s most booked property the hustle over the years this 100 square foot geodesic structure has hosted more than 5 8k airbnb guests from all over the world people have traveled here from more than 40 countries djibouti mongolia china india australia peru on 6 different continents it s been the subject of news articles instagram shoots and video tributes the mushroom dome is the most booked and most wish listed property on airbnb s platform besting 5 6m other listings including a house shaped like an elephant a cave in france and a 12th century scottish castle what makes it so popular why do people flock here and how has this tiny cabin s fame impacted the owner s life on a recent afternoon in august i went there to find out the origins of a legendary cabin within seconds of stepping out of the car i was greeted by katherine kitty mrache the mushroom dome s 71 year old proprietor with kind eyes and a head of white feathery hair kitty emerged from her garden a throng of hummingbirds in tow you made it she beamed kitty migrated to the woods in 1984 when her parents a renowned geologist and an anti war activist moved here from the bay area suburbs in search of solitude they asked her if she d be interested in joining them if they bought her land next door hell yeah she said for the next decade she lived on the property cobbling together an income as a kumon instructor a montessori teacher and a crystal healer kitty poses in front of the mushroom dome the hustle in the mid 90s kitty s parents allowed a friend who d recently become homeless to build a small cabin on the 10 acre property kitty agreed so long as the structure was 100 square feet or less a local builder sold the woman a set of blueprints for a unique geometric structure with the help of an ex navy seal she built it from scratch and lived there for the next 7 years before marrying and moving out after kitty s parents passed away her family sold off the property but kitty who still lived next door wanted to keep the strange cabin we hired a crane and loaded it onto a flatbed truck she says and then i got to see a house fly a jill of all trades she fixed up the relocated cabin as a crash pad for her kids she cut out 144 wood triangles by hand built a foundation and retrofitted the roof with elastomeric paint when she and her husband michael became empty nesters they decided to try their hand at renting it out by the night an early airbnb adopter in july of 2009 kitty listed her cabin on craigslist for 60 night but quickly found out the site was rife with scammers and unreliable guests people would book it and then cancel at the last minute never to be heard from again she says they didn t pay in advance so i d just lose out on the income she looked for an alternative and stumbled across a newfangled short term rental platform called airbnb at the time the company was 11 months young and relatively unknown kitty decided to give it a shot and signed up the hustle the mushroom dome was the 8 357th property to join airbnb almost all of the other listings were urban properties in san francisco and manhattan kitty s place a weird looking dome in the middle of the woods was something of an oddity and that worked in her favor within 2 weeks the mushroom dome was fully booked since then the cabin s popularity hasn t let up today the mushroom dome is so popular that it only has 2 or 3 vacancies in a typical year guests typically have to make reservations up to 8 months in advance even kitty s own children now fully grown adults have to contend with the masses to get a night on the calendar despite its popularity kitty has chosen to keep her property relatively affordable at 156 night 100 night cheaper than hotels in town i don t want just the techies to stay here she says i want it to be accessible to all different types of people her guests run the gamut from millionaire founders to lower middle class families who save up all year to stay here the hustle part of kitty s success can be chalked up to airbnb s marketing love affair with her cabin she joined the platform when the company was just a few employees working out of an apartment to this day she knows the founders on a first name basis and they see her as an embodiment of the company s stated purpose helping everyday people monetize their extra space the company featured the mushroom dome on a series of billboard ads in 5 us cities with the caption millions of airbnb hosts only one like kitty it also had a replica of the structure installed on the 4th floor of its san francisco hq a billboard featuring kitty s abode in belmont california via emilee goo airbnb says the mushroom dome s prosperity is part of a larger trend on the platform a rise in the popularity of unique looking properties travelers are turning to unique abodes like cabins tiny homes and treehouses to break up the monotony of the past year with the type of stay not the exact location becoming the destination a spokesperson for the company told the hustle the platform says it has 170k of these listings a 30 jump from 2019 of these listings a jump from 2019 searches for unique properties like hobbit holes and potato houses shot up 94 during the 1st half of 2021 compared to the same period 2 years ago kitty chalks up her success to a focus on the human touch it s kind of woo woo to a lot of people she says but to me it s important to focus on service not what i can get out of it she decries airbnb hosts who leave a key in a lockbox and never make contact with their guests her property she claims is more than a place to sleep it s a doorway for people to discover themselves the guest books in the cabin are full of notes from travelers who describe the dome as a conduit for transformative experiences in these tight quarters guests have proposed to each other taken pregnancy photos and celebrated major milestones in their lives kitty holds a map showing where all of her guests have come from the hustle kitty wants to be a central part of that experience a 40 year practitioner of meditation she often guides guests on mindfulness quests and metaphysical journeys during my 2 hour chat with her which was intended to focus on what makes an airbnb listing popular we discussed telepathic dogs quantum physics mineral healing thought field therapy tapping tectonic plates reared in the countercultural chaos of the 60s and sculpted by the new age spirituality of the 80s kitty is as unique as the property she rents she regaled me with tales about alchemic substances spirit channeling and the night her activist mother once spent in a jail cell with the singer songwriter joan baez we talked about the immortal indian yogi babaji 70s rock band supertramp and mellen thomas benedict a man who supposedly died and came back to life in 1982 at some point during the conversation it struck me that kitty not just the dome is integral to the listing s popularity kitty reads through reviews left in an old logbook from 2009 we chose this place as a part of our honeymoon wrote one guest thank you for providing us with a beautiful place to start our lives together the hustle the mushroom dome isn t for everyone though kitty s gotten a few bad reviews for being too talkative others don t understand just how rustic the property is i had one woman bring her mother here from china they drove all the way up took one look at it and drove straight back down the hill she says it wasn t her idea of a good time but by and large guests know what they re getting into and a break from city life is a part of the charm a live saver the popularity of the mushroom dome has allowed kitty to renovate and rent out a 2nd property on the land a den that she calls the hummingbird haven together these 2 properties have been a lifesaver before she joined airbnb kitty was struggling to get by on her 250 mo social security checks today she says the rentals bring in 8k mo 96k year more than 8x what the average airbnb host makes the extra cash helped her husband michael retire from his job working with international students at the ucsc extension school for the first time in our lives we don t have to worry about money kitty says the hustle she is well aware of the controversies surrounding airbnb the platform has been derided for having a detrimental impact on housing stock rising rent and home prices and gentrification but there is a difference she says between renting out a remote cabin in the woods and snatching up a property in a housing starved urban neighborhood solely for use as a vacation rental the cabin has been a boon for santa cruz county it brings in 50k year in transient occupancy taxes and more than 2k other property owners in the region mostly empty nesters over the age of 50 have followed kitty s lead and rented out extra rooms of their own outside of the hummingbird haven dozens of hummingbirds congregate around red feeders sucking up 2 liters of nectar every day the hustle like many airbnb hosts kitty was strained by the pandemic last year she had over 70 cancellations and the mushroom dome sat empty for nearly 2 months she stayed positive using the time to install a new hardwood floor and build a new couch the lull in bookings a 1st in more than a decade also gave kitty some time to reflect on everything this odd little cabin has given her i m 71 now and sometimes i think i d like to go travel and see the world she says gazing out at the redwood trees that enshrine the deck but then again the whole world has come to me instead
plymouth mass people evacuated popular beach communities and made last minute runs on batteries and gasoline as hurricane henri churned closer to long island and southern new england while officials pleaded with the millions of people in the storm s path to brace themselves for torrential rain and storm surges hurricane henri was on course to collide sunday in the late morning or afternoon with a long stretch of coastline as hurricane warnings extended from near the old whaling port of new bedford massachusetts across the luxurious oceanfront estates of new york s hamptons to the summer getaway of fire island intense winds and potentially dangerous tidal surges were expected as far east as cape cod and as far west as the new jersey shore and utilities warned ensuing power outages could last a week or even more governors urged people to stay home during the brunt of the storm henri was veering a bit further west than originally expected placing eastern long island in its bull s eye rather than new england that gave people directly in the storm s path less time to prepare a mandatory evacuation order was issued for some residents closest to the water in madison connecticut first selectwoman peggy lyons wrote in a public notice that any residents who do not leave the evacuation zone by 9 p m tonight are putting their lives at risk and public safety crews will not be able to respond to you once winds exceed 50 mph residents and visitors on fire island a narrow strip of sandy villages barely above sea level off long island s southern coast were urged to evacuate the last boats out will leave at 10 40 p m saturday after that officials said there may be no way out for people who decide to ride out the storm the evacuation threw a wrench into kristen pavese s planned fire island bachelorette party the group of 10 had intended to celebrate out on saturday night but ended up leaving on the ferry just a day after arriving they had planned to stay until monday i m upset about it but it s the weather it s nothing i can control said pavese a long island resident i ve been going to fire island for a long time so i m sort of familiar with this happening the group made alternate saturday night plans at a long island winery and pavese said she was happy to still be with her friends approaching severe weather saturday night also halted a superstar laden concert in manhattan s central park the show headlined by bruce springsteen paul simon and jennifer hudson was meant to celebrate new york city s recovery from the coronavirus but officials asked concert goers to leave the park during barry manilow s set amid the threat of lightning mayor bill de blasio ultimately said the event had to be called off and urged attendees to go home gov andrew cuomo pleaded with new york residents to make last minute preparations warning that heavy rain winds and storm surges from henri could be as devastating as superstorm sandy in parts of the state the governor who will leave office in two days following a sexual harassment scandal warned that heavy rains were expected to create problems far up into the hudson river valley we have short notice we re talking about tomorrow cuomo said so if you have to move if you have to stock up if you have to get to higher ground it has to be today please gov ned lamont warned connecticut residents they should prepare to shelter in place from sunday afternoon through at least monday morning as the state braces for the first possible direct hit from a hurricane in decades in rhode island gov dan mckee similarly urged state residents stay at home sunday and into monday morning we consider this a serious matter mckee said at a news conference officials said logan international airport in boston was expected to remain open but that some flights likely would be canceled and service on some branches of new york city s commuter rail system will be suspended sunday amtrak service sunday between new york and boston was cancelled massachusetts gov charlie baker expressed relief saturday that the latest models suggest henri won t make a direct hit on the state but baker and mckee at separate briefings warned that high winds and heavy rains still could lead to widespread and lengthy power outages the white house said u s president joe biden discussed preparations with northeastern governors and that new york lt gov kathy hochul who succeeds cuomo on tuesday also participated biden later began approving emergency declarations with rhode island new york hasn t had a direct hit from a powerful cyclone since superstorm sandy wreaked havoc in 2012 some of the most important repairs from that storm have been completed but many projects designed to protect against future storms remain unfinished with a top wind speed of 75 mph 120 kph saturday henri sped up to move north at 21 mph 33 kph as of saturday night it was about 180 miles 290 kilometres south southeast of montauk point on long island southampton town supervisor jay schneiderman said the town was considering issuing a voluntary evacuation advisory for about 6 000 people he said storm models showed that the storm s center would run smack on the town of southampton he described a run on supplies like batteries and flashlights as people are starting to wake up regardless of its exact landfall broad impacts were expected across a large swath of the northeast extending inland to hartford connecticut and albany new york and eastward to cape cod which is teeming with tens of thousands of summer tourists storm surge between 3 and 5 feet 1 to 1 5 metres is possible from flushing new york to chatham massachusetts and for parts of the north shore and south shore of long island the hurricane center said rainfall between 3 to 6 inches 7 5 to 15 centimetres is expected sunday through monday officials in massachusetts connecticut and new york cautioned that people could lose power for days authorities advised people to secure their boats fuel up their vehicles and stock up on canned goods in the hamptons the celebrity playground on long island s east end officials warned of dangerous rip currents and flooding that s likely to turn streets like the mansion lined dune road into lagoons we have a lot of wealthy people there s no doubt that we do but everybody pulls together in an emergency schneiderman said so you know yeah there are people hanging out on their yachts at the moment drinking martinis but they re also starting to talk about this storm and i m sure they re going to want to be helpful hill reported from albany new york associated press writers mallika sen and larry neumeister in new york mike melia in hartford connecticut and mark pratt in waltham massachusetts

exosomes are nano sized biological capsules that cells produce to protect and courier delicate molecules throughout the body the capsules are hardy enough to withstand enzymatic breakdown as well as acidic and temperature fluctuations in the gut and bloodstream making them a promising candidate for drug delivery harvesting them to achieve clinical grade levels of purity however is a complex process exosomes are abundant in cow s milk yet they re difficult to isolate from other milk proteins and lipids said rob gourdie professor and director of the center for vascular and heart research at the fralin biomedical research institute at vtc gourdie s laboratory developed a scalable method to harvest exosomes from unpasteurized cow s milk using this purification method which was published this month in nanotheranostics the research team can extract roughly a cup of purified exosomes for every gallon of unpasteurized milk for the first time we ve charted a path toward the industrial scalability of exosome purification for oral drug delivery said gourdie who is also the commonwealth research commercialization fund eminent scholar in heart reparative medicine research and a professor of biomedical engineering and mechanics in virginia tech s college of engineering the research team developed their multistep cost effective purification process which optimizes filtration methods and timing of temperature and chemical treatments effecting calcium levels during the covid 19 pandemic spencer marsh and kevin pridham both postdoctoral fellows in gourdie s lab at the fralin biomedical research institute and jane jourdan gourdie s lab manager did the practical work to develop the proprietary procedure our team worked together effectively and safely on this project throughout the pandemic gourdie said it was a sight to see their selfless teamwork enthusiasm and dedication to overcoming challenges is something that does not happen as often as you might think in science there were many failures but eventually we figured out stepwise processes that worked joy wolfram assistant professor of medicine at mayo clinic who was not involved in the study says the new protocol advances the pharmaceutical potential for exosomes what s remarkable is the quantity of extracellular vesicles they are able to produce isolating and manufacturing extracellular vesicles in a scalable manner has always prevented their translation into the clinic but this paper shows a path to overcome those roadblocks wolfram said wolfram previously published a protocol for using tangential flow filtration technology that gourdie s team adapted to isolate the milk exosomes exosomes are secreted naturally by nearly all cell types in humans and other mammals and can be found abundantly in blood lymph urine and milk lined with protective membranes exosomes shuttle biomolecules snippets of genetic material and chemical signals between cells over long ranges over the past decade research into their pharmaceutical applications particularly for the delivery of fragile drugs such as peptides and micrornas has surged imagine instead of getting a vaccine shot your nurse hands you a milkshake instead another milkshake may contain exosomes loaded with a therapeutic peptide designed to protect internal organs such as the heart from myocardial infarction gourdie said exosomes can also penetrate the blood brain barrier a collection of coupled cellular processes that protects the brain from unwanted pathogens and chemicals introducing a new way to deliver therapeutics to treat neurological diseases and brain cancer improving the viability of using exosomes opens up a wide range of drug delivery methods with unlimited clinical applications gourdie said gourdie partnered with homestead creamery a local dairy processing plant to obtain unpasteurized milk samples for the study we have always built our business on relationships and this is an exciting collaboration for us said donnie montgomery co founder and co owner of homestead creamery last year gourdie licensed the intellectual property to deliver heart medicine using exosomes through virginia tech s license center for technology commercialization and formed the tiny cargo co
tropical storm henri socked the northeast with strong winds as it made landfall sunday on the coast of rhode island and sent lashing bands of rain westward knocking out power to over 140 000 homes and causing deluges that closed bridges swamped roads and left some people stranded in their vehicles the storm was downgraded from a hurricane before reaching new england leaving many to breathe a sigh of relief but the national hurricane center warned the slow moving storm would continue dumping heavy rains on wide swaths of the region well beyond the weekend over two days heavy sustained rains flooded areas as far southwest as new jersey even as it took on tropical depression status the storm threatened to stall near the new york connecticut border overnight before pivoting east and moving out toward the atlantic ocean on monday some of the highest rain totals were expected inland there were few early reports of major coastal damage due to wind or surf president joe biden on sunday promised to provide federal help to the residents of affected states the president declared disasters in much of the region opening the purse strings for federal recovery aid biden earlier had offered his condolences to the people of tennessee after severe flooding from an unrelated storm killed at least 22 including young children and elderly people and left dozens of others missing when it made landfall near westerly rhode island henri had sustained winds of about 60 mph and gusts of up to 70 mph according to the national hurricane center by late sunday henri had sustained winds of about 30 mph 48 kph as it moved across connecticut toward the new york state line some of the worst rain arrived well before the storm s center in helmetta new jersey some 200 residents fled for higher ground taking refuge in hotels or with friends and family as floodwaters inundated their homes it came so quick in the blink of an eye said the town s mayor christopher slavicek whose parents were spending the night after fleeing their home now there s clean up so this is far from over the mayor said some communities in central new jersey were inundated with as much as 8 inches 20 centimeters of rain by midday sunday in jamesburg television video footage showed flooded downtown streets and cars almost completely submerged in newark public safety director brian o hara said police and firefighters rescued 86 people in 11 incidents related to the storm he said significant flooding led to multiple vehicles submerged in flooded areas this could have been a lot worse particularly as it relates to wind new jersey gov phil murphy said sunday evening connecticut gov ned lamont said henri was close to being in the rear view mirror but said there s still more work to do even as mandatory evacuations were being lifted in some communities about 250 residents from four nursing homes on the shoreline had to be relocated to other nursing homes several major bridges in rhode island which stitch together much of the state were briefly shuttered sunday and some coastal roads were nearly impassable in newport paul and cherie saunders rode out the storm in a home that her family has owned since the late 1950s their basement flooded with 5 feet of water during superstorm sandy nine years ago this house has been through so many hurricanes and so many things have happened said cherie saunders 68 we re just going to wait and see what happens rhode island has been hit by hurricanes and tropical storms periodically including superstorm sandy in 2012 irene in 2011 and hurricane bob in 1991 the city of providence sustained so much flooding damage from a hurricane in 1938 and hurricane carol in 1954 that it built a hurricane barrier in the 1960s to protect its downtown from a storm surge coming up narragansett bay that barrier and newer gates built nearby were closed for hours sunday before reopening the national weather service recorded what could be the wettest hour ever in central park with 1 94 inches of torrential rainfall pelting the park between 10 p m and 11 p m saturday earlier in the evening thousands attending a homecoming concert at the park were forced to disperse because of heavy rainfall after passing back through new england and sweeping out into the atlantic over the next couple of days the hurricane center predicted henri will lose its identity until then areas from northeast pennsylvania through new england braced for heavy rains marshall shepherd director of the atmospheric sciences program at the university of georgia and former president of the american meteorological society said henri was reminiscent in some ways of hurricane harvey a slow moving storm that decimated the houston area in 2017 to the west side of the storm you have a banding feature that has literally been stationary sitting there and dumping rain that will be a significant hazard for the new york and new jersey area shepherd said after tropical storm irene roared up the coast in august 2011 many were relieved when the new york city area largely was spared but then the storm settled over the green mountains and irene became the biggest natural disaster to hit vermont since an epic 1927 flood parts of the state got 11 inches of rain in just 24 hours irene killed six in vermont left thousands homeless and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway i remember irene and media outlets outside vermont brushing it aside as if no big deal while it hit vermont robert welch a podcaster tweeted sunday i ll relax when i see it at sea on radar in one of his final appearances as governor before he is set to step down at the end of monday over a sexual harassment scandal new york gov andrew cuomo said the state s primary concern were inland areas like the hudson river valley north of new york city which was projected to get inches of rain over the next few days in the hudson valley you have hills you have creeks the water comes running down those hills and turns a creek into a ravaging river cuomo said major airports in the region remained open as the storm approached though hundreds of sunday s flights were canceled service on some branches of new york city s commuter rail system was suspended through sunday as was amtrak service between new york and boston power outages affected power to 130 000 homes across rhode island connecticut massachusetts and new york connecticut s largest electric utility said it had restored 20 000 customers but thousands like linda orlomoski who lives in canterbury remained without power i haven t seen any trucks at all in my neighborhood but the opposite end of my road had their power restored before 6 p m so close and yet so far she said it s supposed to get nasty hot and humid again on tuesday so if we still have no power by then that will be miserable
the experience of labor offshoring bears lessons for today s capital offshoring american shareholders have accumulated massive exposure to china s market leaving them vulnerable to the anti market features of china s politics in the early 2000s a china shock roiled america s manufacturing economy as companies offshored labor the united states is now at risk of a second china shock as american investors offshore capital at record rates china shock 1 0 devastated american manufacturing and enriched chinese industry as china s economy has changed its sectoral composition migrating from an export economy to one that services its domestic market china s economic leaders have changed their strategic objective no longer do they espouse the benefits of reform and opening now the goal is regulation and self sufficiency changes in china s economy have paved the way for china shock 2 0 the first shock can be traced to china s decision to open its market the second shock will find its origins in china s decision to close its market economists call the frictional period of trade integration with china in the first decade of the twenty first century the china shock it refers to the severe damage chinese import competition inflicted on certain sectors of the american economy david autor calculates that the china shock was responsible for the loss of 2 4 million american jobs between 1999 and 2011 in the aftermath the american workforce adapted more slowly than expected labor force participation rates remained unnaturally low and unemployment unnaturally high for the following decade what started as an economic problem job loss metastasized into feelings of social obsolescence the challenge proved too daunting for government assistance alone as unemployment insurance failed to remedy the problem finally came the political backlash in 2016 candidate donald trump drew on this new fount of protectionism winning eighty nine of the 100 counties most affected by chinese import competition china shock 1 0 was a story of offshoring labor american and multinational firms shuttered domestic manufacturing hubs in favor of cheaper locations overseas furniture plastics and agriculture were among the unloved sectors most afflicted its impact was felt in rural america but the seeds of the shock were sown in the markets of shanghai and shenzhen in 1992 chinese leader deng xiaoping s southern tour ignited a flurry of business activity deng pointed to the collapse of the soviet union and the vitality of the west as justification for reform and opening up economic modernization is an irreversible general trend of historical development he said china s village industrial output grew by a staggering 28 percent per year in the 1990s and china joined the world trade organization in 2001 during the 2000s china s so called golden decade under president hu jintao chinese gdp grew fivefold by decade s end the country was the world s largest manufacturing power and second largest economy china s economic boom has put the united states at risk of a second china shock this time a capital shock while the u s china bilateral relationship has fractured foreign investment has multiplied last year global holdings of chinese equities surged by 40 percent international investors now hold a record 800 billion in chinese stocks and bonds the rate of buying also reached its highest pace ever this year 70 percent of american business leaders record remaining optimistic about the chinese market foreign direct investment continues to chase china s huge domestic market practically unabated so far the offshoring of american capital has been part inertial part intentional some investors have simply maintained passive positions in index funds whose managers have been adding exposure to the chinese market this outflow of dollars is poised to continue as china cracks down on foreign listings of chinese companies investors might be tempted to follow these chinese stocks delisted from american exchanges over to chinese exchanges other investors will continue to devise new joint ventures to access the chinese financial market or fund new bets on chinese technology both areas of record inflows offshoring american capital is a precarious bet for shareholders and a geopolitical loss for policymakers investors are failing to appreciate the magnitude of risk that stems from xi jinping s ideological grip on chinese capital markets china s mammoth domestic market and the stubbornly persistent inflows of foreign direct investment have given xi the confidence to ignite a regulatory crackdown since november chinese regulators have taken more than fifty actions spanning anti monopoly real estate finance and education more than one move a week the wall street journal notes titans like jack ma s ant group ride share app didi and web giant tencent have all fallen victim this decision to regulate is not an economic imperative as much as a political one in a january speech to the central party school in beijing xi made it clear that his crackdown on capital markets was an ideological endeavor capital markets must prevent foreign capital from entering and exiting he told cadres economic self sufficiency must be the goal the barbaric growth of capital must be halted at all costs last week china s state council reinforced xi s guidance releasing an implementation outline with thirty five instructions the document makes it clear that regulation is the country s economic priority for the next five years these regulatory objectives have policy aims only in a political sense the goal is not market efficiency or macroeconomic maneuvering to manage the mundellian trilemma politics is the end goal regulation the rationale while the arsenal of american tools to counter china in geopolitical competition is extensive the u s government s present approach struggles to manage the consequences of offshoring an essential factor of production currently investment blacklists decreed by executive order are the most wide ranging tool in november 2020 the trump administration blacklisted american investment in companies associated with china s military and state security in june president joe biden expanded the blacklist to encompass companies linked to human rights abuses the bureau of industry and security housed within the commerce department maintains the administration s entity list which recently placed restrictions on thirty four new chinese companies investment in these firms requires onerous licensing the treasury department recently expanded the scope of its committee on foreign investments in the united states investment review for inbound technology investment across a variety of agencies the tools to control american capital outflow are being stretched to their breaking point moreover despite these many tools the government still lacks a centralized repository of investment screening criteria deploying a comprehensive centralized regulatory instrument to monitor and temper this outbound investment could help ward off china shock 2 0 in a speech in july national security advisor jake sullivan floated a new investment screening regime that is postured for intense technology competition his focus is on the impact of outbound u s investment flows that could enhance the technological capacity of our competitors in ways that harm our national security quieter initiatives on investment screening will pick up the pace in the months ahead he concluded it is clear that the biden administration is considering broader efforts to regulate outbound american investment perhaps they have internalized the lesson of china shock 1 0 when government intervention was too little and too late to counter xi s assault on chinese capital markets and by extension american shareholders and american national interest it would be wise for american regulatory action to be as deep and systemic as the changes the chinese economy has experienced under xi christopher vassallo is a former schwarzman scholar and researcher at the asia society policy institute and harvard s belfer center he graduated magna cum laude from harvard with a degree in history his twitter handle is vassallocmv image reuters
new york hasn t had a direct hit from a major hurricane season storm since superstorm sandy wreaked havoc in 2012 example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video people evacuated popular beach communities and made last minute runs on batteries and gasoline as hurricane henri churned closer to long island and southern new england while officials pleaded with the millions of people in the storm s path to brace themselves for torrential rain and storm surges hurricane henri was on course to collide sunday in the late morning or afternoon with a long stretch of coastline as hurricane warnings extended from near the old whaling port of new bedford massachusetts across the luxurious oceanfront estates of new york s hamptons to the summer getaway of fire island intense winds and potentially dangerous tidal surges were expected as far east as cape cod and as far west as the new jersey shore and utilities warned ensuing power outages could last a week or even more governors urged people to stay home during the brunt of the storm henri was veering a bit further west than originally expected placing eastern long island in its bull s eye rather than new england that gave people directly in the storm s path less time to prepare a mandatory evacuation order was issued for some residents closest to the water in madison connecticut first selectwoman peggy lyons wrote in a public notice that any residents who do not leave the evacuation zone by 9 p m tonight are putting their lives at risk and public safety crews will not be able to respond to you once winds exceed 50 mph residents and visitors on fire island a narrow strip of sandy villages barely above sea level off long island s southern coast were urged to evacuate the last boats out will leave at 10 40 p m saturday after that officials said there may be no way out for people who decide to ride out the storm approaching severe weather on saturday night prompted the evacuation of manhattan s central park during a superstar laden concert headlined by bruce springsteen paul simon and jennifer hudson that was meant to celebrate new york city s recovery from the coronavirus the evacuation threw a wrench into kristen pavese s planned fire island bachelorette party the group of 10 had intended to celebrate out on saturday night but ended up leaving on the ferry just a day after arriving they had planned to stay until monday i m upset about it but it s the weather it s nothing i can control said pavese a long island resident i ve been going to fire island for a long time so i m sort of familiar with this happening the group made alternate saturday night plans at a long island winery and pavese said she was happy to still be with her friends gov andrew cuomo pleaded with new york residents to make last minute preparations warning that heavy rain winds and storm surges from henri could be as devastating as superstorm sandy in parts of the state the governor who will leave office in two days following a sexual harassment scandal warned that heavy rains were expected to create problems far up into the hudson river valley we have short notice we re talking about tomorrow cuomo said so if you have to move if you have to stock up if you have to get to higher ground it has to be today please gov ned lamont warned connecticut residents they should prepare to shelter in place from sunday afternoon through at least monday morning as the state braces for the first possible direct hit from a hurricane in decades in rhode island gov dan mckee similarly urged state residents stay at home sunday and into monday morning we consider this a serious matter mckee said at a news conference officials said logan international airport in boston was expected to remain open but that some flights likely would be canceled and service on some branches of new york city s commuter rail system will be suspended sunday amtrak service sunday between new york and boston was cancelled massachusetts gov charlie baker expressed relief saturday that the latest models suggest henri won t make a direct hit on the state but baker and mckee at separate briefings warned that high winds and heavy rains still could lead to widespread and lengthy power outages the white house said president joe biden discussed preparations with northeastern governors and that new york lt gov kathy hochul who succeeds cuomo on tuesday also participated biden later began approving emergency declarations with rhode island new york hasn t had a direct hit from a powerful cyclone since superstorm sandy wreaked havoc in 2012 some of the most important repairs from that storm have been completed but many projects designed to protect against future storms remain unfinished with a top wind speed of 75 mph 120 kph saturday henri sped up to move north northeast at 18 mph 29 kph as of saturday evening it s still about 335 miles 540 kilometers south of montauk point on long island southampton town supervisor jay schneiderman said the town was considering issuing a voluntary evacuation advisory for about 6 000 people he said storm models showed that the storm s center would run smack on the town of southampton he described a run on supplies like batteries and flashlights as people are starting to wake up regardless of its exact landfall broad impacts were expected across a large swath of the northeast extending inland to hartford connecticut and albany new york and eastward to cape cod which is teeming with tens of thousands of summer tourists storm surge between 3 and 5 feet 1 to 1 5 meters is possible from flushing new york to chatham massachusetts and for parts of the north shore and south shore of long island the hurricane center said rainfall between 3 to 6 inches 7 5 to 15 centimeters is expected sunday through monday officials in massachusetts connecticut and new york cautioned that people could lose power for days authorities advised people to secure their boats fuel up their vehicles and stock up on canned goods in the hamptons the celebrity playground on long island s east end officials warned of dangerous rip currents and flooding that s likely to turn streets like the mansion lined dune road into lagoons we have a lot of wealthy people there s no doubt that we do but everybody pulls together in an emergency schneiderman said so you know yeah there are people hanging out on their yachts at the moment drinking martinis but they re also starting to talk about this storm and i m sure they re going to want to be helpful ___
the international monetary fund imf will inject 650 billion in special drawing rights into the global economy it will allocate them among its member states which can then decide for themselves how they want to use their special drawing rights this injection which will take place on 23 august 2021 is more than double the total number of special drawing rights the imf has ever issued and is equal to about 5 of total global reserves the imf will allocate the special drawing rights among its member states based on their quotas which are determined by the size of a country s economy and its role in the global economy therefore about 60 of these funds will go to rich countries that do not need them african countries will receive 33 6 billion with the lion s share going to the five largest economies on the continent south africa nigeria algeria morocco and egypt the imf and many countries recognise that this division of the new resource is both inequitable and inefficient they are talking of creating a mechanism for reallocating some of the funds an amount of 100 billion is mentioned to developing countries if done effectively the reallocation could help african countries deal with covid 19 climate change and their many other economic and social challenges it is also an opportunity for african countries to begin reforming their relationship with the imf but this will require them taking the initiative to ensure that the reallocation mechanism is fully responsive to african needs and is accountable to africans to understand what africa needs to do it s helpful to review the history of special drawing rights a short history in 1969 the imf member states authorised the organisation to issue special drawing rights at the time the leading member states were becoming concerned that countries might not be able to obtain enough dollars to meet their trade and financial needs which would adversely affect the global economy they thought special drawing rights could help overcome this shortage to encourage states to hold special drawing rights they decided that there would be no policy conditions attached to their use however in order to ensure that countries would not use special drawing rights imprudently they decreed that their use would carry an interest charge the membership also decided that the special drawing rights would be allocated to the members according to their quotas in the imf this meant that the majority would always go to the richest and most powerful imf member states which were unlikely to actually use them their use was also restricted to transactions with the imf other imf member states and any other organisations that the imf explicitly authorised to hold special drawing rights today there are 15 such organisations special drawing rights have not played a major role in global finance over the past 50 years one reason is that the imf had the financial resources and bargaining power to convince states to adopt policies that made it unnecessary to issue new special drawing rights this is now changing comparing the imf s role in the 1982 sovereign debt crisis and its role in the current covid pandemic helps illustrate the changes then and now in 1982 many latin american sovereign borrowers were in danger of defaulting on their debts this had serious implications for their largest creditors the big us banks this situation threatened the us banking system as well as the stability of the international financial system and the global economy both debtors and creditors turned to the imf for help it responded by providing financing to the debtor states on condition that they adopted tough policy reforms that their creditor banks provided new financing and that they renegotiated their debts for example the imf provided mexico with us 3 4 billion to meet its debt obligations in exchange for the country substantially cutting its budget deficit and implementing structural reforms and the commercial banks extending 1 5 billion in new funds and rescheduling 23 billion of mexico s total debt forty years later a very different scenario unfolded in the early days of the pandemic the fortunes of most countries were more influenced by the actions of the world s key central banks and by private investors than by the imf unlike in 1982 the imf no longer had the resources or bargaining power to drive the global response to a financial crisis in march 2020 investors panicked by the onset of the covid 19 pandemic withdrew from domestic and international financial markets thereby reducing the financing available to sovereigns corporations and households the major central banks responded swiftly by injecting over us 10 trillion in dollars and other convertible currencies into financial markets and taking actions to support other central banks these actions provided support to commercial banks and other financial institutions which in turn decided how to allocate the trillions among their many sovereign corporate and household clients the imf response was much weaker and slower from the advent of the pandemic until 30 june 2021 it has provided about 115 billion to 85 countries and 726 75 million in debt relief to 29 low income member countries opportunity to gain lost ground this month s issuance of special drawing rights is an opportunity for the imf to regain some of its lost influence in global economic governance it is working with its membership to create a mechanism through which rich countries can reallocate a substantial portion of their special drawing rights to help poorer countries so far these discussions have focused on an existing but controversial imf trust fund the poverty reduction and growth trust the imf has historically used the fund to provide concessional financing to low income countries in return for them adopting harsh policies including raising taxes and cutting social spending there is therefore also talk of creating a new mechanism the resilience and sustainability trust but this would take time and would depend on the outcome of complex and unpredictable negotiations among the imf member states time however is of the essence neither the imf nor developing countries can afford to wait too long for the reallocated special drawing rights to begin flowing and being used effectively to help those most in need this creates an opportunity for africa to work with the imf to ensure that the reallocation mechanism meets africa s needs as closely as possible what should africa do africa should call for reforms that will make the poverty reduction and growth trust more responsive to african needs and more accountable to africans in particular the imf should take the following three

economists are generally considered to be people who promote selfish behavior and generally not care about others i want to argue that selfish behavior can also lead to desirable outcomes but first let me define what economics really studies by offering definition provided by the american economic association it s the study of scarcity the study of how people use resources and respond to incentives or the study of decision making it argues that economists study all aspects of decision making assuming rational individuals who wish to maximize their own happiness giving rise to the negative popular myth that economists promote greedy selfish behavior to make my point the following event that took place during the tokyo olympics on aug 1 2021 mutaz essa barshim qatar and gianmarco tamberi italy shared the gold medal for men s high jump both barshim and tamberi had cleared 2 37 metres but were unable to clear the 2 39 metres bar even after three attempts when the olympic official came to discuss the modalities of a jump off for the gold medal barshim asked if they could share the medal the official replied in the affirmative and the rest is history since the summer olympics began in 1896 more than 5 600 gold medals have been given out but there have only 31 instances of sharing as far as i can tell this is the first instance where rival athletes from different countries opted to share the medal themselves leaving aside for the moment that they both thought they could earn bigger cash rewards in their home country i really do not think that this was the primary motivation for either athlete because of the speed with which all of this happened instead i would like to argue that this happened because they behaved selfishly to understand this we need to first account for how economists view risk in everyday parlance risk means exposure to a chance of loss and a risky venture is something that involves the possibility of a loss economists assume that individuals fall into three categories risk loving risk neutral and risk averse a risk averse individual derives greater satisfaction from a guaranteed or certain outcome than a combination of uncertain outcomes that probabilistically offers a higher pay off a risk lover prefers exactly the opposite a risk neutral person is equally happy with a guaranteed outcome and a combination of uncertain outcomes that on average offer the same pay off thus a risk neutral person derives the same amount of satisfaction from a dollar s worth of gains and losses for a risk averse person the satisfaction formally utility from losing a dollar is worth more than the dollar while the same is true for a risk lover for gaining a dollar not surprisingly most of us are risk averse and prefer to invest in safe assets that may offer lower returns than a volatile stock market while risk lovers on the other hand are the ones who haunt casinos and take the chances life throws at them let us revisit the tale of barshim and tamberi if they participated in a jump off only one of them would earn a gold medal and the other would face the chance of losing that medal however if they were both risk averse then the only rational and selfish choice was to share the medal because it makes winning the gold medal a certainty but there is a little more to this tale of medal sharing even though barshim suggested the idea of sharing why did tamberi accept it it turns out that they are both good friends on and off the track which provides yet another reason that made medal sharing possible imagine that your happiness depends on your own plus that of your child or fiancé in other words your happiness is a sum of your own happiness plus the happiness of your loved one then it is easy to see why the two friends might want to share an olympic gold medal in other words even rational selfish behavior can lead to beautiful outcomes and produce heartwarming stories i invite you all to explore economics and especially my own department at virginia tech as a way of gaining a deeper understanding of human behavior

leak and destroy on the hunt for climate killing gas chad dorger l senior environmental program associate at tradewater refrigerant solutions picks up empty refrigerant tanks from rick karas r in peotone illinois on august 11 2021 peotone united states after finding a rusty gas canister near his midwest us home rick karas checked online if it was worth anything incredibly it turned out to be a coveted commodity in the battle against climate change his roughly basketball sized container was filled with cfcs chlorofluorocarbons a potent greenhouse gas that is perfectly legal to possess but which has been globally banned from manufacture for decades absent a government mandate to destroy the ample existing stocks a handful of companies have stepped in to hunt down the gases in a process funded by selling carbon credits they earn from destroying the chemicals karas connected online with a company called tradewater which subsequently led to one of its staffers picking up the can at his home in tiny peotone illinois about an hour s drive from chicago minutes later he had a 100 bill and the gas once standard in car air conditioners or refrigerators and packed into cans that leak over time was on its way to the incinerator i feel good a little cash in the pocket and it helps the environment karas who raises bees told afp though he was completely unaware of the climate connection that s the way the chicago based firm prefers it they make no mention of their mission in online ads targeting would be sellers and they even do business under a different name refrigerant finders to sidestep what remains a politically charged subject in the united states chad dorger who picked up karas s tank noted that 80 percent of customers don t care what happens to the gas but for the rest it can get tricky they will flat out refuse to sell and they ll say no i want this to be used or i don t believe in that climate change hoax he said still the taming of cfcs has been one of the success stories in humanity s patchy efforts to tackle the manmade emissions that are driving stronger storms drier droughts and the massive deadly wildfires that have come roaring after them this summer the right to pollute the united nations trumpets the 1987 montreal protocol which barred making cfcs so as to repair a thin layer of ozone in the atmosphere that shields life on earth from cancer causing ultraviolet rays as the only un treaty ever that has been ratified by every country on earth it s hard to debate the logic besides their corrosive effect on the ozone layer cfcs are also a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat up to 10 000 times more efficiently than carbon dioxide global cfc concentrations fell steadily until about 2012 after the protocol took effect but startled scientists discovered in 2018 that the pace of that slowdown had dropped by half during the preceding five years evidence pointed to factories in eastern china once cfc production in that region stopped the ozone layer s healing process appeared to be back on track there s not many voices against destroying cfcs but carbon offsets are more complicated under the scheme a polluting company or individual buys a credit equivalent to a metric tonne of carbon dioxide with the money going directly or indirectly into an emissions reduction plan like planting trees or investment in renewable energy sources but some critics accuse big business of paying for a quick fix rather than seeking to truly overhaul the environmental impact of their operations while some botched offset projects have failed to deliver for some hardcore environmentalists that is giving someone the right to pollute and we shouldn t pollute said george washington university economics professor michael moore tradewater s leaders however are very clear about what they do and why if companies like ours don t destroy this refrigerant it will leak into the atmosphere chief operating officer gabe plotkin told afp there s no government mandate to do it there s no financial incentive to do it and in some cases there s no will to do it he added

here s everything to know about this weekend s weather that s tropical in name but far from its titular home huh a hurricane is hitting new england maybe rare tropical weather is making its way up off the atlantic coast of the u s destined for new york and new england two regions that don t often play host to tropical storms who is henri who is bob get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters a stormy pair henri is the tropical storm that s expected to strengthen into a hurricane and perhaps become new england s first in 30 years bob was its predecessor responsible for the deaths of 17 and 1 5 billion in damages in august 1991 these storms have human names courtesy the world meteorological association which draws up a list of 21 names for each atlantic hurricane season which areas is henri supposed to affect right now it s looking like new york s long island and southern new england particularly connecticut if it makes landfall in new york that would be the first time the state s sustained a direct hit during a hurricane season since 2012 s superstorm sandy the effects of which are still plaguing new york so what are the conditions needed for an henri or bob there are two ingredients needed for a storm to track this far up north a tropical system itself and steering currents most tropical systems in the northern hemisphere run out or recur before they can make their way north according to the national weather service ok so this is pretty rare is henri s path connected to climate change no perhaps surprisingly it s just a tropical weather phenomenon the national weather service says we shouldn t necessarily expect to see more frequent new england tropical storms what do people need to do to prepare for henri this isn t new england or new york s first rodeo with weather writ large after all a nor easter is just a hurricane with a boston accent it s not too different in the long island dialect either so the usual protocols apply get boats out of the water gas up cars stock the pantry and batten down the hatches be prepared for power outages too we re in the dog days of august are there still tourists on the atlantic coast oh yes school is back in session in parts of the east coast but there are still thousands of tourists enjoying the beaches of cape cod the hamptons and elsewhere is henri a fast or slow moving storm henri isn t winning any races its slow churn could be a good thing increasing the chance it will falter quickly but it could also mean a lot of concentrated rain it s the first time since hurricane irene in 2011 that a hurricane watch has been issued for parts of the tri state nhc said nbc new york s pei sze cheng and lynda baquero reports wait was hurricane bob the same as the perfect storm nope though both storms were in 1991 the so called perfect storm also known as the halloween storm hit new england about two months later it started as a nor easter in which form it inflicted the most damage a hurricane eventually formed at its center but it purposely went unnamed because meteorologists worried it would be distracting say it had been named what would it have been known as henri seriously yep atlantic hurricane names are recycled every six years unless they re retired out of notoriety we re never going to see another hurricane named katrina or even bob again and the h name henri in 1991 was next on the list when the storm struck as tropical storm henri which could become a hurricane by saturday afternoon is expected to clip the far eastern reaches of long island the area is already making preps including clearing drains to prevent flooding and securing boats nbc new york s pei sze cheng reports so that movie isn t about bob correct the perfect storm was a 2000 movie starring george clooney and new england s own mark wahlberg based on a book of the same name by sebastian junger we re getting a little off topic here though ok you said henri is expected to be the first hurricane to hit new england in 30 years but what about irene irene was indeed tropical and a hurricane but by the time it ravaged vermont it was technically a tropical storm
