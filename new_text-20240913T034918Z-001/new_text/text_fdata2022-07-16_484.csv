almost every house democrat voted on thursday to reward indian h 1b visa workers by offering the huge prize of citizenship to their adult children in exchange for their parents taking fortune 500 jobs from american graduates sixty two republicans also voted for the corporate giveaway within the defenses authorization bill for 2023 but the legislation was rejected by most of the gop s leadership including rep kevin mccarthy r ca jim banks r in and jim jordan r oh the gop leadership s opposition may help stop senate approval said rosemary jenks policy director at numbersusa but she warned we have our work cut out for keeping this off the senate version your green card expansion will not be in the final after conference we will make sure of that said a tweet from the federation for american immigration reform to the leading democratic sponsor rep deborah ross d nc it is bad policy and has no place in a defense bill the tweet added if approved by the senate the giveaway legislation will make it easier for fortune 500 companies and their many subcontractors to fill corporate jobs with more indian visa workers instead of american professionals many corporations use the h 1b visa program to dangle the prize of citizenship before cheap and compliant indian graduates when recruiting for jobs that would otherwise go to skilled underused innovative and outspoken american professionals this replacement process spikes the stock bonuses of c suite executives but undermines the companies ability to innovate amid growing foreign competition the existing visa worker system has brought at least 1 5 million foreign contract workers into coastal based jobs at many fortune 500 companies this huge inflow of foreign workers drains investment from gop majority midwest and southern towns and it demotes millions of the ambitious sons and daughters of american parents the giveaway legislation benefits the visa workers and their foreign born children but provides no compensation to americans or their communities the chain migration giveaway also threatens the jobs of gop members naturalized indian immigrants are one of the most pro democratic voting blocs partly because they feel little pressure to give up their ancient caste culture to better integrate into u s society all but three of the 218 democrats voted for the chain migration giveaway this lockstep democratic support for corporate outsourcing may be risky a july 5 7 poll of 849 registered voters by siena college showed that democrats have the support of 57 percent of white college graduates that group and their children are most impacted by the expanded giveaway of benefits to foreign contract workers the clear opposition by the gop leadership gives the gop an opportunity to reduce that crucial democratic advantage if the gop leaders are willing to anger their national corporate donors in the fortune 500 the giveaway bill is marketed as a humanitarian benefit to roughly 200 000 older children of visa workers from india each year the federal government offers 140 000 green cards to visa workers and their families but the huge surge of indians into americans jobs has created a massive backlog in the giveaway process the backlog ensures that some of the indian workers children age out of the legal process as they turn 21 this lifts the age limit so allowing the adult children of visa workers to potentially benefit from their parents job offer jenks said it is ridiculous that people who come here on a temporary visa believe they have a right to stay permanently they have decided unilaterally that it doesn t matter what the law says it doesn t matter what rational expectations might be they are entitled to remain in the united states indefinitely congress has a responsibility to american citizens said jenks to ignore the needs of americans and ignore the cost to americans and to instead grant special favors to the foreigners is ludicrous she added these adult children are good for campaign p r especially because few reporters show any skepticism or even recognize that the children s taxpayer funded education in the united states makes them valuable hires in their homeland much of the stealth campaign for the expansion included personalized arguments during face to face lobbying of legislators in their home districts usually by the visa workers indian doctors and their children advocates for the giveaway campaign also added the adult children of non indian e 2 visa holders the e 2 visas allow some foreigners to stay in the united states while they are running a business the corporate giveaway was backed by some gop leaders the yes voters included rep tom emmer r mn a former lobbyist who now runs the gop s 2022 campaign committee tom cole the pro outsourcing top republican member of the rules committee and rep john katko r ny the top republican on the homeland security committee the giveaway was also backed by anti trump republicans rep liz cheney r wy rep adam kinzinger r il and rep peter meijer r mi many of the gop supporters have influential groups of indian visa workers in or near their district this group includes herrea beutler and rep marianette miller meeks r ia the leading gop sponsor of the legislation with deborah ross d nc today the house passed my amendment which will protect over 200 000 documented dreamers miller meeks said in a tweet these dreamers grew up in the united states and call this place home sadly due to a broken immigration system many of them are forced to leave the myvisajobs com site sketches out the number of h 1b in each state north carolina for example those numbers show perhaps one quarter of the resident population of white collar outsourcing workers such as h 1bs l 1s j 1s h4eads tns b 1 b 2s and opts that white collar inflow does not include the inflow of legal immigrants and the semi legal inflow across the southern border like many other americans miller meeks iowa constituents lose local white collar jobs and wage increases because of the visa workers but they also lose possible jobs wealth and status because the federal migration economic policy sends myriad new workers renters and consumers to coastal investors in their coastal states the population pipelines minimize pressure on coastal based investors to hire people and serve consumers in distant midwestern states many other midwest republicans also voted for the bill that diverts wealth and investment from their districts they included jim baird r in rep troy balderson r oh rep jack bergman r mi rep larry bucshon r in rep anthony gonzalez d oh rep bill johnson r oh rep dave joyce r oh rep michael turner r oh rep billy long r mo and rep ann wagner r mo many of their parents are h 1b visa holders who have allowed themselves to be used as pawns to displace american workers from their jobs which is exactly what the program was designed to do you re not only inappropriately rewarding the practice but encouraging more of it fair fairimmigration july 15 2022 in contrast the many coastal democrats who voted for the giveaway strengthened the federal incentives that enrich home state investors and landlords their support for the surge of wage cutting and rent boosting visa workers also hurts their districts american employees and renters pro migration republicans backed the giveaway even though the bill benefits visa workers not immigrants they included orchard owner rep dan newhouse r wa rep jaime herrea beutler r wa and rep david valadao rca other supporters of the corporate giveaway include rep nancy mace r sc and rep kat cammack r fl many of the gop yes voters are expected to be gone after the 2022 election they included cheney kinzinger upton katko rep kevin brady r tx rep madison cawthorn r nc rep anthony gonzalez r oh rep bob gibbs r oh and rodney davis r il in addition newhouse meijer and herrera beutler face tough primary races the gop s rising number of pro migration latino representatives mostly voted for the corporate giveaway to the indian white collar workers that take jobs from american latino graduates they include rep mayra flores of texas rep elvira salazar r fl tony gonzalez r tx diaz balart r fl rep mike garcia r ca and rep carlos gimenez r fl business first republicans also backed the giveaway they included rep michael mccaul r tx mark amodei r nv rep patrick fitzgerald r pa rep darrell issa r ca and rep young kim r ca and rep michelle steel r ca democrats padded the final result 277 yeas to 150 nays by combining miller meeks giveaway amendment into a difficult to resist en bloc mega amendment of almost 140 different amendments the bloc of amendments included roughly 21 amendments proposed by republicans including barr r ky amendment no 468 requires the secretary of state to report on chinese support to russia with respect to its unprovoked invasion of and full scale war against ukraine cammack kat r fl amendment no 479 requires a report on the feasibility of establishing a u s customs and border protection cbp preclearance facility on taiwan crenshaw r tx amendment no 498 requires sec of state reporting on what is needed to provide access to free and uncensored media in the chinese market foxx r nc amendment no 512 creates an inspector general for the office of management and budget to bring transparency and accountability to the agency tenney r ny amendment no 422 restricts the ability of covered entities owned directed controlled financed or influenced directly or indirectly by the government of the people s republic of china the ccp or the chinese military from using federal funds from engaging entering into and awarding public works contracts barr tenney and foxx voted for the en bloc amendment but rep dan crenshaw r tx voted no the democratic leaders buried their giveaway in an en bloc amendment to help protect their members from the voter opposition to the giveaway said jenks any member of congress who voted for this can say oh no i didn t vote for it because of that amendment i voted for it because of x y or z amendment she said some of the republicans didn t even know the amendment was in there and they voted for it to get something completely different and now they re like oh crap i voted for that jenks added here s the states that still have primaries that people can vote out pro amnesty republicans michigan washington minnesota wyoming florida new york louisiana ryan james girdusky ryangirdusky july 15 2022 extraction migration since at least 1990 the d c establishment has extracted tens of millions of legal and illegal migrants and temporary visa workers from poor countries to serve as workers consumers and renters for various u s investors and ceos this federal economic policy of extraction migration has skewed the free market in the united states by inflating the labor supply for the benefit of employers the inflationary policy makes it difficult for ordinary americans to get married advance in their careers raise families or buy homes extraction migration has also slowed innovation and shrunk americans productivity partly because it allows employers to boost stock prices by using cheap stoop labor instead of productivity boosting technology migration undermines employees workplace rights and it widens the regional wealth gaps between the democrats big coastal states and the republicans heartland and southern states the flood of cheap labor tilts the economy towards low productivity jobs and has shoved at least ten million american men out of the labor force an economy built on extraction migration also drains americans political clout over elites alienates young people and radicalizes americans democratic civic culture because it allows wealthy elites to ignore despairing americans at the bottom of society the economic policy is backed by progressives who wish to transform the u s from a society governed by european origin civic culture into a progressive directed empire of competitive resentful identity groups we re trying to become the first multiracial multi ethnic superpower in the world rep rohit khanna d ca told the new york times in march 2022 it will be an extraordinary achievement we will ultimately triumph he boasted the progressives colonialism like economic strategy kills many migrants it exploits poor foreigners and splits foreign families as it extracts human resource wealth from poor home countries to serve wealthy u s investors this migration policy also minimizes shareholder pressure on u s companies to build up beneficial and complementary trade with people in poor countries business backed migration advocates hide this extraction migration economic policy behind a wide variety of noble sounding explanations and theatrical border security programs for example progressives claim that the u s is a nation of immigrants that migration is good for migrants and that the state must renew itself by replacing populations the polls show the public wants to welcome some immigration but they also show deep and broad public opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young u s graduates the opposition is growing anti establishment multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity that americans owe to one another

from the it keeps happening dept it s no secret that techdirt believes youtube s copyright enforcement program is an absolute mess on the one hand it s difficult to be too hard on the company after all it is trying to figure out how to enforce draconian copyright laws in countries like america at a scale that is absolutely absurd on the other hand the way it works today is so wide open for fraud and abuse that it s literally a challenge to pick out which of a ton of stories i want to link to in order to show the history of fraud mistakes and nefarious copyright claims taken for reasons that fall completely outside of any interest in copyright law or protection and it just keeps happening meet lofi girl the name of a youtube account that streams low fidelity hip hop music to serve as background music for studying or resting two of lofi girl s live streams were taken down after someone submitted a copyright takedown notice for them that copyright takedown notice was shared by lofi girl on twitter and well the lofi radios have been taken down because of false copyright strikes hopefully youtubecreators youtube will sort this quickly pic twitter com x01hl6jt2n lofi girl lofigirl july 10 2022 forgive my american centric viewpoint on this but it seems like a copyright claim from some random music publisher in malaysia probably should have triggered a deeper dive into whether there was actually infringing activity here or not instead because of youtube s stock policy youtube simply took the streams down and informed lofi girl it had done so many on social media noticed all this and took to the streamer s defense many rallied behind lofi girl on monday using the hashtag bringbacklofigirl with some also criticizing youtube s copyright strike policies and eventually youtube rescinded the copyright takedown and removed the strikes from lofi girl s channel and that s all well and good except that the only reason anyone even had to go through this exercise is because youtube s reporting system is so completely wide open that it practically begs for this kind of fraud and abuse the remaining question is when is youtube going to get around to doing anything about that filed under content moderation copyright lofi girl streaming companies youtube

with a million babies born each year kenya s annual diaper consumption is estimated at 800 million pieces the government considers them essential items and has lately been encouraging manufacturing firms to set up shop in the country to supply the east african region as of june 2021 the country had a total of seven diaper firms which were allowed to import manufacturing materials largely plastics duty free however there has been much less attention paid to where the diapers end up one group of researchers found that in kenya as in many developing countries it appears that little information is available regarding handling and the proper disposal of disposable diapers despite a significant rise in usage of such during the last decade by women of child bearing age as a result diapers are contributing to a dramatic increase in plastic pollution one that has raised concerns in government and in kenya s mainstream media by 2013 the department of public health was warning that poor disposal of diapers was a leading cause of disease as well as blocked drainage in major urban areas and the problem is intensifying as diapers become cheaper and mothers in rural kenya gravitate to them for their convenience in fact around the world disposable diapers represent about 4 per cent of all solid waste and are the third largest contributor to single use consumer items in landfills when my neighbour esther was expecting her fourth child a few years ago she took a ride with me into nakuru town to buy supplies in anticipation of the happy event on her shopping list were washable nappies i have since learned that among her peers esther is the exception the vast majority of mothers here have adopted the disposable diaper we live on the edge of a small township in nyandarua county that boasts a health centre complete with a maternity wing our local minimarket a family run business stocks most of the diaper brands available in kenya from those targeting the young mum living in nairobi s leafy suburbs to those made specifically for the mother who earns a ksh250 daily wage selling her labour to neighbouring farms or ekes out a living selling vegetables or second hand clothes at our local market competition among manufacturers and importers of baby diapers has drastically reduced prices local producers have also adapted to the kadogo economy selling individually wrapped baby diapers for as little as ksh20 apiece the clinical officer at our health centre informs me that on average the maternity wing delivers 250 babies a year alice who runs the minimarket and who is herself a mother of twins told me that before they were toilet trained at just over two years old her bundles of joy were using up to six diapers each per day the math is very worrying it will take about 20 generations of alice s descendants for the diapers used by her children to decompose early 21st century disposable diapers will finish biodegrading in 2500 washable nappies are not a choice for alice however not unless she is willing to finish a 14 hour day with her hands deep in a bucket of soiled nappies alice tells me that unlike in the past women employed by families to take care of babies and young children have become accustomed to the convenience of diapers and are no longer willing to take on the additional task of washing soiled cloth nappies our little township borders the aberdare forest which has become a dumping ground for soiled diapers i became aware of the dumping after i found mounds of used diapers on a piece of fallow land adjacent to my property worried that i would soon find myself living next to a growing garbage dump i determined to find out the source of the dumping ours is a small community and my enquiries led me straight to the offending mother who challenged complained that her children had not done as they had been told she normally dumps her used diapers in the forest when she goes to gather firewood so she told me a stroll into the forest confirmed that indeed our forest was being used as a dumping ground for diapers one pile had been left so perilously close to the river that come the rains it would soon add to the growing menace that is river pollution by diapers but why was this happening a department of health official attached to our local health centre told me that the problem was directly linked to inadequate resources and personnel solid waste management falls under the department of health services of the nyandarua county government for the 2019 2020 fiscal year the approved budget allocation to ensure the controlled disposal of solid waste and human remains within the entire county of 638 289 people was ksh7 603 000 projected to rise to ksh8 million for the 2021 2022 fiscal year nyandarua has four sub counties kinangop kipipiri ol joro orok and ndaragwa ndaragwa sub county covers a total surface area of 653 km² and has four wards leshau kiriita central and shamata with a total population of approximately 92 626 people the sub county is served by one of only three garbage trucks owned by the county government the truck collects waste from our township once a week and takes it 60 kilometres away to the municipal dump at ol kalou the county capital however frequent breakdowns and lack of fuel mean that we can go weeks without having our garbage collected and since the county government s budget has not stretched to refuse bins residents resort to digging pits into which they throw their household waste consisting mostly of plastic wrapping plastic bottles torn shopping bags and the now ubiquitous disposable face masks the single use plastic bags that were banned by the government in 2017 are also sneaking their way back into the environment used by unscrupulous butchers as packaging a visit to our local slaughterhouse is enough to put you off your meat bits of plastic show up in the guts of the carcasses of goats and cows that have been grazing in our public spaces the accumulating mounds of rubbish are set alight releasing toxic fumes into the air used diapers however are notoriously difficult to burn you need a lot of kerosene so where do they end up in our surrounding environment of course soiled diapers are rolled up and dumped in ditches and on open ground under cover of darkness to be torn open by stray dogs and picked over by fowl let loose more fastidious mothers pay people to dispose of them in the bush or like my neighbour take them there themselves when i asked about the options open to those living in areas without waste collection services on farms and villages deep in the countryside the department of health official told me that they are encouraged to bury soiled diapers on their land thus introducing the concept of landfill to individual households as for the mounds now festering in our forest the official told me that it would be up to the forestry department to clear up the waste since it had been dumped within their jurisdiction a call to the local office of the forest service made it clear that the answer was not that clear cut the official i spoke to informed me that the matter had been raised with the local administration through the chief s office and a solution was awaited he did not sound hopeful manufacturers of disposable diapers give very clear instructions about how to use them and warn parents to keep the packaging out of the reach of children because of the danger of suffocation i found only one that specifically urged users not to throw soiled diapers into the toilet but to put them out with the trash instead bizarrely this manufacturer also encouraged the user to return the plastic packaging to the company s offices in nairobi none advised against throwing them out into the environment where they add to the growing volume of human faecal matter and the attendant pathogens and nor were users encouraged to empty the waste into the toilet before disposing of diapers this lack of information means that there is a lack of awareness among the population as to the true cost of opting for disposable diapers many mothers only see the advantages of using them complaining only that they are difficult to burn none that i spoke to knew that their used diapers would take centuries to biodegrade and that they are polluting our sources of water this story is not unique to nyandarua county however residents in the urban areas of kisumu county have also taken to disposing soiled diapers in the environment in the dead of night the situation is no better in kilifi county where in june 2019 the chief officer for environment and natural resources mariam jenneby called for a total ban on single use plastics and disposable diapers saying that they were a major cause of ocean pollution kilifi county s solid waste management budget for the 2020 2021 fiscal year stood at ksh14 100 000 of which ksh5 1 million was for the purchase of a double cabin vehicle for environmental conservation and management extension services the rest would go to fencing and rehabilitating the mariakani dumpsite installing refuse bins in mariakani municipality and purchasing assorted tools and equipment no mention is made of recycling the county has a population of 1 109 735 people 2019 and covers an area of 12 610km² 2 17 per cent of kenya s total surface area on the other side of the country in kisumu county whose population stands at 1 155 574 people spread out over an area of 2 086km² the budget allocation for solid waste management for the 2020 2021 financial year was ksh3 190 998 all of it earmarked for the purchase of goods and services no mention is made of recycling it is however observed in the document that the objective to strengthen solid waste management in kisumu county has been met and that effective planning management and execution of service delivery outcomes are at 100 per cent the residents of kisumu tell a somewhat different story however there is no objective reason to believe that the situation of solid waste management in the other 44 counties of kenya is any different on the contrary it would appear that the 2015 national solid waste management strategy developed by the national environment management authority nema and whose main guiding principle is zero waste remains a dead letter the short term goal of the strategy is to achieve approximately 80 waste recovery recycling composting and waste energy and 20 landfilling in a sanitary landfill inert material by 2030 but as observed above the budget allocations for nyandarua kisumu and kilifi do not cater for the cost of recycling and while it is a fact that most solid waste is generated in urban areas disposable diapers have made their way into the rural areas where as observed they are playing havoc with the environment at its unveiling the constitution of kenya 2010 was hailed as among the most progressive world wide for addressing issues that are seldom addressed by national law indeed article 42 of the constitution recognises the right of every person to a clean and healthy environment while article 69 provides the obligations of the state in this regard that include the obligation to eliminate processes and activities that are likely to endanger the environment diaper manufacturers were among the beneficiaries of the decision announced by treasury cabinet secretary ukur yattani in his june 2020 budget to remove import duty on inputs in order to boost local manufacturing and create jobs but even as the government incentivises manufacturers and encourages investment in the production of a highly polluting product there is no policy in place on how to manage the growing waste resulting from the increased use of disposable diapers barely two decades ago single use diapers were alien to the majority of kenyan mothers they should have remained so by incentivising the production and imports of disposable diapers under the guise of creating employment and using the argument that baby diapers are essential products and there is a need to supply them at affordable prices the government has not only failed in its constitutional obligation to deter activities that are a menace to the environment but has also needlessly compounded the challenges of solid waste management in the country moreover kenya has squandered the reputational capital earned with the 2017 ban on plastic carrier bags by resisting the introduction of disposable diapers one of the biggest contributors to plastic waste globally kenya could have taken the lead in halting the progression of a disposable diaper pandemic that began in the united states over 70 years ago every minute 300 000 more diapers are released into the environment that could be replaced with compostable nappies for example however the adoption of an alternative to the disposable diaper would require the full commitment of governments and manufacturers the second part of article 69 of the constitution states that every person has a duty to cooperate with state organs and other persons to protect and conserve the environment however both the national government and the county governments have failed to take the lead and it has been left to youthful civil society organizations such as the kenya environmental action network kean to raise awareness regarding the polluting effects of the disposable diaper in september 2021 kean partnered with kisumu environmental champions who describe themselves as a group of kids teenagers and youths from kisumu county working on environmental education and climate action to organize a climate strike where they called for a ban on plastic diapers and plastics in general the recently concluded united nations environment assembly unea issued a resolution calling on un member states to continue and step up activities and adopt voluntary measures to combat plastic pollution including measures related to sustainable consumption and production which may include circular economy approaches in the absence of such measures youthful kenyans are stepping into the breach too keenly aware of the environmental future that awaits them if no action is taken leafylife is a kenyan start up that is using green chemistry to recycle waste diapers and sanitary pads sustainably using a circular economy approach the social enterprise has developed a chemical process that recycles the waste into a fuel gel that lasts 10 per cent longer than kerosene emits 76 per cent less carbon dioxide and no carbon monoxide smoke or soot leafylife was founded by a trio of graduates from the department of chemistry of the university of nairobi who were moved to act in 2019 when they became aware of the threat posed by discarded disposable diapers peter gachanja denis muguta and melvin kizito received recognition for their innovation on the occasion of the global sustainable chemistry week organized by the international sustainable chemistry collaborative centre isc3 in frankfurt am main germany in november 2021 but can initiatives such as leafylife become successful without the development and implementation of a robust framework that actively encourages local innovation in the field of solid waste management the global baby disposable diaper industry was valued at us 43 billion in 2020 and continues to grow without decisive government action and if the unea call for an end to plastic pollution remains another dead letter the industry will continue to thrive and a product designed to

nine ok getty images stock cheyenne wyo lyle neiberger would have turned 33 this year but he is forever 17 frozen in his father lance s memory i ve never been angry at my son i ve always been angry at me why didn t i see it what if i would have done something different he lamented while sitting in his woodshop at his home in central wyoming it s been 16 years since lyle died by suicide lance neiberger had no idea his son was contemplating suicide and lyle left no note behind memories of lyle line the walls of neiberger s woodshop a hobby father and son bonded over we re all in the cowboy up attitude you know real men don t cry real men don t have problems he said here in wyoming nicknamed the cowboy state real men are taught that when they have a problem they pick up and fix it without looking back neiberger said we all have something go wrong and we all need help at times and when you learn that you don t need help and you just go on maybe that makes life a lot tougher neiberger said u s suicide rates are the highest they ve been since world war ii at 30 5 per 100 000 persons in 2020 wyoming s rate is more than double that of the national average and the highest rate per capita in the nation according to the wyoming department of health at 71 neiberger has taken on the responsibility of helping to curb wyoming s high suicide rate by telling lyle s story to schools in the surrounding area and by heading the natrona county suicide prevention task force he hopes he can save at least one life the task force meets once a month in casper wyoming to plan events pool resources and keep track of the lives lost at nearly 60 000 residents casper is wyoming s second largest city casper police chief keith mcpheeters told abc news that his officers respond to suicide calls twice as often as they do for shoplifting i just want to go over the statistics that we are showing year to date last year my officers had responded to 256 persons who were considering suicide and this year we have seen an absolute negligible change so year to date from may 15 253 he said at a recent task force meeting sixteen years ago one of those calls came from lance neiberger when he found lyle at home neiberger said he had no idea his son was suicidal there isn t a day that goes by that i don t think about him now after his death it was horrible it was just miserable it was crying it was the whys the kicking yourself everything today i can often think about lyle just with a smile on my face i came to a point where i realized that it was lyle s decision and his decision only he said when asked why he thinks the suicide rate in wyoming is so high he had many reasons one of them the state s rural landscape wyoming accounting for its land mass is the tenth largest state in the country by population it s the smallest so even if you wanted help help might be a long way from you andrea summerville the executive director of the wyoming association of mental health substance abuse centers showed abc news trevor ault the area right outside of casper she pointed out miles and miles of sweeping plains with very few people in sight you ll hit a major town about every hundred miles and when i say a town i mean a town of 5 000 people she said you might get a call from somebody that s 100 miles away from the nearest town but you might also just not have the mental health professionals wyoming has been a mental health professional shortage area always designated by the rural health agency the entire state not just an area not just a town but the entire state now federal legislation to help any american in crisis reach a counselor by phone is set to launch july 16 it will transition the ten digit suicide hotline into a three digit number 988 but in wyoming even that will be an uphill climb to adopt there are some logistics tied with 988 specifically things like geo location so with 911 everybody knows if you call 911 they know where you re at to locate your cellphone you re not going to find a cell tower every 50 miles or so here and so making sure that we are meeting those infrastructure challenges is probably going to be our biggest most expensive long term project summerville said the 988 hotline is being touted as a one stop shop for anyone experiencing a mental health crisis but funding the project so that health care providers are ready for the influx of calls is proving to be challenging similarly to 911 988 will be funded by a monthly fee on all phone lines the fee is determined by each state the department of health and human services expects the volume of calls to double within the first year however according to the national alliance on mental illness only colorado nevada washington and virginia have enacted a comprehensive plan for funding the central wyoming counseling center is one of two suicide hotlines centers already up and running in wyoming it opened two years ago the workers know this state s layout its culture its resources or lack thereof which is essential in a crisis they ve secured 2 1 million to expand the suicide hotline to a 24 hour service most of it federal money from the american rescue plan act that wisconsin gov mark gordon appropriated but with the state legislature refusing to expand medicaid federal funding will soon run out summerville told abc news they currently only have the funding to continue 988 for two more years in terms of putting it into operation in wyoming it s going to take a lot of work we only have four crisis stabilization centers across the state so how do we move people across the state according to the centers for disease control and prevention of the 45 979 who died by suicide in the united states in 2020 nearly 70 were white men men are less likely to reach out for help a fact that dr amanda dediego an assistant professor at the university of wyoming is all too aware of there s that heavy heavy stigma about help seeking behavior and then there s not a lot of options for you to be able to seek care in these rural communities and have your confidentiality it s not that your provider is not honoring the confidentiality it s just that everybody knows everything dedeigo said along with lisa scroggins the executive director of the natrona county library she is spearheading a new project to create spaces that sidestep the issue of stigma it s called wyoming public access to telehealth services or wypaths it will be a booth placed in local libraries that is soundproof and provides a space for people to be able to connect through telehealth to their health care providers they plan on training library staff across wyoming in suicide prevention a big part of the training is being empathetic to your fellow citizen or resident so seeing the person who walks into the door and realizing their situation may be different than yours and looking for signs that a person may be needing help and then saying hey right here here s your help said scroggins lance neiberger still thinks about how lyle didn t come to him about his negative thoughts when he reflects on the loss of his son he didn t feel comfortable enough to come to me and say dad life s kicking my butt i m really struggling here so i think what he was doing was acting up and as his drama increased i got angry i didn t like the drama we weren t communicating about the problem so he took his drama to another level and i took my anger to another level and at the time of his death and when he needed me the most i wasn t there for him because we were going in opposite directions instead of working together he said neiberger said he considered taking his own life during the six months after lyle died it wasn t until our daughter gave birth to our granddaughter that i really realized what i would have missed had i not lived back then as neiberger stared at lyle s gravestone decorated with mementos from friends and family he couldn t help but wonder what his son s life would have been like had he lived past 17 but he is determined to keep having these very uncomfortable conversations in the hopes that lyle s death will not be in vain that s what keeps me going my faith in the fact that i truly believe i ll see him again someday i ll be with him that s what s given me the hope to continue he said if you are struggling with thoughts of suicide or worried about a friend or loved one help is available call the national suicide prevention lifeline at 1 800 273 8255 for free confidential emotional support 24

the hit fx series the bear was just renewed for a second season following its smash success fx if you ve ever prepped onions and veg in the wee hours of the morning for the day s lunch rush if you ve ever been yelled at by the dishwasher for not peeling the labels off the cambros before they hit the sinks if you ve ever dropped a tray full of freshly baked cookies in front of customers and the business owner on your first day then fx hulu s buzzy new show the bear will slap you right back into the thick of those suppressed memories the bear depicts a young chef with an extensive fine dining background who abruptly returns home to chicago to run his family s sandwich shop following the tragic death of someone close to him it s a show filled with all the thorny relatable moments most back of the house staff experience and it s a refreshingly honest depiction of what goes on behind the scenes to bring customers their favorite sandwich or blue plate special i speak from experience as someone who toiled as a cook and dishwasher at small independently run eateries with questionable ethics and paperthin budgets in sacramento needless to say not all of my experiences as a woman of color working in the restaurant industry were ones that i was ready to revisit yet i binged the entire show in two days advertisement article continues below this ad for bay area chefs the bear brought up feelings of anxiety so much so that many admitted to turning the show off and walking away variety calls it one of the most stressful shows while the atlantic said it was the antithesis of comfort tv at the same time they d find themselves returning to find out whether or not its leading character carmy played by jeremy allen white shameless could truly turn the beloved chicago sandwich shop with its hard knock kitchen crew around the outside of kristin houk s restaurant tato in the bayview neighborhood ed u yelp after watching the first episode chef owner of all good pizza cafe alma and tato kristin houk said the patriarchal elements of the show s kitchen were all too familiar i think that they ve captured the chaos of a kitchen for sure houk said just the intense intense pressure and for me as a woman i always felt there was a lot of sexism in the kitchen as well and a lot of really shitty behavior quite frankly advertisement article continues below this ad as a third generation chef jarad gallagher who s worked in michelin starred kitchens such as chez tj and owns a barbecue joint in san juan bautista called the smoke point found the show s gritty depiction of the small chicago eatery refreshing it had a really good realistic look into how these aren t all lavish facilities gallagher said it was enjoyable seeing that carmy kind of became the way he is because of a collection of his experiences and they re not all good he deals with all of the hardships that any business owner has to and then he has to be a chef chef jarad gallagher is the executive chef of broma in mountain view and also the owner of the smoke point in san juan bautista courtesy of alejandro velarde for gallagher who now is the executive chef at iberian spanish restaurant broma in mountain view the pressures on display in every episode of the bear remind him of all the tense moments he s experienced throughout his career cooking across six continents and throughout the country including in chicago advertisement article continues below this ad it has also really exposed some of the negative so when the chef was standing next to in the french laundry where he was just telling him basically that he s worthless that happens gallagher said it s happened to me in europe it s happened to me in new york chicago and here it was a little overdone but it happens as far as the accuracy of how the show s chicago based kitchen known for its sliced dipped beef sandwiches was portrayed chef owner of nightbird kim alter said she was pleasantly surprised at its efforts to get it right i felt like they must ve had a really good consultant or the person who wrote was in this business because i would say 98 of shows that i watch are ridiculous alter said she pointed to details that the bear got right including the cutting of the tape used to make labels for food prep and the dishwasher as an indication of how the show captured all the things that this industry is chef owner of nightbird kim alter in the kitchen courtesy of adahlia cole it felt a little exaggerated in some parts based on how i am in my kitchen and how i ve been in other kitchens she continued but for the most part it s pretty dead on advertisement article continues below this ad alter said she s worked with every type of person portrayed in the bear whether it was during her early days as a commis or when she rose to the title of executive chef characters such as the ambitious leading sous chef sydney to the hothead ritchie who has deep ties to the family restaurant alter has cooked with them all actor jeremy allen white plays carmen carmy berzatto in the hit fx series the bear fx throughout the show lead character carmy endures vivid flashbacks that thrust him head first into the high pressure situations of his michelin star kitchen days for alter those scenes in particular were highly relatable as someone who s worked in some of the most successful restaurants in the bay area including manresa ubuntu aqua and acquerello all i ever was in growing up was very militant disciplined kitchens and i personally like that alter said i think it gives you consistency and it builds a better cook i don t agree with how i ve been treated my entire career i don t treat people the way that i was treated but the discipline of a michelin star kitchen where you re cutting your tape and everyone s chef and you re just working hard it leads to a better product so that part didn t give me anxiety advertisement article continues below this ad kim alter of nightbird making sure tickets are all accounted during dinner service courtesy of adahlia cole what did stick out to alter in the show was stressful moments such as when the restaurant s toilet breaks and there s no choice but to open or when the power goes out adding to the day to day challenges as a chef cooking is the easy part it s the dealing with the personalities it s the dealing with your toilet breaking your power going out at 7 o clock like all of those things are never really portrayed because it s a little bit more romantic in movies or tv alter said that s the reality of it consistently everyday it s something and that s very relatable to me literally every week my power goes out or a customer flips out or i get extorted by google so it s relatable in that sense for chef owner adam rosenblum of red window causwells and little red window the anxiety felt in the silence during carmy s michelin star flashbacks reminded him why that path as a chef just wasn t for him advertisement article continues below this ad each episode that i ve seen there s been a little piece that has hit home rosenblum said all my friends went the fine dining route they were the ones getting berated and yelled at and told that they were a piece of garbage that just has zero appeal to me i wanted to make really good food but i knew from early on that i just wouldn t thrive in that kind of environment however there was one instance in the bear that rosenblum said was completely inaccurate when the full 22 of veal stock was on the top shelf i was like no one in their right mind would do that he said a no one would have taken the effort to lift something that heavy onto the top shelf when there s plenty of room elsewhere and b you know how that s going to end chef adam rosenblum is the chef owner of red window causwells and little red window in san francisco courtesy of stephanie amberg rosenblum said being a good leader for his restaurant family who are sometimes the folks he sees more than his own wife and kids is high on his list of priorities the show s hard look into drug and alcohol abuse for example was a reminder of how some chefs and their kitchen crew deal with the stresses of the job advertisement article continues below this ad it s pretty noticeable when people are abusing obviously at work we have a zero drug policy but then it s more than that he said when we re seeing someone struggling it s about talking to them and figuring out how we can support them across all of his restaurants in san francisco rosenblum says the challenges seem never ending but that doesn t stop the order tickets from pouring in at the end of the day there are a lot of things that keep him in this fast paced high stress environment and the food is just one aspect actor ayo edebiri plays sous chef sydney adamu in the fx series the bear fx there s a lot of things that keep me in this ridiculous industry it is so silly especially now with all of the labor issues that we re having it s even sillier he said we re all stretched even thinner and costs are going up and margins are going down it is the wrong time to be in the restaurant business but it s also a great time i think it s always going to be like that there s always going to be something that brings us down and then there s going to be all of these positive things that remind us of why we do what we do advertisement article continues below this ad with high profile instances of accused sexual harassment from east coast restauranteur mario batali whose trial began in may to the alleged hostile and abusive work environment created by celebrity chef owner michael chiarello of the san francisco tapas bar coqueta the industry is already working to address the issues of problematic behavior seen on the bear to combat toxic behavior across her restaurants houk told sfgate that she first and foremost hires women all good pizza for example is her all women led restaurant in the bayview hunters point neighborhood houk is also the head chef owner of tato and her third restaurant cafe alma is also helmed by a woman she also conducts extensive training with everyone on staff when they join which includes equality and kitchen safety courses to ensure everyone knows they have a voice

nine ok getty images stock cheyenne wyo lyle neiberger would have turned 33 this year but he is forever 17 frozen in his father lance s memory i ve never been angry at my son i ve always been angry at me why didn t i see it what if i would have done something different he lamented while sitting in his woodshop at his home in central wyoming it s been 16 years since lyle died by suicide lance neiberger had no idea his son was contemplating suicide and lyle left no note behind memories of lyle line the walls of neiberger s woodshop a hobby father and son bonded over we re all in the cowboy up attitude you know real men don t cry real men don t have problems he said here in wyoming nicknamed the cowboy state real men are taught that when they have a problem they pick up and fix it without looking back neiberger said we all have something go wrong and we all need help at times and when you learn that you don t need help and you just go on maybe that makes life a lot tougher neiberger said u s suicide rates are the highest they ve been since world war ii at 30 5 per 100 000 persons in 2020 wyoming s rate is more than double that of the national average and the highest rate per capita in the nation according to the wyoming department of health at 71 neiberger has taken on the responsibility of helping to curb wyoming s high suicide rate by telling lyle s story to schools in the surrounding area and by heading the natrona county suicide prevention task force he hopes he can save at least one life the task force meets once a month in casper wyoming to plan events pool resources and keep track of the lives lost at nearly 60 000 residents casper is wyoming s second largest city casper police chief keith mcpheeters told abc news that his officers respond to suicide calls twice as often as they do for shoplifting i just want to go over the statistics that we are showing year to date last year my officers had responded to 256 persons who were considering suicide and this year we have seen an absolute negligible change so year to date from may 15 253 he said at a recent task force meeting sixteen years ago one of those calls came from lance neiberger when he found lyle at home neiberger said he had no idea his son was suicidal there isn t a day that goes by that i don t think about him now after his death it was horrible it was just miserable it was crying it was the whys the kicking yourself everything today i can often think about lyle just with a smile on my face i came to a point where i realized that it was lyle s decision and his decision only he said when asked why he thinks the suicide rate in wyoming is so high he had many reasons one of them the state s rural landscape wyoming accounting for its land mass is the tenth largest state in the country by population it s the smallest so even if you wanted help help might be a long way from you andrea summerville the executive director of the wyoming association of mental health substance abuse centers showed abc news trevor ault the area right outside of casper she pointed out miles and miles of sweeping plains with very few people in sight you ll hit a major town about every hundred miles and when i say a town i mean a town of 5 000 people she said you might get a call from somebody that s 100 miles away from the nearest town but you might also just not have the mental health professionals wyoming has been a mental health professional shortage area always designated by the rural health agency the entire state not just an area not just a town but the entire state now federal legislation to help any american in crisis reach a counselor by phone is set to launch july 16 it will transition the ten digit suicide hotline into a three digit number 988 but in wyoming even that will be an uphill climb to adopt there are some logistics tied with 988 specifically things like geo location so with 911 everybody knows if you call 911 they know where you re at to locate your cellphone you re not going to find a cell tower every 50 miles or so here and so making sure that we are meeting those infrastructure challenges is probably going to be our biggest most expensive long term project summerville said the 988 hotline is being touted as a one stop shop for anyone experiencing a mental health crisis but funding the project so that health care providers are ready for the influx of calls is proving to be challenging similarly to 911 988 will be funded by a monthly fee on all phone lines the fee is determined by each state the department of health and human services expects the volume of calls to double within the first year however according to the national alliance on mental illness only colorado nevada washington and virginia have enacted a comprehensive plan for funding the central wyoming counseling center is one of two suicide hotlines centers already up and running in wyoming it opened two years ago the workers know this state s layout its culture its resources or lack thereof which is essential in a crisis they ve secured 2 1 million to expand the suicide hotline to a 24 hour service most of it federal money from the american rescue plan act that wisconsin gov mark gordon appropriated but with the state legislature refusing to expand medicaid federal funding will soon run out summerville told abc news they currently only have the funding to continue 988 for two more years in terms of putting it into operation in wyoming it s going to take a lot of work we only have four crisis stabilization centers across the state so how do we move people across the state according to the centers for disease control and prevention of the 45 979 who died by suicide in the united states in 2020 nearly 70 were white men men are less likely to reach out for help a fact that dr amanda dediego an assistant professor at the university of wyoming is all too aware of there s that heavy heavy stigma about help seeking behavior and then there s not a lot of options for you to be able to seek care in these rural communities and have your confidentiality it s not that your provider is not honoring the confidentiality it s just that everybody knows everything dedeigo said along with lisa scroggins the executive director of the natrona county library she is spearheading a new project to create spaces that sidestep the issue of stigma it s called wyoming public access to telehealth services or wypaths it will be a booth placed in local libraries that is soundproof and provides a space for people to be able to connect through telehealth to their health care providers they plan on training library staff across wyoming in suicide prevention a big part of the training is being empathetic to your fellow citizen or resident so seeing the person who walks into the door and realizing their situation may be different than yours and looking for signs that a person may be needing help and then saying hey right here here s your help said scroggins lance neiberger still thinks about how lyle didn t come to him about his negative thoughts when he reflects on the loss of his son he didn t feel comfortable enough to come to me and say dad life s kicking my butt i m really struggling here so i think what he was doing was acting up and as his drama increased i got angry i didn t like the drama we weren t communicating about the problem so he took his drama to another level and i took my anger to another level and at the time of his death and when he needed me the most i wasn t there for him because we were going in opposite directions instead of working together he said neiberger said he considered taking his own life during the six months after lyle died it wasn t until our daughter gave birth to our granddaughter that i really realized what i would have missed had i not lived back then as neiberger stared at lyle s gravestone decorated with mementos from friends and family he couldn t help but wonder what his son s life would have been like had he lived past 17 but he is determined to keep having these very uncomfortable conversations in the hopes that lyle s death will not be in vain that s what keeps me going my faith in the fact that i truly believe i ll see him again someday i ll be with him that s what s given me the hope to continue he said if you are struggling with thoughts of suicide or worried about a friend or loved one help is available call the national suicide prevention lifeline at 1 800 273 8255 for free confidential emotional support 24

the first half of 2022 will go down as one of the more challenging market environments many investors have ever experienced the s p 500 fell 20 its worst performance at the midway point of a year since 1970 52 years ago broad u s bonds delivered their worst start to a year in history down 11 investors would be forgiven if they thought bonds might offer some salvation during a stock bear market coming into the year bonds had posted positive returns in 42 out of the past 46 years with an average intra year drop of only 3 1 however stocks and bonds fell sharply in tandem during the first six months of 2022 joining nearly every other major asset class deeply in the red the peculiarity of this year s stock and bond market dynamics warrants some additional discussion in 2008 while in the midst of a severe global financial crisis and with the s p 500 down 37 broad bonds finished the year up 5 during the fourth quarter of 2018 while the s p 500 plummeted nearly 20 heading into christmas no santa claus rally that year broad bonds were up 1 over the same time period during the march 2020 covid crash the s p 500 dropped 34 in only 23 trading days despite significant stress in the financial system broad bonds were still only down 1 over the same time period the bottom line is that high quality bonds have typically served as a ballast during steep market sell offs they have been a place to hide a place of refuge not in 2022 so what s going on sometimes investors are left grasping at straws on why financial markets behave in a particular manner that is certainly not the case this year most of what investors are now experiencing can be traced back to the federal reserve s actions over the past several years last quarter we explained how the fed s difficult task of shepherding the economy and financial markets through the pandemic led to the current situation the fed made the decision to support the economy and financial markets at all costs and deal with any negative ramifications later their actions have clearly contributed to rising inflation and they now find themselves in the difficult spot of attempting to rein in surging prices without throwing the economy into recession in summary if the fed fails to bring inflation under control the economy could buckle however if they re too aggressive in stamping out inflation well the economy could still buckle with inflation running at 40 year highs the fed had no choice but to spring into action during the first six months of this year they raised interest rates a total of 1 5 and expectations are that they will hike rates an additional 1 5 2 by the end of the year as a refresher higher interest rates impact everything from mortgages to auto loans to credit cards increased rates also make financing more expensive for businesses who borrow money to pay for daily operations and invest in longer term projects all of this can have the effect of slowing the economy since consumers and businesses spend less when faced with higher rates a reduction in consumer and business spending theoretically helps reduce inflation since there is less demand for goods and services less demand puts downward pressure on prices the fed s ultimate goal speaking of the fed s goals they have what s called a dual mandate in order to achieve economic stability they aim to 1 promote maximum employment in other words they want to lower the unemployment rate and 2 promote stable prices and moderate long term interest rates they want to keep inflation under control but why is the fed so concerned about inflation or promoting stable prices as we noted previously inflation has its own insidious effects while some inflation should be expected in a healthy economy which is why the federal reserve targets 2 annual inflation too much inflation can be a negative if consumers start balking at higher price tags on goods and services they ll stop buying corporate earnings will be negatively impacted a reduction in corporate earnings could lead to layoffs less business spending and reduced investment all negatives for the economy not only that but people simply hate inflation and for good reason every time they go to the grocery store fill up the gas tank or do pretty much anything they might have to start making trade offs or avoiding purchases altogether when confronted with spiking prices for goods and services consumer spending patterns change and people simply don t like having this change forced upon them in this manner a recent monmouth poll found that inflation was the top concern for americans followed by gas prices the economy and everyday bills all of which are interrelated together these four categories were the top concern for 68 of respondents for context consider that covid was the clear number one concern in march 2020 at only 57 that offers some idea as to how much people despise inflation also as we noted last quarter inflation presents a complicating factor during a mid term election year which is the lesser of two evils for politicians in power is it rampant inflation or potentially volatile and declining financial markets while the fed is apolitical washington has a way of exerting pressure when needed the main takeaway from all of this is simply that the fed is firmly committed to tackling inflation potentially at the risk of driving the economy into recession if it s not already in one fed chairman jerome powell recently said the risk is that because of the multiplicity of shocks you start to transition to a higher inflation regime our job is literally to prevent that from happening and we will prevent that from happening we will not allow a transition from a low inflation environment into a high inflation environment he also said we re strongly committed to using our tools to get inflation to come down the way to do that is to slow down growth ideally keeping it positive is there a risk that would go too far certainly there s a risk i wouldn t agree that it s the biggest risk to the economy the bigger mistake to make would be to fail to restore price stability the bottom line is the fed is absolutely serious about reining in inflation so what does this all mean the negative effects of inflation along with a potential recession looming on the horizon have caused concerns around corporate earnings the single most important long term driver of stock returns longer duration growth stocks whose anticipated earnings are much further out into the future have been particularly vulnerable the result is the worst first half performance from the s p 500 in 52 years as for bonds rising rates lead to declining prices why do interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions a simple example is to consider owning a bond with a 1 000 face value that pays 2 annually if interest rates go to 3 then why would an investor buy a bond paying only 2 the answer is they wouldn t unless that bond cost less than 1 000 therefore the price of the 2 bond falls to a value that offers the equivalent of a 3 yield inflation rising interest rates a potential recession add this all together and you end up with what we witnessed in the first half of 2022 so will anything change in the second half of the year stocks are forward looking and therefore recession concerns are likely already priced in to the markets the question is whether the economy ultimately lands in a better or worse spot than currently expected valuations are trending back towards more reasonable levels though the earnings picture moving forward is obviously murky and earnings growth is slowing there are also some early indications that inflation may be peaking with areas like energy and commodity prices starting to roll over with the caveat that there are supply side factors at play as well while the fed can attempt to control the demand side of the equation by raising rates they can t do much to fix supply chain issues and bottlenecks the ongoing russia ukraine war has impacted food and energy supplies china s ongoing covid lockdowns have crimped their output of goods some raw materials and critical components are still in short supply these are inflationary and there s simply nothing that the fed can do about that where does this leave investors while the traditional benefits of asset class diversification were missing in the first half of 2022 now is certainly not the time to abandon a well rounded portfolio while rising interest rates have caused some short term pain for bond holders the good news is that higher yields equate to greater portfolio income moving forward the pendulum is now beginning to swing back in the favor of savers who have been penalized over the past decade plus with paltry yields as for stocks it s important to remember that longer term success in the markets ultimately comes down to how investors manage challenging years such as this recall that following the market declines of 2008 2018 and 2020 stocks rebounded quickly from these periods when investor sentiment was dour the wall street journal s jason zweig perhaps said it best part of what makes bear markets so unbearable is that nobody and i mean nobody knows when or how they will end in other words the future is unknowable and uncertain we cannot control it however we can control factors such as having the right financial plan and investment approach in place exhibiting good investor behavior by maintaining a properly diversified portfolio minimizing fees and taxes and staying laser focused on our longer term goals it s not always the easiest path but it will likely prove the most rewarding for more news information and strategy visit vettafi

twitter is the social media darling afp julie jammot anxious employees wary advertisers and hamstrung management twitter is limping along as it waits to learn how the fight over elon musk s buyout bid will end just days before the first court hearing in twitter s lawsuit seeking to force the tesla boss to close the 44 billion deal the firm is stuck in limbo the best conclusion for me would be that he leaves us alone so that we can go on our merry way an engineer at the key social media network told afp on condition of anonymity the engineer spoke of employees departing and a climate of uncertainty that does not leave one with a peaceful state of mind we re still trying to do our work normally because the main reasons why we chose to work for twitter still hold true he added but there s been nothing normal about musk s unsolicited bid that he s now backed away from saying twitter has obfuscated on the number of fake accounts on the platform he has harangued the network on its own platform no less with mocking tweets about its management and direction musk s repeated disparagement of twitter and its personnel create uncertainty that harm twitter and its stockholders the firm s lawyers argued in their lawsuit lodged this week the billionaire s comments also expose twitter to adverse effects on its business operations employees and stock price the lawyers added a judge has set the first hearing in the case for tuesday in a court in the eastern state of delaware sluggish ad sales twitter is facing a huge image crisis and confidence in its leadership is wavering emarketer analyst debra williamson told afp but whether the musk situation has affected its revenues is unclear she said the most loyal advertisers have likely stuck around but those less committed to twitter may have scaled back their spending while waiting for the endgame angelo carusone president of watchdog group media matters thinks the damage is already done because musk has been a frequent critic of content moderation the fight against hate and disinformation is widely defended internally but also by many advertisers concerned that their brands are not associated with toxic messages carusone said that in early may at an annual marketing event where companies negotiate large advertising deals twitter was not able to give advertisers any clarity or confidence that it would continue to be safe showcase for them they didn t go anywhere close to what they normally sell at that event and it s obviously been sluggish since then he added the san francisco based social network cannot afford to lose customers unlike big fish such as google and facebook parent meta which dominate online advertising and make billions in profits twitter lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020 and 2021 the group will capture less than one percent of global ad revenue in 2022 according to emarketer compared to 12 5 percent for facebook 9 percent for instagram and nearly two percent for booming upstart tiktok on top of that twitter s user base is barely expected to grow and may even shrink in the united states noted williamson the emarketer analyst twitter can t meaningfully respond musk once had potential twitter investors salivating with his talk of growing revenue fivefold and aiming for a billion users by 2028 instead a court battle is building to end either with twitter being owned by an unhappy investor who decided he didn t want it after all or with twitter on its own and weaker than it was before this all started williamson added the battle is set to last for months and at a time when economic headwinds are steady and firms need to be nimble to monetize new audio and video formats diversify revenue sources and attract younger audiences at least facebook can respond to current threats even if they re responding poorly they can respond said carusone the media matters president what twitter cannot do right now is meaningfully respond to anything the social network s lawyers have blamed musk for withholding consent for two employee retention programs designed to keep selected top talent during a period of intense uncertainty generated in large part by musk s erratic conduct internally some employees have also lost confidence in management which they would have liked to be more combative in dealing with the world s richest person parker lyons a financial analyst at twitter went so far as to tweet several memes that took aim at the firm s board for its deal with musk in one the board is shown firing bullets into twitter above the sarcastic caption who could have done this

diana shroll has had fun proving people wrong but now it s time to move on when shroll opened fit fab fun at 209 s sandusky ave on july 25 2018 people said it was doomed to fail i was told when i opened this so many people oh bucyrus isn t ready for healthy wraps or healthy smoothies nobody s going to eat that with spinach in it you know they like their burgers and fries and pizzas and so i don t know if you call it a highlight but i think we proved them wrong she said people do want to eat healthy and people do appreciate a good salad bar now shroll is selling the business and the building that houses it to jeremy and michelle roberts who already own special moments bridal next door in the other half of the building her last day with fit fab fun will be july 22 for me personally i just really love the downtown of bucyrus and i love how everyone s active and i did not want to see a store leave that s a staple within the community jeremy roberts said and i want to maintain that as much as i can four years brought many changes four years ago shroll was looking for something to do she and her husband tim own dt petroleum and she had worked there for 30 years but customers seemed more demanding even mean she said i just have to find something else to do their son a physician lived in san antonio texas he was married with no children their daughter a veterinarian lived near findlay and she and her husband didn t want any kids so i was like well what am i going to do i m too young to sit at home shroll recalled so she opened the business well about a year after i opened it is when our daughter called she said guess what we re going to have a baby which oh my gosh was the most awesome phone call in the whole world shroll s first grandchild harper was born in march 2020 right smack in covid on her birthday that year shroll learned her son and his wife were expecting a baby gwen was born in 2021 this year the family welcomed hayden when her daughter asked shroll to watch harper the answer was obvious of course she knew she could trust her employees to run the business and take care of customers while she was away she s known three of them since they all attended wynford schools together but it s just gotten to be too much shroll said it s been crazy we do a good little business and i didn t want to just close it because a lot of the downtown people really count on just walking in here and getting something to eat so i just kept praying about it and praying about it then roberts approached shroll about purchasing the building she told him she wasn t sure about selling the building she might want to sell the business long story short he decided they wanted to buy both it just sort of happened so i m like all right lord i think that s my answer shroll said but it s still it s going to be sad i mean i put so much into this heart soul energy you know but those little babies when harper puts her arms around me and says i love you i just there s no place i want to be rather than taking care of them they grow up so fast serving up sunshine and smoothies shroll said it s important to her that people know they ll still be able to come in and get their smoothies and wraps the most popular smoothie on the menu is called green fusion i laugh because that has spinach in it and i go back to that people don t want to eat healthy shroll said the california club wrap is the top selling menu item but quesadillas and the salad bar are popular too we make a mean quesadilla she said we sell a lot of those but she s always told her employees that good customer service comes first i mean you ve got to have good food obviously shroll said but i want everyone when they walk in that door i want it to be more of an experience i always say every person you need to treat as though they have a sign around their neck that says make me feel special because you know that s just so lacking any more in businesses and i don t want people to feel that way or like we re doing them a favor to make them something to eat her staffers have been amazing she said always happy and smiling even when they re having a bad day her slogan for the business has been serving up smoothies and sunshine i just want people to be happy shroll said there s just so much yuck out there new owners plan to keep things the same roberts said he hopes to keep the business that way i would like everyone to know that it s going to pretty much stay the same with the service and excitement that they re used to and we re going to try to continue that we don t want anyone to think it s going to be a big change he said any changes will be very minute just to try to benefit everybody else the robertses who both have full time jobs in addition to owning real estate and now two businesses have hired marissa hamilton to manage fit fab fun we have been fortunate enough to find some very very good people within the community jeremy roberts said michelle ziegler works for us at special moments and she has really picked it up where we can t and she has done a great job for us at that bridal store only one of shroll s current staffers will be staying on but that s largely by chance she explained one of the younger employees is a college student who will begin student teaching soon another is expecting another baby and was planning to leave anyway i m like ok maybe this is a good time to leave i don t have to hire anybody new shroll said i ll just walk out as difficult as that s going to be there are things shroll won t miss taking out the trash or meeting the delivery truck early every monday we re only open 11 to 2 but i m here at 8 a m every morning the days that i m here and i won t leave right away she said and then on saturdays and sundays you have to stock up for the next week it s a lot of hours it s not just like come in for a couple hours and leave so that will be kind of nice her biggest hope is that the community will continue to support fit fab fun i ve been so blessed and i appreciate so much that community support for this place has been great and i just hope that they continue to do that she said because this it s going to be hard to leave ggoble gannett com 419 559 7263

san francisco afp anxious employees wary advertisers and hamstrung management twitter is limping along as it waits to learn how the fight over elon musk s buyout bid will end advertising read more just days before the first court hearing in twitter s lawsuit seeking to force the tesla boss to close the 44 billion deal the firm is stuck in limbo the best conclusion for me would be that he leaves us alone so that we can go on our merry way an engineer at the key social media network told afp on condition of anonymity the engineer spoke of employees departing and a climate of uncertainty that does not leave one with a peaceful state of mind we re still trying to do our work normally because the main reasons why we chose to work for twitter still hold true he added but there s been nothing normal about musk s unsolicited bid that he s now backed away from saying twitter has obfuscated on the number of fake accounts on the platform he has harangued the network on its own platform no less with mocking tweets about its management and direction musk s repeated disparagement of twitter and its personnel create uncertainty that harm twitter and its stockholders the firm s lawyers argued in their lawsuit lodged this week the billionaire s comments also expose twitter to adverse effects on its business operations employees and stock price the lawyers added a judge has set the first hearing in the case for tuesday in a court in the eastern state of delaware sluggish ad sales twitter is facing a huge image crisis and confidence in its leadership is wavering emarketer analyst debra williamson told afp but whether the musk situation has affected its revenues is unclear she said the most loyal advertisers have likely stuck around but those less committed to twitter may have scaled back their spending while waiting for the endgame angelo carusone president of watchdog group media matters thinks the damage is already done because musk has been a frequent critic of content moderation the fight against hate and disinformation is widely defended internally but also by many advertisers concerned that their brands are not associated with toxic messages carusone said that in early may at an annual marketing event where companies negotiate large advertising deals twitter was not able to give advertisers any clarity or confidence that it would continue to be safe showcase for them they didn t go anywhere close to what they normally sell at that event and it s obviously been sluggish since then he added the san francisco based social network cannot afford to lose customers unlike big fish such as google and facebook parent meta which dominate online advertising and make billions in profits twitter lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020 and 2021 the group will capture less than one percent of global ad revenue in 2022 according to emarketer compared to 12 5 percent for facebook 9 percent for instagram and nearly two percent for booming upstart tiktok on top of that twitter s user base is barely expected to grow and may even shrink in the united states noted williamson the emarketer analyst twitter can t meaningfully respond musk once had potential twitter investors salivating with his talk of growing revenue fivefold and aiming for a billion users by 2028 instead a court battle is building to end either with twitter being owned by an unhappy investor who decided he didn t want it after all or with twitter on its own and weaker than it was before this all started williamson added the battle is set to last for months and at a time when economic headwinds are steady and firms need to be nimble to monetize new audio and video formats diversify revenue sources and attract younger audiences at least facebook can respond to current threats even if they re responding poorly they can respond said carusone the media matters president what twitter cannot do right now is meaningfully respond to anything the social network s lawyers have blamed musk for withholding consent for two employee retention programs designed to keep selected top talent during a period of intense uncertainty generated in large part by musk s erratic conduct internally some employees have also lost confidence in management which they would have liked to be more combative in dealing with the world s richest person parker lyons a financial analyst at twitter went so far as to tweet several memes that took aim at the firm s board for its deal with musk in one the board is shown firing bullets into twitter above the sarcastic caption who could have done this 2022 afp

these oil stocks are gushing enough cash to pay you while you sleep our society is built on oil and gas whether you believe renewables will take over in your lifetime fossil fuels will likely play a significant role in powering the world for years to come that s great news for dividend investors the industry s massive profits can provide passive income dividends that can pay your living expenses or buy more shares dividend investing works the same no matter how much or little you invest as long as it s part of a diversified portfolio here s a hypothetical example of how investing 10 000 in these two oil and gas stocks can produce 2 000 in dividends over time 1 an integrated oil giant chevron corporation cvx 0 86 is one of the world s largest oil and gas companies it s integrated which means it touches upstream operations like exploration and extraction and downstream operations like refining and distribution commodity prices for oil and gas determine what chevron can sell its materials for which impacts how profitable the company is chevron is a cyclical business because the ups and downs of oil and gas prices can cause boom and bust periods for the company you can see below how chevron s cash operating profits closely track the price of oil but chevron s integrated business model includes refining and retail businesses that aren t as dependent on commodity prices to generate cash profits helping the company endure the ups and downs when you factor in chevron s massive size and balance sheet you get a titan of industry with deep pockets it s how it s been able to keep raising its dividend for the past 35 years investors receive 5 68 per share in dividends annually a 4 1 dividend yield at the current share price putting 5 000 into the stock at its current price will fetch investors 36 shares producing 204 48 in passive income in one year 2 pipelines full of dividends enbridge enb 1 26 is another massive energy company in north america but it s primarily a midstream company with an extensive network of pipelines and storage facilities to transport oil and gas from the oil fields to refineries throughout the continent pipelines work like traffic tolls on the highway enbridge is paid based on the volume of oil and gas transported and isn t as dependent on what the commodities sell for enbridge has long term contracts with its customers most include measures to compensate for inflation and recover rising operating costs these all make enbridge s business more predictable than most oil and gas companies you can see below how enbridge s cash operating profits have remained more steady than chevron s over the same period even during the collapse in oil prices during covid 19 lockdowns when oil prices temporarily went below zero enbridge remained resilient knowing this it shouldn t be a huge shock that enbridge is an excellent dividend stock management has raised its payout for 26 years in a row the company pays its dividend in cad totaling cad 3 44 annually translating to 2 64 in usd it offers investors a 6 3 yield buying 5 000 of stock at the current price will net you 120 shares totaling 316 80 in passive income your first year the snowball grows larger dividends are great because the good ones don t just pay you once they pay you repeatedly raising the payout yearly a total 10 000 investment will pay 521 28 in year one now let s assume that each company raises its dividend the following year the average increase over the past few years has been about 5 for chevron and enbridge that original 5 000 in chevron shares will pay 214 70 and enbridge will pay 332 64 for a total of 547 34 in year two that s 1 068 62 in two years without lifting a finger repeat the dividend increases in year three chevron s paying you 225 44 and enbridge another 349 27 for a total of 574 71 for the year the snowball grows to a total of 1 643 33 over three years you ll cross the 2 000 barrier in passive income during year four and your passive income will grow as chevron and enbridge raise their payouts you can even supercharge your returns by reinvesting your dividends instead of pocketing them meaning your dividends will buy more shares which also pay dividends keep in mind though that you pay capital gains taxes on dividends held in a brokerage account if they are taken or reinvested this little example is to illustrate the powerful compounding effect that comes with passive income you can never guarantee that a company will remain successful in the future which is why a diversified portfolio can help minimize your risks making dividends a part of your investment strategy could mean you re knocking on the door of financial freedom faster than you might realize

this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below access to abortion in sudbury more complicated than just geography laws intended to protect those who provide abortions also make harder for women who want to use their services to find them sunmedia article content if you only look at publicly available information you d think that it was impossible to access abortion services in the greater sudbury area advertisement 2 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content we apologize but this video has failed to load tap here to see other videos from our team try refreshing your browser or access to abortion in sudbury more complicated than just geography back to video in fact a recently updated list of abortion clinics and services across the country from the abortion rights coalition of canada lists only one item located in sudbury health sciences north s options clinic but unlike other items on the list which state what services are provided all that s listed for hsn is a phone number article content on its face it seems like abortion is just one more medical procedure that poses significant geographic challenges where local access is impossible and only those with the time and money to spare can travel to receive it but the truth is actually more complicated and geography is necessarily the main barrier abortion access is changing when the united states supreme court overturned the landmark abortion case roe v wade on june 24 the decision caused some in canada to look more closely at what abortion access is like here advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content across much of canada accessing abortion services remains complicated and difficult according to joyce arthur executive director of the abortion rights coalition of canada it s very much a patchwork quilt she said it can be very good in some of the major cities in particular vancouver toronto and montreal but outside of those cities it can be much more difficult possibly even impossible for some people while it s hard to pinpoint exactly only about one in six canadian hospitals currently provide elective abortion services that includes medical abortions which are procedures that used prescribed medication that can be taken at home for early stage pregnancy typically up to 12 weeks and surgical abortions an in clinic procedure that uses suction to empty the uterus which is typically only performed up to 22 weeks though many providers have much stricter limits advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to arthur telemedicine has been one of those significant contributors to improving access across the country the abortion pill mifegymiso can be prescribed by any physician including family doctors and general practitioners that means that if a patient seeking an abortion can find a doctor willing to give her the prescription no travel is needed if none are willing to do so locally services are available that can connect patients to physicians locally there s a lot of communities in canada where a person can get on a phone call or video call with a doctor in vancouver and then get a prescription phoned into the local pharmacy and go pick up the pill that s happening more and more still it s not a magic bullet advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content anti choice pharmacists can be a problem arthur said there s so many communities that still don t have pharmacies that would have it in stock across much of the country access to surgical abortion also continues to pose a problem as an in person procedure lack of local access can meet extensive travel taking time off work and potentially costly accommodations remote rural areas are the most affected by this that s the problem that on the surface seems to exist in sudbury impossible to know when the star contacted health sciences north to see if we could glean more information about what abortion access looks like in sudbury we received a short and simple response from communications manager jason turnball advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content hsn is legislated under the freedom of information act and there are mandatory exclusions outlined under section 65 which specifically address abortion records turnball wrote it s this legislation that makes it so difficult to understand how accessible abortion is in any given area the most comprehensive list of abortion providers is managed by action canada which offers a confidential hotline for those seeking information about sexual health pregnancy options and abortion according to jessa millar who manages the access line abortion is much more accessible but much harder to track than it was before somebody could be asking their family doctor can you prescribe me mifegymisto and the doctor might say i ve never done that before but i don t see why not then that person is an abortion provider but they didn t call to tell us that and they probably never will advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as a result she said it s going to be kind of impossible to know how many doctors in canada are able to prescribe and are prescribing abortion medication that s not necessarily a bad thing for those seeking an abortion for one it means that in more areas across the country there are fewer hoops to jump through to access an abortion for another it means doctors are treating abortion pills like any other kind of medication the legislation also allows abortion providers to protect themselves from public backlash providers i ve spoken to are interested in supporting people outside of their patient roster they re willing to have people self refer to them to provide abortion care to the general public said millar but they don t want to be publicly listed as an abortion provider advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content in fact only a small number of physicians and facilities who do provide abortions publicly identify that fact according to the arcc s list of clinics there are only 23 publicly declared providers in ontario but that number doesn t accurately reflect that number of providers that actually exist in the province action canada s database of providers which is used to refer patients who call in to the nearest provider to them includes a number of facilities and physicians who remain unlisted to the public in other words they will accept referrals from patients who gain their information through the access line but they won t publicly advertise that they provide abortion services stigma is still very prevalent even though we live in a country that prides itself on believing that people have a right to bodily autonomy said millar there is still abortion stigma they still have some fear around being known for the services they re providing it s too bad because that in and of itself creates a barrier advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content she added the more difficult it is to find out where to go the longer it will take and the more difficult it will be to access services at all services available but challenges remain in greater sudbury there are no healthcare providers who publicly state that they provide abortion services including hsn however according to public health sudbury and districts there are multiple providers of medical abortions as well as one provider of surgical abortion while it isn t easy to find this information on your own there are several resources in place to direct patients to the proper care public health for example can be a first point of contact for many patients province there s a lot of fear and anxiety during this time so our role is to talk to them about the different options available to them said carol lougheed a public health nurse in the health protection division we really encourage individuals to talk to someone they can trust someone they can really count on for support and just weigh the pros and cons advertisement 10 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to lougheed when a patient comes in with an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy they can refer them to counselling and other services that help the patient decide how they want to proceed we re very supportive of the idea that this needs to be their own personal decision she said we ll help them by giving them information but we never encourage a client to make any specific decision from there they can refer them to support services or other health providers whether they intend to continue their pregnancy pursue adoption or terminate the pregnancy while hsn won t confirm whether its provides abortion services it does have a phone number for their options clinic which is publicly advertised as its point of contact for patients looking for information advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content but just because these services exist doesn t mean access in sudbury is without its issues according to arthur stigma and lack of knowledge are some of the most difficult issues to navigate even in areas where services are offered the protection providers have under the freedom of information act for example are a catch 22 the issue is that the anti choice have been known to try to ferret out information on who s providing abortions then they go and picket and harass doctors that s where that protection is coming from but then people can t find out where to go for services some of the groups hit hardest by this are marginalized and indigenous communities low income people immigrants youth and lgbtq individuals advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content cass kuntsi who works with youth and is part of a group organizing a pro choice rally in sudbury on sunday said she s seen how stigma can prevent young people from reaching out there s a lack of education she said a lot of the time they don t want to ask because they either don t have somebody that they trust to ask or they re embarrassed if they don t have somebody they can confide in who can help them access resources then they feel very alone and isolated connecting people with the resources they need she said is key i think that education is super important especially in our area she said it s great to say don t do it but you also have to provide a solution for when a problem does arise ignorance is bliss until it

property owners are required to extend their current use and income restrictions for an additional of 10 years beyond their current expiration date to ensure these rehabilitated units remain affordable with the nation already facing an affordable housing shortfall it is critical to not only create additional housing but ensure our current stock does not fall into disrepair forcing households to relocate said ihda executive director kristin faust i thank the governor and illinois general assembly for their continued support in ensuring people are not forced from their homes through no fault of their own the preservation program will not only help keep illinoisans in their homes it will ensure these units remain affordable to provide for additional families and seniors in addition to the natural aging of the state s affordable housing stock the covid 19 pandemic negatively affected rent rolls due to increased unemployment causing many property owners to defer maintenance projects to ensure low income families seniors and other vulnerable households continue to have access to housing that is safe healthy and well maintained ihda created the preservation program to provide the capital that addresses physical needs so these developments can continue to provide quality affordable rental units the investments announced today are a further commitment to instilling housing justice for chicago s most underserved communities and it could not come at a better time said state senator robert peters d chicago every illinoisan deserves housing options that are safe and well maintained and this will help to ensure just that to be eligible for the preservation program developments must have a minimum of 25 of the units restricted to households with incomes at or below 60 of the area median income in addition eligible developments were required to be impacted by at least two of the conditions identified below direct financial risk to ihda or another funding entity existing physical needs that if not repaired threaten the sustainability of the development loss of marketability loss of affordability due to expiration of use restrictions or loan maturity or inability to sustain operations with income and rent restrictions going forward all applicants were required to submit a physical needs assessment completed by an independent third party that addressed all anticipated capital repairs required within the next 12 years i am glad to see that housing units that have been historically neglected are getting the updates and renovations needed to ensure low income households have access to safer living conditions said state senator patricia van pelt d chicago these investments will benefit seniors families and other vulnerable residents who have been affected by the housing crisis i am happy to announce these awards from the rebuild illinois program as some of our city s housing infrastructures are in deep need of rejuvenation said majority caucus chair mattie hunter d chicago at a time when the nation is seeing unprecedented housing insecurity i am proud that elected officials and stakeholders could come

appropriation to ihda in the rebuild illinois capital plan p a 101 0029 ihda has used funding from the capital bill to develop and implement various programs including reducing barriers to homeownership and revitalizing and stabilizing communities ihda expects to launch additional programs to help create and preserve affordable housing in the coming months from promoting public safety to combatting the effects of inflation on low income families improving housing conditions is key to building up communities said state rep kam buckner d chicago sustainable living situations help people maintain jobs and help kids get to school regularly and i cannot underscore the importance of housing during the coming winter months enough i thank governor pritzker and ihda for the good work they are doing for illinois families an investment in safe affordable housing is an investment in the health and wellbeing of people across illinois said state rep lamont j robinson d chicago by

duluth suppliers of tetrahydrocannabinol or thc are seeing a surge in the sales of hemp derived edibles and beverages following minnesota s change in law those 21 years or older may now buy products that contain up to 5 milligrams of thc per serving and 50 milligrams per package prior to the new law going into effect on july 1 hemp and cannabidiol also known as cbd products that contained less than 0 3 delta 9 thc were already legal in minnesota however the same limit didn t previously apply to delta 8 thc i have been selling thc in minnesota for three years said craig sutherland co owner of sutherland cbd changes with the new law restrict individual edible gummy servings to a maximum of 5 milligrams of hemp derived thc prior to new law i was selling under 0 3 thc by weight and was able to sell 10 milligram edibles in minnesota sutherland cbd is a retailer wholesaler and distributor of anything derived from cannabis and hemp with locations in the lakeside neighborhood of duluth as well as in superior sutherland cbd also has an e commerce site and ships wholesale nationwide within short notice duluth s sutherland cbd along with many other thc distributors in minnesota were required to change its entire storefront when 10 milligram or 0 3 thc edible products became noncompliant under the new law sutherland said any of his store s inventory that became noncompliant was transported to its superior location where it is legal advertisement since wisconsin adopted the usda farm bill it is able to do more in terms of cannabis than minnesota such as sell a higher strain i can sell stronger gummies of delta 8 right now in wisconsin there is no limit to edibles as long as it is under 0 3 delta 9 by weight sutherland added in minnesota it is 5 milligrams total whether it s delta 8 or delta 9 a lot of minnesotans are traveling to superior to purchase scrambling to meet demand following the passing of the new bill sutherland said he is seeing a significant increase of demand for thc edible products at his stores which he credits partially to a media infused false hype he estimated sutherland cbd s sales of thc edibles to be anywhere from double to triple the numbers experienced during this time last july childproof packages of delta 9 thc gummies offered at sutherland cbd on friday july 15 in duluth each container holds 10 gummies with 5 milligrams of thc per gummy for a total of 50 milligrams of thc per package clint austin duluth news tribune a lot of minnesotans didn t know you could buy thc gummies already and now everyone starts coming out of the woodwork sutherland said we re selling hundreds of thousands of gummies we re selling them as quickly as they come in supply chains are also experiencing a huge uptick due to the increased demand sutherland said new labeling and childproofing requirements are contributing to the companies providing those services to be backed up as well wholesalers and retailers are now ordering an estimated quarter million gummies a week to keep up with demand within his supply chain which sutherland said consists of dozens of business owners that rely on these networks suppliers were backlogged wholesalers are scrambling sutherland said it s not a bad thing we re learning as we go and adapting it s part of the industry it is fragile lawmakers can change it at any time what s next in minnesota in terms of cannabis the consumer market for marijuana has existed for a long time in minnesota it is a huge step towards full adult use marijuana said jason tarasek who serves on the board of directors of the minnesota cannabis association and lobbied in favor of minnesota s thc edible law i have been lobbying for adult use marijuana for three years and it is amazing how much progress we ve made in a short amount of time tarasek said it strikes me that legislators are getting much more comfortable with adult use marijuana i applaud them i think they re going to see it benefits everyone in minnesota to do this tarasek also founded minnesota cannabis law in 2018 and is a steering committee member and co founder for minnesotans for responsible marijuana regulation with nearly 20 years of legal experience tarasek is among the 5 of attorneys in the state named to the list of super lawyers advertisement he added the dfl controlled house passed an adult use legalization bill but republicans in senate refused to consider it gov tim waltz said he will sign the bill if it gets through senate i think it would be foolish for the legislation not to legalize full adult use marijuana in the next session we will get a six month trial period they will see there is nothing to be concerned about minnesota see also democrats tout law legalizing thc gummies lawmakers who helped push the new rule through the minnesota capitol said they were working on fixes around enforcement next steps to fully legalize marijuana for adult use minnesota has a projected 1 2 billion marijuana market per year which equates to an estimated 200 million 300 million in tax revenue tarasek said these funds could be funneled toward education building schools and back into communities impacted by the war on drugs he said marijuana has a stigma associated with it that has been built over decades of misinformation and a fear it may harm children but every state that has legalized it has seen teen use go down because it takes away the black market aspect of marijuana tarasek said adding it is more difficult for teenagers to obtain marijuana as illegal drug dealers are replaced by licensed dispensaries that require proof of age i don t want thc to get into the hands of kids in any case it can only be sold to those 21 and older and only marketed to adults there are currently 19 states that have fully legalized adult use marijuana as a board member of the cannabis industry association of south dakota tarasek also provides legal services to entrepreneurs who intend on entering the medical marijuana and adult use marijuana markets in that state according to tarasek he anticipates minnesota s neighbors north dakota and south dakota to legalize full adult use marijuana this november gary meader duluth news tribune north dakota is similar to minnesota and currently has mixed legal status allowing for medical and decriminalized use of marijuana while it is not currently decriminalized in south dakota iowa and wisconsin have mixed legal status and allow for cbd oil with thc for medicinal purposes michigan and illinois allow for full adult use marijuana as for minnesota the recent thc edible law had adverse impacts to businesses selling vape cartridges with any amount of thc or individual delta 8 tch edibles above 5 milligrams which tarasek explained are now illegal in minnesota the cannabis industry creates a lot of jobs i have clients who are getting impatient and began opening businesses in the upper peninsula of michigan tarasek said even so he said thc retailers in the twin cities ran out of stock within 48 hours and are scrambling to get more if you are a retailer that can get your hands on gummies with 5 milligrams of thc per serving you re going to make a lot of money cannabis hemp marijuana thc cbd delta 8 and delta 9 what s the difference the united states food and drug administration describes cannabis sativa as a plant with its most commonly known cannabinoid compounds being cbd and thc both have different chemical properties and each affect the body differently advertisement both compounds are found in marijuana and hemp hemp is considered any part of the cannabis plant with a delta 9 thc concentration up to 0 3 on a dry weight basis marijuana is any part of cannabis that has more than 0 3 while marijuana contains more thc hemp has a lot of cbd gary meader duluth news tribune thc is the main psychoactive compound in marijuana and produces an intoxicating effect whether it s derived from hemp or marijuana it s what makes people feel high cbd doesn t cause that feeling delta 8 thc is also produced naturally by the cannabis plant but is not found in significant amounts nearly all delta 8 thc products are synthesized extracted and purified from cannabis sourced cbd while delta 9 thc can be smoked or vaporized in flower or bud form without requiring extraction edibles do require an extraction process although less potent delta 8 thc has similar intoxicating and psychoactive effects as delta 9 thc from jan 1 2021 to feb 28 2022 national poison control centers received 2 362 exposure cases of delta 8 thc products of these cases 58 involved adults and 41 involved children under 18 years old seventy percent of overall exposure cases required health care facility evaluation with 45 being pediatric patients and 8 resulting in critical care one pediatric case resulted in death additionally the fda received 104 reports of adverse events in patients who consumed delta 8 thc products between dec 1 2020 and feb 28 2022 with 55 of these patients requiring an evaluation by emergency medical services or hospital admission classified as food minnesota statute 151 72 allows for the sale of manufactured and packaged products that contain substances derived from legally certified hemp in minnesota according to the minnesota board of pharmacy food ingredients that are combined with thc or cbd must meet requirements for food manufacturing products containing hemp derived thc and cbd fall under the same authorities and requirements as fda regulated products containing any other substance however the law doesn t allow restaurants bars or other businesses that prepare food and beverages for on site or take away consumption to further prepare food using substances derived from hemp edible cannabinoid products also cannot be made by applying thc or cbd to a commercially available candy or snack food item in minnesota it is a misdemeanor to sell misbranded or adulterated products products that do not meet all the requirements may also be schedule 1 controlled substances depending on the substance and quantity involved it can be a felony to sell or possess controlled substances advertisement the pharmacy board will rely on consumer complaints to investigate reports of non compliance currently it does not have a lab to test hemp derived products for compliance

the world economy took another step towards recession with the announcement yesterday that china the world s second largest economy had grown by only 0 4 percent year on year in the second quarter this was below the 1 2 percent predicted by economists and well down from the 4 8 percent year on year growth recorded in the first quarter the main reason for the slowdown was the effect of the two month lockdown of shanghai as the government sought to implement its policy of zero covid workers labor near a construction site with cranes near the central business district skyline in beijing china october 11 2021 ap photo ng han guan shanghai has re opened but china is now facing the effects of the ba 5 variant of the virus which is rapidly spreading around the world because of the abandonment by all governments of even limited mitigation measures let alone pursuing the necessary policy of global elimination according to an analysis made by the japanese financial firm nomura 31 chinese cities are under full or partial lockdown affecting almost 248 million people and accounting for 17 5 percent of the country s economic output the chinese experience demonstrates two things public health safety measures can bring the pandemic under control but elimination is impossible solely on a national basis besides the devastating health impact as millions are condemned to an unnecessary death the refusal to adopt such an international strategy is not only fuelling inflation it is pushing the world economy into a slump on a quarter by quarter basis the economy contracted by 2 6 percent in the three months to the end of june compared with 1 4 percent growth in the first quarter the june quarter contraction was well above predictions of a 1 5 percent shrinkage unemployment is starting to rise with the level of youth joblessness rising to a record 19 3 percent releasing the figures a spokesperson for the national bureau of statistics fu linghui tried to put the best face on the situation at a press briefing yesterday morning generally speaking with a series of policies to solidly stabilise the economy achieving notable results the national economy has overcome the adverse impact of unexpected factors demonstrating the momentum of stable recovery he said during a visit to wuhan last month chinese president xi jinping indicated that zero covid would continue while he acknowledged there were economic problems he said it was better to temporarily affect a little economic development rather than risk people s health and safety chinese authorities have estimated that hundreds of thousands if not millions could die if the let it rip policy in the rest of the world were adopted but there are signs of cracks in the regime in its report on the covid induced economic downturn the washington post one of the many media outlets around the world calling for the abandonment of zero covid eagerly seized on such indications it reported that when chinese premier li keqiang visited the coastal city of fuzhou to hold discussions with officials in the south eastern industrial area about how to bring stability he urged they steer the economy back on track photographs in state media have shown li in meetings where no one was wearing a mask and these appearances have been interpreted by some as a show of support for a faster return to normalcy it described the zero covid policy as increasingly controversial and economically damaging but apart from sections of the upper middle class whose objections are eagerly seized on by the western media the official policy enjoys wide public support and the government fears it would face massive opposition were it abandoned the chinese government is seeking to alleviate the covid economic damage by loosening financial conditions and allowing local government authorities to issue additional bonds to finance new projects but financial stimulus measures are restricted by the shift by major central banks to a higher interest rate regime authorities fear there will be a fall in the value of the renminbi and a capital outflow if monetary policy is relaxed too much the economic slowdown in china means that the three major economic regions of the world the us europe and china are moving closer to recession the escalation of inflation in the us it jumped to 9 1 percent in june up from 8 6 percent the previous month means that the fed is certain to again lift interest rates by 0 75 percentage points at the end of the month and possibly by a full 1 percent this has fuelled predictions of a recession under conditions where the us economy contracted by 1 6 percent on an annualised basis in the first quarter and a similar result appears likely for the second the present fed rate is between 1 5 and 1 75 percent but according to jeffrey lacker a former president of the richmond fed it would have to go to 6 percent to influence inflation such an escalation would virtually guarantee a recession under conditions where the financial system as well as consumer and business spending have become dependent on a low interest rate regime former treasury secretary lawrence summers has said that an unemployment rate of 10 percent lasting for a year is necessary to bring inflation down the economic outlook in the euro zone is going from bad to worse this week the value of the euro has fallen to parity with the us dollar at one point it went below parity amid fears that a cut off of russian gas supplies as a result of the us nato war in the ukraine could induce a deep recession the european central bank ecb is committed to start lifting its interest rate when it meets later this month but only by 0 25 percentage points well below the rate rises in the us and this is driving down the value of the euro the falling euro adds to the cost of imports driving up inflation from its present level of 8 6 percent and adding to pressure on the ecb to move faster with rate hikes but such moves threaten to lead to fragmentation in financial markets as the interest rates on the bonds of the more indebted countries of the south rise above those on the bonds of countries of the north in 2012 this divergence threatened the continuation of the single currency the ecb has said it will develop measures to counter this threat when it meets next week under what were once regarded as normal conditions a fall in the currency would be regarded as having some benefits by making exports cheaper in world markets but not in the present situation where currency falls drive up inflation the extreme price increases in import and producer prices overshadow any profit that exporters can book for themselves due to a weaker currency sonja marten head of foreign exchange and monetary policy at dz bank in frankfurt told the wall street journal summing up the implications of the euro s plunge james athey investment director at abrn a major uk investment company told the journal what it is indicative of is that this is a horrific situation for the eurozone in the past during periods of major currency misalignments international agreements were reached one recalls the plaza and louvre accords of the 1980s to stabilise the situation no longer speaking after a meeting this week with the japanese finance minister shunichi suzuki where the rapid fall of the yen against the dollar was discussed us treasury secretary janet yellen made it clear there would be no intervention to bring down the dollar and g7 countries should have market determined exchange rates the position of the biden administration is that a strong dollar is of assistance in bringing down inflation yellen did not use the words of nixon s treasury secretary john connally in 1971 after the president closed the gold window the dollar is our currency but it s your problem but she could well have in a world of growing recessionary trends escalating inflation financial turbulence and currency storms it is very much every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost

harder for women who want to use their services to find them sunmedia article content if you only look at publicly available information you d think that it was impossible to access abortion services in the greater sudbury area advertisement 2 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content we apologize but this video has failed to load tap here to see other videos from our team try refreshing your browser or access to abortion in sudbury more complicated than just geography back to video in fact a recently updated list of abortion clinics and services across the country from the abortion rights coalition of canada lists only one item located in sudbury health sciences north s options clinic but unlike other items on the list which state what services are provided all that s listed for hsn is a phone number article content on its face it seems like abortion is just one more medical procedure that poses significant geographic challenges where local access is impossible and only those with the time and money to spare can travel to receive it but the truth is actually more complicated and geography is necessarily the main barrier abortion access is changing when the united states supreme court overturned the landmark abortion case roe v wade on june 24 the decision caused some in canada to look more closely at what abortion access is like here advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content across much of canada accessing abortion services remains complicated and difficult according to joyce arthur executive director of the abortion rights coalition of canada it s very much a patchwork quilt she said it can be very good in some of the major cities in particular vancouver toronto and montreal but outside of those cities it can be much more difficult possibly even impossible for some people while it s hard to pinpoint exactly only about one in six canadian hospitals currently provide elective abortion services that includes medical abortions which are procedures that used prescribed medication that can be taken at home for early stage pregnancy typically up to 12 weeks and surgical abortions an in clinic procedure that uses suction to empty the uterus which is typically only performed up to 22 weeks though many providers have much stricter limits advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to arthur telemedicine has been one of those significant contributors to improving access across the country the abortion pill mifegymiso can be prescribed by any physician including family doctors and general practitioners that means that if a patient seeking an abortion can find a doctor willing to give her the prescription no travel is needed if none are willing to do so locally services are available that can connect patients to physicians locally there s a lot of communities in canada where a person can get on a phone call or video call with a doctor in vancouver and then get a prescription phoned into the local pharmacy and go pick up the pill that s happening more and more still it s not a magic bullet advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content anti choice pharmacists can be a problem arthur said there s so many communities that still don t have pharmacies that would have it in stock across much of the country access to surgical abortion also continues to pose a problem as an in person procedure lack of local access can meet extensive travel taking time off work and potentially costly accommodations remote rural areas are the most affected by this that s the problem that on the surface seems to exist in sudbury impossible to know when the star contacted health sciences north to see if we could glean more information about what abortion access looks like in sudbury we received a short and simple response from communications manager jason turnball advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content hsn is legislated under the freedom of information act and there are mandatory exclusions outlined under section 65 which specifically address abortion records turnball wrote it s this legislation that makes it so difficult to understand how accessible abortion is in any given area the most comprehensive list of abortion providers is managed by action canada which offers a confidential hotline for those seeking information about sexual health pregnancy options and abortion according to jessa millar who manages the access line abortion is much more accessible but much harder to track than it was before somebody could be asking their family doctor can you prescribe me mifegymisto and the doctor might say i ve never done that before but i don t see why not then that person is an abortion provider but they didn t call to tell us that and they probably never will advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as a result she said it s going to be kind of impossible to know how many doctors in canada are able to prescribe and are prescribing abortion medication that s not necessarily a bad thing for those seeking an abortion for one it means that in more areas across the country there are fewer hoops to jump through to access an abortion for another it means doctors are treating abortion pills like any other kind of medication the legislation also allows abortion providers to protect themselves from public backlash providers i ve spoken to are interested in supporting people outside of their patient roster they re willing to have people self refer to them to provide abortion care to the general public said millar but they don t want to be publicly listed as an abortion provider advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content in fact only a small number of physicians and facilities who do provide abortions publicly identify that fact according to the arcc s list of clinics there are only 23 publicly declared providers in ontario but that number doesn t accurately reflect that number of providers that actually exist in the province action canada s database of providers which is used to refer patients who call in to the nearest provider to them includes a number of facilities and physicians who remain unlisted to the public in other words they will accept referrals from patients who gain their information through the access line but they won t publicly advertise that they provide abortion services stigma is still very prevalent even though we live in a country that prides itself on believing that people have a right to bodily autonomy said millar there is still abortion stigma they still have some fear around being known for the services they re providing it s too bad because that in and of itself creates a barrier advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content she added the more difficult it is to find out where to go the longer it will take and the more difficult it will be to access services at all services available but challenges remain in greater sudbury there are no healthcare providers who publicly state that they provide abortion services including hsn however according to public health sudbury and districts there are multiple providers of medical abortions as well as one provider of surgical abortion while it isn t easy to find this information on your own there are several resources in place to direct patients to the proper care public health for example can be a first point of contact for many patients province there s a lot of fear and anxiety during this time so our role is to talk to them about the different options available to them said carol lougheed a public health nurse in the health protection division we really encourage individuals to talk to someone they can trust someone they can really count on for support and just weigh the pros and cons advertisement 10 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to lougheed when a patient comes in with an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy they can refer them to counselling and other services that help the patient decide how they want to proceed we re very supportive of the idea that this needs to be their own personal decision she said we ll help them by giving them information but we never encourage a client to make any specific decision from there they can refer them to support services or other health providers whether they intend to continue their pregnancy pursue adoption or terminate the pregnancy while hsn won t confirm whether its provides abortion services it does have a phone number for their options clinic which is publicly advertised as its point of contact for patients looking for information advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content but just because these services exist doesn t mean access in sudbury is without its issues according to arthur stigma and lack of knowledge are some of the most difficult issues to navigate even in areas where services are offered the protection providers have under the freedom of information act for example are a catch 22 the issue is that the anti choice have been known to try to ferret out information on who s providing abortions then they go and picket and harass doctors that s where that protection is coming from but then people can t find out where to go for services some of the groups hit hardest by this are marginalized and indigenous communities low income people immigrants youth and lgbtq individuals advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content cass kuntsi who works with youth and is part of a group organizing a pro choice rally in sudbury on sunday said she s seen how stigma can prevent young people from reaching out there s a lack of education she said a lot of the time they don t want to ask because they either don t have somebody that they trust to ask or they re embarrassed if they don t have somebody they can confide in who can help them access resources then they feel very alone and isolated connecting people with the resources they need she said is key i think that education is super important especially in our area she said it s great to say don t do it but you also have to provide a solution for when a problem does arise ignorance is bliss until it s not advertisement 13 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content where does that start nurturance and validation she said it s a

rattled and uncertain of its future twitter stumbles on under the cloud of elon musk s buyout bid twitter is left in limbo san francisco anxious employees wary advertisers and hamstrung management twitter is limping along as it waits to learn how the fight over elon musk s buyout bid will end just days before the first court hearing in twitter s lawsuit seeking to force the tesla boss to close the 44 billion deal the firm is stuck in limbo the best conclusion for me would be that he leaves us alone so that we can go on our merry way an engineer at the key social media network told afp on condition of anonymity the engineer spoke of employees departing and a climate of uncertainty that does not leave one with a peaceful state of mind we re still trying to do our work normally because the main reasons why we chose to work for twitter still hold true he added but there s been nothing normal about musk s unsolicited bid that he s now backed away from saying twitter has obfuscated on the number of fake accounts on the platform he has harangued the network on its own platform no less with mocking tweets about its management and direction musk s repeated disparagement of twitter and its personnel create uncertainty that harm twitter and its stockholders the firm s lawyers argued in their lawsuit lodged this week the billionaire s comments also expose twitter to adverse effects on its business operations employees and stock price the lawyers added a judge has set the first hearing in the case for tuesday in a court in the eastern state of delaware sluggish ad sales twitter is facing a huge image crisis and confidence in its leadership is wavering emarketer analyst debra williamson told afp but whether the musk situation has affected its revenues is unclear she said the most loyal advertisers have likely stuck around but those less committed to twitter may have scaled back their spending while waiting for the endgame angelo carusone president of watchdog group media matters thinks the damage is already done because musk has been a frequent critic of content moderation the fight against hate and disinformation is widely defended internally but also by many advertisers concerned that their brands are not associated with toxic messages carusone said that in early may at an annual marketing event where companies negotiate large advertising deals twitter was not able to give advertisers any clarity or confidence that it would continue to be safe showcase for them they didn t go anywhere close to what they normally sell at that event and it s obviously been sluggish since then he added the san francisco based social network cannot afford to lose customers unlike big fish such as google and facebook parent meta which dominate online advertising and make billions in profits twitter lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020 and 2021 the group will capture less than one percent of global ad revenue in 2022 according to emarketer compared to 12 5 percent for facebook 9 percent for instagram and nearly two percent for booming upstart tiktok on top of that twitter s user base is barely expected to grow and may even shrink in the united states noted williamson the emarketer analyst twitter can t meaningfully respond musk once had potential twitter investors salivating with his talk of growing revenue fivefold and aiming for a billion users by 2028 instead a court battle is building to end either with twitter being owned by an unhappy investor who decided he didn t want it after all or with twitter on its own and weaker than it was before this all started williamson added the battle is set to last for months and at a time when economic headwinds are steady and firms need to be nimble to monetize new audio and video formats diversify revenue sources and attract younger audiences at least facebook can respond to current threats even if they re responding poorly they can respond said carusone the media matters president what twitter cannot do right now is meaningfully respond to anything the social network s lawyers have blamed musk for withholding consent for two employee retention programs designed to keep selected top talent during a period of intense uncertainty generated in large part by musk s erratic conduct internally some employees have also lost confidence in management which they would have liked to be more combative in dealing with the world s richest person parker lyons a financial analyst at twitter went so far as to tweet several memes that took aim at the firm s board for its deal with musk in one the board is shown firing bullets into twitter above the sarcastic caption who could have done this
brookfield wis july 15 2022 globe newswire cib marine bancshares inc the company or cibm otcqx cibh the holding company of cibm bank announced its unaudited results of operations and financial condition for the quarter and six months ended june 30 2022 net income for core banking activity i e deposits and portfolio loans strengthened however earnings declined as a result of substantially reduced mortgage banking income following the significant rise in mortgage interest rates net income for the quarter was 0 9 million or 0 68 basic and 0 49 diluted earnings per share compared to 1 4 million or 1 08 basic and 0 63 diluted earnings per share for the same period of 2021 and net income for the six month period was 1 8 million or 1 38 basic and 1 00 diluted earnings per share compared

million and 3 23 respectively compared to 5 8 million and 3 26 respectively in the same period of 2021 and 11 4 million and 3 15 respectively for the six month period compared to 11 5 million and 3 24 respectively for the same period of 2021 the six month period includes 0 3 million less ppp loan fee accretion income and 0 2 million more subordinated debt interest expense compared to the same period in 2021 revealing a stronger result for core banking activity in 2022 versus 2021 ppp loans are substantially paid down as of june 30 2022 with remaining principal balances of 0 2 million and a negligible amount of fees left to accrete in the future net mortgage banking revenues were down 1 5 million and 5 0 million for the quarter and six month period respectively compared to the same periods of 2021 the change was due to a 54 decline in loan originations for the six months ended june 30 2022 compared to the same period of 2021 as a result of an increase of more than 150 basis points in average mortgage rates that also prompted tightening margins across the industry as mortgage producers began to compete more intensively for each mortgage related mortgage division compensation expenses were also down 0 8 million and 2 5 million for the quarter and six month period respectively when compared to the same periods in 2021 although nominally up from the lows reported for march 31 2022 asset quality measures remain near cycle best levels as of june 30 2022 non performing assets restructured loans and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing to

due to ongoing marketing activity short term federal funds and us t bill interest rates have risen substantially since the beginning of the year and as a result pressure on balances is expected to increase mr j brian chaffin cibm s president and ceo commented we continue to focus on growing and improving our core banking activities and are seeing positive outcomes including improved net interest income composition and growth in key loan and deposit balances although reduced residential mortgage activity has had a large impact on our earnings in 2022 compared to the prior two years it has also afforded us the ability to make significant progress in the implementation of a new mortgage loan operating system which will provide a better loan origination experience for both employees and customers alike in the future he added project falcon which we launched two years ago also concentrates on identifying and implementing internal process improvements and efficiency enhancing technologies that allow us to maximize our internal capacity this is critically important as we target improved efficiencies through higher core revenues as well as improvements in our cost structure and controls mr chaffin also cautioned with growing economic uncertainty high inflation rates and rising interest rates recession risks are significant in the foreseeable future as a result we are both seeking business opportunities to enhance our performance in the current markets and actively managing the loan portfolio to reflect higher future credit risks he concluded as a reminder at our 2022 annual meeting we announced plans to redeem approximately 5 830 shares of series a preferred stock during the fourth quarter of 2022 the redemption will be pro rata among series a preferred

by sarah jane tribble mexico mo when the new corporate owners of two rural hospitals suddenly announced they would stop admitting patients one friday in march kayla schudel a nurse stood resolute in the nearly empty lobby of audrain community hospital you ll be seen the er is open the hospital with 40 beds and five clinics typically saw 24 to 50 emergency room cases a day treating patients from the surrounding 1 000 plus acre farms and tiny no stoplight towns she said she wouldn t abandon them a week later noble health had the final word it locked the doors noble a three year old startup that acquired audrain and nearby callaway community hospital offered explanations on social media including a technology issue and a need to restructure their operations to keep the hospitals financially viable the company should have had plentiful resources to keep them afloat noble was launched in late 2019 by nueterra capital a venture capital and private equity firm that has raised millions of dollars to back dozens of health care companies according to nueterra s portfolio and federal filings don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free what s more in addition to medicare and medicaid funds noble had received nearly 20 million in federal covid relief money in the 18 months before it closed the hospitals funds whose use is still not fully accounted for private equity investors with their focus on buying cheap and reaping quick returns are moving voraciously into the u s health care system investments increased twentyfold from 2000 to 2018 and have only accelerated since financially distressed rural hospitals like audrain are targets putting vulnerable communities at the mercy of firms whose north star is profit rather than patient health a recent report found that 441 more than 20 were at risk of closing or losing services the saga that followed noble into these towns may well serve as a warning flare from the rolling wheat and corn fields between kansas city and st louis noble acquired the hospitals after charming local leaders desperate to save beloved local institutions and federal regulators did nothing to block or thoroughly vet the acquisition despite red flags noble s directors had little health care experience the one who did was donald r peterson whose previous foray into the space an infusion company ended with charges of medicare fraud just months later he became one of two directors of noble along with nueterra s chairman daniel r tasset according to a state filing in an emailed response to questions from khn peterson said the startup was meant to do good we created noble to save a rural hospital that was about to close tasset could not be reached for comment audrain had struggled before noble came calling said dr joe corrado a longtime surgeon at the hospital on an average day in 2019 40 of beds were empty as more treatments moved to the outpatient setting and some patients drove an hour to larger hospitals for specialty care things grew worse rather than better under the new private equity owners according to corrado as well as state and federal documents gained through months of public records requests and dozens of interviews with community leaders health officials and residents once noble owned callaway and audrain the hospitals stopped paying their bills according to lawsuits filed by contract nurses security guards and others inspection reports from the state workers coordinating with the centers for medicare medicaid services were alarming listing 135 pages of deficiencies that put patients at risk for their health and safety corrado saw his hospital being whittled away supplies for surgery disappeared crucial medicines went unstocked paychecks never came he said just days before noble suspended operations he told management we don t have the ability to do the things we need to take care of patients when state health department surveyors arrived at the callaway hospital in late summer 2021 only three patients remained all in the geriatric psychiatry unit inspectors reported they witnessed a suicidal 77 year old stab her own leg with an ink pen that an 85 year old missed his medicine over the weekend because a pharmacist was unavailable and that nurses waited five minutes to provide oxygen after surgery because the machine malfunctioned ambar la forgia a columbia university assistant professor who studies private equity in health care said the business model in general is all about creating short term returns for shareholders the emphasis on profit she said is not necessarily great for the patient don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free that la forgia said raises hard questions for rural america is a bad hospital better than no hospital and how should federal regulators who approve hospital purchases and monitor their performance thread that needle hospitals hollowed out of drugs supplies and salaries audrain was once a 247 bed regional destination for care with more than 4 300 admissions in 1992 according to a county bond report internal medicine doctors orthopedic surgeons and pulmonologists competed to admit the most patients by 2019 it was a shadow of that former self yet patients like dee tate diagnosed with cancer in 2020 relied on it she got blood tests scans port placement and chemotherapy to put her into remission all at audrain so she was shocked when her oncologist dr shahid waheed told tate he couldn t perform her scheduled infusion this january if i don t take this treatment the likeliness of this kind of cancer coming back goes way way up she said the medication rituxan was not in short supply nationally noble could not stock it because the hospital purchasing department did not have the money for it according to a former hospital employee who spoke on condition of anonymity ultimately the person said the staff bought it directly from the supplier tate s infusion was five weeks late it came from indiana she recalled tate along with about 500 other patients now must travel at least 40 miles for cancer care in the operating suite corrado said he could never be sure supplies like anesthesia medicines bandages and catheters would be available for surgeries from mastectomies to emergency appendectomies management determined who would be paid on a week by week basis he said on one friday they would pay the employees and they couldn t buy anything else and another week they would be able to maybe buy supplies money troubles were not new to the hospitals despite federal subsidies rural hospitals often struggle because their patients tend to be on medicare or medicaid or have no insurance providing less revenue than commercial insurance the year before noble bought audrain the hospital reported an 18 million loss for patient services on 44 million in patient revenue the callaway hospital had eked out a 170 000 profit from patient care while still owned and operated by nueterra the next year under noble s management callaway reported a nearly 6 million loss on patient services its 2020 medicare cost report showed on paper financial filings show it had spent 43 more than the year before don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free but much of the money was not spent on delivering health care said ge bai a professor of accounting at johns hopkins carey business school who reviewed callaway s most recent medicare cost reports for khn she noted that the hospital received millions in covid relief that it reported as miscellaneous income the hospital s spending on laboratory medical supplies contract nursing and care all increased as is expected in a pandemic bai said but she questioned other line item cost increases for example spending on the non salaried employee benefits climbed 273 to 1 4 million callaway s 18 bed hospital nearly doubled its spending on administration adding 1 1 million in fees paid to nueterra subsidiaries nuehealth and noble in 2020 the hospital also paid noble a 38 000 lease in 2020 a statement filed with callaway county showed these dramatic increases raise a red flag bai said to whom did the money go noble executives repeatedly declined requests for comment or interviews to clarify such questions in late march noble spokesperson nancy mays said they did not have time to answer questions because they were talking to potential buyers and figuring out how to best serve employees right now a sales pitch heavy on charm audrain county officials were easy prey for investors noble was the only bidder for the failing hospital said lou leonatti the longtime local attorney and many in mexico a town of 11 000 and the county seat believed we were saved dana keller the head of mexico s chamber of commerce who felt a hospital was essential to keeping business in town said she set up meetings so noble s executives could talk about their philosophy for rural health care leaders who called themselves progress mexico tried to evaluate the startup at the time we looked at it nueterra had an ownership interest don peterson had an ownership interest drew solomon and tom carter leonatti said but there was much they didn t know or overlooked none of noble s three founding owners had run a hospital or navigated its regulatory demands only peterson a serial entrepreneur who spent decades investing in workstation and information technology businesses had worked briefly in health care and that ended badly in 2012 he created ivxpress now called ivx health with infusion centers in 10 states peterson left ivx in 2018 after a whistleblower accused him of altering claims faking drug purchases and paying a doctor kickbacks peterson settled the resulting medicare fraud charges with the u s health and human services office of inspector general without admitting wrongdoing such oig settlements are in essence the federal government saying that we don t trust you said robert salcido an attorney who specializes in health care fraud jeff morris peterson s attorney said in a letter to khn peterson s five year voluntary exclusion applies to health care programs only this precludes him from making any claim to funds allocated by federal health care programs for services including administrative and management services ordered prescribed or furnished by mr peterson morris said peterson had been diligent in complying with his exclusion which began aug 5 2019 peterson agreed to pay 334 800 in restitution according to the terms violating the agreement could bring criminal prosecution and as much as 4 5 million in penalties within months of the settlement peterson signed noble s filing to register in missouri as a director as well as its secretary vice president and assistant treasurer in april 2020 he ordered medical supplies for the callaway hospital according to a receipt obtained through a public records request pandemic relief and unpaid bills as in much of rural america the pandemic was slow to emerge in callaway and audrain counties but covid 19 cases were climbing by fall 2020 the hospitals hired contract nurses for help and when possible transferred patients to larger urban areas callaway saw a surge in late 2020 and closed its general inpatient care in january 2021 audrain the larger hospital dealt with a surge of daily cases in that span noble pursued all forms of coronavirus related funding on its watch callaway and audrain hospitals attested to receiving about 11 million in federal relief which rolled out after the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act was enacted in march 2020 noble s hospitals also took in 4 8 million in loans from the federal paycheck protection program that have been forgiven hospital cost reports from 2020 indicate that the millions should have helped audrain s health care staffing costs were 3 5 million and callaway s were 562 000 noble also turned to state and local officials missouri distributed 1 1 million to noble from its cares funding mostly to callaway for covid testing callaway county drew from two of its own federal allocations for the hospital as of february leaders had approved more than 14 000 for covid testing funded by the american rescue plan act in addition invoices provided through a public records request show that the county used cares act funding to pay noble s hospital nearly 364 000 for covid testing operations and marketing noble sought audrain county s help last fall to pay contract nurses after pandemic costs soared its commissioners approved a one year 1 8 million loan using arpa money the loan is due in september at a 2 5 interest rate if noble defaults the rate climbs to 5 even as the hospitals looked flush with federal money contractors were pulling out according to lawsuits that allege more than 2 million in unpaid bills in one suit filed april 21 moberly anesthesia associates said the audrain hospital failed to pay nearly 214 000 for services provided among other lawsuits sodexo operations a food services provider signed a contract with noble audrain in may 2021 and filed suit in january saying it is owed more than 555 000 contract agency grace staffing pulled its nurses from callaway s er and other floors last year saying it is owed more than 125 000 ptc laboratories in columbia missouri said noble owes more than 500 000 in back payments and late fees for thousands of covid tests of callaway employees noble health executives carter and solomon declined to comment on the lawsuits nueterra capital ceo jeremy tasset the son of daniel tasset said in a march email that we are a minority investor in the real estate and have nothing to do with the operations of the hospitals callaway county records show noble owes more than 72 000 in unpaid property taxes and penalties audrain and callaway counties records confirm that noble kept hospital operations and real estate assets separate a common move experts said from the private equity playbook when profits are expected from property value rather than medicine said rosemary batt a management professor at cornell university that s a tipoff that they must be doing something to monetize the real estate to make money patients at risk for their health and safety eileen o grady research manager at the nonprofit private equity stakeholder project said private equity s focus on strong speedy returns makes it a risky business model for health care in rural hospitals o grady said there are very few ways to boost revenue and cut expenses without having an impact on patient care indeed by late summer 2021 federal and state inspectors found alarming deficiencies at the callaway hospital and gave noble 23 days to fix them noble took some corrective actions so inspectors cleared the hospital to admit patients and receive funding but it was not exactly a clean bill of health the september checklist of deficiencies spanned 16 pages compared with 135 the month before some lapses such as not staffing an overnight er doctor were unaddressed at the audrain hospital inspectors found ineffective management its electronic medical record system did not keep patient information its behavioral health staff did not retain records or footage of an alleged patient assault and inspectors found long electrical cords next to beds a risk for strangulation meanwhile the three men who ran noble were shopping for more hospitals to buy solomon and carter pitched noble s services to officials in fort scott kansas whose hospital had closed in 2018 city and county leaders on july 23 2021 paid 1 million from their american rescue plan act funds for noble to study the feasibility of reopening the money was paid to a new company peterson founded in june access medical advisors solomon president of noble s real estate company told the county in late march of an incredible finding from the study fort scott s hospital building was worth 19 6 million which could present the borrowing basis or the bonding basis for a really great viable community project to move forward solomon s discovery came as noble s hospitals in missouri remained closed staffers looked for new jobs and patients traveled even farther for care it came as noble health appeared to be unraveling in late march and april the kansas city attorney who registered the company its hospitals its real estate entities and access medical advisors philip krause informed state officials he had resigned his positions with all of them peterson s linkedin page said he has retired from noble health in march he incorporated a new company noble health services based at his home address a half

alexanderford erie indemnity company nasdaq erie remains robust with solid fundamentals it is well positioned given its highly strategic pricing and strong customer base its stellar balance sheet proves its adequate capacity to sustain its size and cover its borrowings and dividends now that p c insurance is at the forefront of climate change growth prospects are more attractive even better the stock price does not appear divorced from its fundamentals anymore company performance with almost a century of existence in erie pennsylvania erie indemnity company acts as the attorney in fact for the erie insurance exchange owned by the policyholders and subscribers it engages in p c insurance providing underwriting renewal services and policy issuance for the policyholders so its primary revenue stream is the management fee from policy issuance and renewal and reimbursements erie and the erie insurance exchange maintain a mutual dependency they ensure the fundamental soundness of one another their strong bond lies with the policyholders or subscribers as such erie imposes a management fee from a portion of written premiums the management fee rate varies with the current and projected financials of the exchange as per the subscriber s agreement the maximum management fee of the written premiums is 25 put it simply the success of its insurance companies at the exchange is also the success of erie the increase in written and retained policies leads to more returns for erie to understand it better the primary function of erie is to run and manage the business operations erie indemnity co operates a very unique business model it is because the exchange does not have employees or agents so it provides other services including customer and administrative support it sales and advertising and agent compensation it is classified as an insurance company but it acts more like an insurance service provider it may be pretty unconventional but this model drives a more stable level of viability today insurance data are geared towards the continued flourishing of insurance businesses at the exchange in fact there is an increased policyholder and subscriber retention it is most evident in the health insurance exchange with a booming cagr it is primarily driven by pandemic fears i believe the p c insurance is going in the same trend since it is also at the forefront of climate change resilience the same uptrend is visible in erie indemnity company in erie the policies in force are 3 1 higher than in 1q 2021 it is a combination of increased new premiums and policy retention the policy retention rate increased by 0 9 it is way better than in 1q 2021 with an 8 decrease from 1q 2020 likewise new premiums are 4 higher than in 1q 2021 and 20 higher than in 1q 2020 both its commercial and personal lines are showing upward momentum it is a pleasant trend since policy issuance and renewals are its primary revenue growth drivers the operating revenue of erie including investment income amounts to 669 million it is a 6 year over year growth from the comparative quarter again it is driven by its primary revenue stream the management fee from policy issuance and renewals its administrative services reimbursement revenue is also higher than in the previous year indeed its popularity in pennsylvania and the boom in the underlying insurance businesses are driving its success operating revenue marketwatch but erie does not depend on external factors alone it has a large operating capacity and capital allowing it to sustain its operations and innovation note that even the insurance industry is also geared to technology amidst the digital transformation also its insurance business has strategic pricing which is lower than many of its peers in pennsylvania the average annual premium for its homeowners insurance is only 774 nerdwallet rates it with 4 5 stars making it one of the top five insurance service providers in the state the premium is also lower than the state and national average of 930 and 1 784 respectively likewise its auto insurance of 1 288 is way lower than the state and national average of 2 002 and 1 771 as such it is more flexible which is more vital amidst inflationary pressures and increased demand for p c insurance there is still more room to adjust the prices to generate more premiums and offset the rising expenses with more premiums more services are needed from erie and in turn more management and administrative fees home insurance and auto insurance price nerdwallet and bankrate even better erie maintains its efficient management there are no economies of scale since the increase in revenues is also the same as the increase in expenses yet the fact that it keeps its costs and expenses manageable means a lot for the company the operations are more stable compared to 3q and 4q 2021 note that the impact of hurricane ida led to an upsurge in insurance claims and demand it adheres to the industry trend wherein underlying insurance businesses in an exchange are realizing more stable income the operating margin is 0 125 vs 0 12 in the comparative quarter operating margin marketwatch why erie indemnity company may stay afloat amidst economic uncertainties the recovery of the us economy does not appear to be as simple as initially expected the increased production and spending are causing a surge in prices so the recent inflation rate set another all time high at 9 1 it is most evident in the real estate market given the skyrocketing demand and shortage now average home prices are over 400 000 it is no wonder that the housing market has appeared to cool down with a 3 decrease in revenues in contrast inflation makes the value of the house house parts and belongings higher so the demand for p c insurance may be sustained we must also consider the increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters in recent years hurricane ida is a perfect example leading to 2 5 3 5 billion in damages in pennsylvania also the demand for houses is still above pre pandemic levels with the millennials comprising the majority that is why p c insurance is at the forefront of climate resilience and may expand by 3 3 3 7 from 2022 to 2024 homeowners insurance market expansion insurance journal likewise the auto insurance industry observes a shortage of new and old cars but its value is still high as more people still prefer to drive private cars earlier this year 80 of americans expressed their preference for private cars when going to work and other establishments it also adheres to the 7 upsurge in car sales in 1q 2022 auto insurance may benefit from its spillovers rvs are still in an uptrend despite the increased price of fuels the pent up demand for leisure travel is the primary growth driver given this the industry performance may stay robust in the following years these may lead to a sustained increase in its personal and commercial lines also it may improve its auto insurance segment which is a substantial factor that affects its profitability it is still possible given its impressive policy retention and renewal it may expand to take advantage of the potential boom it is on the right track as it continues to capitalize on innovation and technology erie has more attractive growth prospects given the potential increase in the industry also it has a strong market positioning with its strategic pricing and customer base yet its strong financial position is what makes it solid and sustainable its cash and cash equivalents alone are enough to cover its borrowings if we add all its investment securities they will comprise about 50 of the total assets its investment securities are also prudent which may produce more yields in the long run it may be a challenge now given the increased interest rates but their appeal appears to rebound as recession fears return overall its balance sheet is stellar cash and cash equivalents and borrowings marketwatch stock price assessment the stock price is in a sharp uptrend in the last two months after its dip from 4q 2021 to april 2022 it rebounded to its range in december at 191 38 the stock price is only 1 higher than the starting price the pe ratio of 34 24 is way higher than the ideal and historical earnings multiple other valuation ratios like ev ebitda of 23 84 also show that the price is high meanwhile dividend payments are high and uninterrupted with a dividend yield of 2 33 it is way higher than the s p 500 and nasdaq components with 1 69 and 1 51 respectively for its consistent dividend payments in over thirty years it is part of the dividend champions this year quarterly payments are 1 11 per share which is 7 higher than in the previous year they are still well covered with a dividend payout ratio of 85 we can assess the price better using the dcf model and dividend payout ratio dcf model fcff 244 000 000 cash 141 000 outstanding borrowings 900 000 perpetual growth rate 4 8 wacc 9 common shares outstanding 52 290 000 stock price 191 38 derived value 172 24 dividend discount model stock price 191 38 average dividend growth 0 1077366104 estimated dividends per share 4 44 cost of capital equity 0 1339365268 derived value 169 7239025 or 169 72 both models adhere to the potential overvaluation of the company there may be an 11 15 downside so it does not convey an ideal buying opportunity for now bottom line erie indemnity company is already a sound and well positioned company its fundamentals are a good fit in a challenging market and also show attractive growth prospects dividends are also enticing and sustainable but the stock price is not at an ideal level of 168 172 the valuations show it is not a good time to buy stocks now even so i am confident about its performance so investors must still wait for a better entry point the recommendation is that erie indemnity company is a hold

this is how twitter s edit button will finally work image source ians news san francisco july 16 microblogging site twitter s board of directors unanimously recommended that its shareholders vote to approve tech billionaire elon musk s 44 billion acquisition of the company twitter said in a proxy filing with the securities and exchange commission sec on friday that it is inviting shareholders to attend a special meeting at an unspecified date to vote on a proposal to adopt the original acquisition plan made in late april reports cnbc we are committed to closing the merger on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk the company was quoted as saying in the filing your vote at the special meeting is critical to our ability to complete the merger it added twitter reminded investors that the purchase price represented a 38 per cent premium to where the stock was trading before musk first disclosed a stake in the company it s fallen dramatically since then closing on friday at 37 74 which is 30 per cent below the agreed upon deal price musk said last week that he was terminating the deal after claiming that twitter failed to provide the requested data on bots and how prominent they are on the platform the microblogging site responded by suing musk to enforce the merger agreement a recent report indicated that twitter lawyers from wachtell lipton rosen katz law firms were preparing for a long drawn court battle after musk filed paperwork with the us sec to exit the acquisition deal

last week elon musk announced he was terminating the deal to buy twitter on tuesday twitter responded by filing a lawsuit in a delaware court demanding that musk be ordered to complete the deal he d agreed to the general consensus seems to be that twitter has a pretty good case however that doesn t mean they re going to win twitter has requested an expedited trial which would be over in a week but today musk s lawyers responded by saying the expedited trial should not be allowed because this case is going to turn on a lot of details about twitter s business that will require expert testimony advertisement musk s court filing accuses twitter of dragging its feet on giving him the data he wanted on bots and then asking for warp speed when it came to setting a trial date twitter argued in its lawsuit that musk has been acting in bad faith and every day that the uncertainty around the acquisition hangs over them the more damage is done to the company the tone of musk s response is similarly fiery offering a preview of the heated legal wrangling that is to come musk asserts that the case should revolve around twitter s statements about how many bots it thinks are on its platform which he believes are incorrect though he hasn t provided evidence of that claim the core dispute over false and spam accounts is fundamental to twitter s value musk s lawyers wrote in the filing it is also extremely fact and expert intensive requiring substantial time for discovery according to the filing the turning point came when musk sought to understand how the process for identifying bots worked and was shocked to see it involved human reviewers looking at very small samples on april 28 just three days after signing the agreement twitter restated three years of its mdau numbers despite never disclosing the issue to defendants pre signing post signing defendants promptly sought to understand twitter s process for identifying false or spam accounts in a may 6 meeting with twitter executives musk was flabbergasted to learn just how meager twitter s process was human reviewers randomly sampled 100 accounts per day less than 0 00005 of daily users and applied unidentified standards to somehow conclude every quarter for nearly three years that fewer than 5 of twitter users were false or spam that s it no automation no ai no machine learning twitter has led defendants on a two month treasure hunt of delays technical bottlenecks evasive answers and ultimately refusals for example on june 15 twitter provided defendants with something it misleadingly labeled the twttr firehose internal which the media has widely reported was twitter s firehose but it was not in fact the firehose ex 6 at 1 2 instead defendants received a bespoke partial data set structured to make the necessary machine analysis impossible id defendants attempted to navigate these roadblocks with requests from morgan stanley beginning may 9 and sent follow up letters on may 25 and 31 and june 6 putting twitter on notice of breach 17 and 29 before ultimately concluding that twitter was intentionally withholding requested information ex 5 twitter itself admitted as much writing to defendants on june 20 that while it would finally provide its existing firehose stream over a month late that data would be insufficient to perform the spam analysis defendants sought to conduct because twitter still refused to provide the private data required ex 7 at 3 twitter even refused to provide the basic account lists necessary for an analysis based on public information see ex 8 at 4 the user information requested relates directly to the closing conditions the availability of financing and transition planning for the business advertisement cnn business published an analysis piece today prior to musk s court filing about what s really going on in this case the author s argument is that while twitter may have a strong case that does not mean they are going to win in fact given that the company s stock is now in the dumps a protracted legal battle with the world s richest man is not really great for business basically twitter is negotiating toward the most favorable final settlement which probably won t be musk buying the company for 54 20 per share since the deal price of 54 20 per share represents a huge premium over twitter s current stock price twitter s board has a duty to shareholders to try to see the deal through or at least to get as much money out of musk as possible and the only way a court will side in its favor is if twitter shows it is making a good faith effort to complete the agreement alternatively twitter could negotiate a lower price for the deal or a settlement that allows musk to walk away and hope that its shareholders don t disapprove or musk could win and walk away leaving twitter with nothing or worse deal or no deal musk remains one of twitter s largest shareholders but that too could change if he chooses to wash his hands of the company with potential ripple effects for the company s other shareholders it s hard to imagine how the company is going to get itself together and go forward regardless of how the suit resolves said carl tobias a professor at the university of richmond school of law it may just not have a very happy resolution unfortunately it s going to be a very messy litigation said kenneth henderson a partner at law firm bryan cave leighton paisner twitter isn t necessarily litigating to go all the way through to the end and get a court order compelling musk to close henderson said they re litigating to position twitter in the best place to get as much money out of musk that they can advertisement the next move in this case is a hearing this coming tuesday on whether or not to grant the expedited trial requested by twitter if the judge grants that it would put twitter in a stronger position and signal the judge may only be looking at this as musk trying to bust a contract if the judge doesn t grant that request that could set up the war of attrition cnn business is suggesting is likely an outcome that would probably benefit musk so we ll have our first indication of how this is going next week
