investments in the last mile semiconductors are at the center of global supply chain issues and how businesses like amd and marvell technology are reacting and are reacting tech behemoths like apple alphabet and meta platforms are preparing for the metaverse but so are smaller companies like unity software chris hill today on motley fool money we ve got a closer look at some of the retailers investing in the last mile and some of the tech companies investing in the metaverse all that and more coming up right now i m chris hill joined by motley fool senior analyst emily flippen thanks for being here emily flippen thanks for having me chris chris hill we ve also got surprising automotive news from the first day of ces but we re going to begin with the future of food this morning kfc announced it will roll out a beyond meat bynd 2 26 version of its fried chicken nationwide starting next monday shares of both beyond meat and kfc s parent company yum brands up slightly on this news emily they started testing this in the summer of 2019 they ve been working on this for a while so you have to believe they re confident in this national launch emily flippen i actually think they re not confident chris the reason why i say that is because when i reflect on the last quarter for beyond meat and the way that management talked about their food service sales that s the sales of their products in places like restaurants versus grocery stores they are feeling was actually really tepid and this was coming out at a time when they already had the partnership with yum china s kfc in china as well as with chains like panda express i actually think the presser is on for beyond meat right now because consumers and investors are looking at the partnerships they ve made in the past in particular that with dunkin donuts and they are looking and asking themselves okay well is this going to be a thing that actually sticks around or is this going to be another dunkin as many investors will remember beyond meat had a launch a couple of years ago with dunkin really publicized had snoop dogg in it and it saw the dunkin beyond sausage sandwiches rolled out nationwide and earlier this year those were actually pulled back they need this kfc launch to be really successful and they need that partnership to last longer than 9 12 months they need that partnership to last for five 10 years into the future chris hill i remember trying that dunkin breakfast sandwich i liked it and my problem with the sandwich was not the beyond meat sausage it was actually the dunkin part of it but anyway let s go back to the partnerships for a second because that s one of the questions i have about this business you look at the stock it is basically where it was on the first day it went public it s been cut in half over the past year what is going to drive this stock higher is it partnerships like this sticking around or is it the retail presence and really becoming more of a daily habit in everyday consumer lives emily flippen in my opinion and as a shareholder of beyond meat i think it s the partnerships with the foodservice at the restaurant in fast casual establishments that is going to be the thing that will set beyond meat apart if you actually look at fast foods supply chains relationships between the suppliers and the change themselves have tended to be really sticky there s a lot of work that goes into bringing a new product into a foodservice location it s not done very quickly you can actually look at the way that mcdonald s started its partnership with coke as an example they had this initial agreement decades ago but its consents continued in this lock step motion and to this day you can still only find cokes and mcdonald s you ll never go to mcdonald s and get a pepsi once those relationships are formed they tend to be pretty lasting now this hasn t been the case for beyond meat thus far again pointing to that dunkin partnership but if they can get that type of decade s long lasting relationship with foodservice establishment that s going to create really sticky long lasting partnerships that should result in some decent shareholder returns from this point out the big question right now is well our foodservice establishments really going to be buying into not just the non meat alternatives but beyond meat s non meat alternatives chris hill i m really fascinated to see how this plays out now because i m thinking about what you said right at the top your belief is that beyond meat is maybe not as confident in this launch this is a nationwide launch this is something that kfc tested in a couple of localities in the southeast part of the united states they ve got 4 000 restaurants across the us doesn t kfc at least have to be confident in this launch emily flippen typically when you have a foodservice establishment that is looking at a trend you can look at the chicken sandwiches as an example they want to act quickly being the last person to act means that you ve already lost the momentum behind the trend and the fact that it s taken so many years for yum in the united states to really get behind beyond meat here and get behind this chicken product says to me one of two things they re nervous about the staying power of this trend or they re nervous about the quality of the products now that doesn t mean that this launch can t be successful again as a shareholder i really hope that it is but the time that it has taken from initiation to creation is a little bit worrying to me chris hill shares of nikola are up seven percent this morning the ev company struck a deal with usa truck logistics business usa truck will buy 10 of nikola s electric trucks seems like a nice little deal but what does it say about nikola that the stock is up seven percent on a deal for just 10 trucks emily flippen well it says a lot about the history of what it means to be the company that is nikola let s take a step back for people who are not familiar with this carmaker it was a business that went public in 2020 had the goal of creating hydrogen fuel cell trucks and other electric vehicles for commercial sale shortly after its ipo the founder and ceo trevor milton was actually indicted for criminal and securities fraud reportedly lying about nearly all aspects of the business when you see the stock up on such a what would normally be say for business like tesla a small amount of news it really just goes to show the very low amount of expectations that investors have for this business nikola still trying to come out of this controversy as a real carmaker they re making some headway here they delivered their first pilot trucks at the end of last year that was the first step in the business to reach production in sales the buy in here even in the only the amount of around 10 cars still says hey maybe there s some opportunity for production to wrap up in this business chris hill you mentioned tesla and i know that tesla is the obvious comparison for any ev maker but when i read this news i actually thought about ford motor because the f 150 lightning electric truck is coming out this spring and the bad news for nikola is they re not just competing against the likes of tesla they re now about to be in direct competition with ford motor and based on everything we ve read we ll see when it actually launches but based on everything we ve read so far it seems like there s a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the new ev version of the f 150 emily flippen there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about electric vehicles in general we re seeing that tipping come in terms of adoption here but these are still electric trucks that they re selling and as you mentioned everyone in their docks right now are making electric cars electric trucks what was supposed to be the aspect that setting nikola apart was the fact that they were going to be making hydrogen fuel cell trucks that was what was promised when they ipo ed in 2020 they did pivot back toward electric vehicles because it was easier for them to get out and scale without needing the logistics and infrastructure for hydrogen fuel across the united states they still want those hydrogen fuel cell trucks to be launched in 2023 i d imagine that a lot of people who are still holding onto shares of nikola are owning these shares not under the premise that they re going to be the next tesla or the next ford in terms of their electric vehicle production but in the belief that hydrogen and hydrogen fuel cell trucks can be the new long way range that we use to transport machines and other items across the country they haven t created that yet so it s still very much in the air chris hill the last thing before we move on in terms of nikola you look at the stock it s down about 65 percent off of its recent highs i understand the enthusiasm for at least some investors out there who think ok there s this stock that s been beaten down this is a nice deal they ve struck here maybe this paves the way for more like this is it worth looking at their stock or are there enough question marks with the underlying business of nikola that you just think to yourself you know what if you want to invest in evs there are better places for your investing dollars emily flippen i tend to agree with the latter chris which is if you re interested in this space there are companies that have proven out a bit stronger than nikola has that being said if you are a purist in the world of hydrogen and you really believe that that s the future then maybe you take a look at this company under the understanding that that concept and that technology has not been proven out yet and that that is going to be a very long term investment as you wait for the technology to catch up to the ideas here the important caveat i will add before moving on is that when we talk about this story again that letter of intent from u s a truck for 10 battery powered electric vehicles with an option to purchase 90 more over the next two years it s vital to remember that there s a difference between a purchase order and a letter of intent nikola has done a great job in getting a lot of these letters of intent it s wonderful but it s not the same thing as that purchase order it s more of an agreement that two parties want the same thing to happen i want nikola to do well but whether or not those purchase orders come in whether or not those deliveries happen especially as they apply to the hydrogen business i think is still very much in the air chris hill let s stick with automotive today s the first day of ces largest consumer electronics show in the world thousands of exhibitors in las vegas and one of the trends we ve seen over the past 5 10 years is the increasing presence of automakers at ces automotive news coming out of ces is not surprising what is surprising is that today the automotive news out of ces is not from an automaker it s from sony the consumer electronics companies sony rolled out the vision as electric suv as apparently a direct challenge to tesla there are a couple of things i want to get to here but first what was your reaction to this story because mine was just utter surprise emily flippen well my first reaction was forgetting that sony was even still a publicly traded company that was apparently innovating on the backend here the fact that sony was even add ces to me was my immediate kind of oh i guess they re still around and i will tell you what chris and prepping for today s show i did take a look at that stock performance over the last couple of years and it s actually been pretty phenomenal now whether or not sony mobility which is their separate division within sony that will so focus solely on those electric vehicles ends up being the thing that propels that stock price even higher over the next five years i think i m still not quite sold on the concept but i was impressed by the fact that they were still apparently trucking even though i had no idea what s happening on the backend chris hill i got to say i do like the fact that they are being very upfront about their ambition with respect to getting into the automotive space so often executive teams are trying to obfuscate in some way they re being pretty direct about what their goal is that said this is a challenge that they re going to face and by the way apple will face this too if they ever actually produce the much rumored apple car which is why should i trust you with my safety i think that s the challenge for any non auto maker like just because i like your phone doesn t mean i m going to trust you to build a car that i feel safe driving around emily flippen i m actually interested in the fact that you came away from the story with the feeling that they weren t obfuscating their perspective on what they were going to do because only four months ago sony was saying we are not interested in launching a commercial car so from september 2021 to today in january 2022 something changed behind the scenes and that actually points to some of the issues i think that exists behind their capital allocation strategy which is they just throw money at the wall and they see what sticks this idea that they ve been piloting for the past year was supposed to be focusing on the sony sensors and instead they ve turned it into this entire vehicle division to me it just begs the question of well why don t you use what your competitive advantage is when i m looking at sony they could be innovative in creating an appliance or a plug in that improves that customer experience of smart devices or electric vehicles but i think they took a cop out approach here by just taking their sensors sticking them on an electric vehicle and saying look we re a car company now i wish i had seen a bit more innovation a bit more creativity on the backend something that would say look sony is going to be the competitor here in this specific niche because when i look at the potential for apple s again to this space obviously tesla being a big player we just talked about nikola and all these other businesses that are going to be competitors i can t help but think i don t see sony coming out as a winner chris hill i am glad you mentioned capital allocation because that was another thought i had again as you mentioned the last couple of years the stock performance for sony has been pretty strong and one of my thoughts this morning was really this is what you re going to put your money toward why don t you stick to your knitting in terms of consumer electronics in terms of gaming that sort of thing moving away from sony because capital allocation is so important the skill that any given executive team has with respect to capital allocation is one of those things that never shows up on the balance sheet directly but it s such an important skill if you and i are of the likemind and i think we are that sony could be better at capital allocation than they are at the moment what s a company or two that you look at and you think that s a company that s doing it right in terms of the way that they invest their money whether it s reinvesting in the business paying a dividend buying back shares there are a lot of ways to allocate capital what s the company or two you think that s doing it right emily flippen when we talked about sony taking a cop out approach here i m probably going to be taking a cop out approach with my answer but i think probably one of the best capital allocators we can look at today is actually amazon i love to point that you make about capital allocation skills not showing up on the balance sheet because you know where they also don t show up on the income statement and amazon got a lot of flak for decades about the fact that they weren t producing bottomline earnings and a lot of that was because they were taking capital and reinvesting it pretty aggressively into their business now the good thing is is that the management team at amazon had a pretty clear vision for what they imagine the company to be now that doesn t mean that all of the initiatives and the projects they put money behind succeeded clearly they didn t at the same time the ones that did succeed were accretive to creating amazon as a platform when i look at sony and i look at where they ve allocated capital they ve created numerous products they re almost this conglomerate of interesting things that range from gaming to media and movies to disks to memory sticks but none of them point to sony as a platform sony as a company sony as a brand they all just exist independently i think when you look at the difference of the way that capital is allocated across these two businesses you have one that was done in a way to build up the amazon brand build up the amazon experience whereas sony was just trying to grow their top line with no reflection upon whether or not that capital is really going to be paying dividends for lack of better words over the next few decades chris hill senior analyst emily flippen thanks so much for being here emily flippen thanks for having me chris chris hill it wouldn t be the start of a new year for investors if we didn t get the mother of all predictions from the financial media here with some thoughts on that as well as some trends to watch is motley fool senior analyst jason moser thanks for being here jason moser hey thanks for having me chris hill now in fairness we made predictions for 2022 on last friday s episode above info money but the one that gets the most headlines is the question will the stock market go up in 2022 and i get it it s natural to ask that question it s natural to wonder that if you re an investor but if you re focused on the long term one year doesn t matter jason moser yes i agree with you it reminds me something i was thinking of earlier that in the near term stock price is not really a very good indicator its not a reliable indicator of how a given business may be performing whatever however you want to call it it it s almost like the psychological state of the market at any given point in time but as you noted it s a fun question to deliberate is when we get every year it s when we ask every year it is i think fun to start the conversation everybody is hitting reset at the new year and wanting to think about what the market may do obviously the market coming off of a very strong performance here in 2021 i think up better than 28 percent with dividends and everything included it s going to be difficult to match that performance it s worth remembering for investors that on average the market has a down year one of every three years and the last down year was 2018 one could argue that maybe we re due for a down year i said on motley fool money i wouldn t be surprised if we did have a down year we ve got a lot of things coming into play here this year in regard to inflation and interest rates and getting off of the stimulus from the last couple of years maybe that presents some headwinds we ll have to wait and see of course but yeah your point i think is spot on their one year in the frame of how we invest just really i don t want to say it doesn t matter but honestly it doesn t matter chris hill let s get to a few trends that investors might want to keep their eyes on this year and we ll start with something that is a concept we ve talked about for years on this show the idea of the last mile with more and more companies delivering this is something that amazon has invested in over the past decade now some people are starting to wonder about a business like shopify which has steadily grown over the last few years shopify hasn t really gotten into that last mile of delivering stuff to people s homes but i m curious how you re thinking about the last mile in the year ahead as a shareholder of shopify if you would be applauding shopify really investing in that last mile jason moser well i do think that shopify is going to continue investing in that last mile they re just doing it very slowly they acquired a little while back six river systems that s something to help in their fulfillment aspirations they re targeting investing over one billion dollars over the next several years but the bottom line is they are taking it very slow this is a conscious decision on their part they wanted to be done right they want it to be done in accordance with what their merchant customers actually need i absolutely appreciate that they re doing it i think it makes a lot of sense for them but it s also interesting to see how different businesses are approaching this problem in different ways you look at etsy which is taking a little bit of a different tag there they have essentially appeared a peer fulfillment design they basically put the onus on the merchant to get the shipping done that s why you don t see these today guarantees often when it comes to etsy because etsy doesn t really control that they want to let their best merchants rise to the top there you look at a company like wayfair wayfair continues to invest big money in its fulfillment infrastructure there the castlegate warehouses they obviously getting furniture from point a to point b is a difficult value proposition they ve needed to invest in that fulfillment infrastructure to be able to whittle down that time and distance then another company we ve talked about recently to lowe s lowe s is building out this market delivery model which essentially just the big and bulky products will flow directly from the supply chain to the customers homes without ever flowing through the store you see different companies attacking this from different angles but generally speaking i think it s going to be something that consumers will only care more and more about i think e commerce and shipments fulfillment that s only going to become more and more important for businesses as time goes on chris hill over the past 12 months the phrase global supply chain has been ordered more times than anyone can possibly count it s something that s going to continue to be a challenge at least in the first half of 2022 semiconductors we re really at the center of that how are you thinking about semiconductors this year and what should investors expect jason moser i look at semiconductors as increasingly more and more attractive opportunity i think a lot of that really just boils down to the evolution of technology the rollout of 5g the subsequent gs to come maybe it doesn t end with 5g we re going to see six and seven and so on as time goes on that s cyclicality window i think for semiconductors is really shrinking as everything becomes more and more connected playing into the internet of things idea things like artificial intelligence machine learning everything is just relying more and more on technology i think we re going to see that cyclicality window continue to shrink and we re going to see i think a lot of businesses the biggest and the best really rise to the top in regard to the supply chain crunch immediate it s something that certainly is going to be at the forefront of the conversation for the first half of this year i wouldn t be surprised to see it bleed into the back half of the year but we see companies talking about the biggest and the best being marvell for example on their most recent earnings call toward supply was used 35 times that amd it was used 30 times remember amd is bringing xilinx into the fold this year that closing has been delayed slightly due to chinese regulators actually giving the deal a little bit of a closer look but it is still scheduled to close i think we re going to see some more consolidation in the space it s definitely something these chipmakers are talking a lot about i think gives investors a lot of opportunity in this space look for the biggest and the best in the space they re going to be able to cope with this better than others as time goes on it looks like an increasingly attractive space because of the connected nature of everything chris hill real quick before we wrap up let s talk about the metaverse for all the jokes that were made about facebook changing its name to meta platforms when you get past the humor and you look at what they are attempting and the opportunity not just for meta platforms but for so many different businesses we can talk about a couple of them how are you thinking about investing opportunities in the metaverse jason moser i think that for now i think the metaverse really it s going to boil down to really big tech and their aspirations in the near term this is really still a fairly new concept but we re going to talk more and more about it as time goes on it s already you think in many ways but it will continue to morph and develop i think the bigger challenge right now is perhaps the physical interface getting something that can take us into this metaverse without just being bulky and uncomfortable some places we could stay for long periods of time for those who want to do that that i think it s going to still take a little while we get a lot of companies out there really working toward that goal from qualcomm to apple and everywhere in between but then i think also you see these just so many other businesses out there they are going to be part of creating this metaverse i think unity software gm of unity creators he s name is mark best the metaverse is going to be built by millions of content creators unity software is on a mission to give them the tools to be able to build their visions bring those visions to life i think that they re going to be a lot of opportunities it s not going to be meta wins the metaverse or alphabet wins the metaverse i think the 3d internet really sums it up well i think from that perspective we re going to see a lot of winners but it s a space that s going to take some time to develop i think chris hill i m glad you mentioned alphabet because it s hard to imagine a business that big with pockets that deep isn t going to be doubling in this space along with another business like apple jason moser indeed chris hill jason moser thanks a lot for being here jason moser thank you chris hill that s all for today but coming up tomorrow dylan lewis will be here with a preview of some of the most highly anticipated ipos of 2022 including one business he calls the most fantastic private company you ve never heard of you won t want to miss it as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against don t buy yourself stocks based solely on what you hear i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you tomorrow
u s a ammoland com ammoland news and i recently reported that the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf went to raided big daddy unlimited bdu and rare breed triggers and seized their stock of forced reset triggers that report was not correct the atf never went to rare breed manufaturing the atf did go to big daddy unlimited and seized their wide open trigger inventory as confirmed by bdu employees to ammoland news and independently to youtuber gun gadgets but they did not go to rare breed as was initially reported the visit by atf to big daddy came just as rare triggers won a preliminary injunction against wide open enterprises for patent infringement stopping the big daddy enterprise s subsidiary from selling its popular forced reset triggers known as the wide open trigger rare breed argued to the courts that big daddy enterprises infringed on the patent of its frt 15 trigger the preliminary injunction said that only rare breed could produce a forced reset trigger because they were the only other company to make one the judge was mistaken on that fact there are other companies that produce forced reset triggers background in july of last year 2021 the atf served rare breed triggers with a cease and desist order ordering the company to stop selling its popular frt 15 trigger the company refused to comply with the atf s demands and filed a lawsuit in federal court against the atf the state tried to block rare breed trigger s evidence by arguing that the administrative record was closed because of the lawsuit the atf did re open the record twice to add videos and other things after the suit was filed that case was dismissed after rare breed trigger and the government missed a filing deadline a judge also denied rare breed trigger s initial preliminary injunction against the atf and the department of justice in that initial order atf claimed that force reset triggers are machine guns the atf used its own discretion to determine that the frt 15 is a machine gun a forced reset trigger works by the bolt pushing the trigger forward thus resetting the trigger this arbitrary ruling by atf is very similar to how the atf determined that bump stocks were machine guns force reset trigger popped up on the radar when an atf employee working in the washington dc office noticed a youtube video showing a rifle with rare breed s frt 15 installed firing that employee contacted the atf s technical branch to see if rare breed had obtained an opinion letter from the atf rare breed based its opinion on the legality of the trigger based on outside experts opinions and not an internal determination by the atf s firearms and ammunition technology division s fatd fatd informed the atf employee that they had not examined the trigger but it most likely would be considered a machine gun months went by without further action but the atf employee would not be undeterred he would reach out to the local atf field office in florida to push for an examination of the frt 15 trigger the atf s fatd examination was further delayed by the public demand for the frt 15 trigger atf could not get their hands on one to test the bureau was forced to use gun broker to purchase two triggers to test sources report that atf tested the trigger by using a zip tie to secure the trigger back the trigger continued to fire some in the gun community point out that plastic is flexible so it was actually pulling the trigger multiple times important to note current owners of forced reset triggers are not violating the law at this time the atf has not released any letters to the public about the legal status of owning a forced reset trigger although there is insider speculation those letters may be forthcoming on the same day as i reported on the site visits by atf we also received another document from alternate sources within the atf marked law enforcement sensitive dated january 13 2022 embedded below that document is what the atf will send out to all police departments in the country the atf again calls all force reset triggers machine gun conversion devices in that document the document further states that forced reset triggers are machine guns under federal law the atf once more says that the shooter does not need to release the trigger to fire another round after the first round is fired the bureau says the firearm will automatically cycle the atf document reads frts are generally marketed as replacement triggers for ar type or other semiautomatic firearms unlike traditional triggers and binary triggers sometimes also referred to as frts the subject frts do not require shooters to pull and then subsequently release the trigger to fire a second projectile instead these frts utilize the automatic firing cycle inherent in the trigger design to eliminate the need for the shooter to release the trigger before a second round may be fired the document gives two examples with photos of the triggers that the atf is telling law enforcement are machine guns the first trigger image is the rare breed frt 15 trigger the second example trigger is the competing wide open trigger sold by big daddy unlimited note the document is dated the exact date that the atf showed up to big daddy unlimited in ammoland news correspondence with rare breed owner kevin maxwell he stated the company sent a letter to the atf to add its evidence to the administrative record on november 2 2021 since the lawsuit was dismissed the atf responded on november 15 2021 that it received rare breed s request rare breed triggers requested an update on december 12 2021 the atf did not respond maxwell believes the newly revealed document apparently being sent to law enforcement will be the only response that rare breed triggers will receive the company is preparing to file another lawsuit against the atf a new lawsuit against the atf is being prepared and will be filed shortly rbt is not backing down maxwell told ammoland news we feel the atf is overreaching its legal authority by its intentional misclassification of the frt 15 ammoland news would like to repeat that mistakes were made in the initial reporting and rare breed had no visits by atf we will provide additional updates as the story develops u les tax forced reset triggers frts atf document jan 13 2022 about john crump john is an nra instructor and a constitutional

9 6 billion said a recent report from pitchbook the national venture capital association that was up 55 percent from 2020 the biggest beneficiary was clickup a company that makes productivity software which raised 400 million while workers in other industries might not care as much about big tech gains gin said it does benefit the overall economy those tech workers have money and they are going to go out and spend it he said they will spend in retail in restaurants or buy homes that will help people in other industries the only other industry to show significant growth in december was retail adding 2 500 jobs however many of those were seasonal for the holiday season on an annual basis the tourism industry has seen the biggest recovery with 37 600 jobs work in the leisure and hospitality

two years ago before the pandemic hit the u s in december 2019 the unemployment rate was 2 8 percent and the labor force was larger total unemployment remains 83 300 jobs below december 2019 levels industry watchers say labor force participation across the u s continues to be down because of changing priorities during the pandemic and wage gains motivating workers to try new industries the result has meant a significant number of job openings especially in low skill work whether you re just getting a start in the world of work or aspiring to a high paying career there are significant opportunities across the labor market said daniel enemark senior economist at the san diego workforce partnership california s recovery has been slower than other parts of the nation which analysts often attributed to stronger lockdown measures to slow the spread of covid 19 many states have fully recovered the jobs they lost during the pandemic said taner osman research manager at beacon

the hollywood freeway fernando maya waited with several backpacks stuffed with clothes electronics and food once a constant roar of traffic below his makeshift home the freeway stood empty in the waning days of spring 2020 as the first wave of coronavirus tore through california here occasional cars whipped up gusts of wind their whistles morphing into the voices of people he had let down a car pulled up alongside a chain link fence that separated a service road from maya s camp he hadn t taken down his tent raised from the dirt by a wood pallet to let rats pass he was leaving and he didn t know how long he d be gone maya slid into the back seat his mind spinning with doubts at 6 feet 1 the 56 year old brimmed with an energy that could swing from charming to intimidating when agitated he slung his words faster then harder i don t want to go anywhere where there s a curfew maya said to the driver jorge soria his case worker i don t need the headache of having to follow directions you re getting a good place but it s not like a free for all soria recalls saying as he pulled the car forward fernando maya under the overpass where he lived in a tent off of the 101 freeway in los angeles on nov 17 2021 miguel gutierrez jr calmatters california s pandemic response marked the start of maya s journey indoors through project roomkey the statewide effort to take vulnerable and elderly people off the street he was given the keys to a hotel room of his own that june later maya would credit the program and gov gavin newsom with having ended his homelessness text messages from fernando maya over the course of a five month stay at a hip west hollywood hotel soria helped maya renew his application for a federal housing program for veterans in an apartment complex with 90 affordable units set aside for people experiencing homelessness by september his application was approved the state would claim maya as a successful transition into permanent housing on paper at least so called permanent supportive housing programs like maya s which pair ongoing rental assistance with supportive services such as case management substance use programs and mental health treatment represent the gold standard for housing chronically homeless people such as maya for every one open unit in los angeles now about seven people are waiting having slept in the alleyways underpasses and sidewalks of los angeles throughout much of his adult life maya longed for a place to call home a chameleon by nature maya assumed he would transition quickly just as he had adapted to the navy prison and living in a tent he d have his own keys his own coffee maker safety ease he didn t think the hardest part was yet to come for years openings in permanent supportive housing have not kept up with the growing number of californians facing chronic homelessness in the three years before the pandemic the number of permanent supportive housing slots in california grew by about 10 in contrast the state counted a 36 uptick in chronically homeless people california is trying to increase capacity last year state lawmakers approved a 12 billion two year plan to tackle homelessness according to the newsom administration these investments would convert 35 000 hotel and motel rooms into permanent supportive housing over five years growing california s stock by over 50 this month he proposed another 1 5 billion to place people with complex behavioral health issues in tiny homes and other temporary housing while they wait for slots to open but demand outstrips supply while conservative estimates put the total number of chronically homeless californians at around 49 000 it s been growing each year the vast majority live outside and about half live in los angeles county if the state executes its plan tens of thousands of people like maya sick and scarred from years of living on california s streets will finally come inside all at once whether they get the support they need to stay housed will determine the future of california s homelessness crisis on the morning of oct 28 2020 maya packed his life into plastic bags and duffels once again leaving the upscale hotel behind he loaded his belongings into soria s car and the two men drove east sandwiched between the hollywood freeway and a busy boulevard lined with auto shops the brand new apartment complex towered six stories over a commercial zone where little else was as modern or sleek as the building s white red gray and glass exterior maya had grown up just blocks away he carted his belongings past a debris filled encampment of tents that snaked around the building then through the glass front door and into a pristine courtyard of cement and manicured lawns in preparation for his move fernando maya rolls his electric bike down a hallway of the hotel where he lived for five months as a project roomkey tenant on oct 28 2020 tash kimmell for calmatters fernando maya holds the keys to his new apartment shortly after moving in tash kimmell for calmatters maya waited jittery with coffee and anticipation in a room strung with halloween decorations where residents watched a communal television minutes after signing his lease he surveyed his new studio shaped like an l the unit opened into a galley kitchen that widened into a bedroom already equipped with a bed and dresser maya bid soria goodbye thanking him profusely for his help having secured housing for his client soria would soon clear maya from his caseload at the people concern a nonprofit provider of housing and mental health services in los angeles several days later sitting at his new kitchen table decorated with a flowerpot of pens maya contemplated his goals decades of stimulant use had left his face gaunt his smile revealed rotting and missing teeth but while at the hotel maya had gained 10 pounds that filled out his pockmarked cheeks a red lanyard hung around his neck weighted by his new apartment keys he felt optimistic he said he wanted a real job before the market locked him out for good his housing voucher subsidized his rent so it only ate through 52 of his 221 monthly cash assistance he still wanted to prove to the world and to himself that he had something to contribute he wanted to visit his mother now in her early 80s whose life waned as she battled an alphabet soup of immunocompromising illnesses they d only spoken on the phone twice in the past five years or so both times at the start of the pandemic now she lived an 8 minute bike ride away but something told maya he wasn t ready he wanted to show her a version of himself that she would finally be proud of drug free and employed in 2016 california created a homeless coordinating council and adopted a model known as housing first for all state homelessness programs the model pioneered by a psychologist in new york in the 1990s and soon embraced by the federal government is straightforward end a person s homelessness by getting them into a permanent home as quickly as possible regardless of whether they use drugs or alcohol or participate in treatment offer them hands on counseling once they re inside let them choose where they live and which services they receive in contrast with how service providers had operated for decades this approach viewed housing as a tool rather than a reward for recovery extensive research shows that permanent supportive housing that follows this approach works better especially for chronically homeless people they stay housed at higher rates reducing the taxpayer costs they would otherwise rack up in shelters jails ambulances and emergency rooms critics including the previous homelessness czar under former president donald trump say that the model hasn t proved its worth as homelessness skyrockets several conservative think tank voices point out that housing first has a mixed record when it comes to addressing serious mental health issues substance use or employment others argue that it writes a blank check for rent without moving people toward the goal of self sustainability republican state lawmakers called housing first the most expensive and difficult policy this month when they implored newsom to declare a special legislative session on homelessness proponents insist that their aim is more realistic and less paternalistic to permanently end a person s homelessness and help that person achieve individual goals but the plan only works if it s executed well a team of university of southern california researchers found that the reality often falls short in a pre pandemic study of 26 housing first programs in los angeles residents tended to report social isolation and unchanged substance use after their first year though their mental health significantly improved most said they received little assistance from the in house support team contributing to tenants isolation difficulty navigating a complex health and social services system and inability to develop additional life skills the housing supervisors described offering comprehensive case management primary and mental healthcare and substance use treatment but the researchers interviews with frontline staff revealed gaps case workers reported that a patchwork of outside agencies providing services were difficult to communicate with caseloads averaged 36 residents per staff member far higher than the recommended caseload of 12 to 15 and staff struggled to focus on anything more than keeping people housed understaffing turnover and burnout plague homeless services throughout the state as california faces a growing shortage of providers including psychiatrists psychologists therapists clinical counselors and social workers covid 19 has only exacerbated staffing shortages so people fall through the cracks according to research by the california policy lab at least one in five people placed in permanent supportive housing in los angeles between 2010 and 2019 returned to homelessness maya recalls that when he was about 7 his father taught him how to bike by pushing him down a narrow alleyway behind their duplex on a three speed without trainer wheels in the last few years maya rediscovered bicycles as a way to cope with his frustrations memorizing the streets of los angeles when major events occurred mass grief after the death of kobe bryant protests after a police officer killed george floyd he watched history unfold from his bike during the early months of the pandemic he swerved across empty boulevards and zipped

was old enough to let go if his father joseph showed his son what responsibility looked like leticia taught him resourcefulness she attended night school when maya was in high school she filled steno pads with new words in english or bits of information she learned from clients and colleagues maya s parents divorced when he and his younger brother paul were teenagers as the brothers remember it leticia was fed up with joseph beating up maya and cheating on her he enlisted in the navy when he was 18 at his parents urging after dropping out of a boys catholic high school trained as a radar operator maya sailed overseas twice stopping in bahrain japan malaysia the philippines singapore and hawaii he first tried crack cocaine while in the navy he still remembers how the drug felt a short lived rush of intense euphoria then a gnawing need for more in his fifth year of service maya failed a drug test for cocaine and then another for marijuana after his second unauthorized absence he was discharged in 1986 a navy medical evaluation classified him as an occasional user not drug dependent maya returned home crack had seeped through his neighborhood soon he was selling or stealing to buy

angeles on june 21 2021 pablo unzueta for calmatters at 25 his parents shipped him to a recovery program after a few weeks maya abandoned it with nowhere to go it was a hot dry year during his first year of homelessness maya remembers wearing shorts every day the next two decades he recounts with a series of numbers a total of 8 years spent in nine state prisons between 1990 and 2011 he was charged with two second degree burglaries one sale of a controlled substance and two petty thefts according to california department of corrections and rehabilitation records once out he would get into sober living and work parole programs but before long he d get the itch for crack he often landed back in prison for violating parole for stretches he stayed with family rented or paid month to month in a downtown hotel but he usually procrastinated on applying for jobs he acknowledges and no one wanted to offer him one anyway so he returned to the streets stealing to get by paul who also used crack and heroin but quit 23 years ago said that addiction always gripped his older brother with tighter claws and it ruptured their relationship when maya stole from paul a family heirloom a ring from ecuador the drug was a chasm maya could never fill when he wasn t high his body ached at the depths of addiction crack could consume 18 hours of each day finding buying using however maya s last three appearances in los angeles court records in 2017 2018 and 2019 show something new possession of methamphetamine someone suggested he try smoking crystal meth to help him beat crack it worked days after maya left on his bike to withdraw his rent his memory resumed to the unmistakable chemical smell of a hospital he was in a sixth floor intensive care unit an ambulance had delivered maya to a county hospital with only a red multitool in his pocket no bike no wallet no phone nurses shared few details besides that he d arrived with a traumatic head injury requiring five staples four ct scans and anti seizure medication ambulance records requested by calmatters reveal that the 911 caller referred to the accident as a hit and run maya believes he left the hospital about a week later with a walker and took a bus home after the hospitalization maya s days changed he rarely left his apartment biked less his dizzy spells continued sometimes so extreme that he could hardly stand up from bed without losing balance he smoked crystal meth most days he now rarely felt a high just freedom from the cravings he stayed up until dawn watching late night news and cop shows or playing solitaire on his phone he often thought of his goals when he first moved in but couldn t muster the will to apply for a job or to walk to his mom s house paranoia dogged him he d emerged from the hospital with no bruises or scrapes other than a gleaming scar about an inch long and shaped like a whale s tail on the back of his head he suspected someone attacked him from behind and might do it again over the summer maya asked his primary care doctor for help quitting crystal meth a highly addictive stimulant methamphetamine floods the brain with dopamine a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward heavy use decays the body and brain sometimes leading to delusions and paranoia that mimic psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia unlike other drugs like opioids there are no good replacement medications that can help a user wean off maya s doctor prescribed daily anti depressants and a monthly injection of a drug used to treat opioid dependence a combination found to slightly reduce cravings for some meth users meanwhile his mental health provider continued to prescribe him zoloft a drug often used to treat depression and anxiety and zyprexa an antipsychotic medication often used for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder but maya distrusted the meds he didn t want to feel sluggish or numb as summer turned to fall maya increasingly perceived threats in the apartment complex he fixated on the idea that neighbors perhaps people living in the encampment outside or other residents or security guards hacked into his internet and monitored his behavior sometimes he heard their voices jeering as if they knew what he had just typed on his phone before his father was diagnosed with parkinson s disease maya thought joseph was going crazy in the years before he died in the early 2000s joseph heard voices saw people who weren t there imagined threats everywhere now maya empathized he said he reported the issues several times to his housing case manager and the property manager and even called the cops it s hard to get a clear picture of what was really happening people assisting the homeless or path a major statewide nonprofit that runs maya s permanent supportive housing citing privacy declined to make his housing case manager or anyone else available to discuss maya security concerns are common in the complex said chester reyes the in house case manager for veterans reyes who works with up to 45 veterans at two different housing complexes said many say they feel unsafe due to the encampment outside crime and drug use near the building and a lack of staffing after hours and on weekends it s also difficult to pin down how various teams in maya s building coordinate support for him path owns the complex contracts with an on site security team and runs the supportive services partnering with a nonprofit medical clinic a nonprofit mental health provider and county department of mental health substance abuse services an affordable housing management company maintains the building and collects rent meanwhile the u s department of veterans affairs pays for maya s rental subsidy and his case manager reyes together these providers are supposed to help maya recover from homelessness set goals develop skills and build community according to path the team meets on a weekly basis to discuss individualized plans for residents however maya says he received no assistance with job applications or other goals he doesn t blame the in house staff he d mostly avoided them especially after he didn t see them act on his safety concerns he d never been one to stick to treatments or open up to counselors at least now he observes that doesn t get him kicked out of housing by maya s account his mental health provider did not coordinate with his primary care provider though he thought they should reyes was on leave for most of the year with a rotating cast of veterans social workers from other buildings filling in maya missed soria his previous case manager who helped him get off the streets as maya s distress grew his studio felt more cramped clutter covered his kitchen counters and stove shopping carts held bike parts and clothes socks and towels hung on a rope strung across his kitchen he kept his blinds drawn he often felt trapped in his room worried that if he left he d be attacked he d rigged a security system at his door to ward off intruders a red shoelace tied around the inside door handle would impede lock pickers a three sided ruler duct taped under the door blocked anything from sliding under when inside he often pulled out his refrigerator to block the entrance he kept a knife tucked in his back pocket fernando maya in his permanent supportive housing unit in los angeles on nov 16 2021 miguel gutierrez jr calmatters the inside of fernando maya s studio on nov 16 2021 miguel gutierrez jr calmatters on his one year anniversary in the apartment maya mulled over the idea of returning to the streets if he couldn t move soon he still had a new tent that soria once gifted him he said he still slept on the sleeping bag he used at the underpass maya s experience echoes what the usc researchers found a disconnect between the lofty goals of program supervisors and the realities that formerly homeless residents and frontline staff face reyes said his main goal for his clients is to help them enroll in any mental or health care they need and keep up with rent but researchers and county administrators and state officials are more ambitious about improving maya s wellbeing dr margot kushel a ucsf professor who studies health and homelessness said maya s team should help him relocate to a place where he feels safer in a study of 169 permanent supportive housing residents in santa clara county in which nearly all remained housed kushel and other researchers found that 70 needed to move at least once the medical director for the substance use branch of the county department of public health dr brian hurley said that maya should have a team of specialists who coordinate his treatment plan and access to contingency management therapy a well evidenced treatment for meth use that incentivizes sobriety with small rewards like cash or prizes dr jonathan sherin a neuroscientist who directs the los angeles mental health department said he wished he could pair maya with a well trained occupational therapist who could meet with him frequently to work through questions like what do you care about what do you want to do what are your goals what s your vision of a future that s bright after a year in permanent supportive housing maya s own goal for himself was simple and urgent move out maya could transfer his housing subsidy to a different kind of permanent supportive housing known as scattered site where he would rent a market rate apartment but would continue to receive veterans case management and other services but his caseworker reyes described it s a long bureaucratic process and it will be on maya to find the rare landlord willing to accept his voucher a challenge in los angeles hot housing market in early november desperation pushed maya to stop smoking meth cold turkey and apply for a job at an amazon warehouse his monthly aid had covered life outdoors but life inside required new expenses rent cleaning supplies and food for which he no longer relied on the salvation army mostly he wanted to get away from the anxiety he felt in his building after eight harrowing days endured mostly alone in his apartment as the voices teased and harassed him maya left the apartment on a sunny morning arriving two hours early to a nondescript office building inside a man behind a glass partition click clacked on a keyboard as maya answered his questions within 15 minutes the man assigned maya his first shift the following friday from 10 p m to 3 a m the man directed maya to one of the drug test stations across the room he held a swab to the inside of his cheek for several minutes before sticking it in a plastic vial you re good to go he recalls an attendant saying maya stepped into the warm autumn sunlight relieved and proud fernando maya outside of the hotel where he lived for five months through project roomkey nov 17 2021 miguel gutierrez jr calmatters the text arrived several days later hi this is amazon with a message about your recent job application we need you to schedule another appointment due to an error with your drug test results energy drained from maya s body in the weeks that followed maya would schedule another amazon drug test only to miss it he would talk himself out of calling his mother again an employee badge would continue to elude him he would eye the tent he stored in his closet maya doesn t remember whether he relapsed before or after he received amazon s text as soon as the smoke hit his lungs he felt a rush of relief the state too has fallen short on many plans a 2020 audit called california s efforts to address homelessness disjointed with at least nine state agencies operating 41 different programs that fund homeless services the nonpartisan legislative analyst s office criticized newsom s homelessness spending plan in both 2020 and 2021 for lacking a clear strategy lawmakers are pushing change from the top they reformed the state s homeless council last year naming the secretaries of california s health and housing agencies as leaders in an effort to improve coordination the state built a data system to track whom counties are serving and how newsom s budget plan last year included a 2 billion boost for local governments to provide homeless assistance as they see fit but only if they make progress toward concrete goals at the same time the state is overhauling its low income health insurance program to provide high needs patients especially those who are homeless with care coordinators who make sure they get all the rehabilitative services they need it s unclear whether these efforts to bake in accountability and coordination will trickle down into the apartment complexes clinics shelters and encampments where social workers doctors therapists and addiction counselors try to help people heal from chronic homelessness one of newsom s point people on these initiatives recognizes the difficulties ahead dr mark ghaly the state health and human services secretary will now co chair the california interagency council on homelessness as california pours billions of taxpayer dollars into tens of thousands of units ghaly said supportive services will have to catch up and be really strong fast for us to see the dividends on new year s day chilly and clear after heavy rains maya biked past his old home under the freeway underpass he noted no new tents its emptiness almost inviting but he didn t plan to return over the holiday the voices he heard in his apartment quieted he attributed it to the clearing of a government sanctioned

downfall the case against boeing is a story about how a revered company compromised its reputation in five short months except however that rory kennedy s documentary argues that this process actually began years earlier when boeing once the standard bearer for airline safety efficiency reliability and performance purchased mcdonnell douglas in 1997 that merger initiated boeing s fundamental transformation into a manufacturer that cared less about quality control than its stock price the ramifications of that makeover were plain to see in october 2018 and march 2019 when two boeing 737 max aircrafts fell from the sky killing more than 300 people all because of malfeasance deliberately perpetrated by boeing itself advertisement downfall the case against boeing is rightly described by the wall street journal s andy pasztor as a horrible horrible story and boeing s culpability is so obvious and inexcusable that at the eventual senate hearings over the two crashes even ted cruz was incensed over its egregiousness premiering on jan 21 at the sundance film festival before making its netflix debut on feb 18 the film is a study of corporate greed and the permanent damage it can beget especially when the culprit in question is a company that provides what amounts to a public utility featuring interviews with journalists pilots analysts experts including capt chesley sully sullenberger and oregon congressman peter a defazio who eventually spearheaded the transportation infrastructure committee s inquiry into boeing s conduct it serves as a cautionary tale about unchecked avarice and the need as pasztor says to always remain skeptical about whom you trust kennedy s documentary begins on oct 29 2018 in jakarta indonesia when lion air flight 610 unexpectedly went down killing all 189 passengers and crew members aboard garima sethi the wife of the plane s pilot captain bhavye suneja recalls receiving the fateful news about the crash as well as enduring the immediate aftermath of the tragedy when boeing mounted a considerable pr campaign to pin the blame on her husband two weeks later boeing changed its tune admitting that the underlying cause of the calamity was an erroneous mcas activation the problem was no one had ever heard of mcas which stands for maneuver characteristics augmentation system and could only find mention of it in the abbreviation section of the 737 max s manual as sethi and others soon learned mcas was software linked to one of the exterior angle of attack sensors located on the front side of the plane because of its larger than usual fuel efficient engines the 737 max had a tendency to fly too vertically at high speeds creating the potential for the engine to stall when its trajectory became overly severe mcas automatically pushed the nose of the plane down so the craft could level out in the case of lion air flight 610 a faulty angle of attack sensor had incorrectly triggered mcas causing nosedive ish behavior that the pilots couldn t rectify in time to avert disaster then again as later investigations revealed they never had a chance since boeing hadn t informed its pilots that mcas existed much less trained them to handle it thus when mcas initiated during lion air flight 610 s early going suneja had no clue what was going on he was simply confronted by a barrage of inexplicable and frenzied warnings and readouts nor any idea how to stop it advertisement even in the aftermath of that worst case scenario the faa bought boeing s story that they d have a swift software fix for mcas thereby negating any need to ground the planes nineteen short weeks later on march 10 2019 that proved to be a grave mistake as ethiopian airlines flight 302 crashed in a similar manner killing 157 worse this catastrophe had happened even though the pilots following boeing s updated advice had reacted to the mcas activation by turning the system off it was now obvious that something was dreadfully wrong and though the faa still refused to pull the 737 max fleet out of the sky president trump unilaterally did so thereby making it the only plane to ever be grounded by a commander in chief boeing retrofitted 45 year old 737 frames with new heavier fuel efficient engines that in turn necessitated the mcas then it lied about the significance and power of the mcas to the faa all in order to avoid additional costly pilot training advertisement boeing s failure to properly respond to the mcas threat is infuriating but downfall the case against boeing also generates outrage from its snapshot of the company s transition from an engineer driven outfit that made its name and its fortune through a commitment to teamwork collaboration and safety to an enterprise consumed with maximizing revenue kennedy s documentary contends it was that directive which led to the lion air and ethiopian airlines tragedies in an effort to retake the industry lead over their european rival airbus boeing retrofitted 45 year old 737 frames with new heavier fuel efficient engines that in turn necessitated the mcas then it lied about the significance and power of the mcas to the faa all in order to avoid additional costly pilot training the results of that deception were broadcast around the globe in 2018 and 2019 and downfall the case against boeing complements those terrible news reports with interviews with some of the victims loved ones who express shock and fury at boeing s callous disregard for the employees and passengers they were supposed to protect director kennedy the youngest child of the late robert f kennedy never loses sight of those who lost their lives in these two incidents and she further honors their memory by thoroughly and lucidly censuring boeing for its numerous calculated unforgivable decisions utilizing flight simulator recreations diagrams and graphics to lay out the heinous and heartbreaking particulars of this tale advertisement when defazio s committee finally received boeing documentation it discovered that the company had known all along that mcas was a problem and moreover that properly dealing with it required greater certification and training for pilots in other words they ignored a safety critical flaw then hid it from faa regulators and finally after the crashes tried to besmirch the pilots whom they d kept in the dark from the get go making matters worse they had done so with the full understanding that once the mcas system went haywire pilots would only have a measly 10 seconds to rectify their situation before death became guaranteed downfall the case against boeing is so damning that it certainly won t help the company s share price it may however motivate air travelers on their next trip to seek out an airbus

why some analysts are still bullish on shopify despite 48 plunge tech darling shopify inc has become such a heavyweight on the toronto stock exchange that when it moves the broader market feels it since its nov 19 peak though shopify s stock price has been almost cut in half leaving some shareholders reeling and others likely wondering whether the drop presents a good entry point i think it s really caught up along with all the other higher multiple growth oriented stocks mostly technology stocks and the impact of rising rates on the company s valuation said martin toner director of institutional research growth and innovation at atb capital markets in an interview higher multiple stocks tend to be more volatile and i think if you looked at amazon s stock over the last 10 years i bet you it s drawn down by roughly 20 per cent a significant number of times and it s just because the multiple is so high he said they make just as much sense at their highs as they do when there s some volatility and they draw down to a certain extent you just have to alter your return expectations as of friday shopify s price to earnings ratio or the amount of money shareholders would need to invest to receive one dollar of the company s earnings clocked in at a whopping 226 according to bloomberg data that far outpaces the toronto stock exchange s average price to earnings ratio of 19 shopify s growth was already on a tear in recent years but that exploded during the covid 19 pandemic when lockdowns forced many mom and pop retailers to begin selling their products online however as vaccinations became more widespread and in person shopping returned some investors and analysts have been questioning whether the company s growth can continue at that pace on friday shopify shares fell deeper into negative territory after insider reported it ended a contract with multiple warehouse and fulfilment partners in a possible signal it could look to bring more of its inventory management and logistics services in house mark mahaney senior managing director and head of internet research at evercore isi in the united states agreed in that interest rate risk has been one of the biggest headwinds for tech stocks recently including shopify there are two trends that have really mattered this year for tech investors one is the timing of the covid recovery and aggressively rising interest rates he said that has a material impact on high multiple stocks a buying opportunity mahaney upgraded his rating on shopify to a buy in december when the stock was down around 20 per cent from its peak before markets began pricing in much more aggressive rate hikes from the u s federal reserve his 12 month price target on the company s u s listing is currently us 2 228 on friday the shares closed at us 882 12 mahaney doesn t think high growth stocks will outperform until there is clarity on when covid 19 shifts from a pandemic into a more manageable endemic phase but added that shopify is worth looking at for investors if they have a longer time horizon he acknowledged the stock could fall further but said ultimately he doesn t see any major fundamental issues and thinks the company is a good play on the rising direct to consumer retail trend the longer your investment horizon the more you should be willing to wade in here and buy pieces of shopify would i fully build out a shopify position today absolutely not but if i didn t own any shopify this is when i d look to start building my position he said don t expect to make money in the next three months but you could be making really good returns in the next three years meanwhile atb s toner holds an even more optimistic view about shopify which stems from what he refers to as the tech giant s layers of growth he has a buy rating and a price target of 2 500 for the canadian listing as shopify builds out its ecosystem for merchants and adds features such as logistics and shipping services each of those will add to the bottom line said toner he added that shopify s platform travels well internationally allowing for continued expansion in global markets you see in technology often there s a winner takes most type of dynamic and the larger the leader becomes the more difficult it becomes to dislodge them so at this point shopify is in a very strong position toner said the bear case despite the praise many analysts heap onto shopify not all of them are convinced one of the most bearish analysts on the company is dan romanoff with morningstar his 12 month price target on the firm s u s shares is us 856 82 despite new tools for vendors and the ability to expand internationally romanoff said he doesn t see the company growing at its current explosive pace forever i m not willing to believe that far down the road that they re still growing at that rate he said in an interview you have to look at a 20 year and say in 20 years their revenue is still growing by 25 per cent and their operating margins are 30 per cent that s not a level they ve ever talked about it s not a level any of their peers that have come before them in the e commerce area have done so that seems unlikely to me when you start blowing this out into the longer term and start contemplating what shopify looks like in 10 20 years i think that s where the real disconnect is he said

manufacturers and retailers both pointing the finger at each other for the shortage joan driggs the vp of content and thought leadership for iri market research company explains alex livingston so what are some of the contributing factors that are causing baby formula shortages at some retail locations joan driggs i think it s a couple of things first of all it s a far different purchase than anything else that you buy in the store there are shared supply chain challenges all across the board with omicron trying to keep or keeping truckers off the roads keeping people out of stores able to stock the shelves keeping people in manufacturing plants away from work so that s shared across the entire supply chain but what s unique to baby formula is that it s such an emotional purchase you know this is not buying breakfast cereal for the family where if your preferred brand or your preferred size isn t available you can find other options that will tie you over this is something that you really these caregivers these parents and others really depend on for the baby s nourishment and it s not an inexpensive purchase alex livingston you know and that is so true i didn t even think about that last part that you mentioned but your data showed that americans spent 4 3 billion in 2020 and 4 5 from that s up 4 5 so how has the pandemic in particular played a role in the need for formula joan driggs i think that it s not necessarily the pandemic that s putting the need for formula the need for formula is always going to be there it makes me laugh like when we talked about the pandemic at the outside people went off and bought bottled water and bottled water wasn t an issue this is strictly just to keep people you know babies nourished and i think what happens and why there is maybe more purchase is because of the tighter supply if you re someone shopping for baby formula and you see that there are only a couple of cans of your 20 or 30 ounce baby formula that you really prefer you re probably going to buy them if you can afford to because you re afraid that the next time you go to the store it won t be there and that s exacerbating the problem alex livingston yeah so what do you think is the solution then to this issue i think a lot of it is it s out there like in some way shape or form it s probably out there joan driggs every manufacturer wants to ensure that their customers are happy every retailer wants to ensure that their customers are happy so i think it really will be dependent on manufacturers making sure that they re getting their most preferred brands out there and then consumers understanding if the size that they prefer or the format that they prefer isn t available like one of the really growing categories same formula but in ready to drink has been hit just as hard or even a little harder because it s so convenient alex livingston so if you have to mix your own that s a solution interesting okay so we have about 30 seconds left so really quickly what does your data predict about the demand for baby formula over the next year joan driggs i think again across the board things are going to level off as manufacturers get their full production up to speed as our supply chain keeps rolling and as retailers are able to stock those shelves but for now people just have to be a little bit more patient shop around as best they can and of course maybe try not to stockpile which would help the whole thing level off alex livingston at newsy first reported this story

i must be the biggest sucker in america i was taught to save my money ever since first grade when those of us with the means deposited 50 cents per month in a savings account on which we received 5 1 2 interest the interest rate never changed so i ve been a lifelong saver and haven t owed anybody any money since we paid off our house 30 years ago we have one credit card and pay it off in full every month i ve never been unemployed and i m still working at 70 my wife started as a cashier in a grocery store when she was 16 and spent 30 years in that capacity she can outwork an entire county road crew we ve never owned more than two vehicles at a time had no car payments and drove our rigs until the wheels fell off so we thought we had enough money saved in case we both require long term care in our golden years but currently we are being paid three tenths of one percent on cd s which is well below the fake inflation rate now our hard earned wealth is being devalued by the same government who encouraged us to save it compare our financial plan to that of a friend we ve known for 40 years starting from nothing he now owns 28 rental houses and several apartment buildings he d buy a house build up some equity and use that to borrow enough for a down payment on another house our friend never saved a penny and just used opm other people s money to buy california real estate he doesn t play in other fields about which he knows nothing so he never sent his money to the big casino on wall street despite being 80 he s still doing it and with today s fed rate at effectively zero he s buying more real estate than ever which he ll pass down to his son although he s a paper gazillionaire his liquid assets consist of two gold teeth he told me that a couple years ago a thief broke into his house and started searching for money and he got up and started searching with him so tell me who s been the investment ignoramus have you been shopping lately i haven t been in a grocery store since covid began because you never know who s been squeezing the peaches but my wife allows me to go to the hardware store as long as i don t buy anything on a recent trip i had a terrible case of sticker shock they wanted 60 for one sheet of plywood two by fours were a dollar a foot one 3 stainless steel bolt was 3 95 and a milwaukee reciprocating saw blade was 16 thankfully i have 500 of them which i bought at an estate sale for three dollars since i buy my clothes at the hardware store i was shocked to see a carhartt sweatshirt was 54 on the way home i paid 4 99 per gallon for the lowest octane gas look around a new pickup will cost you 75 000 and a used combine can easily cost half a million i needed some extra long railroad ties so i bid 60 for six of them on an online auction they sold for 200 i d like a new dog and have my heart set on a basset hound but the nearest breeder wants 1 500 for one pup at the current rate of real inflation i m afraid the dollar store which now sells everything for 1 25 will soon be the twenty dollar bill store i inherited the first dollar grandpa made in business which he framed in a picture frame that probably cost him ten cents at woolworths today the frame is probably worth a dollar at a garage sale and the dollar is worth ten cents yet our government says there s no need to worry about inflation all that time i was saving money for the future my own government was devaluing it as fast as their overheated printing presses could print it i ve been a fool i should have been buying farm land bitcoin ammunition amazon stock rental houses lottery tickets and carhartt sweatshirts at the current rate of real inflation next year a reciprocating blade will cost a wheelbarrow full of money i happen to have a few for sale but i don t want cash gold or silver only

the character renfield from bram stoker s dracula admitted the importance of blood saying that the blood is the life this idea is not new for example maya kings attempted to obtain the good will of the gods by giving blood offerings throughout history there have existed enough tribes which practiced ritual hematophagy blood consumption as a food source and cannibalism eating other humans traditions which have given shape to the images of certain mythological entities such as the werewolf the wendigo or the vampire cannibalism implies the consumption of blood whereas necrophagy is the consumption of the flesh of the dead tech labs beyond cannibalism and blood consumption rituals necrophagy beyond cannibalism it is known that numerous rituals implied the consumption of blood but in history there have also been rituals which involved the practice of necrophagy in certain tribes when a relative died the descendants had to consume its lifeless body in its entirety this ritual could go on for days and sometimes the corpse began to putrefy despite this aspect the descendants consumed everything to take into themselves the knowledge and the power of the deceased relative such that the spiritual energies of the ancestors were not lost a strange ritual continues to be practiced in certain areas of india on a certain day of the year the ones who have deceased relatives buried in the cemetery go in the morning to the temple where they inhale a smoke resulted from the burning of a special mixture of plants and substances after the state of ecstasy is achieved the priest leads those who have come to the temple to the cemetery there the people will unearth their deceased relatives with their hands and they will bite and chew pieces of the corpses the explanation of this ritual consists in the idea that each bite will get the soul of the deceased closer to eternal peace faster and it is not only rituals that have a link with hematophagy cannibalism and necrophagy on the globe there is a multitude of legends which talk about supernatural beings which feed on human blood and flesh greek and roman mythology mention beings named lamia strixes and empusae who consumed

blood of christ which is then consumed by christian believers kadmy adobe stock blood in religious ritual there are also religions which forbid any form of blood consumption islamic law talks about the term najis which defines that which is impure in the context of religious ritual najasat being the ritual impurity which can be removed by cleansing through fasting and prayer the koran mentions in its turn impurity prohibiting in any form the consumption of blood to consume blood or food prepared with it is haram a sinful act in the judaic tradition blood is washed completely away with great care from meat before cooking it the argument which upholds this custom is encountered in the leviticus where it is mentioned that it is not allowed to consume blood because the life of the animal is in the blood with regards to the christian religion in this context a type of ritual hematophagy appears the eucharist implies the idea that the wine used actually becomes the blood of christ which is then consumed by believers the consumption of human blood is rejected as a taboo activity and related to cannibalism in the fifth book of the new testament it is stated that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what has been strangled and from sexual immorality if you keep yourselves from these you will do well as for ritual hematophagy from the context of the eucharist this is justified as being a spiritual nourishment christian mythology also includes references to the chalice used by christ at the last supper known under the name of the holy grail in this receptacle the blood of christ had been collected during the crucifixion and the legends say that all those who drink from this chalice became immortal the terrifying wendigo is a cannibal spirit that eats living hearts and more dracolumina17 cc by sa 4 0 cannibalism that transforms professor basil johnston offered a presentation of a wendigo describing it as follows the wendigo was gaunt to the point of emaciation its desiccated skin pulled tightly over its bones with its bones pushing out against its skin its complexion the ash gray of death and its eyes pushed back deep into their sockets the wendigo looked like a gaunt skeleton recently disinterred from the grave what lips it had were tattered and bloody unclean and suffering from suppuration of the flesh the wendigo gave off a strange and eerie odor of decay and decomposition of death and corruption in this way the wendigo symbolizes the idea of greed and excess especially through the fact that it can never be satisfied regardless of how much it has killed and eaten the wendigo is counted among the most terrifying beings it is a cannibal spirit which can induce the state of possession after this possession the individual takes the physical form of a monster him going to satisfy the cannibal tendencies of the entity it is believed that the ones who practice cannibalism can be possessed much easier by a wendigo and the ones who kill a human and consume his heart can become in their turn a wendigo some russian nomads had the habit of drinking the blood of the first enemy fallen in battle and mongols sometimes fed on horse blood to survive even the locals from the caribbean were adepts of cannibalism feeding on human organs and flesh today cannibalism is still encountered in the korowai population from new guinea and in melanesia not even the stories for children are exempt of references to cannibalism the most well known example being hansel and gretel even the old russian myths told about the entity known as baba yaga she made her appearance in the form of a crone who stole children to feed on their flesh the image of a vampire and the horror they create to survive stockis adobe stock the image of the vampire the vampire appears in many of the cultures of the world as a mythological entity it is a living dead human who feeds on fresh blood and who is defined as the dead one who after a punishment or a curse leaves his grave at night and visits those who sleep to suck their blood his only food or as a deceased who comes out of his grave at night to torture the living to drink their blood and to kill them so that they too in their turn will become vampires the mythologies of the world talk about more kinds of vampires including in europe various descriptions for differing kinds of vampires in this sense the french revenant and the romanian strigoi are different from the krusnik and the kudlak from istrian beliefs as living dead the strigoi and the revenant leave their grave and go to torment the living and in this way the strigoi differ from the western vampire the vampire is the result of the transformation induced by a sire the strigoi rises from the grave as a living dead after a great discontent this can consist either in an action which has been undertaken against him while he was still alive such as a great offense a great sorrow or the fact that he has been killed by someone or it can be about a posthumous discontent such as the fact that his funerary rituals have not been correctly performed on one side the strigoi has a mytho folklorical justification related to the fear of death and to the necessity of fulfilling the funeral in a correct manner even more different from western vampires are the krusnik and the kudlak opposed entities found in an eternal battle out of the two the kudlak being the entity of a vampiric type the image of the vampire is not limited to the european space the akkadian goddess of war and fertility named ishtar

the vampire also appears in relation to the human s desire to obtain immortality the legends of the world talk about immortals who present themselves in diverse forms in the hebrew bible methuselah lived for over 900 years and he descended from a people who lived for very long utnapishtim the ancestor of gilgamesh became immortal after he had used a certain type of plant chinese myths have many references to immortals dwarves who led very long lives and the elixir of immortality chinese immortals lived in the heavens in a world hidden in the clouds and they have fascinated the chinese rulers who were also interested in their turn to find out the secret of immortality in this regard ioan petru culianu mentioned immortality could have a price and this price could be too high the fascination which the myth of the vampire exerts upon the imagination of the individual has resulted in countless novels and movies offering new visions of centuries old myths and enriching them the western vampire is a living dead who drinks the blood of the living to survive him being transformed into his vampiric form after the bite of another vampire after a curse or after the fact that he had turned his back on faith in his form of a being of the night the vampire cannot stand silver holy things garlic and other items which are mentioned in the numerous legends on this topic however that which fascinates consists in the seduction which the vampire exerts despite the fact that he is a type of living dead the chupacabra of mexico and elsewhere consumes animal blood goat blood especially daniel adobe stock a cryptid which drinks blood out of the mysterious beings which feed on blood one cannot forget the chupacabra which consumes animal blood goat blood especially the study of this

cryptid in the same situation there are also tokoloshe bigfoot the loch ness monster lusca the mongolian death worm yeti iguanodon mokele mbembe yowie and others the earliest accounts related to the chupacabra appeared in mexico from where they have spread to central america north america and chile the locals went to ask for the help of the authorities because they found their animals killed in a barbaric manner ripped apart and emptied of blood most of the dead animals were goats that had been bitten through the neck and the blood had been sucked out entirely some people declared that they had seen the culprit and even though throughout time the descriptions have begun to differ initially the chupacabra was described as a creature with big eyes sharp claws and a row of spikes on the middle of the back and as having the dimensions of a bear cub new accounts about the chupacabra have appeared in the philippines and in russia and the press has begun to become interested in the subject this thing has started many discussions on this theme some supporting the idea of the extraterrestrial origins of the creature and others trying to explain that it only had to do with coyotes infected with scabies unlike other predatory species the chupacabra drinks in its entirety the blood of its prey and eye witnesses have reported that the being has reptile like skin a snout with big panther like teeth and a forked tongue also from the descriptions this creature can cover great distances like kangaroos through jumps and there have been situations when the witnesses have said that they had seen the being making jumps over six meters 20 feet despite the lack of scientific evidence for the locals from central america the fear of chupacabra has not decreased at all after mating it is not unusual for the larger female praying mantis to eat the male depicted on top here ugrashak cc by sa 4 0 cannibal tendencies in the insect world there exist certain species which practice the

praying mantises an insect which during or at the end of the sexual act bites off the head of the mate pliny talks in naturalis historiae about a species of cannibalistic birds these birds similar to ostriches led their lives on an isolated and less known island they did not feed on anything from that island instead they only ate one another through this cannibal behavior the birds performed natural selection which allowed the survival of the most resistant and the best adapted similar to the insect named the praying mantis in european mythology the demonic entity known as a succubus acts as a sexual predator the demon has both the feminine variant named succubus and the masculine variant named incubus while the incubus mates with women whom he kills by absorbing their vital energy during the sexual act the succubus mates with men whom she kills at the end of the sexual act to consume their flesh as food stories about cannibal tendencies also exist in japan where the cannibal crone yama uba fed especially on the flesh of newborns but also on that of adults in exchange when such a crone saw the small orphan kintarou she did not kill him but raised him with love and care him growing up to become sakata no kintoki the famous hero of japanese legends in this way it can be said that hematophagy cannibalism and necrophagy have been included in the myths of the world ever since ancient times giving birth to legends and fantastic beings which remain known and near potent in the modern worlds we live in top image wendigos fall into the larger definition of cannibalism as

this is the final installment in our three part discussion of separate property in divorce we previously covered common categories of marital and separate property this week we consider how one spouse s separate property might be invaded in divorce invasion of separate property in general each party will receive their own separate property without any part going to the other party and the court will then seek to make an equitable division of all that remains in the marital estate but there are two important exceptions wherein the court may invade one spouse s separate property and divide it up anyway upon a showing of substantial need or contribution the substantial need exception derives from michigan statute mcl 552 23 1 which provides that separate property may be invaded if after division of the marital assets the estate and effects awarded to either party are insufficient for the suitable support and maintenance of either party as interpreted by michigan courts this means that invasion is allowed when one party demonstrates additional need such that invading one party s separate property is necessary to ensure that the other party has sufficient resources to support themselves the contribution exception derives from michigan statute mcl 552 401 which provides that the court may invade separate property when the other spouse contributed to the acquisition improvement or accumulation of the property thus hen one significantly assists in the acquisition or growth of a spouse s separate asset the court may consider the contribution as having a distinct value deserving of compensation a common example of this is a home purchased prior to the marriage but which becomes the marital home after the couple marries the longer the parties live in the home the more marital the home becomes there is no definitive rule as to timing but the theory is that the non purchasing spouse is contributing to mortgage reduction and upkeep and maintenance another example is closely held company stock that increases in value as a result of both parties efforts during in the marriage in a recent case the trial court found that certain private stock the husband acquired before marriage was the husband s separate property and that his efforts working for the company during the marriage contributed to the increase in the value of the stock the court noted that while the husband worked long hours for the company as much as seven days a week and 12 hour days the wife also worked for the company and was fully responsible for the children while the husband worked long hours the trial court ruled and the court of appeals affirmed that the wife was entitled to 1 3 of the value of the stock because she contributed to its appreciation not only as an employee of the company but also by managing the household and childcare for the couple s children separating expectations from reality anyone contemplating divorce should resist the urge to rely on their gut instinct for determining what property may or may not be subject to division while the law in this area is relatively clear and often well reasoned it may not coincide exactly with what seems fair on a surface level things like separate bank accounts or each spouse s respective earnings may seem like they should be separate but they are not in addition the application of the law will always depend on a judge s view of the facts how extensively were funds commingled is there substantial need for invasion how significant was one spouse s contribution to the other s separate property what did the parties really intend to keep separate understanding the analysis courts go through is certainly necessary for arguing your case to a judge but it is also helpful in negotiating a property settlement outside of court by knowing your legal rights you know when it makes sense to concede and when it makes sense to push for a better deal see reeves 226 mich app at 494 id sutariya v sutariya no 345115 2021 wl 5019330 at 3 mich ct app oct 28 2021

excluding ppp loans of 27 2 million and investment portfolio growth of 45 7 million during the year ended december 31 2021 this growth in earning assets contributed to net interest income expansion and helped to offset the yield reduction resulting from the current low interest rate environment 345 million has been funded in new ppp loans since the commencement of the ppp loan program of which

december 31 2020 the fourth quarter decrease compared to prior quarters is attributable to the decrease in ppp loan interest and fees as described above the year over year increase is attributable to an increase in interest and fees on ppp loans and organic growth as mentioned above net interest margin was 2 55 and 3 04 for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2021 respectively as compared to 3 49 and 3 59 for the same periods of 2020 the interest margin compression was mainly due to an increase in low yielding cash balances driven by deposit growth and ppp loan forgiveness payments and from lower overall market rates triggered by the fomc rate cuts in march 2021 which continue to adversely impact earning asset yields as they reprice and mature non interest income for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2021 totaled 1 542 000 and 5 426 000 respectively compared to 1 303 000 during the prior quarter 1 280 000 for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 4 815 000

2021 a decrease of 12 1 million from september 30 2021 and 153 1 million from december 31 2020 the fourth quarter and year to date decreases in gross loans were due to decreases in ppp loan balances of 36 0 million and 180 3 million respectively as a result of ppp forgiveness payments received from the sba the company s total deposits were 1 81 billion as of december 31 2021 an increase of 105 8

chief operating officer non performing assets remained at zero as of december 31 2021 as they were as of september 30 2021 and december 31 2020 the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans decreased to 1 25 at december 31 2021 compared to 1 30 at september 30 2021 and increased from 1 12 at december 31 2020 as loan loss reserves relative to gross loans remain at acceptable levels and credit quality remains stable the decrease compared to september 30 2021 is due to the 635 000 reversal of loan loss provisions associated with general improvements in credit risk metrics within our loan portfolio the increase compared to 1 12 as of december 31 2020 is due to the decrease in outstanding ppp loans that do not require a loan loss reserve as they are guaranteed by the federal government through the sba program the 635 000 reversal in the fourth quarter of 2021 compares to a reversal of 338 000 during the fourth quarter of 2020 corresponding to the reduction in non accrual loans and an aggregate provision for loan losses of 2 165 000 for the year ended december 31 2020 the 2020 provision for loan loss is commensurate with growth of the loan portfolio and includes a covid 19 related discretionary adjustment during the second quarter of 2020 qualitative risk based discretionary adjustments were made to the allowance for loan losses in connection with the covid 19

most of us learned the classic reason or emotion concept of decision making as described long ago by plato human thinking is understood as akin to a chariot driver trying to control two horses one guided by rational impulse and the other driven by irrational passions plato taught that when reason predominates we are more fully human and less likely to err lawyers embrace the platonic model if we can just put our emotions in a box we believe we can rely on glorious reason to carry the day for our clients and ourselves if only recent advances in the science of decision making undercut long held assumptions about how people make decisions science now teaches that a human being s cerebral cortex and its deliberate logical power does not solely or separately rule the day instead logic or reason described as system 2 thinking operates alongside and in conjunction with the evolutionary brain and its quick instinctual impulses described as system 1 thinking to put this construct in everyday terms system 1 thinking is like driving a car down an open highway while system 2 thinking is like parallel parking on a busy street nobel laureate daniel kahneman one of the leaders in the developing understanding of human decision making explains that system 1 silently takes over from system 2 by introducing unconscious mental shortcuts known as heuristics as detailed in his book thinking fast and slow these mental shortcuts are not chosen they are the consequence of the mental shotgun the imprecise control we have over targeting our responses to questions thus we are not even aware of the tricks our mind is playing in order to solve a problem the mental shotgun makes it easy to generate quick answers to difficult questions without imposing much hard work on your lazy system 2 again this process occurs automatically without conscious awareness so these shortcuts take over our thinking easily and automatically armed with insights into heuristics along with strategies to overcome routine thinking errors lawyers can become better decision makers here are two examples to whet your appetite to learn more 1 affect heuristic this devilish mental shortcut substitutes an easier and often irrelevant question in place of a difficult question one that requires the use of logic and facts to answer correctly in so doing we get the right answer to the wrong question ralph a weber columbia 1982 a fellow in the american college of trial lawyers created weber advising llc milwaukee to assist in house counsel and trial lawyers with upcoming trials to mediate and arbitrate and to pursue writing projects focused on decision making get to know the author check out q a below kahneman gives this example of the affect heuristic at work he asked the chief investment officer cio of a large financial firm why the cio had invested tens of millions of dollars in the stock of ford motor company the right answer according to economists would have involved an explanation of how the current market price of ford stock was below where it should have been that is ford s stock was undervalued by the market how the cio had reason to know this and thus why the cio chose to take advantage of his insight into the true higher stock value by buying at the below value market price but that is not what the sophisticated cio said the cio instead replied that he had recently attended an auto show and had been impressed by the ford cars he saw boy do they know how to make a car he said he made it clear that in making the stock investment he had trusted his gut feeling kahneman points out that this sophisticated investor had avoided the difficult question of weighing ford s market price versus its true value and instead allowed the affect heuristic to take over he liked the cars he liked the company and he liked the idea of owning the stock instead of focusing on whether ford stock was currently underpriced system 1 and the affect heuristic guided his judgment with a feeling of liking and disliking with little deliberation or reasoning if a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly system 1 will find a related question that is easier and will answer it the question the investor faced should i invest in ford stock was difficult but the answer to an easier and related question do i like ford cars came readily to his mind and determined his choice hiring decisions are one area in which the affect heuristic comes into play for lawyers we scan a candidate s resumé look for points of common experience have a 30 minute conversation and then answer the question do i like this person if you or i do and if our colleagues likewise like the person the person is hired and then we re disappointed when the person s skills don t meet our needs if all we consider is whether we like someone then we re not asking the right questions kahneman s latest book noise a flaw in human judgment offers a way to overcome the affect heuristic companies working to overcome hiring flaws now practice structured interviewing one such company is google which despite significant efforts to make good hiring decisions found in an audit of its recruiting that there was zero relationship between the predicted and actual hiring outcomes google thus revamped its system now it first carefully identifies the specific skills needed for a given job for lawyers this could be brief writing taking depositions client generation abilities and so on next it requires interviewers to assess each key skill separately so that a high score in one category does not influence another category in which the rating should be low also and especially important interviewers work with a common set of predefined questions so that each candidate is being asked the same questions without which fairly comparing the candidates becomes difficult or impossible while google adds other data to the mix including work sample tests to check job related knowledge the final decision also includes the judgment and intuition of the hiring committee instead of leading with intuition however as the affect heuristic wants us to do structured interviewing delays the application of intuition until all the evidence is gathered and analyzed now imagine for a moment how this approach can improve the process for hiring lawyers instead of a series of random interviews that yield little in the way of meaningful information you and your colleagues can use a structured approach that first decides which skills are important next identifies the questions likely to yield evidence about those skills then has interviewers ask these questions of each candidate while separately recording scores for each skill category once this is done you assemble the data and apply your experience and intuition to the evidence before you 2 confirmation bias confirmation bias is a second powerful mental shortcut that can lead to poor decision making because our minds dislike the discomfort of uncertainty we want to answer questions or solve riddles as quickly as possible we do so by creating a hypothesis and then looking for facts to support confirm that hypothesis in short first we pick an answer and then we look for facts to support that choice the problem with confirmation bias is that it shuts off our brains to later received contradictory evidence which if we considered it could cause us to change our minds unfortunately confirmation bias takes over and causes us to ignore or discount as untrustworthy evidence that contradicts what we already have come to believe to paraphrase paul simon s lyric in the boxer we hear what we want to hear and disregard the rest confirmation bias often is mentioned in the political arena with good reason in a 2004 study brain scans were conducted on participants as they read statements from then presidential candidates george w bush and john kerry in which the candidates clearly contradicted themselves republican participants were far more critical of john kerry s statements ignoring the contradictions of their own candidate while democrat participants took george w bush to task and gave kerry a pass the brain scans revealed that as the participants evaluated the statements the part of the brain most associated with reasoning was dormant while the parts of the brain associated with emotions and resolving conflict were highly active essentially it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want and then they get massively reinforced for it with the elimination of negative emotional states and activation of positive ones so what can lawyers do to account for and offset confirmation bias how do we think about solutions to clients problems so we are receptive to information that contradicts our initial assessment how do we step away from the warm feelings offered by certainty and actually consider whether an answer is wrong advice from the legendary judge learned hand might help in his june 28 1951 senate committee testimony judge hand warned against unquestioned certainty judge hand quoted from oliver cromwell s letter asking the scots to reconsider their position and avoid what became the battle of dunbar judge hand then urged that cromwell s plea i beseech ye in the bowels of christ think that ye may be mistaken be inscribed over the door of every courthouse and used to begin every court session hand understood the value of challenging one s own thinking and wanted that value broadly and permanently expressed in american courts science has affirmed the usefulness of judge hand s admonition to consider that we may be mistaken as a way to improve decision making professor charles g lord and colleagues tested this strategy and described their findings in considering the opposite a corrective strategy for social justice their work investigated whether confirmation bias could be overcome either 1 by an instruction to be unbiased or 2 by an instruction to consider the opposite the consider the opposite instruction was worded as follows ask yourself at each step whether you would have made the same high or low evaluations had the same study produced results on the other side the experiment showed that the consider the opposite approach worked while those instructed to be unbiased became more extreme in their beliefs those told to consider the opposite were able to offset confirmation bias the authors reported we cannot but conclude that judge hand s advice should be taken literally the military and intelligence communities long have understood the value of red teams whose role is to challenge the accepted wisdom of the group you sometimes see participants in a meeting purporting to play that role usually announcing in advance of their remarks the qualifier just to play devil s advocate but this comment suggests that going against the group consensus needs to be noted and excused rather than expected and encouraged humility drives a culture that values red teams and devil s advocates leaders who value humility strengthen their decision making by understanding they may be wrong we all know people who are not always right but who are never in doubt the superficial attraction of such self assured people wears thin when the consequences of their narrow field of vision come home to roost conclusion i hope this introduction to decision making science whets your appetite to learn more about ways to avoid common thinking errors if so watch for a future

for years now the u s export import bank an under the radar agency that provides subsidized loans to foreign firms willing to buy american products has tried to remain relevant after a semi hiatus alongside criticism for functioning as the bank of boeing ex im convinced the trump and biden administrations that it may be a tremendous weapon to fight chinese influence while it can do no such thing ex im is now moving on to something else extending its domestic influence ex im s grandiose claims shouldn t distract us from its mediocrity in 2019 congress handed the agency a seven year reauthorization and restored a quorum on its board of directors this allowed ex im to resume work on what it claimed was a 40 billion backlog of u s projects the argument was that during the four prior years when ex im was mostly dormant u s exporters lost billions of dollars because foreign clients couldn t access preferential loan rates and terms all backed by american taxpayers these exports the tale continued were ready to roll as soon as the agency was revived nonsense three years later advocates for the bank s crony activities still use the backlog as justification in other words if there ever was a backlog it s apparently still there that leaves one to wonder what the bank has been doing in recent years while the country was in the early stages of the pandemic in 2020 ex im deployed new lending programs and lifted some restrictions in existing programs purportedly to allow more deals to go through during hard times you would think such an international crisis would increase the demand for cheaper financing you d be wrong while a few large companies that already had plenty of access to capital benefited the number of deals remained low as a result ex im s footprint has been steadily declining according to ex im data its portfolio of loans and guarantees dropped from 54 7 billion in 2019 to 46 9 billion in 2020 and finally to 41 3 billion in 2021 this is less than one third of the institution s 135 billion financing capacity then there s ex im s program on china and transformational exports which congress inserted into the 2019 reauthorization to spur strategic investments designed to counter china s global economic influence last year the program delivered only 141 million a tiny fraction of the 27 billion target that ex im is supposed to hit by the end of 2026 meanwhile ex im s support for small business has been declining since the bank was fully restored in 2019 dropping from 2 3 billion to 2 1 billion to only 1 6 billion in 2021 in 2021 ex im s financing for women and minority owned businesses was only 361 million that s less than half of where it stood 10 years ago not even adjusting for inflation faced with this record of underachievement the biden administration could have put an end to the charade once and for all instead it asked the agency to investigate financing investments within the united states rather than merely abroad it s a ludicrous idea there s no need to issue loans domestically we have one of the most highly developed financial markets in the world and the u s banking sector is plump with liquidity available to companies that need capital in fact any engagement by ex im in the domestic market would simply replace legitimate sources of financing that aren t subsidized by u s taxpayers in addition to crowding out private lenders and distorting capital markets it would extend the corporate favoritism the bank is known for abroad to our own shores it s an unfair advantage to companies the government chooses to subsidize what are the chances ex im will conclude that there s no need for any of this near zero meanwhile the extremely flexible criteria it s proposing to assess domestic investments will all but guarantee that companies with no need will be eligible boeing for example would now be able to borrow from ex im for its domestic operations in addition to benefiting from a huge amount of the bank s foreign activities while boeing would understandably love an additional handout like most of these subsidies it will be a net negative for the country s economy as a whole there aren t enough words in this column to list all the many dangers lurking in this proposal when it comes to government decisions arguments matter but a long term track record should matter more biden and his team should reconsider and instead ponder shutting ex im s doors for good veronique de rugy is a senior research fellow at the mercatus center at george mason university a columnist for reason magazine and the washington examiner and blogs about economics for national review click here to contact her and follow her on twitter veroderugy click here to read previous columns the opinions expressed are her own related stories

4 compared to 13 687 000 or 1 68 eps for 2020 the fourth quarter net income decrease was primarily due to a decrease in paycheck protection program ppp loan interest and fee income to 1 254 000 during the fourth quarter compared to 2 679 000 during the third quarter of 2021 and 2 150 000 during the fourth quarter of 2020 the year to date increase in net income was mainly due to ppp loan interest and fee income of 8 726 000 in 2021 as compared to 4 720 000 in 2020 additionally a reversal of loan loss provisions totaling 635 000 was recognized during the fourth quarter and year to date period of 2021 as compared to a reversal of 338 000 during the fourth quarter of 2020 and provisions of 2 165 000 for the year to date period of 2020 the company has benefited from loan growth excluding ppp loans of 27 2 million and investment portfolio growth of 45 7 million during the year ended december 31 2021 this growth in earning assets contributed to net interest income expansion and helped to offset the yield reduction resulting from the current low interest rate environment 345 million has been funded in new ppp loans since the commencement of the ppp loan program of which 314 million has been paid down through sba forgiveness payments leaving an outstanding balance of 31 million as of december 31 2021 our team had a truly dynamic performance in 2021 their work to support local

the fourth quarter decrease compared to prior quarters is attributable to the decrease in ppp loan interest and fees as described above the year over year increase is attributable to an increase in interest and fees on ppp loans and organic growth as mentioned above net interest margin was 2 55 and 3 04 for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2021 respectively as compared to 3 49 and 3 59 for the same periods of 2020 the interest margin compression was mainly due to an increase in low yielding cash balances driven by deposit growth and ppp loan forgiveness payments and from lower overall market rates triggered by the fomc rate cuts in march 2021 which continue to adversely impact earning asset yields as they reprice and mature non interest income for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2021 totaled 1 542 000 and 5 426 000 respectively compared to 1 303 000 during the prior quarter 1 280 000 for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 4 815 000 for the year ended

000 for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 29 864 000 for the year ended december 31 2020 the fourth quarter and year to date increases compared to prior periods correspond to staffing expense general

million from september 30 2021 and 153 1 million from december 31 2020 the fourth quarter and year to date decreases in gross loans were due to decreases in ppp loan balances of 36 0 million and 180 3 million respectively as a result of ppp forgiveness payments received from the sba the company s total deposits were 1 81 billion as of december 31 2021 an increase of 105 8 million over september 30 2021 and 439 2 million over december 31 2020 we ve had transformative growth in our balance sheet over the past two years at the same time we have seen considerable changes on the competitive front resulting from recent consolidation within the industry coupled together these factors instill optimism in our outlook for the road ahead summarized rick mccarty president and chief operating officer non performing assets remained at zero as of december 31 2021 as they were as of september 30 2021 and december 31 2020 the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans decreased to 1 25 at december 31 2021 compared to 1 30 at september 30 2021 and increased from 1 12 at december 31 2020 as loan loss reserves relative to gross loans remain at acceptable levels and credit quality remains stable the decrease compared to september 30 2021 is due to the 635 000 reversal of loan loss provisions associated with general improvements in credit risk metrics within our loan portfolio the increase compared to 1 12 as of december 31 2020 is due to the decrease in outstanding ppp loans that do not require a loan loss reserve as they are guaranteed by the federal government through the sba program the 635 000 reversal in the fourth quarter of 2021 compares to a reversal of 338 000 during the fourth quarter of 2020 corresponding to the reduction in non accrual loans and an aggregate provision for loan losses of 2 165 000 for the year ended december 31 2020 the 2020 provision for loan loss is commensurate with growth of the loan portfolio and includes a covid 19 related discretionary adjustment during the second quarter of 2020 qualitative risk based discretionary adjustments were made to the allowance for loan losses in connection with the covid 19 pandemic and corresponding economic stress these discretionary adjustments are continuously evaluated based on current levels of credit risk to borrowers impacted by the covid 19 pandemic the board of directors of

hedge fund ceo josh young is forthright about how he cashed in on climate change activists hate for fossil fuels people don t understand how much money you can make in things that people hate young said in a financial times article focused on hedge funds that are profiting on energy equities including his bison interests investment company that reports say saw a more than 300 percent increase in value in 2021 what i ve been doing is owning the things that people absolutely hate young told breitbart news referring to the war on fossil fuels including the biden administration s efforts through executive order to shut down u s pipelines and halt exploration and production of oil and gas on federal lands young explained the lucrative investments in energy equities that are being dumped by businesses universities and other entities in the name of climate change and social justice there s still so much value for so little money versus what is available in the broader stock market or for other investments young said bison interests website explains the company s investment strategy this way we are leading experts in the oil and gas investment field and we concentrate on dislocations in the marketplace headquartered in houston texas the heart of the u s energy market our strategy is focused on outperforming in the public oil and gas space over a variety of market conditions breitbart news asked young about on how the climate change movement has put the focus on institutions and corporation s environmental social and corporate governance or esg rating leading to divestment from fossil fuels across the board while the demand for oil and gas here and abroad continues to grow institutional divestment by pension funds endowments some billionaires and others have depleted capital that would have been spent on development leading to lower production than otherwise young said divestment and associated negative media narrative has suppressed the valuation of public companies and assets by depleting available funds to buy or hold these stocks with valuations much lower than when oil and gas prices were last at these levels for example oil is at levels last seen in 2014 but the xop oil and gas producer etf is down 50 percent young said and the phenomenon that young has taken advantage of will continue according to a bison interests report 2022 is looking promising for the oil and gas industry on several fronts un economic esg mandates by investment allocators and increasingly unfriendly policy and regulations are restricting the availability of capital and suppressing development activity insufficient exploration and production activity is depleting reserves and despite the prevailing green transition narrative demand continues to rise inexorably ironically divestment and virtue signalling policymaking has intensified at a time where an energy crisis of epic proportions is already well underway with natural gas prices in europe sitting near 200 barrel of oil equivalent after briefly running higher than 350 but young told breitbart news the ongoing and growing demand for oil and gas is not exclusively beneficial to investors reduced domestic oil and gas production raises prices and increases the risk of supply disruption which could lead to lines at gas stations already seen recently in europe blackouts and shortages young said investing in domestic production helps moderate prices and reduces both the risk of shortages and dependence on sources in countries that may have adverse interests to the u s perhaps just as ironic young believes in the importance of protecting the environment while supporting fossil fuels which have lifted millions of people around the planet out of poverty and improved the standard of living overall i don t like to invest in companies that are egregious polluters such as producers in russia responsible for numerous oil spills young said it is not necessary to cause this sort of environmental destruction and it is bad business it is possible to sufficiently supply the energy necessary for humanity to thrive without destroying the environment young said i focus on high energy return on investment eri projects which are intrinsically better for the environment when measured holistically than low eroi projects young said so the projects i m involved with are actually improving the environmental footprint of the energy supply increases in energy demand are correlated with lifting people out of poverty extending their lifespans significantly and reducing disease and hunger young told breitbart news so i believe these investments are both holistically environmentally beneficial and also are humanitarian and young predicts that not only are fossil fuels on the move but that the public s opinion on them will shift away from saving the planet to saving the american middle class lifestyle so in certain places in europe it s already kind of having a resurgence and you re seeing it a little bit in certain european reporting young said i think it just takes shortages and gas lines and other things and then these things get more popular and even with all the climate change hysteria and biden s efforts to kill fossil fuels according to the federal energy information administration the oil and gas sector grew in 2021 including the completion of 14 pipelines in the united states i ve been told for years that oil and gas are going away and yet oil demand has increased by at least 1 million barrels per day worldwide for the last 40 years with the exception of the financial crisis in 2008 and the world shutdown for covid in 2020 young said and oil and gas companies and assets are still being priced as if they are going away despite continued growing demand as for young and his oil and gas investment strategy he will continue to take advantage of the unintended consequence of climate change activists demonizing fossil fuels it s like a half off sale essentially for oil and gas stocks young said follow penny starr on twitter

a billionaire investor renowned for predicting a string of market bubbles has shared the chilling warning that a historic share market crash was looming jeremy grantham has made a name for himself after accurately predicting when bubbles will burst over many decades last year the british investor began sounding the alarm that a historic stock market collapse was looming and now he is convinced it s all but inevitable that the s p500 will plummet by almost 50 per cent even if the us federal reserve steps in in a lengthy note published this week on his firm gmo s website mr grantham claimed the us was now in the middle of a superbubble the fourth in american history following previous bubbles in 1929 2000 and 2008 stay up to date with the latest market moves with flash a dedicated news streaming service new to flash try 14 days free now billionaire jeremy grantham says the us is facing the fourth superbubble in its history istock and he said it s only a matter of time before today s superbubble bursts this time last year it looked like we might have a standard bubble with resulting standard pain for the economy he wrote but during the year the bubble advanced to the category of superbubble one of only three in modern times in us equities and the potential pain has increased accordingly this checklist for a superbubble running through its phases is now complete and the wild rumpus can begin at any time when pessimism returns to markets we face the largest potential markdown of perceived wealth in us history he explained at the same time the us has experienced very low interest rates high bond prices and bubbles in housing commodities stocks and bonds jeremy grantham says the historic bubble is set to burst picture james croucher he said that if valuations across all of these asset classes return even two thirds of the way back to historical norms total wealth losses will be on the order of 35 trillion in the us alone if this negative wealth and income effect is compounded by inflationary pressures from energy food and other shortages we will have serious economic problems mr grantham also doubled down on his gloomy prediction in an interview with bloomberg i wasn t quite as certain about this bubble a year ago as i had been about the tech bubble of 2000 or as i had been in japan or as i had been in the housing bubble of 2007 he told the publication i felt highly likely but perhaps not nearly certain today i feel it is just about nearly certain for those without a background in finance mr grantham went into terrifying detail about exactly why bubbles are so concerning in his note which made headlines across the globe the billionaire investor says he is nearly certain the crash has already started istock as bubbles form they give us a ludicrously overstated view of our real wealth which encourages us to spend accordingly he explained then as bubbles break they crush most of those dreams and accelerate the negative economic forces on the way down to allow bubbles let alone help them along is simply bad economic policy mr grantham laid the blame squarely at the feet of the authorities lashing out at the us federal reserve s current and previous decisions asking why on earth the fed would not only have allowed these events but should have actually encouraged and facilitated them

tom lydon ceo of etf trends recently sat down with cathie wood ceo of ark invest to discuss how ark invest was approaching its portfolios during extended market volatility and ark s long term outlook for its investment strategies please note the following regarding views expressed during this interview forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon this interview is for informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy sell or hold any particular security any references to particular securities are for illustrative purposes only the audience should not assume that an investment identified was or will be profitable past performance is not indicative of future performance future returns are not guaranteed tom lydon hi it s tom lydon with etf trends and today i m happy to welcome cathie wood ceo of ark invest cathie great seeing you thanks for spending some time with us cathie wood oh i m happy to be here tom wonderful to spend some time with you tom lydon so we ve had a lot of volatility in 21 and that s carried over into 22 how has this affected your response to portfolios are you doing anything differently cathie wood well we are doing right now what we always do during a correction and this has been an extended one almost a year now we ve been concentrating our portfolios towards our highest conviction names and so we haven t done anything different the reason for that is the innovation that we re investing in is following learning curves that are dropping costs and prices and increasing the access to these technologies throughout the world so they are scaling exponentially and we just want to be there for the ride tom lydon so there s some concern that maybe the downside volatility has been driven by deterioration in the underlying fundamentals of your holdings cathie wood well no although those who tag our portfolios with a stay at home description would suggest that there s decelerating growth and that it probably will not pick back up that was a once in a lifetime opportunity pulled a lot of business ahead we think that this year now that we are getting through the toughest comparisons in terms of the coronavirus when consumers and businesses were adopting technologies aggressively to solve some big problems they were encountering now that we are passing through the toughest comparisons we think this controversy will be put to bed because as we cycle through we believe their growth rates are going to accelerate forces in motion if we re talking about better cheaper faster more productive more creative solving problems those don t turn back and so we think that s going to be the big surprise this year tom lydon well i remember talking to you about this pre pandemic and then throughout this pandemic two years that we ve had you would bring up different companies like teledoc for example and the story just kept getting stronger and stronger maybe use that as an example cathie wood sure i d love to so teledoc is now in our top five as is zoom and roku these would fall into the stay at home stock category we ve been increasing our position as we ve been concentrating our portfolio just to refresh your memory the reason we concentrate our portfolios is because during risk off periods most investors and analysts diversify their portfolios and get closer to their benchmarks the benchmarks against which they re measured we do not have anyone benchmark that s not what we do what we do is buy the stocks that they are selling because very often in our portfolios the stocks are either small positions in indexes or they re not in indexes our so very few stocks in our portfolio are in the indexes as investors are selling those shares again a decision just to get closer to their benchmark we re buying them and concentrating our portfolios towards our highest conviction names so let s talk about teledoc and i did write down a few statistics here of course a lot of people were introduced to telemedicine during the coronavirus crisis they got their first taste and to the extent they can help it meaning they don t absolutely have to see a doctor for checkup reasons that need to be done personally we are not going back to the old way of doing things now if you look at the revenue of teledoc it is up fourfold from 2019 and perhaps more important the arpu the average revenue per user has gone from 1 roughly 1 to 2 60 and our analyst simon barnett says that if they did a lot more cross selling and just theoretically every person took all of their services that arpu could go all the way to 68 now of course it won t but it is going a lot higher now in this they just guided to the december quarter 43 growth which was higher than consensus expectations that revenue for 2021 now stands at two billion dollars that s a real company a lot of sellers of our stocks they re probably quantitative strategist using algorithms and really don t care what a company does many just have used valuation as a reason to sell our stocks but they compare our strategy to a tech and telecom bubble strategy none of the companies in the tech and telecom bubble that i remember got anywhere near two billion dollars in sales so there may have been the odd one and maybe amazon was a very low margin company was there but teledoc is at two billion dollars it has 68 gross margins i ll just wrap this one up by saying many people who do pay a lot more attention to stocks in the various indices are basically dismissing teledoc as hey united healthcare could do that easily well the fact is and maybe they could they are trying to do it in some way but this is not their dna if you look at teledoc s price to sales right now which is what we have to do with these high growth companies as they re revving into profitability on the operating income line teledoc s price to sales is five times united health 13 to 14 times teledoc s growth rate revenues they will tell you over the next three to five years 25 to 30 plus and united health maybe 10 so there s something very interesting about this picture just throwing out the way the world is going to work in order to buy more of the way the world has worked and we think that will prove to be a mistake tom lydon you re so right i mean my wife and my kids have all used a teledoc type service over the last couple of years it s so nice and it s so easy even though it s safer to go back into the dental office obviously or see your physician if you ve got something going on to be able to do a teledoc appointment has just been fantastic i hope we re not going back i can t imagine how shortsighted people are that say that they want to get back in line at a dentist office and wait a half hour and it s also less expensive right cathie wood it s less expensive there is a major labor shortage brewing in the healthcare industry as we all know this is going to be one of the solutions to that problem and the healthcare system will become more efficient because of it if i could just give you in terms of this idea of tough comparisons i ll give you the most extreme example in the portfolio zoom just to set zoom up a little bit zoom s user base has gone from 20 million users before the coronavirus to 200 million now many people say oh yeah but a lot of those people aren t paying okay its revenues have gone up sixfold from 2019 to 2021 it is about to face its toughest comparison revenue in the fourth quarter year ago went up 370 now the fear with zoom is okay going back to work this story is over well it s not over if their guidance is correct and where they issued it pretty close to the quarter so i think it s close their revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be in the 19 to 20 range think about that on top of that that s against a i think it was 68 comparison now that is the toughest quarter they face the next quarter they ll be facing 185 growth well we think their revenue growth rate will accelerate that is when i think a lot of investors will get an ah ha moment wait a minute what is going on here accelerating against this 185 number and just to give you a sense of their gross margins 65 to 68 most of our companies have very nice gross margins its valuation today is eight and a half times revenue microsoft and many people say i know it s just a microcosm of microsoft microsoft s a much more mature company microsoft s price to sales is 10 times so you can see that many of these emerging growth companies that got an accelerated boost a tailwind from the covid crisis are now selling at lower multiples on that basis than the most mature companies in the marketplace tom lydon it s crazy to believe another quick story cathie so i ve been in new york a couple times we re here in california we have a lot of clients in the financial services business that are in new york city and you know what maybe i ll have a lunch or maybe we ll go out to some dinners but people don t want to meet in the office they find it more efficient to meet like this over zoom i would go back to the hotel room and have meetings between the meals and i could have more meetings more effective more efficient and our company with people all over north america we re not going back cathie wood we re not yes and what most people do not understand when it comes to zoom in particular communications that category is the largest part of the enterprise technology stack so telecommunications globally is a 1 5 trillion business zoom s revenue base is 4 billion dollars again a real company now we believe that we are in the first major you d call it rip and replace except this is digital first major rip and replace cycle for the communications part of the tech stack since the early nineties this is a 1 5 trillion category zoom is starting to replace pbxs so the ciscos and the polycoms out there we believe are going to be pushed out so this is a much bigger story than just video communications although we do believe that is a very valuable piece of the story tom lydon so cathie lets switch gears for a second you touched a little bit on teledoc healthcare and genomics names were hit particularly hard in the last 12 months talk about that space and are you still excited about it cathie wood we couldn t be more excited the space went into a little bit more of a tailspin this week after the jp morgan conference the purported reason for that was oh we didn t get any real m a out of this this is usually when big announcements are made and typically there are a few very good m a events so what we re dealing here with is really the longest duration stocks in our portfolio if you ve been watching we are continuing to add to these names every time they come down now many of these names again you ve got algorithms at work and you ve got an inflation fear out there which many people think means higher interest rates interestingly long term interest rates are not confirming that by the way we do believe inflation is transitory i know that s become a bad word recently but we believe people are going to be shocked at how low inflation goes this year we re going to see negative year over year in many many categories today s retail sales report proves that out so we re dealing with that issue inflation interest rates interest rates go up lowering the present value of future cash flows of course we re looking way into the future with some genomics names what s going on in healthcare is increasing confidence that we are going to be able to cure a disease intellia for example did something this year it was a few months ago that nobody thought was possible its results from an in vivo trial which means it was delivered internally not externally to t cells that have been pulled out of the body so it s like real medicine that the cure rate in a rare disease called h a t t r was the same in humans as it was in primates that was a very high cure rate i think it was in the eighties don t quote me on that but it was very high shockingly high this is telling us that first of all identifying mutations which we do through dna sequencing and figuring out what genes to edit to reprogram the genome and get rid of the programming error or the mutation that this is going to cure disease now it s very interesting i may have said this to you before it s very interesting to have watched apple scale to a 3 trillion market cap but the four or five companies now that have the best patent positions in crispr cas9 and in base editing and prime editing those caps collectively don t even amount to 50 billion and we re talking about curing diseases they have the patents they will be getting royalties from everyone that s just one small microcosm of what s going to happen in this genomic revolution it is the convergence of dna sequencing artificial intelligence gene therapies like gene editing the way the genome stocks have been treated is purely for a macro reason anyone looking at the micros would not be selling these stocks tom lydon you and i have talked about this before also that getting your dna sequencing the cost of that has gone down tremendously almost to the point where the average patient who walks in for a checkup every year is going to have the option of getting their dna sequence looked at right cathie wood yes and simon told us an example of what s happening with children and rare diseases i think there were again i don t remember how many people were in the trial but with short read sequencing historically the improvement in the ability to detect these mutations in these children where the parents just go around for years and years trying to figure out what s wrong with my child the understanding had increased to 25 from low single digits we weren t able ever to find what these poor children were suffering from in the day now 25 long read sequencing now has taken us to 60 just think about this on average as we understand it children with rare diseases and i think one out of every twelve children born has a rare disease most of them are not going to be debilitating some are quite debilitating parents search on average it seems about five years to hit on an answer some never do well now we ve just with long read sequencing increased the probability of finding what s wrong out and really giving these children an opportunity to have normal lives tom lydon that s amazing so i want to ask you this question a lot of investors may have entered into an ark etf a year ago when it was in the first quarter of 21 things were pretty good you were coming off a real good year in 2020 but things have fallen off of a little bit since then cathie wood oh a lot tom lydon talk to those investors what advice would you give them cathie wood yes well first of all and we ve gone back and examined our own record so i can give you some numbers if you look at our performance arkk if you look at that strategy on a rolling 24 month basis and to do that we have 63 observations now because we started the firm in 2014 63 observations over a 24 month rolling basis 91 of the time we have beaten we have outperformed the broad based averages if you look at on a three year basis so i guess we go down to that would be 51 observations i think we have never underperformed the market on a rolling three year point of view what this means is that this rubber band has been stretched so tautly so tightly that we believe and consider the source but we truly believe given the valuations in our portfolio the growth in the portfolio and the fact that we re probably looking at very choppy waters from a cyclical point of view so that our secular growers are going to shine we truly believe that that rubber band will snap and the performance will rebound i m not going to say can t hold me to any particular speed but we think the undervaluation in the portfolio right now has reached an extreme i ve never experienced in my career i don t think we re missing anything i really don t of course when we go through periods like this we examine all of our assumptions and we can be very hard on ourselves that s a very healthy process i can tell you and i m talking about both macro and micro i believe what i just said about our portfolios they are ready like a coiled spring tom lydon although you started ark in 14 and i m going to be careful here you and i have been at the markets for a while i mean you probably started your career in the eighties what would you say cathie wood oh i started my career while i was in college so it was 1977 again inflation was picking up there so i know of what i talk when it comes to inflation and what will perpetuate it tom lydon so when you talk about extremes this includes the dot com area from a comparative standpoint right cathie wood yes and back then i couldn t give you any company with two billion three billion four billion in sales like i have just given you certainly from a gross profit point of view they were challenged on that score i think the discipline that has evolved in the market over the last 20 years is we want to see a fundamental measurement of profitability and potential profitability on the bottom line the operating line so gross margin is a very good indicator of that most of our stocks you ll find with the exception of genomics just because we re such early stage there most of our stocks have very healthy gross margins i gave you teledoc and zoom in the high 60s low 70s so back in the tech and telecom bubble i remember investors were falling all over themselves scrambling to get as much innovation in their portfolio as they were competing with each other to get i guess the benchmarks went up to 38 technology and investors in order to beat the benchmark were up to 45 and 50 technology what were they doing the valuations were based on potential eyeballs maybe in 10 years that is no longer the case the analyst and portfolio managers scrutinize earnings looking for clues that that gross margin structure is going to hold as the company scales and that the underlying growth rate is robust and strong and that other competition isn t coming behind to disrupt it i think one of the things that has helped us in this period is we are not just singing to our internal choir we have a very big and robust open source research ecosystem we are getting all kinds of support from people who are out there doing the innovating as i mentioned the reason we tweet our research and give it away for free is we want to become a part of these communities so we do have our finger on the pulse of these businesses and the pulse is very strong as we are talking to those who are actually living eating and breathing it every day tom lydon well i have to say we are students of etfs we watch what you folks have done over time even though 21 was a choppy year your asset base held up pretty well it wasn t just a lot of investors chasing a hot dot can you talk to that cathie wood yes i do and we ve been just incredibly grateful for that support and conviction in our strategy a lot of the people who enter our strategy understand we are talking about a five year investment time horizon as i ve mentioned before the rate of return expectation we have for our portfolios during the next five years even more so after this last one is higher than i have ever experienced in my business as i mentioned i ve been doing this for a long time and i have a lot of experience doing it i want to also hold another example out there just to give you a sense of what can happen if you just stick with it tesla how long did we have to bear the slings and arrows of people who were analysts and others who were trying to denigrate that story and were actually ignoring the data as it was coming through if someone had sold tesla in 2019 as the sec was investigating the famous tweet and as fears that they would never be able to scale manufacturing were rife as fears that they would run out of cash were also rife if you had sold then you would ve taken a temporary loss and turned it into a permanent loss and you would ve missed a move in the stock on this basis split basis from the 25 to 30 range up to 1 000 in a little more than two years that is the nature of the innovation that s going on out there and the exponential growth the explosive growth opportunities out there believe me those companies that have been investing aggressively now and may not be profitable now because they re investing much like tesla did back then they re going to be the winners just like tesla is the traditional auto manufacturers really didn t start thinking about electric vehicles seriously until i d say the last two years and now tesla is running circles around them and we believe will continue to run circles around them tom lydon so cathie when you look at this new year 2022 what s driving your conviction to your etfs as you look forward talk a little bit about expectations cathie wood sure our conviction and the courage of our conviction especially in a year like we ve just experienced is our research if anything our research and we re going to be publishing big ideas soon but our research is reinforcing the conviction that we ve had every time we advance our research one more year as we re looking out there at learning curves and cost curve declines and price elasticity of demand all of that is a green light even on the regulatory side what s been very satisfying and gratifying is that regulators are data driven and our strategy is data driven tesla is on the right side of change all of our companies are on the right side of change what we would be worrying about are those who are actually getting closer to their benchmarks and investing in the past and getting set up to be disrupted by the five innovation platforms dna sequencing robotics energy storage artificial intelligence blockchain technology those platforms are converging and the kind of growth coming out of those platforms is going to be astonishing the rapidity or the speed at which these platforms are evolving is incredible it s going to catch a lot of very large companies on their heels i often will remind people at one point you didn t get fired for buying ibm or ge today you could i think there are going to be a lot more examples of that in the traditional benchmarks in the years ahead tom lydon so you mentioned big ideas this is your annual report where you talk about your highest conviction ideas i look forward to getting that every year we will make sure we mention that too for everybody as well quick question does short interest or inverse products that are pegged to your strategies perhaps being fueled by negative coverage in the media does any of that any of those things affect you in the way you manage your strategies at all cathie wood no i think that there are people who have formed companies and started funds specifically to short our strategy now from a psychological point of view i think about that and i think gosh it must be consensus or conventional wisdom that innovation is in a bubble and i would say in the private markets it might be the difference in valuations between the private markets and the public markets is bigger i believe now than when we started ark one of the reasons i started ark was to take advantage of what i believed would be an arbitrage between the public and the private markets and there was last year we had somewhat of a closing of that arbitrage now last year meaning 2020 now it is wide open again one of two things is going to happen either the private markets are going to come down public markets are going to go up in terms of valuation or some combination of the two we are seeing coming across our desk daily price to sale ratios in the innovation platforms around which we base our research and our investing regularly they re at 20 30 40 times sales even higher on some i just gave you two stocks teledocs at five times and zoom is at eight and a half times so the conviction is puzzling to me because the private markets are saying something very different the public markets have the revenue basis and the growth rates to prove out that this is the real deal this is not the tech and telecom bubble all over again these are real companies that are going to help transform the world in a massive way the seeds for their technologies were all planted back in the 20 years that ended in the tech and telecom bubble so these strategies that are inverse to ours suggest to me there s a lot of conventional wisdom no problem shorting these stocks they have only one way to go algorithms have helped that along momentum driven ones certainly this is what makes a market if we re right they are going to have to cover it and i think we re right tom lydon so again it s nice to have a loyal client base and that s important but at the same time in terms of headlines where do you think ark is most misunderstood could you dive into that a little bit cathie wood misunderstood i think that many people don t know us and so they don t understand the depth of our research they don t know the breadth of our research ecosystem which reaches into the world of innovation to derive insights that are not available in the financial world i think they don t understand that our analysts their responsibilities are broken out not by sector or by industry or sub industry but by technology there are 14 technologies involved in the five major platforms these technologies if they re going to move down learning curves and costs fall as we expect them to then prices will fall access will increase and these analysts who have a specialization in technologies will appropriately be generalists on the sectors as they watch these technologies traverse more and more sectors as the costs and prices come down i think that most research departments are not set up like ark s and they don t understand yet they should they are starting to understand we re getting some incoming questions but i think tesla s been a great example auto analysts should not have been following that stock should have been an energy storage analysts robotics software as a service artificial intelligence very importantly not auto analysts we had three analysts on the tesla stock collaborating because of that we understand how powerful how powerfully the convergence between and among technologies is going to play out i need say no more than tesla going from 25 to 1 000 in two and a half years it was a major surprise to some people and it was because they didn t understand the story we feel that is a theme that s going to play out again and again and again in our portfolios tom lydon so there were a lot of people on wall street that were watching you from afar not investing but they re watching and seeing your great returns over many many years and there were a lot of people that did invest who still are loyal investors but we ve seen a lot of volatility with innovation comes volatility so can you address that cathie wood yes the first thing i want to say is volatility is not always a bad word in fact in a bull market volatility is your friend certainly that was the case for us in 2020 the reason it has become a bad word is since the tech and telecom bust we have seen every bear market accompanied by an increase in volatility as measured by the cboe s vix and yet because so many people in the business joined after the tech and telecom bubble they do not remember that we have seen volatility move up in up markets for extended periods of time i think we will go back there again i think 2020 was a glimpse at that we use the volatility to our advantage we know that disruptive innovation is controversial and with controversy can come volatility we believe that our research points us in the right direction so if a stock is down 10 or 20 in the short term because of some earnings result where a company decided to invest more to innovate and was punished we will be buying a stock like that so we use the volatility to our advantage and very often you ll see that trading around volatility adds significant alpha in 2018 when the market was down our trading around tesla alone now granted it was one of the more volatile ones our trading around the volatility of tesla alone added i believe 175 basis points to performance in a down year that had nothing to do with how tesla did that was simply our trading so we do use it i believe we ve used it massively in this last year and the proof will be in the next few years we ll see if this leaning into the negative sentiment and declining prices is going to pay off it has every other time in my career tom lydon so if an advisor who invested their client s money in your etfs or an individual investor bought your etfs succinctly what would you tell them what advice would you give them cathie wood well there s tremendous change on the way we know it we re seeing it in our lives the ground is shifting underneath us it is because of these innovation platforms the most important thing is to get and stay on the right side of change now what does that mean in terms of portfolio construction do you want to go 100 into a strategy like ours well most given the volatility cannot do that i might do that personally and i have a huge majority of my financial wealth in our strategies that s because of the conviction i have in them on a five year basis but just let s take the more risk averse investor if we re right and there s going to be a lot of creative destruction out there there are going to be a lot more ibms and ges again they were never supposed to have failed as spectacularly as they have in terms of their promise if we re right then even the conservative investors need a hedge against that possibility our portfolios are a great hedge and we have a white paper on our site about how adding our portfolio to traditional growth and value portfolios 5 to 10 would have increased returns relative to just the plain vanilla value growth would have increased returns and lowered volatility because the correlation of our returns and you can see it in the last couple of years the correlation of our returns to the traditional benchmarks has been very low last year it was negative the year before it was positive but over time very low correlation of returns we know that most of our clients that are advised by rias have exposure in i think it s below 10 i think most below 5 i certainly would be using this downdraft to increase that allocation because if anything during the last year and it is quite a year for me to be saying this if anything our conviction in how rapidly the world is going to change and how transformative these technologies will be as they converge and feed one another our conviction in that outlook has increased dramatically tom lydon it s great to hear that cathie i know you probably have a lot of people asking you especially younger investors or younger advisors what s some of your best advice when i look back in all those years where i got emotionally involved in volatility in the market and i did the stupid thing at the wrong time i would just overemphasize that the people that i talk to you ve got time that we don t have right now make that work for you what would you add to that cathie wood well and i will harken back to 08 09 how many people do both of us know who just couldn t take it anymore they became very emotional their life was flashing before their eyes they thought they were going to be destitute you conjure up all kinds of fears as downward momentum continues relentlessly day by day they finally can t take it they sell and they regret it for the rest of their lives they think of about it every day the market goes up after that so i would agree with you an emotional response just avoid it it is usually catastrophic to long term performance what is additive and significantly so to performance is averaging down it doesn t feel good maybe as you re doing it but you would be shocked how little it takes if you re consistent and you just keep averaging down tom lydon before i let you go i want to come back to big ideas 2022 i know it s coming out soon anything you could tease out for us could you give us a little peek cathie wood well i think because of the year that we ve had we ve probably packed in a lot more substance you re going to learn a lot more about nfts and the metaverse we think that word is becoming overused now in the continuum of bitcoin defi and nfts we re going to help put that into perspective i think that s probably the question we are getting the most people know that we are all about innovation they want to understand if we really believe in this nft thing and we really believe in it so we ll look forward to sharing all of that with advisors and and with the world tom lydon cathie we re excited to have you as one of our keynote speakers at exchange our in person etf conference in miami beach in april we re really looking forward to seeing you cathie wood oh well thank you i know you just delayed it a couple of months and i think you did exactly the right thing i am really looking forward to being in person with you and all of your clients and my colleagues in april in miami tom lydon i know you ll be there in force cathie thank you thanks for your time today and look forward to seeing you in person cathie wood oh thank you tom thank you so much for giving us this amazing platform for more news information

the ford bronco is so hot that dealers can t keep them on lots more than about seven days right now that stat applies to all broncos regardless of trim so it s understandable that the public is stoked to get their hands on the upcoming bronco raptor the problem is it s still months from being delivered john hennessey and his team have just solved that issue with a 411 horsepower bronco velociraptor that s been fast tracked for sale this ultimate hennessey bronco version was announced last year but we expected a longer wait before production began it turns out that demand was just too big since we announced our plans for the bronco mid last year we ve been inundated with customer requests to take our upgraded version said john hennessey the burly suv still uses the original twin turbo v6 from the regular bronco but boosts output to 411 horsepower and 600 lb ft of torque through the use of aftermarket parts and engine tuning for those keeping track at home that s 81 more ponies and 185 more lb ft of torque than the stock bronco which has 330 horsepower and 415 lb ft of torque related 2022 ford bronco raptor debuts monday jan 24 on sale this summer the tuner will show off the suv in public for the first time during barrett jackson s scottsdale arizona show later this month but you don t have to wait to see it here that s because we ve got a video of john hennessey himself driving it below firstly this thing looks properly quick secondly aside from handling like an suv it might be a perfect daily driver hennessey easily rumbles over dirt and grass and then back onto the pavement at speed like it s no big thing of course that kind of reliable performance is the sort of thing he s built his brand on the bronco velociraptor will be limited to just 200 units and each will come with its own three year or 36 000 mile warranty sure you could wait quite a while more and get a bronco raptor from ford but even if it s anywhere near as powerful it certainly won t be this special hennessey says that you can actually place your order for a bronco velociraptor through your authorized ford dealer too

lots of readers responded to my jan 5 newsletter discussing a new book money magic an economist s secrets to more money less risk and a better life by the boston university economist laurence kotlikoff i ve already responded to many of you by email but nothing beats hearing from kotlikoff himself i presented him with some of your questions and criticisms and he replied here s that exchange larry many readers said that there s no reason for a long term investor to shy away from stocks because they always go up in the long run say over 20 or 30 years your response this statement is wrong there are several 30 year periods over which stocks barely rose in inflation adjusted terms and many 20 year periods in which they outright declined plus we don t have enough independent observations to go on take the two 30 year periods 1915 through 1945 and 1916 through 1946 28 of the annual returns in the two periods are the same so they don t provide new information unfortunately the history is far too short to provide statistical reliability about cumulative returns over independent 30 year holding periods one response is to consider cumulative returns from other countries but as zvi bodie a fellow professor at boston university points out russia china germany and japan have major gaps in their data thanks to wars and revolutions we can t calculate how their stock markets would have fared between say 1915 and 1945 but it surely would have been bad and speaking of japan its nikkei 225 average fell 48 percent in inflation adjusted terms between 1989 and 2020 the research firm morningstar states over longer horizons the chance of losing money in the stock market is substantially reduced that s true but if you do lose it can be disastrous suppose you are blindfolded and have two options stay where you are hold safe bonds or toss a die hold risky stock if you roll 2 through 6 you walk north a block if you roll 1 you walk south a block ten blocks north is a pot of gold ten blocks south is a cliff most of the time you ll get the gold and gloat over taking the gamble but some of the time you ll fall off the cliff with no wall street firm to catch you you describe stocks as exhibiting a random walk but some top finance economists say that after stocks drop they have a tendency to go back up and vice versa regression to the mean there is some weak evidence for that in the data but it can take decades to manifest if there is any chance to make money from regression to the mean professional traders will seize on it before you have a chance in any case because it s weak it doesn t prevent really terrible outcomes wall street s focus is on probability whereas economists focus on outcomes losing everything not matter how low the probability is not something an economist would ever entertain as part of a reasonable financial plan larry one reader wrote this peter you wrote think of investing like driving a car statistically speaking the chance you ll have a serious accident over the next five years is greater than the chance you ll have one over the next five months this is not a great analogy the chance of an accident is not greater over five years than five months because each time you get into your car and drive is an independent event what do you say to this reader yes each trip is an independent event and has the same odds of a major accident but the more times you drive the greater the risk of at least one accident let s say tossing heads is bad the probability of completely avoiding heads is 50 percent on the first toss but only 1 in 1 000 over 10 tosses true the probability of ending up with more money after x years goes up the higher the share of stocks in your portfolio but so does the probability of ending up with less than the purely safe investment this is the dirty little secret of wall street some readers invest in dividend yielding stocks for income preferring those over stocks that don t have dividends but tend to rise in price more is that a sensible strategy yes if you do it right i introduce upside investing in my new book as a safe and simple way for risk averse investors to play the market the idea is to treat all your money now in stocks and all the money you ll add to your stock holdings as if you will lose every penny of it then invest your remaining money in safe assets i e tips treasury inflation protected securities this sets a floor to your living standard until you withdraw money from the stock market you spend only the floor amount this way if your stocks crash and burn before you sell them your living standard won t be impacted as you withdraw from the market invest the proceeds in tips which gives you more safe assets justifying a higher living standard floor taking dividends and safely investing them is an example of upside investing the key thing is never spending out of a pool of funds that isn t fully safe this way your living standard floor will only rise versions of upside investing are considered in risk less and prosper your guide to safer investing by zvi bodie and rachelle taqqu lastly i got some emails from people who said owning a house is a good way to protect yourself from the vicissitudes of the markets is that true and if so why absolutely when you own your home you re protected from rent increases the shelter that the house provides is like an inflation protected annuity you might buy from an insurance company it s not true however that if house prices rise you re better off if you sell your house you still need a place to live and other places will have gotten more expensive if house prices fall where you are but rise where you want to live you ll get hurt the one big advantage though even if you must move is that homes are real assets as such they should maintain their real value during periods like now of high inflation the new york times

article content the produce warehouse in northeast calgary routinely received two or three trucks a day to restock their shelves now when they are attempting to import 80 to 90 per cent of their stock from the u s they are lucky to get one truck every two or three days this has led to shortages in staples their customers have been accustomed to relying on them for like grapes strawberries and citrus when they can get some of those items the price has gone up exponentially grapes that used to be 99 cents a pound are now running 4 99 a pound with the trucks freestone can secure they are focussing on vegetable deliveries and the cost of those trucks has also skyrocketed the average truck out of california pre pandemic cost freestone 6 000 to 7 000 now it s costing them 9 000 to 11 000

content soufan said the issue has spiked since canada put in border crossing regulations on jan 15 it is expected to get worse on saturday when the u s installs similar regulations requiring canadian truckers to be fully vaccinated this is hitting most canadians hard a poll released by angus reid institute on friday showed 57 per cent of canadians were having difficulty feeding their families up

grows on thursday premier jason kenney pleaded with the federal government to extend exemptions for truckers we need to apply these policies with a heavy dose of common sense he said in his press conference common sense tells us we are at the peak of supply chain constraints across north america around the world huge inflation and we can t afford to lose potentially thousands of truckers on our roads bringing groceries up from the u s and who knows maybe rapid test kits as well advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below

number of truckers with 10 2 per cent of the population and 14 per cent of all truck drivers he said about 70 per cent of truckers are vaccinated and while there is some hesitancy which they are trying to address through education one of their biggest stumbling blocks is access truck drivers are sometimes on the road for two weeks at a time and they cannot just pull up to a clinic or pharmacy in a big rig nash said the backlog is already starting to accumulate at the border estimating about 100 loads a day noting the coutts crossing handles about 800 loads a day if we had another 4 000 drivers in alberta that would bring us to the ability to fill the open positions there are now he said it comes to a point where you are so saturated you can throw as much as you want at it but it s not going to get us out of the hole quick enough the industry was struggling to find drivers pre pandemic but the issue has been exacerbated over the last two years with an estimated 1 000 drivers

president and ceo of the alberta chamber of commerce said this is helping to fuel inflation that already hit 30 year highs in december while this impacts all sectors he noted the average food price for restaurants has increased by 8 per cent but this is also going to impact agriculture and our ability to export stock which could in turn cause prices to increase on beef pork and chicken here it all depends on what the packing plants want to do with it if they don t think they can get a good price for it they may in fact hold off on taking the cattle from the producers said kobly according to statscan s consumer price index review released this week the cost of food went up 2 2 per cent overall but jumped considerably on some items like eggs 6 3 per cent bacon 12 5 per cent meat 4 3 per cent seafood 3 4 per cent and fresh fruit 2 6 per cent while dairy was up 2 8 per cent driven by butter at 6 3 per cent sylvain charlebois the senior director of the agri food analytics lab at dalhousie university is forecasting food costs to increase by another seven per cent in 2022 in canada one of the major factors in this early on will be the vaccine passports advertisement 6 story

damage may have already been done stateside with their 125 000 truckers finding different routes to warmer climes omicron has been a gut punch for the food industry and frankly vaccine mandates at the border for truckers has really taken the oxygen the industry needs away from the industry he said soufan is expecting the trucking challenges to continue at least until the spring when they can start
