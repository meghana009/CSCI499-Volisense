standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies rather these measures are provided as additional information to complement those ifrs measures and ratios by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management s perspective accordingly they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under ifrs 15 table of contents we present the following non ifrs financial measures a adjusted selling general and administration

incur indebtedness without the effect of non cash charges such as depreciation amortization finance costs non cash compensation expense loss on disposal of property and equipment impairment of property and equipment and right of use assets stock based compensation and certain non recurring expenses this measure also functions as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance we also present the non ifrs ratio adjusted net loss income per common share for purposes of evaluating underlying business performance relative to our performance based on our results under ifrs while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period the use of non ifrs financial measures and ratios provide complementary information that exclude items that do not reflect our core performance or where their exclusion would assist users in understanding our results for the period for these reasons a significant number of users of the md a analyze our results based on these financial measures management believes these measures help users of md a to better analyze results enabling better comparability of our results from one period to another and with peers management believes that these non ifrs financial measures and ratios in addition to ifrs measures and ratios provide users of our financial reports with enhanced understanding of our results and related trends and increases the transparency and clarity of the core results of our business we believe that although these non ifrs financial measures provide investors with useful information with respect to our historical operations and are frequently used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of companies they have limitations as an analytical tool some of these limitations are adjusted selling general and administration expenses adjusted results from operating activities adjusted net loss income and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted selling general and administration expenses adjusted results from operating activities adjusted net loss income and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the cash requirements necessary to fund capital expenditures and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements because of these limitations these non ifrs financial measures should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations the following tables provide reconciliations of our non ifrs financial

the united states remains a country of tenacious faith the nature of that faith stretches from the digital pulpits of silicon valley where cool technology occupies the seat of majesty to the hot bible belt of spiritual endurance and suffering where the good lord holds sway in stern disapproval in between market fundamentalists take time to worship the invisible hand of business and capitalism the symptoms of that faith can be extraordinary almost to the point of caustic neuroses faith in the sanctity of guns permits a form of tolerable urban warfare a type of assimilated frontier violence characterised by high death tolls for all the rage and mourning that takes place after each massacre be it in school or in places of worship the slain are merely the tax paid for exercising a constitutional liberty as with all freedoms exercising them comes at a cost as a sacred totem the gun like ancient god figures drawn from verdant groves and sun bleached deserts is an idol to be replicated in displays shows and performances any chinks in this system of idolatry are put down to the nature of the worshipper weak of character questionable of principle the uvalde shooter was in keeping with this view a mental basket case detached isolated estranged he was lobotomised by the cruel workings of social media an outcast a social vegetable a suburban family with 50 assault weapons salivating over their next purchase is by contrast sanely functional good citizens going about their business under the double blessing of the second amendment and the marketplace advertisement texas senator ted cruz s understanding of this issue is typical and unblemished by complexity in the language of a sweetly crafted and predictable fairy tale cruz sees a morality tale in the business of owning guns to the 19 children and two adults who perished at robb elementary school he had this response what stops bad guys is armed good guys garden gnome psychology is never far from such reasoning we know that many of those who commit the most heinous crimes they re isolated from human contact cruz told members of the national rifle association in an address last month they re living a virtual life in the absence of community and faith and love addressing the medical pathological aspect to de psycho as it were the field of ownership is seen as one answer from the pro gun fraternity the other is counter intuitive and in its way truly a matter of faith to solve the gun problem more weapons not fewer are needed spread the fetish proliferate the means of mass lethality as certain theorists of security and international relations regard the issue of addressing nuclear weapons the more countries have them the more secure the world will be terror binds us terror deters us if you cannot abolish weapons then partake of its fruits in such mind numbing logic schools can solve shootings by flooding the administrative system with guns arming teachers militarising the spaces and places of learning in a 2021 pew research poll 43 of those surveyed favoured allowing k 12 teachers and school officials to carry guns of the percentage 66 of them were republicans 24 democrats 63 of gun owners supported the measure 33 of non gun owners did not in response to uvalde senator cruz texas attorney general ken paxton and lt gov dan patrick are stirring their base their suggestions of arming schools are of uneven quality childish and resoundingly doltish but they point to a central understanding of acceptable carnage and military permissiveness attorney general paxton has been true over the years to the view that a citizenry armed to the teeth even when going about mundane tasks is a safe one in december 2017 he issued an opinion claiming that licensed handgun owners could legally carry loaded weapons into texas churches with no posted signs banning them as for what could have been done in uvalde the theme is familiar the key was to make it more difficult for people even to get in that point of entry by having teachers and other administrators who have gone through training and who are armed advertisement such a measure paxton argued was to be encouraged as law enforcement authorities tended to be late on the scene failing to prevent the shooting the reality is he explained to fox news we don t have the resources to have law enforcement at every school patrick s statement of june 3 could just as well apply to a discussion about violent insurgencies us foreign policy has tended to foment over the years if every member of law enforcement across the state approximately 80 000 officers had a bulletproof shield in their vehicle their ability to respond to an active shooter situation would be greatly enhanced does he envisage police driving into the active shooter in class he notes that more training is needed but the urgency of having measures in place before the start of the new school year to better equip our police who respond to these attacks was paramount as with any planning for a military campaign having the appropriate material in stock might be a problem there could be a supply chain issue at present but we should try to buy every quality shield we can find and order the rest so we are at the front line when more become available not that these matters solve the problem to equate armed teachers with safety is a false equation the uvalde shooter could still go about his business even in the face of a heavily armed response unit the good guys seemed rather ineffectual to stop the bad guy at uvalde the national education association president becky pringle s statement in response to shootings could only seem peculiar in an environment of gun fetishists bringing more guns into schools makes schools more dangerous and does nothing to shield our students and educators from gun violence dispirited about such responses daniel siegel a 23 year old middle school teacher from houston suggested something disturbingly radical give schools more resources not in terms of weapons and defences but on matters of learning and the nurturing of students emotional wellbeing sadly that horse saddled by the second amendment bolted some time ago
washington u s senate minority leader mitch mcconnell on tuesday said he is comfortable with the bipartisan deal senate democrats and republicans struck on gun control legislation signaling that he will join in passing a bill when it comes to a vote for myself i m comfortable with the framework the kentucky republican said during a press conference and if the legislation ends up reflecting what the framework indicates i ll be supportive the push for gun legislation follows the second deadliest school shooting in a decade in which 19 children and two teachers were murdered in uvalde texas on may 24 it followed another mass shooting in buffalo new york on may 14 where a white supremacist targeted a black neighborhood and killed 10 black people at a grocery store a bipartisan group of 20 senators including 10 republicans the number needed to advance a bill past a filibuster announced a framework early sunday and are quickly moving to draft the bill s specific wording or text the lead democrat on the framework sen chris murphy of connecticut said a component of the bill would be an expansion of mental health with somewhere in the billions for funding but he did not give more details on how much money will be provided for those services given the opportunity to spend billions of dollars fixing our mental health system we would be foolish not to take up that opportunity he told reporters tuesday we certainly haven t announced any numbers we re still working on that senate majority leader chuck schumer a new york democrat said on the senate floor that once there is legislative text for the bill he will quickly call a vote aiming for passage before the july 4 recess the bipartisan framework is far from perfect but if passed it will unquestionably save lives and would be the most significant action on guns that the senate has taken in nearly three decades senate majority leader chuck schumer the bipartisan framework is far from perfect but if passed it will unquestionably save lives and would be the most significant action on guns that the senate has taken in nearly three decades he said this is the best chance we ve had in years to finally tell the american people that yes after the horrifying tragedies of uvalde and buffalo this time this time will be different the framework would provide funding to states to establish red flag laws which allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is distressed and poses a harm to either themselves or someone else it would also close the boyfriend gun purchase loophole by requiring convicted domestic violence abusers and those subject to domestic violence restraining orders be included in background checks including those who have or have had a continuing relationship of a romantic or intimate nature it would also allocate funding for school resources such as mental health and violence prevention programs and require gun buyers under 21 to undergo a background check that includes a review of juvenile and mental health records access to juvenile records sen roy blunt a missouri republican who is part of the bipartisan coalition said that an important component of the bill is having access to juvenile records if someone under 21 wants to purchase an assault weapon democrats tried to raise the age of purchasing an assault weapon the type of firearm used in most mass shootings from 18 to 21 but the provision was stripped out during negotiations the legal age to buy a handgun is 21 the person in uvalde who on his 18th birthday underwent a background check to buy a gun and since you have no earlier records from 18 available it s like that person was born that day blunt said at a press conference blunt said the group is hoping to have the bill text written by the end of this week or next house package the democratic controlled house passed its own gun control package last week but it has little chance of being brought to the senate floor for a vote that collection of earlier bills raises the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21 creates new requirements for storing guns in a home with children prevents gun trafficking requires all firearms to be traceable and closes the loophole on bump stocks devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons among other things the white house and democratic leaders signaled their support for the senate framework on monday and all pushed for more to be done the last time congress passed major gun control legislation was in 1994 when former president bill clinton signed into law a ban on assault rifles but it was temporary and ended in 2004 the senate democrats and one independent in the bipartisan group along with murphy are kyrsten sinema of arizona richard blumenthal of connecticut cory booker of new jersey chris coons of delaware martin heinrich of new mexico mark kelly of arizona angus king of maine joe manchin of west virginia and debbie stabenow of michigan the 10 senate republicans in the bipartisan group including blunt are john cornyn of texas thom tillis of north carolina richard burr of north carolina bill cassidy of louisiana susan collins of maine lindsey graham of south carolina rob portman of ohio mitt romney of utah and pat toomey of pennsylvania gun rights groups the national rifle association issued a statement following the announcement of the bipartisan agreement saying that the organization would not comment on the framework we will make our position known when the full text of the bill is available for review nra wrote in a statement the nra will continue to oppose any effort to insert gun control policies initiatives that override constitutional due process protections and efforts to deprive law abiding citizens of their fundamental right to protect themselves and their loved ones into this or any other legislation but another large gun rights group the gun owners of america has already come out opposing the framework and is pressuring senators to oppose the deal there is absolutely no compromise acceptable to gun owners of america the organization wrote in a statement these are our rights and we shouldn t surrender an inch of them to anyone
investor confidence when it comes to global growth just fell to its lowest point in almost 30 years according to the latest fund manager survey by bank of america 73 percent of managers are pessimistic about global growth the highest since the survey began in 1994 the fear of stagflation that is a combination of recession and inflation rose to the highest level since 2008 with 83 percent of fund managers saying that stagflation will be the most likely economic backdrop for the next 12 months more than half of asset owners have already been preparing for stagflation institutional investor previously reported bank of america based the results on a survey of 300 fund managers with 834 billion in total assets under management the survey was conducted between june 3 and june 10 the bleak investment outlook coincides with the s p 500 s official drop into bear market territory on monday the popular benchmark plunged nearly 4 percent marking a 20 percent drop from the recent high in january according to boa it is the twentieth bear market in the past 140 years a natural response to the market downturn is to deploy a more defensive investment strategy according to the survey 44 percent of fund managers are encouraging companies to play it safe by strengthening their balance sheets instead of expanding capital expenditures or buying back shares up from 41 percent in january 2021 the thought of course is that companies in good financial health are expected to withstand macroeconomic shocks better than those without a hawkish central bank also plays an important role in the surveyed managers investment outlook according to boa 79 percent of fund managers expect higher short term rates although historical data suggests that rate hikes are unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock market contractionary monetary policies have become the top concern for fund managers with 32 percent saying it s the biggest tail risk david kelly chief global strategist and head of the global market insights strategy team at j p morgan asset management even wrote in a note this week that there is 50 percent of chance that the fed will raise rates by 75 basis points instead of the current consensus of 50 basis points at the upcoming fed meeting but the investment landscape for the rest of the year isn t completely bleak according to boa the silver lining might come in mid october history is no guide to future performance but if it were today s bear market would end on october 19 2022 with the s p 500 at 3000 the survey said part of that has to do with investors belief in the fed s ability to curb inflation according to boa more investors than at any time since the global financial crisis expect the global consumer confidence index to come down next year

africa s bigger worry is western bondholders study finds an article in the south china morning post see below is yet another refutation of the baseless debt trap diplomacy western propaganda accuses china of deliberately driving african nations into debt in order to seize their assets upon default on their loans these charges have been disproved again and again including by the china africa research institute cari johns hopkins university washington dc not to overlooked not one african asset or project involving china has been seized contrary to the debt trap narrative if a wave of african defaults materializes in the near future as ifi officials have been fearing since at least 2015 it will be catalyzed more by private sector maneuvering and intransigence than by chinese scheming the study said these false allegations against china and its belt and road initiative have been repeated without a scintilla of evidence by leaders of western governments including several u s presidents members of congress and state department officials the motivation for the mindless repetition of what is a blatant falsehood is the perverted geopolitical doctrine the followers of this geopolitical mindset insist that for the u s led west to maintain their supremacy in the world they must suppress and weaken other superpowers to prevent them from challenging the u s west hegemonic status sadly from the ideology of western geopolitics the african continent is seen as a mere chess board with african nations as mere chess pieces to counter china s emergence to china s credit they have collaborated with african nations to build vitally necessary infrastructure while for the last fifty years the west has refused to make these long term investments as i have documented on this website for years africa s infrastructure is so huge that the demand for capital investment cannot be satisfied by one nation alone there is a harmony of interest for the u s and china to cooperate with african nations to eliminate poverty and hunger which i know can be done within one generation let us jettison the relic of geopolitics and adopt a mission that is in the shared common interest of humankind africa s bigger worry is western bondholders study finds chinese debt traps in africa the bigger worry is bondholders study finds china is the continent s biggest bilateral creditor but most of the debt is due to private western holders of african debt according to a new report private sector manoeuvring rather than chinese scheming more likely to induce a wave of defaults researchers say jevans nyabiage june 6 2022 the rise in african debt due to chinese lending pales in comparison with the debt burden created by private creditors in the last decade according to a new report taking aim at accusations that beijing engages in debt trap diplomacy on the continent the study by harry verhoeven from the centre on global energy policy at columbia university and nicolas lippolis from the department of politics and international relations at the university of oxford says the debt trap narrative is a function of china us strategic and ideological rivalry rather than a reflection of african realities or perspectives what keeps african leaders awake at night is not chinese debt traps it is the whims of the bond market the report says debt trap diplomacy involves extending loans to countries and taking control of key assets if the debtor defaults on repayments while china is the continent s biggest bilateral creditor most of the debt is due to private western holders of african debt according to the researchers capital in the form of debt repayments thus continued to flow from africa to europe and north america the study said verhoeven said the percentage of african debt owed to china was less compared to that borrowed from private creditors is not the most rapidly growing segment of debt other credit lines have grown a lot more in recent years especially those towards commercial creditors said verhoeven co author of the report politics by default china and the global governance of african debt these are bondholders people from london frankfurt and new york who are buying african debt that segment in the last couple of years has grown much faster than any liabilities that african states owe other creditors the report cited confidential estimates of international financial institutions ifis that showed sub saharan africa s government debts to chinese entities at the end of 2019 totaled around us 78 billion this was about 8 per cent of the region s total debt of us 954 billion and 18 per cent of africa s external debt

video embed beaver pennsylvania to say dr mehmet oz s eyes lit up when he walked into grandpa joe s candy store a whimsical old fashioned candy store filled with nostalgia and a lot of sugary treats and saw a large colorful display filled with his favorite confection pez would be an understatement img_4006 1 jpghe picked out four different pez containers for his grandchildren and one for himself and then went for several packets of refills those are for the grandkids parents and myself you always have to have refills especially on long road trips he said with a broad smile immediately the customers as well as the manager found themselves impressed that the montgomery county republican and celebrity heart surgeon decided to make their hometown located along the confluence of the beaver and ohio rivers one of his first stops as he begins his general election campaign in fact there were very few businesses along third street that oz didn t wander into unannounced monday afternoon the republican nominee for senate said this granular approach was the best way for him not just to get to know the residents and small business owners but also to listen to what their main concerns are heading into this november s midterm elections the low key event marked the beginning of his general election granular strategy to keep the seat in republican hands a victory that would help assure the party that it would gain the majority in the upper chamber in november despite a two week lull that kept the campaign from starting in earnest he was in a near tie with primary rival david mccormick that led to an automatic recount oz still has a mobility advantage over democrat john fetterman who is homebound after suffering a stroke followed by heart surgery the fetterman campaign said the democrat won t be joining the campaign trail until sometime in july oz said the first thing he learned on his walking tour occurred when the owner of a beaver store told him baby formula isn t the only thing not on his store shelves tampons there is a tampon shortage the owner of the store said adding that he was told by the distributors they are out of stock and that he will be the last on the list to get any as they go to the bigger chains first when and if they get them like the beginning of the baby formula shortage the tampon shortage has gone largely underreported in this country despite often putting an additional strain on women across the country its origins are based in high fuel costs a lack of raw materials and a supply chain on the brink of collapse oz said it was just another additional burden on main street america that goes unaddressed by the biden administration and has its roots in the government spending too much money which has led to inflation which has impacted so many things in people s everyday lives oz said he s already out of stock he said of the grocery store s empty feminine hygiene aisle they told him it will be temporary what do you mean temporary what are women supposed to do in the meantime oz made stops in suburban pittsburgh talked with farmers and small business owners in erie plans to spend time in cambria and blair counties wednesday and he is then off to lancaster scranton and the collar counties around philadelphia to finish off the week by father s day on sunday oz said his campaign to earn voters trust can t just be about being against democrats or against biden or fetterman voters want aspiration and ideas they want you to show you can take them somewhere better that you understand what is impacting them that is why i am here he said the cleveland native said he also knows that after his bitter battle with mccormick bringing the party together is critical which is why he said he did not showboat until the race was called and was grateful mccormick didn t either image0 jpeg i ve talked to dave twice now he s very gracious and i appreciate that on his part i know that wasn t easy to do when you are locked in a race that close but he did it right and i applaud him for that oz said unlike kathy barnette the insurgent candidate who petered out in the final days and who said she would not support whomever the nominee would be if it wasn t her mccormick said he would do everything he could to help oz in his effort to win the seat the most common concerns oz received during his hourslong walk along third street were the price of gas how inflation was impacting people s budget and bottom line and rising crime in the lingering aftermath of the democrats defund the police movement that never went away several people such as judy cashdollar of beaver and the fantone family of industry switched their lifelong democrat affiliation to republican to vote for oz in the primary last month his response to them was thank you i need you to talk to your friends democrats or independents and tell them why this race is so important i need their support to win in november and i think my ideas and platform are much better for their lives than fetterman s

the federal reserve on june 15 2022 lifted interest rates by 0 75 percentage point the third hike this year and the largest since 1994 the move is aimed at countering the fastest pace of inflation in over 40 years wall street had been expecting a half point increase but the latest consumer prices report released on june 10 prompted the fed to take a more drastic measure the big risk however is that higher rates will push the economy into a recession a fear aptly expressed by the recent plunge in the s p 500 stock index which is down over 20 from its peak in january making it a bear market what does this all mean we asked brian blank a finance scholar who studies how businesses adapt and handle economic downturns to explain what the fed is trying to do whether it can succeed and what it means for you 1 what is the fed doing and why the federal open market committee the fed s policymaking arm had been pondering how much and how quickly to raise its benchmark interest rate over the coming months to fight inflation the stakes for the u s economy consumers and businesses are very high only a week ago the fed had been expected to raise rates by 0 5 percentage point at the latest meeting but markets and wall street economists began to expect the larger 0 75 point hike after the may consumer price data suggested inflation has been unexpectedly stubborn some wall street analysts even argued a 1 percentage point hike was possible the prospect of a faster pace of rate hikes due to inflation has prompted financial markets to plunge by over 6 since the june 10 report investors worry the fed may slow the economy too much in its fight to reduce inflation which if left unchecked also poses serious problems for consumers and companies a recent poll found that inflation is the biggest problem americans believe the u s is facing right now 2 what is the fed trying to achieve the federal reserve has a dual mandate to maximize employment while keeping prices stable often policymakers must prioritize one or the other when the economy is weak inflation is usually subdued and the fed can focus on keeping rates down to stimulate investment and boost employment when the economy is strong unemployment is typically quite low and that allows the fed to focus on controlling inflation to do this the fed sets short term interest rates which in turn help it influence long term rates for example when the fed lifts its target short term rate that increases borrowing costs for banks which in turn pass those higher costs on to consumers and businesses in the form of higher rates on long term loans for houses and cars at the moment the economy is quite strong unemployment is low and the fed is able to focus primarily on reducing inflation the problem is inflation is so high at an annualized rate of 8 6 that bringing it down may require the highest interest rates in decades which could weaken the economy substantially and so the fed is trying to execute a so called soft landing 3 what s a soft landing and is it likely a soft landing refers to the way that the fed is attempting to slow inflation and therefore economic growth without causing a recession in order to stabilize prices while not hurting employment the fed expects to increase interest rates very rapidly in the coming months including the latest rate hike the fed has already lifted rates by 1 5 percentage points this year putting its benchmark interest rate at a range of 1 5 to 1 75 historically when the fed has had to raise rates quickly economic downturns have been difficult to avoid can it manage a soft landing this time fed chair jerome powell has insisted that the central bank s policy tools have become more effective since its last inflation fight in the 1980s making it possible this time to stick the landing many economists and other observers remain uncertain and a recent survey of economists notes that many anticipate a recession beginning next year that said the economy is still relatively strong and i d say the the odds of a recession beginning next year are still probably close to a coin flip 4 is there any way to tell what the fed might do next each time the federal open market committee meets it seeks to communicate what it plans to do in the future to help financial markets know what to expect so they aren t taken by surprise one piece of guidance about the future that the committee provides is a series of dots with each point representing a particular member s expectation for interest rates at different points in time this dot plot previously indicated that the fed will raise interest rates to 2 by the end of the year and close to 3 by the end of 2023 the latest inflation news is forcing it to change its tune the dot plot now suggests the fed expects rates to near 3 5 by december implying several large rate hikes are still in store this year and almost 4 in 2023 before falling again in 2024 long term interest rates such as u s treasury yields and mortgage rates already reflect these rapid changes some investors however think the fed may have to move even faster and are forecasting rates approaching 4 by the end of 2022 5 what does this mean for consumers and the economy interest rates represent the cost of borrowing so when the fed raises the target rate money becomes more expensive to borrow first banks pay more to borrow money but then they charge individuals and businesses more interest as well which is why mortgage rates rise accordingly this is one reason mortgage payments have been rising so rapidly in 2022 even as housing markets and prices start to slow down when interest rates are higher fewer people can afford homes and fewer businesses can afford to invest in a new factory and hire more workers as a result higher interest rates can slow down the growth rate of the economy overall while also curbing inflation and this isn t an issue affecting just americans higher interest rates in the u s can have similar impacts on the global economy whether by driving up their borrowing costs or increasing the value of the dollar which makes it more expensive to purchase u s goods but what it ultimately means for consumers and everyone else will depend on whether the pace of inflation slows as much and as quickly as the fed has been forecasting this article was updated to include results of fomc interest rates announcement

lt gen prakash katoch when us secretary of defence lloyd austin visited india in march 2021 all he had to say about the chinese invasion in eastern ladakh april may 2020 was a quip to the media saying we never knew india and china were so close to war this was despite the india us intelligence sharing arrangement not only did china move two motorized divisions to eastern ladakh the pla had constructed a new road leading up to five kilometer short of galwan the least that the us could have done was to warn india of movement of the pla formations but it chose to keep quiet speaking at the shangri la dialogue in singapore on june 11 2022 austin said china is taking aggressive and illegal approaches to the territories it claims in the south china sea and advancing its illegal maritime plans further to the west we see beijing continuing to harden the position along the borders it shares with india he said some other highlights of his talk included the indo pacific is america s center of strategic gravity quad aukus climate resilience efforts with asean america s close partnership with pacific islands are new opportunities for cooperation other than nuclear powered submarines aukus will progress emerging technologies from ai to hypersonic russia s assault on ukraine has galvanized the world and rules based international order matters america believes india s growing military and technological capability can be a stabilizing force in the region australia india and japan have been holding security dialogues on maritime cooperation since 2015 japan and the philippines launched a new 2 2 dialogue and so have australia and india america stands by friends especially important with china adopting war coercive and aggressive approach austin talked about aggressive chinese moves in the region american support for the one china policy multiple exercises by us and allies in the region and us resolve to deter aggression the question and answer session post austin s address witnessed bonnie glaser us questioning deterrent steps required if china attempts to seize taiwan with president biden said he would defend taiwan if attacked austin gave a roundabout answer saying unilateral change to the status quo would be unwelcome and ill advised he then said america remains committed to the one china policy but would provide taiwan with military means to defend itself jeffrey urdiniao philippines said china built artificial islands and militarized them stationing bombers and fighters in south china sea despite frequent us warnings of consequences so what will be different in the biden administration s approach because the current policy is not working or changing the behavior of china austin s fuddled response was some of the consequences that allies and partners grow closer together and work together in a more deliberate way to protect their interest and their territory on waters like minded countries bond together to create new capabilities much more united region focused so much more on a free and open indo pacific lin kook singapore referring japanese prime minister kishida cautioning that ukraine today may be east asia tomorrow said complacency should be avoided because china is like russia and will act like it austin s response was centred around a powerful global response to the ukraine conflict and international rule based order from the above a number of issues merit closer scrutiny foremost is reiteration of rule based international order by austin and us officials is a joke considering america s blackest of black history running rogue over decades and centuries besides calling the indo pacific america s centre of gravity is fine but what is the response to chinese aggressive moves and the us supporting the one china policy coalitions and more coalitions while sitting on the fence to promote american interests and let nations fend for themselves why the dither to add south korea to the quad which appears willing scared of beijing chinese defence minister wei fenghe has accused washington of trying to hijack asia pacific countries under the garb of multilateralism turning them against china he says china will not flinch from war if taiwan takes a decisive step towards independence obviously america will fight china in the same manner it is fighting russia today using ukraine as its proxy what is meant by america stands by its friends selling arms like to ukraine if the us considers india as the stabilizing force in the region why doesn t it support one india rather than random comments about pla activities across the line of control austin s emphasis on emerging technologies is interesting china just launched the world s first artificial intelligence operated drone carrier on december 4 2021 general david thompson deputy commander of the us space force for space operations said china is developing its space capabilities twice as fast as the us beijing is capable of surpassing the us in space capabilities by the end of the decade a recent article in the wall street journal says proliferation of pla bases is being matched with an ever growing chinese navy the us is heading in the opposite direction with 297 ships and plans to fall to 280 by 2027 china has 355 and is headed to 460 by 2030 beijing relies on smaller vessels but it will soon launch an advanced aircraft carrier that will let it project air power abroad american policy in the indo pacific remains more rhetorical while china has merrily gone about its business recently signing economic and security deals with solomon islands and samoa and discovery of a chinese base coming up in cambodia much before the us started bandying about the centrality of asean in the indo pacific china had hijacked cambodia and laos to break the cohesion of asean in the west america continues to expand coalitions and partnerships the european commission president ursula von der leyen referred to as the nazi babe by some has assured ukraine s comedian president volodymyr zelenskyy that decision on ukraine s admission to the eu will be taken within a week this will help joe biden tell the eu to pay for ukraine s reconstruction much like donald trump said nato must pay more biden s aim is for the ukraine conflict to reduce russian military capability to the extent it cannot be a threat to any country even as russia is going about achieving its aims notwithstanding the long range weapons supplied by the us and britain henry kissinger recently wrote an op ed in the sunday times saying it will be necessary to find a place for ukraine and also for russia if we do not want russia to become china s outpost in europe but the us appears busy in deflecting biden s demonstrated dementia with propaganda that vladimir putin is suffering from cancer and xi jinping is afflicted with cerebral aneurysm washington is ecstatic over the us arms industry raking in billions and calculating how much america will earn from reconstruction of ukraine but biden s ukraine policy is in shambles american scholars diplomats and former military and intelligence officials have been pointing out the foolishness now general david richards britain s former chief of defence staff says western coalition has no strategy at all regarding the conflict in ukraine and future relations with russia nato countries are making tactical mistakes without any consideration to long term consequences there is no coordination between western allies neither washington nor london are considering how they will build relations with moscow after ukrainian conflict ends thus pushing moscow towards a strategic partnership with china the ukraine bungle after the rout from afghanistan has lowered credibility of the biden administration further the country has become a laughing stock with trump being accused of attacking capitol hill and biden causing energy and food shortages worldwide with poorer countries being the worst hit and record high inflation in the west by forging stronger china russia bonds washington is scripting its own doom

but despite the president s pronouncements data from the federal reserve shows that household debt has increased by over 1 5trillion since biden took office in january 2021 and the country s credit card debt is at record highs as well after jumping nearly 20 during the month of april to 1 103 trillion the previous pre pandemic record was 1 1 trillion americans savings accounts have also shrunk by more than 9 000 over the past year from 73 100 in 2021 to 62 086 in 2022 according to a survey from wealth management company northwestern mutual the country s current economic outlook is largely due to inflation which is at a more than 40 year high this has caused voters to sour on the economy despite a mixed recovery after 2020 s pandemic induced downturn that has led to robust hiring and a healthy 3 6 percent unemployment rate the president on tuesday tried to remind his audience of the food lines and layoffs during the coronavirus pandemic that preceded his presidency contrasting that with the improvements in household balance sheets under his watch he also took aim at widespread lies about reckless spending an apparent reference to the many critics of his covid stimulus package which most experts believe at least partially fueled rising inflation household debt has increased by over 1 5trillion since biden took office in january 2021 inflation is at a more than 40 year high which has caused voters to sour on the economy despite a mixed recovery after 2020 s pandemic induced downturn that has led to robust hiring and a healthy 3 6 percent unemployment rate president joe biden told the largest federation of labor unions on tuesday that he s working to rebuild the u s economy around workers but stretched the truth when he talked about the federal debt and how much families have been spending even some democrats who align with biden politically have suggested that government spending has been a problem for middle class families economist and former obama administration official larry summers predicted as much back in february 2021 there is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to world war ii levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability he wrote in an op ed for the washington post this will be manageable if monetary and fiscal policy can be rapidly adjusted to address the problem but given the commitments the fed has made administration officials dismissal of even the possibility of inflation and the difficulties in mobilizing congressional support for tax increases or spending cuts there is the risk of inflation expectations rising sharply economist ellen gaske of pgim fixed income said that this was exactly the mistake the biden administration made in retrospect it was more than what was needed gaske told the associated press it was not just the size of the relief packages but those direct cash payments to households added purchasing power very directly and when you pushed that up agai biden however counters those claims by asserting that social spending has reduced the deficit by 350billion and will cut the deficit by up to 1 6trillion by the end of 2022 the president continued to rail against his critics regarding spending during his tuesday speech i don t want to hear any more of these lies about reckless spending we re changing people s lives and because of the fact this year we re delivering the biggest drop in the deficit in the history of the united states of america but even though the economy has quickly amassed jobs high inflation has left many workers feeling worse off as wages have not kept up with the costs of living the labor department said friday that average hourly earnings after adjusting for inflation have fallen 3 percent over the past year inflation has left biden and democrats control of the house and senate vulnerable in the upcoming midterm elections biden claims that social spending has reduced the deficit by 350billion and will cut the deficit by 1 6trillion by the end of 2022 the price of a gallon of gasoline in the united states continues to skyrocket under biden s watch prices of everything from gas to travel to hotels have gone up by double digtis since january 2021 republican lawmakers have blamed the president s 1 9trillion coronavirus relief package for causing inflation to start rising last year gop lawmakers also say the biden administration has been too restrictive on domestic oil production working families budgets took a back seat to the far left s wish list senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky said in a monday speech biden says the gop is focused on cutting taxes for companies and the wealthy republicans argue that their 2017 tax overhaul created a firmer base for growth by reducing corporate tax rates making u s companies more competitive republican lawmakers have blamed the president s 1 9trillion coronavirus relief package for causing inflation to start rising last year they say enabling companies and individuals to hold on to more of what they earn will boost growth while biden counters that laws enabling unionization and boosting child care benefits for families will lead to growth through a stronger middle class biden has tried to take specific aim at a proposal by sen rick scott r fla that suggests all americans should owe federal income taxes many republican lawmakers have either disowned the proposal or offered caveats since tax credits are a means of financial support for poorer and middle class u s families republicans have it all backwards their plan literally calls for increasing taxes on middle class and working people and cutting taxes on corporations and wealthy americans biden said i believe in bipartisanship but i have no illusions about this republican party the maga party the three main stock exchanges in the united states all plummeted on monday with the s p 500 officially entering bear market territory amid deepening concern that the country could soon be entering a recession the s p 500 sank 3 9 bringing it more than 20 below the record high it set in january and erasing all of the market gains experienced since president joe biden entered office in january 2021 the dow jones index sank a stunning 900 points on monday as well republicans have it all backwards their plan literally calls for increasing taxes on middle class and working people and cutting taxes on corporations and wealthy americans biden said i believe in bipartisanship but i have no illusions about this republican party the maga party the president also focused on a longtime priority during his tuesday speech boosting union membership but he faces an uphill battle to restore the labor movement which has declined for decades as it became harder to organize workers and many factory jobs moved away from communities with a history of unionization only 10 3 percent of u s workers belonged to a union last year down from 20 1 percent in 1983 according to the bureau of labor statistics the nature of who belongs to unions has also changed over time as nearly half of union members work for the government just 7 7 percent of manufacturing workers and 12 6 percent of construction workers hold a union card as the movement s blue collar roots have diversified into white collar professions despite the decline in unionization the movement still generates value government figures show that the median unionized worker earns about 10 000 more annually than a worker without a union we should encourage unions biden said i m not just saying that to be pro union i m saying it because i m pro american
at that point when a slave finally succumbed and wholeheartedly chose to serve the enslaver in ways that even endangered the lives of the co enslaved it was out of extreme debasement on the one hand and an engrained sense of inferiority complex on the other it was not resignation to the fact that the enslaver was too powerful to be overthrown it was a painful affirmation that the enslaver was racially superior and thus needing to be served thus compradors in colonial africa and uncle toms in north america but while uncle toms in north america would be pitied and sympathised with our compradors in colonial africa were laughing stocks compradors were traitors spineless individuals and cowards of the highest degree how would you turn around and serve the killer of your kindred and looter of your resources we asked but somehow compradors managed a brave face including as ngugi wa thiong o has narrated priding in the fact that they were sleeping with the boss white wife and that this was an issue of personal advancement ever wondered why it is so easy for a white person to see president museveni on short notice and extremely difficult for people such as his ministers ever wondered why museveni trusts white people recently evidenced by the pinetti lubowa hospital pinetti coffee deal gold trade banking vaccines more than he trusts africans it is surely not that white people have always delivered quality work and africans disappointed even timothy kalyegira would agree that white people have actually cost uganda or africa more money than we could ever accurately count they have taken billions of dollars out of uganda under these colonial comprador relationships so they are thieves but why would museveni trust the white frail looking thick bearded professor from the united states prof sarfaraz niazi to manufacture him a vaccine for covid 19 despite having nothing to show for his potential and not whole heartedly support our own prof patrick ogwang of the covidex cure truth is if prof ogwang was white and demonstrated thoroughness as his small facility continues to do he would have received a government guarantee of billions of shillings for investment and a free huge piece of land and much more it would be the same with dr david ssenfuka whose cancer and diabetes cures have been useful to many of museveni s close friends and associates but why are these men left to vend for themselves despite their well documented breakthroughs there are many reasons of course but most outstandingly they are not white it is not simply about museveni s insecurity with having to keep power in hostile buganda thus aligning with white people buganda being the centre of political and economic activity for the country which is undoubtedly a big part of the problem but at a personal level one realises that the fire breathing and undoubtedly ruthless museveni still struggles with whiteness he suffers an acute sense of inferiority complex the fear to stand up to white capitalists which has instead turned him into an obsequious servant of whiteness is born not just out of the obsession to keep power but also an acute self engrained inferiority look in what many are quick to term as tomfoolery from reading much western spin president amin stood his ground against whiteness turned the racial cards upside down and liberated nationals from the backwaters of the economy eight years were just enough to propel ugandans to some degree of self conviction and self worth the state stood on their side and privileged them many native writers and businessmen have attested to this fact again it is easy to say that museveni actually exploits white people by using them as fronts but as we know and for sure he too knows white people have the lion s share in the many deals he has entered with them this then turns bwana museveni into a servant of whiteness receiving crumbs from what is rightly his why hand over coffee to a pinetti or gold to some obscure white people for just a cut a small cut but this is not to begrudge president museveni for personally failing to decolonise his mind rather that he has infected the entire country with this inferiority over the last 30 years ugandans sense of self worth and confidence has run down the drain we are rendered unable to do anything the museveni government is ready to assign anything to anyone as long as they are white it should be heart breaking that all those natives in museveni s circle who appear rich and double as motivational speakers put any name here are simply agents of white folks they own no capital to put this in perspective 700 youthful ugandans leave the country daily for enslavement in the middle east chinese can destroy lake victoria through sand mining without looking over their shoulders indian sugarcane planters are happy to destroy an entire ecosystem because the president is their servant and can also kick natives out of their properties without thinking twice about it and our supposedly wealthy tycoons have turned to fraud and non repayment of their loan obligations the fruits of 30 years and counting of a president with an acute sense of inferiority complex yusufkajura gmail com the author is a political theorist based at makerere university

7187 46 18 35 0 25 dax30 13304 39 122 64 0 91 by greg peel oh the pain it was actually quite a good session on the asx yesterday if you don t count the 5 5 opening plunge clearly prospective buyers stood the hell out of the way when the bell rang allowing the sell at market orders to be filled at heart breaking levels it was testament to early sentiment that an hour or so in the top five asx200 leaders board had only three stocks on it and the biggest gain was less than 1 the index bottomed at 6566 in the first twenty minutes and half an hour later was at 6615 there followed a slow build up of momentum into the afternoon for a close at 6686 down 3 6 the technology sector had been down over 8 early on before closing down 4 5 bnpl stocks now dominate the sector and most everything is going wrong for them at present rising interest rates suggest rising default risk leading regulators to warn of more scrutiny block sq2 in particular is closely linked to bitcoin and they are among the most volatile of no profit growth stocks on the market before anything else block fell 15 1 and zip co zip 15 9 the energy sector copped the biggest hit at 4 9 as had been the case on wall street overnight and despite a slight rise in oil prices signifying just how crowded a trade it has become on oil gas price surges woodside energy wds in particular has been highly sought after post merger and fell 5 3 yesterday bhp group bhp investors received woodside shares in the merger bhp fell 4 2 or 30 index points and the materials sector fell 4 4 chinese lockdowns do not help the banks have been largely trashed ever since last week s rba rate hike and fell another 3 7 either despite or because of the aussie ten year bond rate are you sitting down jumping 32 points to 3 99 the two year jumped 37 points to 3 08 implying expectation the rba will hike to 3 before reconsidering they were the biggest and in the case of banks and resources the most influential index point falls the outperformers were defensives staples 1 9 and utilities 1 8 while healthcare copped 2 6 and real estate which has also been trashed on surging rates fell 3 3 ur westfield urw dropped 11 7 so was that it have we now seen the bottom well that depends on what the fed decides tonight and whether or not another 50 points hike from the rba next month is priced in we re not off to a good start with our futures down 40 points this morning but it would require a 120 points drop to return to yesterday s intraday low which incidentally was a level last seen in february 2021 no consensus us wholesale inflation fell to an annual headline rate of 10 8 in may from 10 9 in april oh what blessed relief and it had peaked at 11 4 in march but that did follow a 0 8 month on month gain as forecast following 0 4 in april oil prices bounced in may and there s not a sign of any significant pullback even if all of china locked down surging food prices are on a lag and there s no end in sight the core ppi was steady at 6 8 after two sessions of carnage the dow opened up 170 points last night before chopping around all day falling to 370 in the last hour and closing at 151 suffice to say no one on wall street can say what will happen next credit markets have now priced in a 75 points fed rate hike tonight many economists have shifted their forecasts to 75 from 50 since friday s cpi result given powell said in may there d be two 50 pointers in june and july and 75 was not on the table many believe the fed will stick to its guns lest it appears to have lost control and be panicked logic would suggest given the cpi immediately led to fears of a 75 pointer that 50 points tonight would lead to a swift snap back on wall street and if it is 75 well it s already priced in but there is also a different view another school believes that the fed has already lost control and if it doesn t go 75 tonight to try to rein in runaway inflation the market will be very disappointed let s just say that sentiment does not exactly reflect a market brimming with confidence or circumspection right now either way the fed is on a hiking trajectory to get to a neutral rate whatever that might be and let s not forget it s also running down its balance sheet withdrawing liquidity from the market that s baked in what will be critical is june quarter corporate earnings results which begin to flow in mid july have estimates been lowered enough or will profits show resilience last night cloud company oracle reported earnings and jumped 10 fedex announced a 53 dividend increase and board overhaul and jumped 14 one issue that has yet to become front page news despite the likes of microsoft and salesforce posting warnings is the us dollar which has surged 10 in a month to a two decade high america s biggest stocks are its big multinationals this reflects soaring bond yields last night the us ten year added another 12 points to 3 48 the two year lagged slightly to be at 3 43 suggesting the market has now shifted up the fed neutral rate assumption to 3 5 from 3 0 we can debate the possibilities till the cows come home but tonight we ll get the fed s decision commodities spot metals minerals energy

inflation in the u s rose to 8 6 in may marking a 40 year high the biden administration blames the russia ukraine war for higher food and gas prices and the markets are not happy stocks lost billions in value over the last five days of trading including many tech holdings and the era of cheap technoliving or the millennial subsidy economy is over according to atlantic writer derek thompson thompson tells kcrw that many tech companies are changing their business models that have become unprofitable for example an uber ride that used to cost 10 15 in washington d c is now 50 and many factors go into that price he says of course you ve got inflation you ve got gas prices you ve got the fact that the labor markets are really tight a lot of tech companies like uber are changing the way they do business in short they used to care about promises and narratives and now they care about profits he explains that companies like uber and doordash were losing money for a long time as they paid customers to use their services the price was often subsidized let s say the average price of a new york pizza is 20 to make and then to deliver it well if you wanted to make a profit you d charge 21 22 25 but instead a lot of these companies were charging 10 or 15 in order to maximize the total number of users so that they can go back to their venture capitalist investors and say hey look we ve got all these users that was the way the business worked for a long long time and it started to change as interest rates have increased venture capitalist investors are now hungry for a return he says many of them invested in uber lyft and doordash because they hoped they would grow to become the next amazon venture capitalists often are taking money from institutional investors or from rich people and those investors are saying hey do something interesting with my money they would grow their user base and grow their revenue base higher and higher and higher but if you looked at every individual transaction they were losing money as these companies raise prices thompson says consumer demand could drop and further shift how tech companies provide services for a while the asset price of everything was going up whether you were in crypto consumer tech or fintech everything was going to the moon thompson says now i think a lot of these companies are going to have to figure out okay which of us were good at raising money and which of us were good at actually being a ceo we re gonna see the distinction between those companies very soon as the federal reserve considers raising interest rates to try and reduce inflation thompson says a recession could be on the horizon what the federal reserve is trying to do to a certain extent is destroy demand they re trying to destroy aggregate demand enough that inflation comes down but not so much that we are tipped into a terrible recession that causes unemployment to go up he says that s really difficult walking that tightrope is hard thompson adds that everyday people are feeling confident about their own financial standings but there s a disconnect with the national economy when they look at their own checking account or they look at their own savings they say well i have more savings than i did three years ago my wage is higher than it was three years ago so my own financial wellbeing is at least okay but i look at the economy and oh my god like look at everything that s happening you ve got inflation and tech stocks are falling and you ve got all of these shortages so maybe it s reasonable to say i m doing okay but everything else is terrible but it s also possible that people are a little bit delusional

natural gas prices crashed after a major lng export terminal shut down following a blast what happened natural gas stocks were unstoppable until last week when they started showing signs of peaking today though was one of the toughest for investors as leading natural gas stocks plunged by double digits here s how much top stocks had fallen at their lowest points in trading tuesday antero resources ar 2 65 eqt eqt 1 96 southwestern energy swn 1 62 natural gas prices unexpectedly plunged and took these stocks along for the ride so what u s natural gas fell nearly 16 on tuesday testing 7 per million british thermal units mmbtu for the first time in nearly nine weeks an unexpected event is to blame last week freeport lng s liquified natural gas lng terminal in texas suffered an explosion industry experts believed the terminal would be up and running within weeks but freeport lng dropped a surprise this morning when it said the plant might not be fully operational until late 2022 and it could take three months to even resume part operations it s a significant development as the texas terminal is one of the largest lng export terminals in the u s and therefore a large consumer of natural gas the long outage now means the terminal won t need natural gas for immediate use and all of that supply amounting to nearly 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day can now be stored or rerouted for domestic consumption that s a lot of gas and should help ease a supply crunch that sent natural gas prices soaring to highs not seen in more than a decade not surprisingly natural gas prices and natural gas stocks tanked after freeport lng s latest update now what investors bet big on natural gas stocks as gas prices continued to rise with share prices of antero resources eqt and southwestern energy even doubling this year through the end of may the blast at the texas terminal has dashed their hopes and investors are now dumping these stocks after their fiery run up it s worth noting here though that lower natural gas prices might not necessarily be bad for all companies the way gas prices were rising companies like eqt that hedge and lock in selling prices would have ended with humongous losses thanks to mark to market losses on hedging instruments a dip in natural gas prices therefore should help them trim those losses in any case it s hard to predict how hard natural gas prices could fall harsh weather in july and august for example could send demand for natural gas soaring which could help tighten the supply and demand balance again and even lift natural gas prices higher on the flip side the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration recently projected greater hurricane activity during the atlantic hurricane season between june and november that s a threat to major lng terminals and any outage could put further pressure on natural gas prices then there s the geopolitical concern stemming from the war between russia and ukraine in short energy prices are hard to predict and investors in natural gas stocks might want to brace for more volatility ahead

the federal reserve is going to have to play catch up a month ago after the last meeting of the federal open market committee fomc fed chairman jerome powell said that a 75 basis point hike was not something the committee was considering following the meeting there was a lot of dovish talk about the fed pausing in september after a couple of 50 basis point hikes on monday night however the wall street journal published a piece that appears to be a message from fed officials that they are going to announce a three quarter of a point hike when the two day fomc meeting concludes tomorrow certainly the futures market is convinced of this a week ago it had the odds of a 75 basis point hike at just under four percent as of tuesday afternoon that had risen to 95 percent what changed of course is that inflation did not slow or moderate as many fed officials apparently thought it would march s 8 5 percent annual gain in the consumer price index cpi turned out not to have been peak inflation after dipping slightly to 8 3 percent in april it jumped back up to 8 6 percent in may the highest in decades measures of underlying inflation such as the cleveland fed s trimmed mean cpi showed inflation becoming more ingrained in the economy perhaps more importantly in terms of the fed s reaction was the change in inflation expectations the fed s house view is that inflation is easier to tame so long as inflation expectations remain anchored in particular the fed tends to watch the longer term expectations since short term expectations can be volatile and are often just extrapolations of food and gasoline prices the five to 10 year expectation in the university of michigan survey showed inflation expectations had jumped from three percent to 3 3 percent a figure that is probably intolerably high for many fed officials the risk is that ongoing inflation will keep pushing it even higher once the anchor is broken the ship is adrift on the tides of inflation so the fed will feel pressure to re establish its credibility on inflation by making a bigger move these inflation expectations were not alleviated by the consumer survey from the new york fed this looks at inflation at two periods one year and three years the median one year inflation expectation climbed to 6 6 percent in the three year window expectations held steady at the elevated rate of 3 9 percent the producer price index ppi released tuesday showed that prices accelerated from the perspective of businesses rising 0 8 percent in may compared with 0 4 percent in april energy prices of course were behind the very strong headline figure rising five percent in may after a 1 6 percent rise in april food prices stabilized with no month over month gain but they are 13 percent higher than a year ago after several months of strong gains perhaps more importantly ppi excluding food and energy was up 0 7 percent month over month services ppi was up 0 4 percent an indication that this is demand driven rather than purely a supply chain issue in short there was nothing in the ppi report to reassure fed officials that inflation was moderating we suspect the market has it right the fed is going to need to do a 75 basis point hike at the current meeting by preparing the market for the hike through the wall street journal article the fed has seen to it that there will likely not be a big sell off in reaction to that size of a hike providing some relief from worries that it could cause a crash the problem with that strategy is that a surprise might actually benefit the fight against inflation a bigger than expected hike would jolt long term rates and push down asset prices effectively tightening the financial conditions earlier than a series of expected hikes would do we doubt however that jerome powell has it in him to shock the market with a 100 basis point hike tomorrow

if you work in homelessness you have to keep a close eye on affordable housing markets we all want more housing and less homelessness the opposite is happening what s to be done according to canadian housing expert steve pomeroy canada lost more than 320 000 units of affordable housing between 2011 and 2016 montreal lost 80 000 units over this time period this amounts to about 16 000 units per year and tens of thousands more since real estate investment trusts and investors have gobbled up the lion s share of this stock renovating them and raising rents the average annual rent increases of these formerly affordable apartments have been 20 per cent according to pomeroy governments have funded the addition of new affordable units over the last decade but only at a rate of about one unit for every 10 housing is the new gold and investors are having a field day at the expense of vulnerable renters old brewery mission has seen up close the efforts of several large commercial landlords to scare many formerly homeless people out of their apartments with bogus claims of lease violations intimidation and illegal rent increases so it s not a coincidence that homelessness is rising in 2018 there were a minimum of 3 149 homeless people on any given night in montreal the next official homelessness street count will be carried out in october but experts suggest the population has risen again to approximately 4 000 people on any given day politicians are putting an emphasis on supply side answers to the crisis to this end the federal liberals have announced funding for the creation of 160 000 new units of affordable housing over the next 10 years across the country through its national housing strategy however it won t be enough considering the rate at which units are disappearing we re running backwards on the treadmill pomeroy said in a recent interview we absolutely need new supply like those projects funded through the federal rapid housing initiative rhi the old brewery is one of many non profit organizations in montreal developing affordable housing adapted for individuals with complex needs leaving homelessness through the rhi we welcome targeted funding opportunities such as these but alone they will not make a big enough dent to truly reverse the upward trend in homelessness additional housing supply needs to be complemented by dramatic regulatory interventions to definancialize housing markets there are four ways this can be done in order to cool the acquisition of more affordable housing stock by investors which inexorably leads to higher rents the provincial government should cap increases on rents of newly acquired affordable stock whether renovations are carried out or not this measure should help reduce the number of renovictions we are currently witnessing across the city a related measure is to better equip tenants to contest evictions before the rental board new york city evictions fell by 40 per cent after tenants were assigned a lawyer at no cost to better defend their interests before the tribunal montreal has already put some controls in place on the conversion of apartment units to airbnb type models it s now time for the provincial government to put a full freeze on any such conversions finally montreal should move quickly to allow for the conversion of select vacant commercial towers into affordable rentals we have no precedent for a housing crisis of this kind the new committee established by mayor plante to look at innovative methods to address it is welcome but the provincial government has to get into the fight as well innovative measures need to be put into place quickly at both the municipal and provincial levels not only to help create corridors out of the homeless shelters and into affordable housing but also to prevent further cases of homelessness from occurring the time to act is now james hughes is the president and ceo of the old brewery mission

a former federal reserve chairman who dismissed concerns about the 2000s housing bubble attempted to squash fears of a 1970s style inflation crisis under president joe biden ben bernanke penned a ludicrous op ed for the new york times headlined inflation isn t going to bring back the 1970s after news broke that inflation skyrocketed to a 40 year high of 8 6 percent year over year in may his main argument had the audacity to varnish the so called expertise of political leaders and the fed oday s monetary policymakers understand that as we wait for supply constraints to ease which they will eventually the fed can help reduce inflation by slowing growth in demand bernanke tried to make it seem like big government learned its lesson from the terrible policies that caused the 1970s crisis in short the lessons learned from america s great inflation by both the fed and political leaders make a repeat of that experience highly unlikely in short reading bernanke s column was like reading a white house press release but bernanke appeared to contradict himself he reportedly warned that the nation is headed for a situation much like the 1970s where americans were losing their jobs but still facing higher prices at the grocery store and at the pump now in his latest write up bernanke did a 180 degree turn are we in danger of repeating that experience he wrote the short answer almost certainly not talk about an about face bernanke fawned how he fed today recognizes that it must take the leading role in controlling inflation and it has the tools and sufficient political independence to do so that s strange coming from the same person who reportedly admitted the fed made a mistake to say the least in its failure to address rising inflation as the threat it was current chairman jerome powell s leadership has tainted the fed by painting the inflation crisis under biden as simply transitory but in bernanke s bizarre view drawing on the lessons of the past also understand that by doing what is needed to get inflation under control they can help the economy and the job market avoid much more serious instability in the future so what exactly have they been doing so far bernanke but this is the same bernanke who repeatedly cast doubt on the warnings surrounding the 2000s housing bubble that eventually led to the 2008 financial crisis below is a video montage of bernanke s dismissals of the tea leaves spelling economic doom in one 2005 case bernanke railed against the idea of a housing bubble potentially bursting and causing a recession i guess i don t buy your premise it s a pretty unlikely possibility bloomberg news just reported on the current inflation woes gripping america that the fed s bid to contain the hottest inflation in decades will end in a recession that s the message the bond market is telegraphing bloomberg news also tweeted recently that powell probably has to push the economy into recession in order to regain control of prices powell is reportedly set to hike interest rates by a massive 75 basis points further elevating recession fears fed chair jerome powell is facing an increasingly grim calculus he probably has to push the economy into recession in order to regain control of prices bloomberg business june 12 2022 the late fed chair paul volcker adopted a similar strategy by initiating steep interest rates to curb the 1970s inflation which prompted a recession even the world bank is currently on high alert the national interest published a story june 11 headlined global recession world bank warns of 1970s style stagflation conservatives are under attack contact the new york times at 1 800 698 4637 and demand it report the truth on the bidenflation crisis
at that point when a slave finally succumbed and wholeheartedly chose to serve the enslaver in ways that even endangered the lives of the co enslaved it was out of extreme debasement on the one hand and an engrained sense of inferiority complex on the other it was not resignation to the fact that the enslaver was too powerful to be overthrown it was a painful affirmation that the enslaver was racially superior and thus needing to be served thus compradors in colonial africa and uncle toms in north america but while uncle toms in north america would be pitied and sympathised with our compradors in colonial africa were laughing stocks compradors were traitors spineless individuals and cowards of the highest degree how would you turn around and serve the killer of your kindred and looter of your resources we asked but somehow compradors managed a brave face including as ngugi wa thiong o has narrated priding in the fact that they were sleeping with the boss white wife and that this was an issue of personal advancement ever wondered why it is so easy for a white person to see president museveni on short notice and extremely difficult for people such as his ministers ever wondered why museveni trusts white people recently evidenced by the pinetti lubowa hospital pinetti coffee deal gold trade banking vaccines more than he trusts africans it is surely not that white people have always delivered quality work and africans disappointed even timothy kalyegira would agree that white people have actually cost uganda or africa more money than we could ever accurately count they have taken billions of dollars out of uganda under these colonial comprador relationships so they are thieves but why would museveni trust the white frail looking thick bearded professor from the united states prof sarfaraz niazi to manufacture him a vaccine for covid 19 despite having nothing to show for his potential and not whole heartedly support our own prof patrick ogwang of the covidex cure truth is if prof ogwang was white and demonstrated thoroughness as his small facility continues to do he would have received a government guarantee of billions of shillings for investment and a free huge piece of land and much more it would be the same with dr david ssenfuka whose cancer and diabetes cures have been useful to many of museveni s close friends and associates but why are these men left to vend for themselves despite their well documented breakthroughs there are many reasons of course but most outstandingly they are not white it is not simply about museveni s insecurity with having to keep power in hostile buganda thus aligning with white people buganda being the centre of political and economic activity for the country which is undoubtedly a big part of the problem but at a personal level one realises that the fire breathing and undoubtedly ruthless museveni still struggles with whiteness he suffers an acute sense of inferiority complex the fear to stand up to white capitalists which has instead turned him into an obsequious servant of whiteness is born not just out of the obsession to keep power but also an acute self engrained inferiority look in what many are quick to term as tomfoolery from reading much western spin president amin stood his ground against whiteness turned the racial cards upside down and liberated nationals from the backwaters of the economy eight years were just enough to propel ugandans to some degree of self conviction and self worth the state stood on their side and privileged them many native writers and businessmen have attested to this fact again it is easy to say that museveni actually exploits white people by using them as fronts but as we know and for sure he too knows white people have the lion s share in the many deals he has entered with them this then turns bwana museveni into a servant of whiteness receiving crumbs from what is rightly his why hand over coffee to a pinetti or gold to some obscure white people for just a cut a small cut but this is not to begrudge president museveni for personally failing to decolonise his mind rather that he has infected the entire country with this inferiority over the last 30 years ugandans sense of self worth and confidence has run down the drain we are rendered unable to do anything the museveni government is ready to assign anything to anyone as long as they are white it should be heart breaking that all those natives in museveni s circle who appear rich and double as motivational speakers put any name here are simply agents of white folks they own no capital to put this in perspective 700 youthful ugandans leave the country daily for enslavement in the middle east chinese can destroy lake victoria through sand mining without looking over their shoulders indian sugarcane planters are happy to destroy an entire ecosystem because the president is their servant and can also kick natives out of their properties without thinking twice about it and our supposedly wealthy tycoons have turned to fraud and non repayment of their loan obligations the fruits of 30 years and counting of a president with an acute sense of inferiority complex yusufkajura gmail com the author is a political theorist based at makerere university

letting up some analysts now think the federal open market committee could surprise with a 75 basis point rate increase instead of the 50 basis point climb that officials have promoted wells fargo securities chief economist jay bryson and economist michael pugliese believe it is likely that the committee will opt to hike rates by 75 bps which would take the target range for the fed funds rate to 1 50 to 1 75 they said reports of a 75 basis point increase were likely were confirmed by off the record comments by fed officials who couldn t comment because of the pre meeting blackout period and while an extra 25 basis points at this meeting would definitely rattle that equilibrium said jan szilagyi ceo of toggle friday s inflation number was an unwelcome surprise to both policymakers and markets and diminished hopes for short term relief from rising rates but the fed has other tools it can use he said in particular they can raise borrowing costs for longer dated loans by signaling a faster pace of hikes or a higher ending point while the markets wonder about the possibility of a 75 basis point increase a 50 basis point increase has been priced in said wilmington trust chief economist luke tilley we think a 50bp hike is more likely he said but accompanied by comments from powell that a 75 bp hike in july would be on the table or perhaps even the baseline expectation the two biggest risks for the fed are moving too slowly or ending the hiking cycle too soon szilagyi said this calls for a nimbler tool than merely hiking the benchmark rate in surprisingly large increments markets would lose faith in the fed that hiked for two meetings then eased only to hike again at the following one forward guidance on the other hand can be much more finely tuned but talk alone won t solve the inflation problem said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein and while there are no good answers the fed must stay hawkish he said while they might be tempted to believe that they could accomplish their goals this week simply with words i doubt that will be enough to get the job done i think they will have to do something more tangible than just talking tough winograd said one option is raising more than 50 basis points he noted or they could indicate that they are willing to raise rates by more than 50 bps in july having previously signaled that 50 bps was likely at that meeting other options would be to extend the guidance for 50 basis point moves beyond july or significantly increase the terminal rate forecast for this cycle making clear that they anticipate moving rates into meaningfully restrictive territory winograd said but a 75 basis point increase at this meeting is unlikely he said they have been careful to preserve forward guidance as a policy tool throughout this cycle and intentionally surprising the market this week would pose risks their ability to conduct monetary policy in the future others agreed that the half point hike is the likely outcome of this meeting i still think 50 bps is the call said joe boyle fixed income product manager at hartford funds that said the possibility of 75 bps and even 100bps has increased and if the fed feels that level of hikes is necessary i d expect powell to indicate as such the market will be all ears during this press conference if the fed does raise rates by three quarters of a point it would be a happy surprise said nancy tengler ceo cio of laffer tengler investments the question now is whether the economy can avoid recession while the four recession indicators she watches the yield curve credit spreads leading economic indicators and the unemployment rate aren t signaling a recession they could at any time tengler said wells fargo s bryson and pugliese expect a meaningful upward shift in the so called dot plot which would indicate that fed policymakers believe even more monetary tightening is appropriate in coming quarters at yearend they expect a fed funds rate target of 3 375 and 4 125 at the end of 2023 also look for higher inflation and lower growth forecasts in the summary of economic projections bryson and pugliese said the march sep suggested 4 3 inflation this year we would not be surprised if the june sep has a median projection north of 5 but future inflation projections shouldn t rise much as the fed expects food and energy prices decelerate and perhaps even decline somewhat in 2023 and beyond gdp growth estimated at 2 8 in the previous sep could fall to between 2 0 and 2 25 they said as wells fargo projects 1 7 growth this year the public is losing patience on inflation and there are loud calls for the federal reserve to boost interest rates more aggressively said david kelly chief global strategist at j p morgan asset management however powerful forces outside the fed s control largely caused the current inflation spike and a reversal of those other forces will likely cure it for the fed the most important task is to recognize the strength of those forces and maintain a balanced and flexible approach to allow inflation to fade without triggering a recession the post meeting statement he said will likely first emphasize the undesirable persistence of inflation pressures seen in a red hot may cpi report and continued very high energy prices they may note that the decline in the unemployment rate has slowed but they will likely assert that labor markets remain very tight while the markets see a 50 50 chance the fed will raise 75 basis points kelly said were they to do this we would likely see both a further increase in short term rates and a decline in long term rates as investors bet more heavily on rate hikes in 2022 leading to recession in 2023 inflation projections could rise to 5 5 for headline inflation with a slight increase in core projections there will be more dots in the fed dot plot this time around with the addition of lisa cook and philip jefferson to the board of governors he noted but still the median forecast for the end of 2022 federal funds rate likely to climb from 1 9 in march to at least 2 6 and possibly 2 9 2 6 would reflect 50 basis point hikes in june and july and 25 basis point hikes in the three remaining meetings of the year 2 9 would presumably reflect an expectation that the september hike is likely to be 0 5 rather than 0 25 dws group u s economist christian scherrmann is eying the sep we are especially keen to see how members diverge in their expectations for 2023 and 2024 might one or more of the fomc members already be secretly penciling in a downturn if so it would provide an early clue of how seriously the fed is likely to take market fears of a recession during its next few meetings but he expects no major surprises at the meeting we expect the fed to reassess the stance of monetary policy and inflation in august and see the september meeting as potential pivot point but sebastien galy senior macro strategist at nordea asset management says the economy is potentially headed for a slow train wreck as the fed is forced to tighten policy more quickly and raise interest rates higher to appease fears of consumers and some corporates when in reality monetary policy works with a lag if they overtighten he said it could lead to recession an economic equilibrium which was uncertain between a slowdown stagflation and recession is becoming ever clearer as inflation widens out forcing the hand of the fed he said the question now is whether the fed can control the narrative again and dampen expectations regarding the terminal rate even if the fed decides on a 50 basis point hike galy said a more rapid pace of rate hikes is unlikely to be well received primary to come the public finance authority wisconsin baa2 is

ohio has the second highest share of children afflicted with lead poisoning in the nation an estimated 1 000 children in cleveland are affected each year cleveland editor s note the above video is from a previous story about national and local leaders discussing lead safety in cleveland for decades city leaders in cleveland have tried to take action to deal with the complex problem of childhood lead poisoning mostly from lead paint in the housing stock and not as much from water pipes and have viewed any potential solutions as complex and expensive back in 2019 cleveland councilman blaine griffin called lead poisoning one of the most complex vexing issues he s ever encountered sometimes it is not what is happening griffin explained it is who it is happening to what griffin now council president meant was that lead paint poisoning was occurring more to cleveland renters in poorer minority neighborhoods and the owners of those properties claimed that they didn t have the funding to upgrade their single family and small apartment complexes as with many midwest cities with and older housing stock cleveland s major problem in implementing this important health care solution as an estimated 1 000 children in the city are affected by dangerous levels of lead each year was getting the necessary funding and if the funding is gained then the enforcement of having lead free housing would have to be done those funding and enforcement issues are closer to being solved now with recent developments in cleveland in late may the city approved using 17 million from the federal american rescue plan act funding to apply to fund various programs to fix the lead paint problem the total raised now is about 120 million from a public private partnership arrangement including more then 50 million from the cleveland clinic foundation the program will provide funds for homeowners and rental property owners for the necessary repairs additional grants for landlords to have their housing officially certified as lead safe job training for those inspectors and housing assistance for those who currently in such homes and for lead testing on children who might have poisoning problems the lead paint problem in the u s has long been an issue that everyone acknowledged but little action taken it is the classic kick the can down the road approach hoping that future funding solutions might suddenly appear the american academy of pediatrics has long advocated taking a proactive approach to the lead paint poisoning issue pointing out that 37 million u s homes have lead based paint in them more than 500 000 preschool children with high lead blood levels with an national annual cost of about 50 billion for health care special education crime problems and other factors lead toxicity results in substantial population level effects on children s intellectual abilities academic abilities problem behaviors and birth weight the aap says cleveland clinic president and ceo tom mihaljevic m d echoed that sentiment and said earlier this year that in 2022 the large cleveland based health system is making lead poisoning prevention its top community priority this effort is critical because prevention is the only effective approach dr mihaljevic said there is no cure and no way to reverse the damage of lead poisoning once it is done i want cleveland to be safe for all children and i know this is a problem we can solve our communities can only be safe and healthy when every person has the opportunity to live in a safe and healthy home the reason for this problem is the basic math that has been long known by community organizers and health care professionals while the lead paint problem exists in every city and state it is more highly concentrated in older cities that built most of their housing before 1978 when the u s began banning such paint and while cities like cleveland buffalo and detroit have a great amount of such high lead level housing stock because of the huge economic and population growth in the early 1900s and the home building that went along with that the economic fallout from manufacturing job loss in the late 1900s and early 2000s have made it difficult to fix the problem now for example in the u s according to census data 53 of the national housing was built prior to 1979 in ohio it is a little higher at 66 but in cleveland and toledo the older housing constitutes 87 and 86 of those two cities housing stock by contrast columbus whose growth was much higher in recent years and has passed cleveland as the biggest city in ohio in terms of population the amount of pre 1979 built housing is 54 the problem is that the northeast and midwest states have higher lead issue problems and the higher modern growth west and southeast leadership think funding should be more statewide and less national but under the biden administration the government spending on lead pipe and paint remediation has increased a bit on the national level though some states have not followed through as much including ohio the feds have appropriated about 3 billion in funding in its infrastructure bill for lead pipe and paint programs the built back better act would add to that if passed the ohio legislature has generally left lead paint laws and how they are enforced to local city and county government entities the ohio senate recently cut 1 3 million from their state budget for lead safe training and certification for building inspectors but on the other side of the coin ohio gov mike dewine s administration did award 1 million in april for asbestos abatement and lead based paint removal for the spitzer building in downtown toledo as part of the ohio brownfield remediation program toledo is pushing for lead safe paint certification action for rental property owners this is serious business because the problem we are dealing with is serious said toledo mayor wade kapszukiewicz recently juanita greene with the toledo community coalition added we have our future at stake here and those are our children policy matters ohio points out that ohio has the second highest share of children afflicted with lead poisoning among all the states with 5 2 of ohio kids being lead poisoned compared to a national average of 1 9 there s a third epidemic in ohio in addition to covid and substance abuse lead poisoning they write it is a serious public health threat especially to children in urban and rural communities across the state what all this means for cleveland and the rest of the state is that lead paint remediation will be an arduous and continual struggle sally martin cleveland s new director of building and housing told ideastream public media recently that nearly 9 200 rental units in the city had been lead safe certified so far but we know that there s probably at least 100 000 units out there she said so with our rental registration we have about 61 000 units registered so that gives us quite a bit of shadow inventory that we still have to get to the message needs to get out that if you re a landlord in the city of cleveland you have to comply with this ordinance martin said you need to register your property annually and you need to comply with the city s lead safe ordinance and if you re not going to comply or you don t have plans to comply you will be prosecuted

business stocks dip deeper into bear market ahead of big fed news traders work on the floor at the new york stock exchange in new york tuesday june 14 2022 ap photo seth wenig new york ap most stocks on wall street dipped tuesday in their first trading after tumbling into a bear market on worries that high inflation will push central banks to clamp the brakes too hard on the economy the s p 500 fell 14 15 or 0 4 to 3 735 48 as investors braced for the federal reserve s announcement on wednesday about how sharply it will raise interest rates it wobbled between losses and gains through the day after a couple big companies flexed financial strength with stronger profits and payouts to shareholders the dow jones industrial average fell 151 91 points or 0 5 to 30 364 83 the nasdaq composite rose 19 12 or 0 2 to 10 828 35 after swinging between a a loss of 0 7 and a gain of 1 1 advertisement despite the swings trading across markets was still calmer than during monday s worldwide rout which sent the s p 500 down 3 9 stocks fell more than 1 in tokyo and paris but rose that much in shanghai a measure of nervousness among investors on wall street eased even as treasury yields again pierced their highest levels in more than a decade no one s going to take meaningful positions today ahead of what could be a rip roaring day with the fed s announcement said katie nixon chief investment officer for northern trust wealth management cryptocurrency prices continued to swing they ve been among the hardest hit in this year s sell off for markets as the federal reserve and other central banks raise interest rates to rein in inflation and forcefully turn off the easy mode that helped prop up markets for years bitcoin was down nearly 5 in afternoon trading and sitting at 22 201 according to coindesk it earlier fell to nearly 70 below its record of 68 990 90 set late last year offering some support to the market was a report that showed inflation at the wholesale level was a touch lower in may than expected though it remains very high it could be an indication that wholesale inflation peaked in march according to jack ablin chief investment officer at cresset capital management advertisement but economists said the data won t keep the federal reserve from raising its key interest rate on wednesday by a larger than usual amount investors are now mostly expecting the biggest increase since 1994 a hike of three quarters of a percentage point or triple the usual amount a week ago such a mega increase was seen as only a remote possibility if one at all but a market bludgeoning report friday on inflation at the consumer level has seemingly pinned the fed into getting more aggressive it showed inflation for the consumer price index got worse in may instead of slowing as hoped it s really a split decision in terms of the market as to whether that will be a good thing or a bad thing nixon said of a big rate increase it certainly opens the door to additional big hikes in the future treasury yields continued to climb with the two year yield touching its highest level since november 2007 before the financial crisis according to tradeweb the 10 year yield during the day reached its highest level since april 2011 they also had a relatively reliable warning signal of recession in the bond market flashing on and off in afternoon trading the yield on the 10 year treasury had climbed back above the two year yield at 3 47 versus 3 41 that s typically how things look in the bond market advertisement in the unusual circumstances where the two year yield tops the 10 year yield some investors see it as a sign that a recession may be hitting in about a year or two it s called an inverted yield curve and it briefly flashed earlier in the day on wall street oracle soared 10 4 after it reported stronger revenue and earnings for its latest quarter than analysts expected fedex jumped 14 4 after it boosted its dividend payout by more than 50 it was the first trading for u s stocks after the s p 500 closed monday at 21 8 below its record set early this year that put it in a bear market which is what investors call a drop of 20 or more at the center of the sell off is the federal reserve s effort to control inflation by raising interest rates the fed is scrambling to get prices under control and its main method is to raise rates but that is a blunt tool that could slow the economy too much and cause a recession the real calm in today s market is driven very significantly by the focus on this week s fed decision said greg bassuk ceo of axs investments today s is either the calm before the storm or the calm that will hopefully represent an extended period of calm other central banks worldwide including the bank of england have been raising rates as well while the european central bank said it will do so next month and in september the war in ukraine is sending oil and food prices sharply higher fueling inflation and sapping consumer spending especially in europe covid infections in china meanwhile have led to some tough business slowing restrictions that threaten to restrain the world s second largest economy and worsen snarled supply chains advertisement the shift toward higher rates has reversed the spectacular rise for markets spurred by massive support from central banks after the pandemic hit in early 2020 the s p 500 more than doubled from late march 2020 through its peak in january it was the shortest bull market on record going back to 1929 which followed the shortest bear market on record according to s p dow jones indices higher rates typically make investors less willing to pay high prices for risky investments that s why some of the biggest stars of the earlier low rate era have been some of the

composite image with background stock photo by artas istock getty images plus overlay stock photo by cody blowers st george news st george two men were arrested over the weekend following unrelated incidents the first was reported on friday involving a man that was thrown through a window on red cliffs drive while the second involved a suspect who reportedly pulled a knife on a man with small children at the park in st george the first incident was reported shortly before 5 p m friday when emergency dispatch began to receive calls about two men actively fighting at the zion outlet mall on north red cliffs drive one of the 911 callers said the two males even broke a large glass window during the course of this altercation the officer noted in the probable cause statement filed in support of the arrest officers responded and found one of the men who was holding his arm and bleeding the officer also noted that one of the lacerations to the man s arm was more than 10 inches long and very deep the man told police that shortly before the incident he was smoking a cigarette near one of the restaurants when another man approached and told him he had to be a certain number of feet from the entrance of a building to smoke a cigarette he said the suspect then swung at him and pushed him through the large glass window located in the front of the restaurant the officer looked over at the window that was broken and estimated it to be roughly 10 feet tall by 6 feet wide with broken glass littering the area the suspect was located approximately 100 feet from where the altercation reportedly took place and was identified as 36 year old brian keith hatcher who told officers the other man involved in the incident pushed off the window to punch him and broke the glass in the process according to the report the suspect was very agitated as he spoke loudly and was very disrespectful the officer said as he told officers it was the other man who threw the first punch which caused him to react he said with conflicting accounts officers spoke to several bystanders to the incident and every witness reported the same thing the officer wrote indicating it was hatcher who was the purported aggressor during the incident eyewitnesses told officers the altercation appeared to have started when hatcher approached the man and pushed him through the window causing it to break the witnesses accounts also matched the injuries found on the victim the cost to replace the large plate glass window was estimated at 2 500 the officer also noted the injuries to the man were substantial so much so that the injury potentially could leave the man with a diminished or altered level of function of the arm that could be long term the laceration likely would leave the man with permanent scarring as well the suspect was arrested and transported to purgatory correctional facility and booked into jail on one felony count of criminal mischief as well as one misdemeanor count of assault with substantial bodily injury less than 30 hours later officers were dispatched to town square park on main street in st george shortly after 9 p m on saturday on a report of a possible assault involving a suspect who was threatening to shoot people a second witness told police the suspect was holding a knife as he continued yelling according to the probable cause statement filed in support of the arrest the 911 caller also said the suspect was wearing a dark shirt dark gray pants and had two backpacks on his person one on his back and the second on the front of his body officers arrived to find a group of residents near the central area of the park while one of the first responding officers was ordering the suspect later identified as 24 year old chandler scott pitts to stop and to drop the folding knife he had in his hand when the suspect stepped towards the officer a second officer pointed his flashlight towards the suspect as he readied his taser for deployment and noticing the taser the report states pitts took a step backward the suspect appeared highly agitated as officers continued to shout orders for him to drop the knife and minutes later the suspect complied and the knife dropped to the ground as officers attempted to take the man into custody the suspect began screaming and cursing at police and then yelled at the officers to shoot him followed by demands for officers to give him a gun several minutes later the suspect stopped resisting and was taken into custody by police meanwhile officers spoke to the two witnesses one of whom said he was at the park with his young children and was speaking to his wife on his cell phone when the suspect approached with the knife in his hand the suspect the witness stated began to curse and yell at him as he pointed the knife in his direction so he placed himself in between the suspect to protect his children the second witness said he observed the suspect approach the man with the three small children and started yelling and cursing at him and he also heard the suspect allegedly threaten to kill the man as the witness approached to assist the father if needed he said the suspect threatened to kill him and his dog the report states the witness who was in fear for his safety pulled his concealed firearm and held it in a low position as he started backing away at that point the suspect walked away heading west through the park with the suspect detained officers attempted to search the two backpacks that were still on the suspect and when scott reportedly refused to remove the packs officers cut the straps so the packs could be searched inside of one of the packs officers found a burnt marijuana cigarette along with a baggie containing suspected marijuana and a second baggie containing what appeared to be psilocybin mushrooms which are classified as a hallucinogen the suspect was transported to purgatory correctional facility facing two third degree felony counts of aggravated assault and possession of a controlled substance also a felony he also faces multiple misdemeanors including one count each of possession of marijuana disorderly conduct interfering with an arrest and a weapons charge prior to the incident on saturday no criminal record could be found on the suspect during a search of court cases and no injuries were reported following thatcher s arrest

the crypto exchange giant coinbase said tuesday it was laying off nearly one fifth of its workforce a sobering sign that the challenges of the once blazingly hot industry go beyond those of troubled bank celsius to the very heart of the crypto investment world in an email to employees coinbase chief executive brian armstrong said the company would cut 18 of its workforce the cuts will affect roughly 1 100 of its approximately 6 100 employees he said all were terminated immediately but will be given at least 14 weeks of severance the news follows developments late sunday night in which the crypto bank celsius said it was temporarily halting transactions raising fears about the lender s liquidity but with questions long mounting about that company s solvency and business practices celsius can be written off by crypto boosters as an outlier that is harder to do for coinbase a top barometer for the industry s health with a self proclaimed 98 million users the company is one of the main ways people buy and sell crypto assets and warnings about its business augur darker messages about the fate of crypto as an investment class advertisement article continues below this ad a recession could lead to another crypto winter and could last for an extended period armstrong said in his email referring to the period in 2018 when many cryptocurrencies plummeted in value before eventually regaining their losses and then some but the stakes are higher now than they were four years ago as far more americans have come aboard the crypto bandwagon a study by grayscale investments found that 55 of all bitcoin holders bought the currency in 2021 the coinbase announcement comes as recession fears mount tech stocks plunge and most troublingly for the crypto world the two leading coins plummet as of tuesday afternoon bitcoin and ethereum had lost respectively 27 and 33 of their value over the previous five days it follows the collapse last month of the financial products of

people scanning pharmacy and grocery store aisles in search of menstrual products may be coming up short due to a national tampon shortage caused by supply chain issues hints of the shortage began popping up on social media earlier this year with people sharing photos of empty store shelves and asking for help in accessing products nonprofits focused on menstrual equity also have started to see an influx in people seeking out items lynette medley co founder of the spot said the germantown menstrual hub has seen a large influx of requests from residents looking for pads tampons and other menstrual products as the shortage has hit stores across the philadelphia region we ve seen a lot of requests for tampons and have given away 85 of our supply medley said and it s not just tampons it s all other period products as well we re almost out of pads too on monday spokespeople from walgreens cvs and target told axios that they were aware of a limited supply of tampons at some locations many suppliers have been unable to fulfill some of the regular orders placed by the stores with companies pointing to supply chain issues as the probable cause of the delay tampax producer proctor gamble told the washington post that it is working with retailers to ensure that people who menstruate have access to the products they need and stressed that the shortage is temporary though not every tampon brand is in short stock at this time proctor gamble is one of the largest manufacturers of tampons in the united states period products including tampons and sanitary pads have become more expensive in recent months as inflation continues to impact consumer spending on necessities data from nielsoniq shows that the average price of a regular pack of pads increased by 8 3 from the beginning of the year through may 28 an average pack of tampons increased by 9 8 though inflated costs of other products have led to shoppers cutting their spending menstrual products are necessary to maintain hygiene and can not be cut back easily further attempting to extend use of the disposable hygiene products can lead to increased risk of infection experts say that pads should be changed every four to eight hours while tampons should be changed every four to six hours the u s food and drug administration notes that people should never leave a tampon in for longer than eight hours because it increases the risk of developing bacterial infections including toxic shock syndrome dana marlowe founder of i support the girls told npr that her organization has received half as many tampon donations as they have in previous years and more than 60 fewer donations than in 2020 she noted that people who lack the resources to travel from store to store in search of products often resort to potentially risky alternatives they re using cardboard and duct tape ripped up sheets marlowe said tampon shortage reveals existing gaps in affordability of menstrual supplies though some shoppers may be new to the struggle to find tampons and pads gaps in access to menstrual hygiene products have persisted for years both in the united states and around the world a 2021 study commissioned by u by kotex found that 2 in 5 americans experience period poverty meaning that they experience difficulties in accessing and affording products like pads and tampons a large 2019 study in st louis found that about 67 of low income women were unable to consistently afford menstrual supplies there are 16 9 million people who menstruate currently living in poverty in the united states lack of access to period products can have an additional economic or societal impact because it can cause people to miss work or school particularly in places where those products are not provided while social safety nets enable low income households to purchase other necessities like food people receiving snap benefits cannot use that money to purchase period products you know if you can t afford housing or food or all of those other things you cannot afford menstrual products because they are not covered by anything medley of the spot said on an episode of crooked media s american dissected podcast earlier this year medley later said the pandemic hit communities in different ways and she sees people of varying socioeconomic statuses come in seeking products because they are often not provided through other safety nets in philadelphia people struggling with period poverty often utilize the spot and no more secrets mind body spirit another effort co founded by medley and nya mcglone to bridge the gap in access the spot is the only organization of its kind in philadelphia medley told phillyvoice despite the tampon shortage it is continuing to host traveling menstrual product giveaways on monday medley and mcglone brought their mobile menstrual health unit to west philadelphia preparatory high school for a community event medley and mcglone founded the spot in 2021 as a menstrual hub traveling from their headquarters in germantown to communities throughout philadelphia and the surrounding region the spot provides education menstrual care and products to those who may otherwise not be able to afford them i think the difference in our approach is that we provide dignity to our communities medley told the inquirer in february we do not give them pity because in my mind we should not have to do this work i cry because i can t believe this is something they have to ask for to beg for a pad or a tampon while those with disposable income are encouraged to purchase longer lasting reusable menstrual products like period underwear or menstrual cups which can last up to six months with regular cleaning and disinfecting those who lack access to other necessities like water service or operational toilets may not have many other options
