a bloc of 25 states led by arizona is urging the supreme court to take up a case that challenges maryland s unusually restrictive gun control laws which the states argue were enacted in defiance of the high court s landmark second amendment rulings the court filing comes as americans await the court s ruling in new york state rifle and pistol association v bruen which could come at any time the justices seemed receptive to arguments in that case on nov 3 2021 that new york state s tough concealed carry gun permitting system offends the second amendment as previously reported by the epoch times maryland s firearms safety act of 2013 enacted on the theory that restricting legal gun purchases promotes safety is among the strictest in the nation the legal regime requires that those who wish to purchase a pistol seek a license applicants must complete safety training and be fingerprinted before a gun permit will be issued the state bans popular weapons such as the ar 15 and similar rifles and limits magazine capacity to 10 rounds maryland law also prohibits firearms with features such as flash hiders and folding stocks that the bloc of states argues enhance gun safety arizona attorney general mark brnovich is seen in an undated photo provided on june 10 2021 mark brnovich arizona attorney general mark brnovich said maryland s anti gun laws go too far americans do not require approval from a local jurisdiction to exercise their constitutional rights brnovich a republican said in a statement we must vigorously oppose this type of misguided overreach at all levels of government joining arizona in the friend of the court brief are the attorneys general from alabama alaska arkansas florida georgia idaho indiana kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri montana nebraska new hampshire ohio oklahoma south carolina south dakota texas utah virginia west virginia and wyoming the case in which the friend brief was filed on jan 26 is bianchi v frosh court file 21 902 the u s court of appeals for the 4th circuit upheld the maryland law in september the bloc of states argues that the circuit court violates supreme court precedent by fashioning its own standard that allows firearms to be banned if a court believes the weapon is military grade or a weapon of war in the parlance of gun control advocates petitioners dominic bianchi david snope and micah schaefer are residents of maryland the petitioners that are organizations are licensed firearms dealer field traders llc firearms policy coalition inc second amendment foundation inc and citizens committee for the right to keep and bear arms the respondent brian frosh a democrat is maryland s attorney general the supreme court is seen in washington on sept 21 2020 samira bouaou the epoch times in december 2020 petitioners sued in federal district court claiming that maryland s categorical ban on the possession of common semiautomatic firearms is facially unconstitutional under the second amendment which is applicable to maryland under the fourteenth amendment according to the petition pdf filed with the supreme court second amendment supporters say that in recent years americans gun ownership rights have hung by a thread in the supreme court in district of columbia v heller 2010 the supreme court held 5 4 that the second amendment protects an individual s right to possess a firearm in mcdonald v chicago 2012 the high court found 5 4 that the right of an individual to keep and bear arms is constitutionally incorporated or made applicable to the states since those decisions were rendered the ideological balance on the supreme court has shifted leading to the current 6 3 conservative supermajority liberal justice stephen breyer announced his retirement last week but he will likely be replaced by another liberal jurist according to the brief the useful in military service standard adopted by the fourth circuit not only would perversely result in eliminating constitutional protection from the very arms the founders expected law abiding citizens to bring with them when mustering for militia service but taken to the limits of its logic this standard threatens to strip constitutional protection from virtually all firearms nearly 20 million rifles of the kind maryland bans have been sold in the united states and are typically used for legitimate self defense the brief states yet the nearly 85 million people living in maryland and the five other states and the district of columbia with similar bans on common semi automatic rifles are flatly prohibited from keeping or bearing these arms solely because they live on one side of a state line rather than the other that situation is intolerable and only this court s intervention can correct it the epoch times reached out for comment to counsel of record for the state julia doyle bernhardt of the maryland office of the attorney general office spokeswoman raquel coombs replied on her behalf saying via email our office does not comment on ongoing litigation maryland was supposed to file a response to the petition by feb 14 but on jan 25 asked the court to extend the deadline the supreme court granted the motion and ordered the state to respond by march 16

an engraving of a 13th century market scene with merchants offering their wares and a mystery being performed in the background bettmann archive as i and too few others have argued since early on in the present pandemic urgently needed demand support measures like those taken in 2020 were bound to raise prices until accompanied by equi proportional supply support measures you simply cannot add purchasing power to a macroeconomy without raising prices unless you add more not produce less of what s to be purchased as well that is the source of our present inflationary pressures these are indeed transitory but will persist till our capacity to supply ourselves catches up with our capacity to purchase what isn t yet here to be purchased in the medium to longer term then we ll end inflation only by ramping up production of all essential goods and all inputs to such goods notably but not solely microchips as quickly as possible we must replicate in effect the feat of the roosevelt administration in taking america from producing just over 3 000 warplanes per annum in 1939 to producing 60 000 warplanes per annum by 1940 after germany s rapid conquest of france that spring sounded the ultimate wakeup call the recent proliferation of supply chain talk thankfully heard now as never before is of course welcome in this respect but it regrettably tends still to be more about the chains than the supplies more about transport than what is transported yet as i ve written in these pages already our present supply chain and consequent inflation woes should be viewed as an opportunity to restore not just america s transportation infrastructure but also its role in producing what s transported both at home and abroad its role as workshop of the free world it is time in other words to re shore production of semiconductors advanced electronics pharmaceuticals batteries solar panels and all other essential products of the economies of tomorrow and in so doing to restore our once preeminent productive prowess and large middle class and this we will manage only through public action like that we employed in our second world war mobilization building and leasing out the very facilities in which our producers produce as well as the houses schools and health facilities our workforce will need if it s to be mobile and nimble while we are taking these medium and longer term measures however certain essentials on which working americans already depend must be kept affordable even in the immediate term fuel foodstuffs heating oil all the things people must purchase to keep living and working each day must be insulated against inflationary pressures now even before their supplies and their substitutes greener supplies can be massively boosted how might we do that some have suggested the 1940s and 1970s expedients of price controls others suggest reinvigorating antitrust and other forms of competition policy these especially antitrust reinforcement are of course fine ideas at least over time but where time is precisely what s lacking far more fast acting will be measures that target price inflating speculation in the commodities markets the kinds of thing hedge funds and wall street trading houses always do with cheap fed supplied money which account for commodity prices not merely rising but rather rising falling and rising again that volatility is what needs ending right now how do we do that here is where i think it helpful to re up the measures that i proposed last time that monetary easing imposed hardship on some even while rescuing others twelve years ago at that time i proposed the fed short commodities so as to fine tune its easing now it seems i must propose this again here s what i mean early each weekday morning in lower manhattan agents at a wall street trading desk trade on carefully drafted sets of trading instructions the instructions direct the agents to purchase and sell specified quantities of specific securities as well as to enter into specified sale and repurchase repo agreements with specified counterparties the decisions on which these traders transact have been reached earlier the same mornings by executives who have digested reams of financial and market data concerning quite recent past and anticipated future market behavior shortly after the sun rises over the east river the traders will begin executing the instructed trades they will be buying and selling lending and borrowing all morning so far so unsurprising but now comes the part you might not have known about the traders i note here will be trading on behalf of the united states of america for they are effectively government agents they work for the federal reserve bank of new york first among equals that constitute the federal reserve system s network of regional district banks the trades to which i refer here are of course known to fed watchers as open market operations they are publicly conducted market moving transactions meant to affect a particular price that i ve elsewhere dubbed in intended analogy to the systemically important financial institutions sifis targeted by titles i and ii of the post crisis dodd frank act of 2010 a systemically important price or index sipi the principal sipi that the fed presently targets is the prevailing money rental a k a interest rate interest rates are systemically important for multiple reasons but chief among them is the interlinked fact that the interest rate is a price that determines a host of other prices most notoriously home prices but also the prices of all goods and services whose supply requires producers to borrow in order to produce given its ubiquity as a production cost and relatedly as a determinant of the value of money hence price stability it is not difficult to see why the money rental rate would count as a sipi in need of public guidance yet interest rates are not the only prices that meet this criterion much like money rental for example labor rental rates a k a wages and salaries also are prices that influence other prices economy wide labor being at least as time honored an input as capital in all capitalist economies and so i have elsewhere proposed publicly conducted open labor market operations in order to maintain stable consumer demand and maximum employment through our macroeconomy over time but now it is time once again to hone in on another set of sipis a set that monetary easing made salient post 2008 and is now making salient again i refer to the aforementioned fuel and food a k a commodity prices at the core of those forms of inflation that working americans have of late felt most acutely to explain as some will remember multiple rounds of fed monetary easing had worked quite well by 2011 in driving down bond yields and other borrowing costs after the crash of 2008 this had proved crucial especially when congress failed to pass adequate fiscal stimulus in keeping americans to their jobs and homes during our post crash debt deflationary spiral there was one respect in which the fed s innovations could be faulted back then however and that was in respect of the effect that its easing had wrought on commodity prices easing induced credit then as now found its way quickly into commodity prices through the actions of speculators betting with fed money in the derivatives markets on price movements in primary markets the resultant price movements again then as now of course disproportionately harmed working people in the lower and middle intervals of the income spectrum they also harmed and antagonized developing nations with whom the us would still like to get on better in the interest of cooperatively working out less dysfunctional international trade and currency arrangements than those still in place since the clinton and bush years what then should we have done should we have forgone qe operation twist and other monetary policy innovations and with them their overall salutary effects it seemed to me then as it does now that there is a better way the better way is not to innovate less with monetary policy but to innovate more if central bank policy works an unintended side effect in the form of price pushing commodity speculation why not have the central bank counter speculate at the same time let it short that on which the speculators go long with its cheap money it is after all already meant to act as the ultimate market contrarian working countercyclically to moderate otherwise self worsening recursive collective action problems of the kind we call feedback fed booms busts inflations and deflations and so i ll repeat fed folk rather than over inclusively raising rates in a manner that threatens post 2020 recovery fine tune your easing short the commodities whose prices are systemically important to working americans and proximately fueled not by your easing but rather by speculators misusing your easing that way you neutralize the unintended effect core inflation while preserving the intended one demand support at least till production again catches up with demanded consumption nationwide now some misguided traditionalists will of course quarrel with the notion of the central banks dealing in something other than treasury securities but that fight has long since been lost and what is more central banks in centuries past dealt in more than just government securities anyway bills of exchange for example why do i say that the treasurys only battle has long since been lost well again since 2008 to take the most obvious example the fed has held mortgage backed securities in addition to treasuries in its portfolio and it has done so precisely in order to keep a floor under them and has done so because home prices too are systemically important in our ownership society but where you can act to maintain a floor you can likewise act to maintain a ceiling at least in the short term and that is what the fed s shorting commodities would do it would stabilize prices of items whose prices we very much need stabilized and would do so from that direction the top we most need while needed monetary easing remains underway this is not as radical an idea as you might think for one thing there s already the precedent of dealing in more than just treasurys as the bill of exchange and mbs examples already illustrate for another thing there is the reason we mandate open market operations in these markets in the first place the fact that their prices are sipis a rationale that embraces far more than government bonds and finally there also are multiple instances of proposal and practice alike whereby commodity prices themselves have been publicly stabilized by means of collectively maintained stockpiles of the commodities themselves remember joseph s advice to pharaoh in regard to grain stores ever heard of strategic petroleum reserves how about government cheese and in what was surely one of the most visionary proposals of all the same fellow who once designed and advocated a much more helpful imf and world bank than the institutions we ended up with j m keynes advocated a global commodity reserve as well and he did so precisely in order to end the subjection of working people worldwide to the vagaries of volatile global commodities markets if you think about it then none of what i propose should be all that surprising monetary policy conducted by open market operations in treasurys is meant to stabilize prices especially consumer prices but that s a blunt instrument monetary policy conducted by augmented operations in mortgage instruments since 2008 is accordingly meant to stabilize prices too but now more specifically mortgage prices and strategic oil and other commodity reserves often are used and in some cases are expressly designed to be used with a view to stabilizing yet other more specific prices commodity prices all we d be doing then in having our central bank short commodities while refraining from tightening up credit would be having it do what it s always expected to do stabilize prices in particular systemically important prices let s do that now for the year ahead even as we work double time to restore the capacity requisite to keeping prices low in the decades ahead the capacity once again to produce
kenya s monetary policy committee mpc meeting held on wednesday resolved to keep interest rates at 7per cent to support economic recovery the committee noted that inflation was cooling off with december readings dropping to 5 7 per cent the biggest inflationary pressure was coming from higher global oil prices the mpc noted that it expects inflation to remain within a target of 5per cent in 2022 as the government moves to lower electricity tariffs and stabilize oil prices the mpc report indicated that the kenyan economy has rebounded strongly and is set to accelerate in 2022 with the kenya shilling trading at 113 55 against the us dollar export activity is expected to grow significantly in 2022 this is expected to strengthen the kenya shilling in return in the us the federal open market committee fomc completed its monthly meeting on wednesday the fed chose to retain rates at the 0 1 0 25 per cent range and deal with ending its asset purchase program by march in preparation for a rate hike this was agreed amid pressures that inflation had hit 7 per cent a 40 year high and that it was hurting household budgets the forward guidance by the fomc has led to optimism in the forex market which has strengthened the dollar in anticipation of the much awaited interest rate hike in six weeks the us stock market has tanked in the last three weeks as the withdrawal of stimulus and quantitative easing funds take effect on overpriced tech stocks the sp500 index has dropped 9 31 per cent the dow jones index 6 61 per cent and the nasdaq 14 11 per cent since the beginning of the year investors are worried that the current prices are indicating a bear market for us stocks and that the market correction could continue diving the us stock market has turned into a stock pickers territory as some individual stocks continue thriving in the chaos the clearest highlight is in the energy sector where stocks have made double digit gains since the beginning of the year to mention but a few chevron corporation is up 13 per cent exxon mobil 21 per cent schlumberger 32 per cent and conocophillips 20per cent year to date ytd this is mainly because of us west texas intermediate wti oil rallying 15 55 per cent ytd and brent oil rallying 13 70per cent ytd with global oil demand growth amid the easing of covid 19 restrictions and rapid economic activity oil prices are expected to break the 90 barrier and hit 100 per barrel in 2022 some individual stocks have made an impressive start to the year with double digit gains despite the overall market being bearish for instance las vegas sands has rallied 17per cent ytd amid speculation that macau china will extend its license by 10 years activision blizzard the gaming company that owns call of duty and candy crush has rallied 18per cent ytd after microsoft announced it will acquire it for an estimated 69 billion looking at the red side moderna has made a highlight as its stock plummeted 38 99per cent ytd amid the easing of omicron variant fears the netherlands and the us have lowered covid 19 restrictions and mandates with denmark and france set to follow this is dampening demand for vaccines and could lead to a bigger selloff in vaccine stocks the european central bank ecb has maintained a hard stance that it is not looking to hike interest rates until december 2022 this is aimed at creating a fertile environment for economic recovery inflation remains at 5 per cent and is expected to drop to 4 7per cent next month since the eurozone asset purchase programme is set to continue until december this year and the us is set to end its own in march investors are strongly betting that the eurusd currency pair will continue plummeting through the year the euro has already lost 1 60 per cent against the us dollar since the 1st of january 2022 more volatility in the forex markets is expected in the year as major central banks embark on monetary policies to stimulate economic growth while checking inflation not to overheat their respective economies potential goldmines lie in sectors that can thrive in high inflation environments and high interest periods as global stocks continue plummeting investors will be looking to buy them at discounted prices this could include selecting stocks in the consumer staples sector energy sector technology sector banking industry aerospace and defense stocks luxury goods stocks and healthcare stocks economies that hold interest rates and continue their asset purchase programmes for longer might experience stronger stock markets but significantly higher inflation on the other hand economies that hike rates and end their asset purchase programmes might experience huge stock market corrections but a stronger currency the technology sector took a big hit last year and is continuing to plummet this year at some point i expect the tech stocks to be so cheap that investors will no longer ignore the rates to optimise opportunity investors will be looking to accumulate stocks that have demonstrated a strong revenue and earnings growth over the last eight quarters investors will also be considering the industry strength where the individual stock is operating as well as the industry s compounded annual growth rate understanding these metrics and fundamental changes in the global financial markets will be crucial to identifying trading opportunities and thus a market beating portfolio return

several conservative mps have made an appearance at the freedom convoy rally in ottawa that began on jan 29 giving their support to the truckers who oppose the federal covid 19 mandates and restrictions while others didn t attend but said they back the effort the truckers i ve met today have been peaceful kind and patriotic mp pierre poilievre mp pierre poilievre wrote on twitter on jan 29 in a video recorded at the event poilievre elaborated on what the rally stands for it s a rally for truckers but it s also a rally for the 60 percent of canadians who said they were worried they can t afford food it s for the 60 year old small businesses man who spent his entire adult life building up an enterprise and watching it wiped out it s for the depressed 14 year old who s been locked out of school it s for the families that can t take it anymore it s for the people that want to stand up and speak for their freedoms it s for all those our government and media have insulted and left behind it s for the people who worked hard to put food on our table and stock our shelves and make this country work and that s why we are gathered here today he said freedom not fear truckers not trudeau mp leslyn lewis wrote on twitter on jan 29 great to see so many law abiding patriotic canadians peacefully expressing their love for this country and democracy people of all ages faiths races from all walks of life united for freedom the freedom convoy began as a protest against the federal government s covid 19 vaccine mandate for truck drivers crossing the canada u s border but has since expanded to a call for all covid 19 restrictions to be lifted the first convoy set off from the west coast on jan 23 and more trucks join from across the country converging in ottawa this weekend for a massive demonstration that will likely continue into next week smaller rallies are being held in other cities at the same time the ottawa rally also received support from saskatchewan premier scott moe who said in a statement that truckers deserve a special thank you for their services that kept the selves stocked and the economy going throughout the covid 19 pandemic to raise these important cross border supply chain issues my message is simple it s time for some common sense he wrote on twitter alberta premier jason kenney was in washington d c on the weekend in part on jan 22 the biden administration initiated vaccination requirements for non u s nationals entering the country who are not vaccinated including canadian truck drivers conservative leader erin o toole met with truckers on jan 28 but didn t attend the rally i support their right to be heard and i call on justin trudeau to meet with these hard working canadians to hear their concerns he said in a twitter post mp damien kurek brought a container of coffee to the rally to show our appreciation for hardworking patriotic truckers who have kept our supply chains healthy grocery shelves stocked for the past two years he wrote on twitter tory mp michael cooper along with a demonstrator carrying a flag with a nazi symbol on it was caught on camera behind cooper while the latter was doing a tv interview cooper later issued a statement saying he wasn t associated with the person carrying the flag whoever flew this flag is personally responsible for that reprehensible decision and should be eternally ashamed of him or herself he wrote he or she does not represent the thousands of peaceful protesters who waved canadian flags and acted responsibly i stand with them and will continue to fight for them several conservative mps backed cooper and also pushed back against reports that frame the freedom convoy and its participants as far right extremists tory mp garnett genuis retweeted cooper s statement and said it was pretty bizarre that some in the media are trying to blame him even though he wasn t aware the flag was behind him it is pretty bizarre that supposedly serious people are trying to blame michael for the fact that someone he doesn t know walked into the camera shot behind him while he was doing an interview genuis wrote on twitter former conservative mp stockwell day also criticized the media for amplifying the conduct of the few wrongdoers among thousands of well behaved protesters in 40 of politics i have never seen main stream media so united against any protest group in such a disgusting way if there is one violent protester or one physical threat that will be all the media reports day wrote on twitter people s party of canada leader and former cabinet minister maxime bernier attended the rally on both jan 29 and jan 30 we will regain our freedom in 2022 he said in a video posted on twitter today we are doing something that will be in the history books conservative mp john williamson issued a statement in support of the convoy and the truckers call to end restrictions the trucker convoy dubbed the freedom convoy even by a mostly unwelcoming media became a symbol for pandemic fatigue and i believe growing opposition to illiberal restrictions on canadians he wrote truckers were called unsung heroes at the start of the pandemic i believe canadian truckers are still our heroes after almost two years living with covid 19 they keep canada moving and i am adding my voice to the belief that it is time to end lockdown restrictions

brent crude touched 90 per barrel briefly this week for the first time in years this latest jump was attributed to tensions around ukraine but this is the most transitory reason for oil price rises the bigger reasons all have to do with fundamentals and 90 per barrel of brent may be only the beginning a lot has been written recently about opec s spare capacity and the not too rosy outlook for it that spare capacity is in decline for several reasons but chief among them appears to be underinvestment as a result jp morgan earlier this month warned that brent could rise to 125 per barrel as opec s spare production capacity falls to 4 percent of total capacity by the fourth quarter of 2022 the international energy agency has gone even further warning opec spare capacity could fall by half to just 2 6 million bpd in the second half of the year the agency then went on to say that if demand continues to grow strongly or supply disappoints the low level of stocks and shrinking spare capacity means that oil markets could be in for another volatile year in 2022 it is not just opec however the biggest non opec producer of oil and biggest oil producer globally is pumping less than it can pressure from shareholders on public oil majors in the united states has increased as has an insistence that companies focus on greening up their operations instead of looking for more oil and gas to extract as a result the u s is pumping less oil than it could and many would argue should as a result the stage seems set for another expensive year in oil which happens to coincide with an expensive year overall as central banks begin tightening monetary policies in response to stubborn inflation that like the iea s oil demand forecasts from the early days of the pandemic proved to be far from the transitory glitch the fed said it was last year the oil market is heading for simultaneously low inventories low spare capacity and still low investment morgan stanley analysts wrote in a note cited by the wall street journal this week summing up the situation quite nicely in this situation 90 for a barrel of brent may be just the beginning related shell s gas trading booms while oil trading slows indeed the wall street consensus seems to be that brent will reach 100 by the summer because of all the reasons listed by morgan stanley and also because breakeven costs are also on the rise thanks to inflation trends and labor shortages at least in the united states yet the biggest driver of prices will remain physical demand the international energy agency admitted physical oil demand has proven stronger than previously expected in its latest oil market report based on this surprising turn of events the iea revised up its 2022 oil demand forecast by 200 000 bpd and based on its track record it might well turn out it has once again underestimated demand robustness even with this estimate oil demand will not only return to pre pandemic levels but exceed them reaching 99 7 million bpd by the end of the year in such a situation higher prices for oil are all but certain since there is precious little bar another round of lockdowns which is highly unlikely anyone can do about them the question then becomes how high oil can go before it begins to go down the answer is tricky u s public oil companies are still beholden to their shareholders who seem to be taking to heart forecasts that oil has no long term future they have limited space for doing what they want private companies will be drilling as wti continues climbing higher and opec will be drilling as well but it may choose to keep controls on production rather than switching to pump at will mostly because only a few opec members actually have the capacity to pump at will excessively high prices tend to discourage consumption regardless of the commodity whose prices are getting excessively high however there is a caveat and it is that the commodity must have a viable alternative to discourage consumption when prices rise too high judging from europe s nightmare autumn and winter this year alternatives to fossil fuels are not yet up to par this basically means that the impact of high oil prices on demand will be slow to manifest and slow to push prices down where does this leave the world the short answer is not in a good place higher oil prices will lift the prices of everything else and this is the last thing you want if you re a government when you re already struggling with inflation it may well be that the pandemic will end for good this year but the real fallout from it may only be starting to show advertisement by irina slav for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

this article originally published july 12 2017 by workers world remains timely in january 2022 as the u s threatens war at the russian border with ukraine and ramps up china baiting in an attempt to break up agreements being forged between nations seeking to remain independent of u s imperialism see also russia s demands challenge nato s threats workers world jan 5 the corporate media s constant use of cold war terminology to describe the meeting of the u s and russian presidents as a meeting of the two superpowers masks the present relationship of forces u s president donald trump and russian president vladimir v putin met at the group of 20 summit on july 7 2017 in hamburg germany old preconceptions and terms must be challenged in order to have an accurate view of the present international situation russia today as a capitalist country is not even a fifth rate economic power the russian economy is smaller than the economies of brazil south korea or canada according to world bank and international monetary fund measurements russia now ranks 12th globally in its gross domestic product this measurement is the market value of goods and services today s russian federation is a vastly different state socially politically economically and militarily from the union of soviet socialist republics of even 27 years ago it is important to understand what russia is today in order to understand the real intent of the constant russia baiting in the media in stockpiled nuclear weapons from the cold war the u s and the russian federation may have somewhat even nuclear firepower more than enough to incinerate the world in one launch but u s military expenditures are estimated at 36 to almost 50 of total global military expenditures russia s expenditures are 4 to 5 of the global total the pentagon maintains more than 800 military bases around the world and 300 000 troops stationed outside the u s russia has a naval base in syria and a few communication centers in former soviet republics the u s navy has 19 aircraft carriers each of which includes jet aircraft helicopters destroyers and nuclear subs russia has one 27 year old carrier propelled with oil fired boilers rather than a nuclear reactor russia s resources a target russia is a target of u s imperialism because of its vast resources eighty percent of russian exports abroad are now in raw materials primarily gas and oil the petroleum industry in russia is one of the largest in the world it is the largest exporter of natural gas coal iron aluminum precious metals lumber and cereals are other major exports this makes russia s economy especially vulnerable to global commodity swings and drastic downturns there is an insatiable drive to control russia s great wealth by the largest banks and corporations all currents of the u s and western imperialist ruling class are desperate to have unlimited access to this great stream of profits which they had finally laid their hands on just a few years ago remember imperialism s very survival depends on expansion and profit photo ops handshakes and reports of cooperation at the g20 meeting do not change or lessen u s imperialism s desperation to hammer down any form of resistance to its global domination any country attempting independent development is immediately targeted there is an irresolvable contradiction between the need of the majority of countries in the world to develop their productive forces and the need of wall street to maintain its place at the center of the world economy however washington s position is clearly slipping despite daily military threats that assert its global dominance new russian capitalists privatization campaigns of the 1990s facilitated the transfer of significant soviet era wealth to a relatively small group of russian business oligarchs these pirates were willing to make the most corrupt deals with the west to maintain their stolen wealth as long as russian politicians and privateers were totally compliant with the devastating looting of the country they were showered with glowing media coverage the group of 7 the largest imperialist countries invited russia to join the problem for the new capitalist oligarchs is that when the soviet state was overthrown there was no room for a new capitalist power in the global economy all the banks and multinational corporations aggressively moved in to take advantage of the chaos after the collapse of the soviet union u s imperialism and the western imperialist powers expected to have totally free rein to loot russia at will for almost 15 years they did have a free hand the results in russia were devastating cost of capitalist restoration seumas milne a british journalist with the guardian news summarized stephen f cohen s book the failed crusade on this transition to a capitalist economy cohen is professor emeritus of russian studies at new york university and princeton university in the most cataclysmic peacetime economic collapse of an industrial country in history nder the banner of reform and the guidance of american prescribed shock therapy perestroika became catastroika capitalist restoration brought in its wake mass pauperization and unemployment wild extremes of inequality rampant crime virulent anti semitism and ethnic violence combined with legalized gangsterism on a heroic scale and precipitous looting of public assets by the late 1990s national income had fallen by more than 50 the market experiment has produced more orphans than russia s wartime casualties while epidemics of cholera and typhus have re emerged millions of children suffer from malnutrition and adult life expectancy has plunged the 1990s was a downhill slide from a centralized publicly owned economy to robber baron capitalism for developing countries in particular the destruction of the second superpower which had championed the anti colonial movement and later the third world cause largely closed off the scope for different alliances and sources of aid and sharply increased their dependence on the west ngos as western missionaries into the economic chaos and social dislocation came not only western bankers stockbrokers real estate schemers and speculators every major corporation including rockefeller ford and the soros foundations religious groups and the u s agency for international development lavishly funded nongovernmental organizations these ngos set up staffs and funded schools religious organizations and publications to promote capitalist values western democracy and civil society and to glorify competition and private property they wrote property laws and textbooks and were thoroughly enamored with western capitalism the yale center for the study of globalization reported there are at least 600 000 registered nongovernmental noncommercial organizations operating in russia in 2005 forces in the russian duma the elected assembly began a nationwide government campaign against foreign funded ngos in 2012 usaid was kicked out of russia the foreign agent law put 33 of russia s ngos out of business in 2013 nato expansion the bankers policy was about subjugating and recolonizing not only russia but all the countries of the former socialist bloc including the countries of eastern europe and the former soviet republics in order to lock this violent and chaotic transformation in place the u s commanded military alliance nato was expanded to include every east european country and former soviet republic right up to the borders of russia in 2013 14 this untenable absorption came to a crisis over u s and german attempts to totally seize ukraine during the years of violent transition to a capitalist economy the ukraine had still maintained deep economic ties and extensive trade with russia but it also had increasing ties to the european union the eu however would not settle for sharing ukraine with russia a total break was demanded by the bankers u s and eu seizure of ukraine when ukraine president viktor yanukovych was negotiating about ukraine s entrance into the eu the eu refused to allow ukraine to continue trading with russia it demanded that ukraine join nato this meant that the crimea the home of russia s black sea fleet and only warm water port would be handed over to nato to carry out a coup against the elected ukrainian government the euromaidan movement led by neoliberals and fascists received enormous western support and funding the reactionary movement seized the center of the capital kiev and held it for three months u s and west european media and politicians poured into the encampment with unanimous support despite russian and ukrainian government efforts to negotiate and a russian pledge of debt cancellation and new funds the elected ukraine government was labeled corrupt and overthrown by a fascist gang which seized government buildings on feb 22 2014 faced with the loss of its only warm water port russia took control of the small peninsula and the russian port in crimea fearing a wave of privatizations and quick industrial shutdowns that have come with every step of capitalist restructuring the workers movement in eastern ukraine the industrial heartland seized factories and communication centers in self defense against the fascist coup in kiev the result was that russia lost a major trading partner its sphere of economic relations became much smaller and it faced an all out effort at economic strangulation banks and sanctions economic sanctions imposed by the u s and eu at this time were specifically designed to hit russia in its energy sector where the country is most vulnerable suddenly no u s oil company could do business with russia nor could any companies sell drilling technology to access oil and gas reserves the sanctions restrict access to western financial markets u s banks cannot issue long term loans to russian businesses for energy focused projects russian state banks are now excluded from raising long term loans in the eu the u s also put sanctions on russian banks banning u s companies from receiving or loaning money to them all this was intended to force the new capitalists around putin to break with his policies and to submit to a total takeover to protect their own profits russia is now on the defensive and since 2014 it s been clear that the imperialists plan is total dismemberment strengthening the state sector under putin and tightening controls on foreign funded ngos and on capital flight out of the country were a matter of economic survival defense of syria the u s led effort to overturn the government in syria threatens to take another major trading partner away from russia russia s only naval facility on the mediterranean is in syria the appeal of the syrian government to russia for assistance after four years of war tens of thousands of mercenaries and funded extremist forces and a year of u s and 10 other countries bombing syria has now led to daily confrontations there is a broad agreement that if u s plans succeed in overturning the government in syria following the overturns that have occurred in iraq and libya then russia and iran are undeniably next on the list russia s assistance to syria is of a defensive character self defense is a critical link in the global axis of resistance based not on ideology but necessity without russian help syria would have fallen but with significant western funding for development blocked new avenues have opened russia is increasingly relying on china for loans is now providing 60 000 tons of wheat per month to venezuela and has canceled cuba s 30 billion soviet era debt the growing web of trade and economic relations among economic formations like brics brazil russia india china and south africa shanghai cooperation organization the bolivarian alliance for the peoples of our america alba and the chinese one belt one road proposal are all signs of growing efforts among many targeted countries to fight isolation and resist imperialist dismemberment during discussion about global warming at the g20 meeting it was the u s colossus that appeared increasingly isolated sole superpower status has not benefited population military expenditures continually drain every needed social program in the u s but they are extremely profitable for the largest corporations such as dyncorp international boeing lockheed martin and raytheon according to the world health organization u s life expectancy ranked 31st globally is one of the lowest in developed countries it is the same for basic education at 38th the united states ranks behind every major industrialized country the measures for infant mortality maternity care housing and infrastructure reflect the true cost at home of u s imperial ism s determination to loot the world
we are to listen carefully to the warnings of the watchmen but we are not to become obsessed with their warnings we re to gather all the knowledge we can about the coming storm so we can prepare our hearts for whatever destruction it brings however we are not to let fear or anxiety consume our thinking dominate our minds or take hold of our hearts darkness is certainly coming and judgment is at our very door as god s people though we cannot allow any cloud of darkness to hide the light of his great promises of love and mercy toward
raposo editor of jornalmudardevida net in which this article was published jan 26 refutes the conclusions of another article titled putin and xi jinping imperialism s favorites arguing they are enemies who serve the goals of imperialism by giving the imperialists a pretext for attack raposo s response serves to answer anyone on the left who tries to put an equal sign between russia and china on one side and the u s european union and japan on the other translation john catalinotto the world is being drawn into a new cold war the escalating conflicts over taiwan and ukraine are evidence of this the major powers are aligning forces forging alliances and preparing for confrontations that go beyond mere economic competition and may spill over into military confrontation what attitude should the anti capitalist and anti imperialist left have toward this issue is it possible to maintain a position of neutrality and equi distance without trying to understand who attacks and who is attacked who provokes conflicts and who defends themselves i would like to add a few notes some objections to what you say and some other considerations related to your article putin and xi jinping the favorites of imperialism the favorites not even ironically i think can it be said that putin and xi jinping are the favorites of imperialism imperialism s favorites are characters like boris yeltsin who practically destroyed russia and sold it piece by piece or the chinese tycoon jack ma who nurtures the ambition of opening the chinese economy to stock market speculation breaking state control over the chinese financial sector with the obvious consequence of handing it over to rapacious international finance in one case as well as the other these characters goals have failed in this the imperialist west has lost a battle and must for now be content to support navalny type garbage from russia or a defector like ai weiwei from china russia has been getting back on its feet after all and rebuilding its national sovereignty china keeps the most extreme gluttony of the big foreign and domestic capitalists in check for the time being and both extend help to the dependent countries these are the facts that panic the u s eu japan imperialist troika the triad as samir amin called it for a well known reason they threaten the triad s hegemony over the world aggressors and defenders to condemn some the u s for pursuing imperialist plans and being hypocrites and at the same time condemn others russia and china for being dictators and violators of human rights is a solomonic attitude that does not address the problem that the world faces today and in the face of which the revolutionary left must take sides the u s and its allies are always on the offensive to constrain undermine and if possible break up politically and territorially russia and china and the latter respond as they can to defend themselves from this siege the former attack the latter defend themselves from aggression without making this distinction nothing becomes clear and the revolutionary left is unable to play a role in events bypassing reality ukraine and nato the ukrainian issue began in 2014 with a coup promoted by the u s and the eu based on ukrainian fascist forces which overthrew a formally legitimate president and put in power a western agent this was followed by the request of the new ukrainian authorities for eu and nato membership the russian reaction whether in reclaiming crimea supporting the rebel republics of donetsk and lugansk or in applying military pressure now is a response to this squeeze moreover the squeeze extends to belarus and the recent wishes of georgia and even finland and sweden see the coincidence to join nato since 1990 despite the assurances given by ronald reagan and george h bush to the naïve gorbachev 14 eastern european countries have joined nato with gorbachev we had another true favorite of imperialism human rights after president jimmy carter in the late 1970s pulled the defense of human rights out of the hat imperialism started to practice the same acts of aggression as always but under a new guise and it has succeeded it must be acknowledged in neutralizing a large part of world public opinion which has been stunned by crimes disguised as good humanitarian actions aimed at overthrowing dictators who mistreat their own people do social problems in belarus or kazakhstan or elsewhere trigger popular protests certainly and rightly so but it would be very naïve not to see the interest and intervention overt or covert of the imperialist west in these events obviously the social problems within these countries cannot legitimize the political pressures economic sanctions or military actions of imperialism now it has been under the guise of human rights humanitarian aid etc that the triad has invoked the right to intervene wherever it wishes obviously doing so in a selective manner seeking whenever it can to change the regime in countries that escape its obedience and preserving the regimes of those within its sphere using this criterion yugoslavia iraq libya iran north korea venezuela bolivia are put under fire and israel saudi arabia the brazil of bolsonaro poland of the kaczynski brothers are kept under its wing to accuse the u s and its cronies of practicing empty rhetoric or holding protests without practical significance in the face of trampled human rights implies an inconsequence that these actions don t actually have and if taken literally such an accusation would force us to demand a consequence from them that is a greater and harsher intervention than they already carry out that would make sense if we take the humanitarian concerns of imperialism seriously but it makes no sense at all if we understand the human rights banner to be a mere tool to make moral gains with public opinion and thus get cover for interventions of force from sanctions to military action uighurs i have no inside information about what is going on in the chinese province of xinjiang with the uighur population what you hear and read around here comes almost exclusively from western governments and news agencies just a few days ago human rights watch created and based in the u s financed by rich donors came out in support of the u s campaign to boycott the winter olympics in china even pressuring the u n secretary general to go along with the campaign and here came the charges against the chinese government about the atrocities allegedly committed against the uighurs in this as in other matters i don t disregard what the chinese authorities say why should i believe western agencies who saw the weapons of mass destruction in iraq rather than believe what the chinese say even though they are a concerned party and what they say to me makes some sense the turkmen and muslim populated province of xinjiang on the border with the central asian countries and with afghanistan and pakistan has been the target of terrorist attacks with separatist goals that killed hundreds of people between late 1990 and 2014 the terrorist operatives were trained by al qaeda particularly in afghanistan part of the attacks were carried out by the turkestan islamic party an organization classified by the u n as terrorist the reaction of the chinese authorities was to eliminate the terrorist groups repress those suspected of collaborating with the separatists and promote actions to isolate those groups and suspects from the bulk of the population namely by creating isolation camps that the chinese call social reeducation centers or vocational training centers and that westerners for obvious reasons call concentration camps development this is the repressive side of the answer but the chinese authorities did not stop there they reinforced the region s economic and cultural development plans to remove the basis for the protests and separatist vehemence some figures xinjiang s per capita income is 7 868 while in the indian region of kashmir also muslim and also with a history of terrorism and separatism it is 1 342 from 2014 to 2019 xinjiang s gdp grew at an average annual rate of 7 2 school attendance is 99 91 and medical coverage is 99 7 maitreya bhakal rt july 2021 recently china has declared extreme poverty eliminated in xinjiang as in tibet will this policy of repression integration lead to the dilution of uighur identity in china as a whole as the well meaning western consciences lament perhaps it will but this is an inevitable path for any country that cherishes its independence china s national integrity political and territorial is a key factor for its independent development that is development without imperialist tutelage to claim that a genocide is taking place in xinjiang the term was coined by mike pompeo donald trump s secretary of state not only has no support in proven facts but has all the traits of another piece of the u s led campaign to demonize china if the opinion of the so called international community counts for anything the number of u n countries that have supported this china policy far outnumbers those that condemn it at the behest of the u s and the europeans hong kong the protests in hong kong have been given the status of a people s struggle for democracy it remains to be asked what this democracy is all about the social sectors that have engaged in the protests constitute a middle and not so middle class clinging to the privileges afforded to it by hong kong s special status as essentially a territory of speculative capitalism a banking center and world trade platform hong kong s service sector accounts for 86 5 of the territory s gdp and industry only 4 which accounts for the social disposition of the nearly 8 million inhabitants it is one of the richest areas in asia and the world with a per capita gdp of 37 191 compared to china s average of 8 840 2021 not surprising is the nostalgia for british colonization or the repeated call for u s intervention which the protesters never hid the movement was essentially a reaction against full integration of hong kong into china but beyond this internal origin with its own motivations there is something more the extremes the protests reached would have been impossible without the encouragement given to the movement from outside as was apparent still the case was handled with restraint by the chinese authorities not least because they evidently did not want to turn the protesters into pro democracy martyrs a figure above suspicion portuguese general garcia leandro former governor of macau said in 2019 portuguese news agency lusa beijing has maintained a great deal of restraint he added you get the feeling that there is a little hand from outside pushing there suspects i don t want to get into speculation but it s clear that there may be taiwan there there may be the united states there once again to not see or to devalue the hand of the west in the matter and to consider everything that happened as entirely genuine spontaneous and popular would be not only to ignore the facts but also to ignore that practically all social movements practically everywhere in the world are inevitably overshadowed by the interests and hegemony of the triad as comparisons also speak the heavy sentences for the hong kong activists crimes of opinion are a far cry from the punishment of persecution character destruction and possible life imprisonment meted out by the u s and its acolytes to julian assange met with silence from almost the entire journalistic community and from the self appointed defenders of human rights smoke screens i have no doubt that the revival of a revolutionary and internationalist workers movement would be the last thing the western imperialist powers wish for but is it this fear that leads them to make putin and xi jinping their favorites as much as the revolutionary left may wish for this revival that is not the reality we are faced with the possibility that in the short term the international proletariat will have a say in world events is practically nil precisely because of this imperialism can make russia china iran venezuela cuba etc the permanent targets of its attacks without fearing a massive organized international response from the peoples and workers in the face of this weakness of the revolutionary forces the anti imperialist and anti capitalist left cannot invent pleasant future scenarios and evade taking a position in the face of present events what is at stake today is the imperialist offensive against the assertion of russia and china for independence this is vital not only because of these two countries in themselves but because this opens up prospects of new directions for many of the dependent countries that until now saw no way of escaping imperialist tutelage the support of russia for syria or china for african and south american countries even with obvious economic interest on china s part or both for iran and venezuela are examples of this it is this joint movement that threatens to reverse the world balance of power that has prevailed since world war ii it is in the face of this conflict and not another future imaginable or desirable one that the anti capitalist left has to define itself i see only one possible definition support anything that contributes to the sinking of triad imperialism particularly its head the u s and this clearly implies supporting russia and china and the other resistant countries insofar as their politics mean a fight against the hegemony of the triad this definition is all the more obligatory since i am convinced it will be in the breaches opened by this confrontation that the anti capitalist left will find the path to renew and re energize the international revolutionary movement that the current epoch lacks

showed that remestemcel l treatment was associated with 64 survival in children with biomarker levels predictive for highest mortality compared with only 10 survival p 0 01 in matched controls treated with other available therapies including ruxolitinib or other biologics these data provide strong supporting evidence that the proposed anti inflammatory and immunomodulatory mechanism of action of remestemcel l is responsible for the improved survival in patients with sr agvhd mesoblast has now generated substantial new data that it believes establish the relevance of the proposed potency assay measuring remestemcel l s in vitro anti inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity to the in vivo clinical effect of the product in the phase 3 trial in children with sr agvhd including survival and biomarkers of in vivo activity mesoblast will provide these new data to otat and address all other outstanding items as required for resubmission of the bla mesoblast continues to be in a well

25 years ago constitutional coup removes ecuador president on february 6 1997 ecuadorian president abdala bucaram was ousted by a congressional vote charging him with mental incapacity in the course of the week three different people claimed to be legitimately in charge of the south american country bucaram who referred to himself as el loco or the crazy one because of his unconventional behavior on the campaign trail and in office refused to recognize the vote the move came after a month of street protests and a two day general strike against austerity measures that had been imposed on orders from the international monetary fund imf both his vice president rosalia arteaga and fabian alarcon the head of congress claimed the right of succession to bucaram who himself denounced the congressional vote as illegal as in most political crises in ecuador s modern history the dispute was resolved through the intervention of the military and behind the scenes machinations of the united states embassy the army announced that it would no longer accept bucaram s orders arteaga was installed for two days and alarcon then formed a new government elected six months earlier on the basis of a populist campaign bucaram quickly adopted an extremely stringent economic austerity package raising electricity telephone and public transit prices while proposing the wholesale privatization of state owned enterprises banks and investment firms hailed the measures bidding up the price of government bonds bucaram apparently antagonized the multinational corporations however with demands for bribes and the imposition of new tariff duties this prompted an all but open demand from the us embassy for his ouster speaking to a group of ecuadorian businessmen in january us ambassador leslie alexander denounced the government and declared unless a dramatic attack is rapidly made on the systematic corruption now afflicting this country it will be my duty to officially warn my fellow citizens of the dangers of investing here while alarcon temporarily rescinded some of bucaram s most extreme economic policies there was little doubt that he would quickly move to impose another restructuring plan that would meet the requirements of the imf 50 years ago massive blizzard devastates iran beginning on february 3 1972 the deadliest blizzard in recorded history hit iran an estimated 4 000 people were killed by the storm and tens of thousands were made refugees hundreds of towns were completely buried in snow three villages kakkan kumar and sheklab were totally destroyed with no survivors the blizzard came after an extended period of drought that had lasted four years but rather than being relieved by rain the drought was followed by a weeklong snowstorm that covered the entire country in areas typically known for their arid and warm climate temperatures dropped to as low as 13 degrees fahrenheit with snow accumulating to a depth of 10 feet and even as much as 26 feet after a week of constant snowfall rescue teams were deployed by helicopter to villages but storms resumed on february 11 forcing rescue teams to evacuate rather than continue attempts to dig out survivors the teams resorted to dropping containers of food and other supplies in hopes survivors could recover them the blizzard exposed the deep poverty and economic backwardness of iranian society after decades of us domination under the brutal regime of the shah reza pahlavi which siphoned off the nation s oil and gas wealth to international corporations and a thin layer of the iranian elite lacking infrastructure to deal with a winter storm villagers were left with no option but to shelter in their homes while the snow piled up around trapping them inside surviving iranians then faced food shortages as transportation and shipping was held back for weeks after the storm 75 years ago top stalinist agent arrested in the us in early stages of cold war on february 4 1947 gerhart eisler was arrested at his new york home and taken to ellis island prison as an enemy alien two days later he was brought before the house un american affairs committee huac which demanded that he answer questions about his relationship with the us communist party cp when he refused eisler was charged with trumped up immigration offenses the german citizen was alleged to be one of the leading agents of the soviet union in the us eisler had been in europe during the war and was detained in nazi occupied france shortly after the nazis annulled the stalin hitler pact with their 1941 invasion of the soviet union eisler escaped europe and was granted refuge in the us his entry under conditions of restrictive immigration policies which would have ordinarily prevented him from admission coincided with the beginning of a wartime alliance between the soviet union and the allied imperialist powers the fbi closely monitored eisler but made no attempt to block his activities he was a well known political figure having in 1919 helped to establish the austrian communist party then a genuine revolutionary organization he was involved in significant factional conflicts in the german communist party in the 1920s eisler aligned himself with the stalinist bureaucracy which usurped power from the soviet working class and carried out a brutal campaign against those who had led the russian revolution including leon trotsky in the mid 1920s eisler was dispatched by stalin to china where he oversaw purges of trotsky s supporters from the communist party and assisted in imposing a class collaborationist program that led to the defeat of the 1925 27 chinese revolution he was reportedly dubbed the executioner in october 1946 louis budenz a former stalinist turned right wing anti communist publicly claimed that eisler though not a member of the american cp controlled it with directives right from the kremlin s mouth the apparent shift in the us government s attitude to eisler coincided with the first stages of the cold war as american imperialism sought to guarantee its hegemony in war ravaged europe and worldwide including through aggressive confrontation with the soviet union eisler was charged with several offenses with his legal appeals exhausted he fled to britain in 1949 and then on to east germany in whose stalinist regime he served as a functionary until his death two decades later 100 years ago james joyce s ulysses published on february 2 1922 sylvia beach s shakespeare and co in paris published james joyce s modernist novel ulysses the book was printed in an edition of 2 000 by maurice darantiere in lyon february 2 was also the irish novelist s 40th birthday the novel is widely regarded as one of the main works of the modernist movement in literature that included a wide range of authors of several nationalities andre gide in france the americans t s eliot and ezra pound as well as virginia woolf e m forster and d h lawrence in the united kingdom among others literary modernism often emphasized the disjunctive states of consciousness of characters the movement was powerfully affected by the carnage of the first world war in addition to the work of psychoanalyst sigmund freud and the irrationalism of philosopher friedrich nietzsche ulysses takes place in a single day june 16 1904 in dublin and shows the internal lives of several characters such as leopold bloom molly bloom and stephen dedalus the protagonist of joyce s novel a portrait of the artist as a young man 1916 chapters of ulysses are modeled on books of the ancient greek epic poem homer s odyssey ulysses is the latin version of the name of the protagonist of the odyssey odysseus because of the novel s sexual frankness it encountered frequent censorship and was the cause of lawsuits it also became a cause celebre in the defense of freedom of expression ulysses was banned in 1921 in the united states after a part of it was published in the little review and it was not until a judge in the united states ruled that the work was not obscene after a second trial in 1934 that the work could be circulated in an english speaking country it was banned in the united kingdom until 1936 and it was not available in ireland until the 1960s

d cl logistics like so many american firms had a problem last year its business fulfilling orders of goods sold online faced surging demand but competition for warehouse workers was fierce wages were rising and staff turnover was high so dcl made two changes it bought robots to pick items off shelves and place them in boxes and it reduced its reliance on part time workers by hiring more full time staff what we save in having temp employees we lose in productivity explains dave tu dcl s president full time payroll has doubled in the past year to 280 listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element as american companies enter another year of uncertainty the workforce has become bosses principal concern chief executives cite worker shortages as the greatest threat to their businesses in 2022 according to a survey by the conference board a research organisation on january 28th the labour department reported that firms had spent 4 more on wages and benefits in the fourth quarter year on year a rise not seen in 20 years paycheques of everyone from mcdonald s burger flippers to citi group bankers are growing fatter this goes some way to explaining why profit margins in the s p 500 index of large companies which have defied gravity in the pandemic are starting to decline on february 2nd meta spooked investors by reporting a dip in profits due in part to a rise in employee related costs as it moves from facebook and its sister social networks into the virtual reality metaverse at the same time firms of all sizes and sectors are testing new ways to recruit train and deploy staff some of these strategies will be temporary others may reshape american business the current jobs market looks extra ordinary by historical standards december saw 10 9m job openings up by more than 60 from december 2019 just six workers were available for every ten open jobs see chart 1 predictably many seem comfortable abandoning old positions to seek better ones this is evident among those who clean bedsheets and stock shelves as well as those building spreadsheets and selling stocks in november 4 5m workers quit their jobs a record even if rising wages and an ebbing pandemic lure some of them back to work the fight for staff may endure for decades american firms slurped from a deepening pool of labour as more women entered the workforce and globalisation greatly expanded the ranks of potential hires that expansion has now mostly run its course says andrew schwedel of bain a consultancy simultaneously other trends have conspired to make the labour pool shallower than it might have been men continue to slump out of the job market the share of men aged 25 to 54 either working or looking for work was 88 at the end of last year down from 97 in the 1950s immigration which plunged during donald trump s nativist presidency has sunk further to less than a quarter of the level in 2016 and covid 19 may have prompted more than 2 4m baby boomers into early retirement according to the federal reserve bank of st louis these trends will not reverse quickly boomers won t sprint back to work en masse with republicans hostile to outsiders and democrats squabbling over visas for skilled ones a surge in immigration looks unlikely some men have returned to the workforce since the depths of the covid recession in 2020 but the male participation rate has plateaued below pre pandemic levels a tight labour market may persist both workers and employers are adapting for the most part they are doing so outside the construct of collective bargaining despite a flurry of activity starbucks baristas in buffalo and amazon workers in alabama will hold union votes in february unions remain weak last year 10 3 of american workers were unionised matching the record low of 2019 within the private sector the unionisation rate is just 6 1 strikes and pickets will be a headache for some bosses but it is quits that could cause them sleepless nights pay as they go companies most straightforward tactic to deal with worker shortages is to raise pay if firms are to part with cash they prefer the inducements to be one off rather than recurring and sticky as with higher wages that explains a proliferation of fat bonuses before the christmas rush amazon began offering workers a 3 000 sign on sweetener compensation for lawyers at america s top 50 firms rose by 16 5 last year in part thanks to bonuses according to a survey by citigroup and hildebrandt a consultancy in january bank of america said it would give staff 1bn in restricted stock which vests over time but base pay is rising too bank of america says it will raise its minimum wage to 25 by 2025 in september walmart america s largest private employer set its minimum wage at 12 an hour below many states requirement of 13 14 but well above the federal minimum wage of 7 25 amazon has lifted average wages in its warehouses to 18 the average hourly wage for production and nonsupervisory employees in december was 5 8 above the level a year earlier compared with a 4 7 jump for all private sector workers firms face pressure to lift them higher still high inflation ensured that only workers in leisure and hospitality saw a real increase in hourly pay last year see chart 2 raising compensation may not on its own be sufficient for companies to overcome the labour squeeze however this is where the other strategies come in starting with changes to recruitment to deal with the fact that for some types of job there simply are not enough qualified candidates to fill vacancies many businesses are loosening hiring criteria previously deemed a prerequisite the share of job postings that list no experience required more than doubled from january 2020 to september 2021 reckons burning glass an analytics firm easing rigid preconditions may be sensible even without a labour shortage a four year degree argues joseph fuller of harvard business school is an unreliable guarantor of a worker s worth the business roundtable and the us chamber of commerce two business groups have urged companies to ease requirements that job applicants have a four year university degree advising them to value workers skills instead another way to deal with a shortage of qualified staff is for firms to impart the qualifications themselves in september the most recent month for which burning glass has data the share of job postings that offer training was more than 30 higher than in january 2020 new providers of training are proliferating from university run bootcamps to short term programmes by specialists such as general assembly and big employers themselves employers in buffalo have hired general assembly to run data training schemes for local workers who are broadly able but who lack specific tech skills google a technology giant says it will consider workers who earn its online certificate in data analytics for example to be equivalent to a worker with a four year degree besides revamping recruitment and training companies are modifying how their workers work some positions are objectively bad with low pay unpredictable scheduling and little opportunity for growth zeynep ton of the mit sloan school of management contends that making low wage jobs more appealing improves retention and productivity which supports profits in the long term as interesting as walmart s pay increases she argues are the retail behemoth s management changes last year it said that two thirds of the more than 565 000 hourly workers in its stores would work full time up from about half in 2016 they would have predictable schedules week to week and more structured mentorship other companies may take note many of the complaints raised by labour organisers at starbucks and amazon have as much to do with safety and stress on the job as they do wages or benefits companies that cannot find enough workers are trying to do with fewer of them sometimes that means trimming services many hotel chains including hilton have made daily housekeeping optional we ve been very thoughtful and cautious about what positions we fill darren woods boss of exxonmobil told the oil giant s investors on february 1st increasingly this also involves investments in automation orders of robots last year surpassed the pre pandemic high in both volume and value according to the association for advancing automation ups a shipping firm is boosting productivity with more automated bagging and labelling new electronic tags will eliminate millions of manual scans each day new business models are pushing things along consider mcentire produce in columbia south carolina each year more than 45 000 tonnes of sliced lettuce tomatoes and onions move through its factory workers pack them in bags place bags in boxes and stack boxes on pallets destined for fast food restaurants mcentire has raised wages but staff turnover remains high even as worker costs have climbed the upfront expense of automation has sunk so the firm plans to install new robots to box and stack it will lease these from a new company called formic which offers robots at an hourly rate that is less than half the cost of a mcentire worker doing the same job by 2025 mcentire wants to automate 60 of its volume with robots handling the back breaking work and workers performing tasks that require more skill one new position introduced in the past year looks permanent a manager whose sole job is to listen to and support staff so they do not quit for more

still good any news very good yeah the highfliers are getting killed but the value stocks are doing great you re up about 10 million from rags to riches hero to villain the past year had been the best time in history to be one of america s 745 billionaires whose cumulative wealth has grown by an estimated 70 per cent since the beginning of the pandemic even as tens of millions of low wage workers have lost their jobs or their homes together those 745 billionaires are now worth more than the bottom 60 per cent of american households combined and each day cooperman could see that gap widening on his balance sheet up an average of us4788 a minute in the sharemarket us1 9 million a day and us700 million total last year as a record amount of wealth continued to shift towards a tiny fraction of people at the pinnacle of the economy cooperman could sense something else shifting too billionaires shouldn t even exist in america read one note he d received after he went on tv to recommend stock picks one day we re coming after all of you with pitchforks read another message wake up moron you and your insatiable greed are at the root of our biggest societal problems he responded to most of the personal emails kept record of the occasional death threats and wrote letters to politicians such as democratic senator elizabeth warren independent senator bernie sanders and democratic representative alexandria ocasio cortez whenever they criticised billionaires in their speeches because he couldn t understand what exactly had he done wrong what rule had he broken he d been born to poor immigrant parents on the losing end of a capitalist economy he d attended public schools taken on debt to become the first in his family to attend college worked 80 hour weeks made smart decisions benefited from some good luck amassed a fortune for himself and for his clients and paid hundreds of millions in taxes to the government he had a wife of 57 years two successful children and three grandchildren who were helping him decide how to give most of his money away to a long list of charities my life is the story of the american dream he d said while accepting an award at one charity gala and he d always imagined himself as the rags to riches hero only to now find himself cast as the greedy villain in a story of economic inequality run amok and now came another series of emails from a stranger who ran a charity in new jersey she said billionaires were avoiding paying their fair share of taxes by using loopholes in the tax code she said their legacy of excessive wealth was burdening future generations she said cooperman had no idea what it was like to live in poverty or to choose each month between paying rent or buying food she makes decent points cooperman said as he read the email again and it made him think back to a question he d begun wondering about himself in a time of historic inequality what were the moral responsibilities of a billionaire advertisement thank you for your emails it might be helpful for me to provide you with some background about myself he wrote back and then he attached a short biography and copies of his letters to politicians there seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of who i am not like the other billionaires he knew what people imagined when they thought of a billionaire he d read the stories of excess and extravagance and witnessed some of it firsthand but that wasn t him he didn t spend us238 million on a new york penthouse like hedge fund manager ken griffin or vacation at his own private island in belize like bill gates or throw himself us10 million birthday parties featuring camels and acrobats like investor stephen schwarzman or drop us70 000 a year on hair care like donald trump or buy a preserved 14 foot shark for an estimated us8 million like steven cohen or spend more than us1 billion on art like media mogul david geffen or budget us23 million for personal security like facebook did for mark zuckerberg he didn t have his own spaceships like elon musk and jeff bezos or a 600 foot 183m flying airship like sergey brin or a decommissioned soviet fighter jet like larry ellison or a us215 million yacht with a helipad and a pool like steve wynn or a private train with three staterooms like john paul dejoria or a us5 million luxury car collection like kylie jenner what cooperman had for transport was a 25 year old schwinn bicycle he liked to ride around the neighborhood and a hyundai he used for running errands a few times each week he rechecked the stock graph on his screen and picked up his phone to call his wife toby who was sitting in her office suite down the hall i m going to head out and grab some of those costco lamb chops later he told her we need anything else she asked i don t think so he said i ll just see what s on special they d been together since they met at hunter college in 1962 when tuition at the public new york university cost as little as us24 a semester and the promise of a life in america was that each generation would surpass the one before she was the daughter of a struggling pillowcase salesman from romania he was the son of a plumber s apprentice who emigrated from poland at age 13 never finished high school worked six days a week and later died of a heart attack while carrying a sink up the stairs to a fourth story apartment advertisement his father left behind an estate worth less than us100 000 but cooperman also inherited his father s belief that the economic ladder between poor and rich was short enough to climb with determination and hard work my phd is for poor hungry and driven more than 90 per cent of children born in the united states during the 1940s would go on to out earn their parents two thirds of those born into poverty would rise into at least the middle class cooperman waited tables during the summers worked for xerox while he went to business school at night and then started as an analyst at goldman sachs making us12 500 a year my phd is for poor hungry and driven he liked to say he told colleagues that capitalism was like a battle for survival in the african safari and that the key to success was to adopt the mind set of a lion or a gazelle during a hunt when the sun comes up you d better be running cooperman told them within nine years he d been named a partner within a decade he was a millionaire together he and toby had learned how to be rich which mostly meant deciding how not to spend their money he still felt most comfortable shopping for clothes wholesale and commuting to work on new jersey public transit toby enjoyed her job as a special education teacher even if she didn t need the us25 an hour so she continued working and donated her salary back to the school they bought a house for us325 000 in new jersey in the 1980s and later built their us5 million home in florida they worried about demotivating their two children by giving them a huge inheritance so instead they put a small fraction of their wealth into a trust that could be accessed only once their sons turned 35 at which point one was already a successful businessman and the other was an environmental scientist with a phd cooperman eventually left goldman sachs to start his own hedge fund omega and for two decades he compounded his millions at an average of 14 per cent each year as the sharemarket soared until he and toby were among the wealthiest few hundred billionaires in the united states they were invited to dinner in 2010 by gates and warren buffett who had just started a program called the giving pledge asking billionaires to donate at least half their money to charity and the coopermans committed that night i could buy a picasso for a hundred million but it doesn t turn me on so then what cooperman told them we live a very rational lifestyle what better use is there for our money they d given away us150 million to a hospital in new jersey us50 million for college scholarships to newark high school students us40 million to columbia business school us40 million to hunter college us30 million to performing arts us25 million to the jewish family fund us20 million to skilled nursing us15 million to food banks and on and on it went but no matter how much they gave away their money continued to make more money even as wages for the middle class remained essentially flat in the past 50 years the gap between poor families and the top 0 1 per cent had increased more than tenfold children now had only a 43 per cent chance of out earning their parents mr cooperman your donation is needed to keep the american dream off life support read one of the dozens of solicitations he received each day mr cooperman more than 11 million american children are now living in poverty mr cooperman please help us provide clean drinking water advertisement mr cooperman the pandemic has left 60 million families at risk of losing their homes he who dies rich dies disgraced he donated to more than 50 organisations each year and also to a number of people who wrote to him in personal distress other than my family writing cheques is the most meaningful thing i do cooperman said and yet no matter how many zeros he included it left him wanting to do more we re going in the wrong direction in this country in so many depressing ways he said he believed in the meritocratic ideal of capitalism equal opportunity if not equal results he said but it seemed to him that the odds of success remained stacked by race by gender and increasingly by economic starting position rates of intergenerational poverty had gone up in each of the past three decades the most disadvantaged children were falling further behind he believed from his own experience that a college education was the best answer and yet tuition costs were continuing to skyrocket it s not exactly a fair system until you even up the odds he said and after looking over the list of worthy causes he and toby had decided that donating half of their money didn t feel sufficient sixty per cent wasn t enough to meet the country s needs neither was 75 so they d agreed to set up a family foundation that would eventually give away more than 90 per cent of their money and cooperman had decided that rather than retiring in earnest he would continue to manage their account so there would be more to give away he who dies rich dies disgraced read a quotation attributed to andrew carnegie on cooperman s office desk but on this day he was still rich and getting richer what s enough he wondered what s the answer he checked the stock graph on his screen up us2 6 million in the past five hours his accounts were equal to the average net worth of 23 000 middle class american families each day when the sharemarket closed at 4pm he checked the final numbers on his 40 stock holdings reviewed his investment strategy for the next day and then left for a two mile walk around the palm trees and putting greens of st andrews country club in boca raton the community was set off from the surrounding suburbs by a canal a gatehouse a 10 foot wall and an infrared security system a few of the 700 homes were owned by other billionaires and most others belonged to millionaires who wintered in florida all the residents had become richer during the pandemic as the luxury real estate market exploded and their home values surged by more than 40 per cent cooperman walked past an old designer home that was being torn down and rebuilt into a new designer home he continued up the road towards the clay tennis courts the spa and the terraced clubhouse a resident drove by in a new bentley and cooperman waved and then watched the us200 000 car drive on you get a lot of people who show off their wealth he said but i could buy and sell that guy 100 times he and toby had spent almost all their time during the pandemic within the gates of st andrews eating dinner outside at the clubhouse and playing cards with friends but every few days they liked to go for a drive once early in the pandemic they d driven to a quiet nearby park only to find more than 150 cars lined up in the parking lot as people waited for bags of canned goods at an impromptu food bank depressing and staggering in a country of such wealth cooperman said and it made him remember a poem his granddaughter had written and published when she was in middle school called seven miles about the physical proximity between the extreme wealth of short hills new jersey where cooperman had his other home and the extreme poverty in nearby newark at one end we have too much she d written at the other they have nothing spread it all just seven miles she d gone on to graduate phi beta kappa from stanford becoming an ultraliberal socialist type in favour of wealth redistribution cooperman said he adored her and admired both her empathy and her intellect but he d repeatedly fought against the liberal idea that one way to redistribute that wealth was to tax billionaires at a rate of 70 per cent or more he d written to senator warren about her soak the rich positions and to president barack obama about villainising success he was a registered independent and he d voted for joe biden in the last election because he considered president donald trump a would be dictator whose comportment in office was beyond disgraceful but cooperman believed most of all in the basic tenets of capitalism he d earned his money and therefore it was his to spend or give away he sent in a quarterly check for us10 million to the federal government in estimated taxes and said he paid an effective tax rate of 34 per cent he d told politicians in his letters that he was willing to pay more but he believed the highest effective tax rate should be no more than 50 per cent advertisement what made america great is our system of capitalism incentivising work and effort and ingenuity he d written capitalism has flaws but socialism has no benefits why not spread my work ethic instead of just my wealth the world isn t meant to be totally even now he looped around a cul de sac and turned back towards his house for years he d been doing these daily walks with his brother howard until he died in december at age 85 and lately cooperman had been thinking back over their lives cooperman had chosen to wake up at 5 15 each morning and devote 80 hours every week to his work taking off only the friday after thanksgiving his brother meanwhile had chosen not to go to college and then retired as soon as he could he preferred to play racquetball go to the casino with friends and volunteer as a wheelchair transporter at the hospital cooperman had ended up with his billions and his name on top of the hospital entrance his brother had died with relatively modest amounts of money but with a cellphone loaded with numbers for dozens of close friends we both got what we worked for cooperman said we were best friends and we admired what each other had but it would have been wrong to take what i earned and given it all over to him he walked up his circular driveway into the house and back towards his office different choices different outcomes he said the world isn t meant to be totally even his choice 12 more hours anchored to the chair in his office monitoring the market and calling in to his trading desk again and again as the sun reflected off the swimming pool outside his window the market fell the market rose he bought us3 million in distressed bonds he gave another us5 million away to charity he was us18 million up for the day he was us6 million down he was beating the market again by midmorning losing at lunch winning an hour later and then losing again does it make any sense he asked himself watching the numbers change on his screen to sit inside all day in front of a machine making money i don t need so i can give it to someone i don t know he d been wondering since his brother s death whether there were better ways to spend some of his time so one afternoon before the sharemarket closed he shut off his computer and drove a few miles outside the gates of st andrews to visit florida atlantic university the school s president had invited cooperman to speak to a group of low income college students about his career and his values believe it or not i have a great deal of commonality with all of you cooperman said as he stood at the lectern and looked out at the crowd of about 40 students from a university scholarship program much like the one cooperman and his wife had started in new jersey most were students of colour who had been born to immigrant parents all of them came from families with incomes of us30 000 or less the students had been living on campus during the pandemic as some of their families were upended by layoffs by evictions by a haitian earthquake by a dominican drought by coronavirus infections and covid 19 deaths i can understand some of the challenges you re facing right now cooperman said starting a short powerpoint presentation about his journey from a one bedroom apartment to the forbes 400 list of wealthiest americans advertisement i worked very hard i wanted to win he told them as he flipped to the next slide i m a great believer in capitalism he said we have the best economic system in the world the attack on wealthy people makes no sense how do you become wealthy he asked you develop a product or a service that people want the world is better off for a larry ellison a bill gates look at the jobs they created look at the good they did for the world the attack on wealthy people makes no sense to me i m giving the money away he said it s been my pledge and my wife s pledge to give it all away he finished going through the slides and then asked for questions after a while a student in the centre of the room raised her hand and waited for the microphone she said she was also interested in a career in business and she explained that one of the many barriers in her way was the start up cost in florida you need us200 she said you re going to need a lot more than that cooperman said i know she said i just mean two hundred to get the license the paperwork from zero cooperman looked at her for a moment and tried to imagine what it would mean to start again from zero and what it would be like to ascend from poverty to extreme wealth not in the 1960s but in 2022 when that gap had multiplied 10 times but he d occupied these students place in the american economy once his faith in the american dream required him to believe that they could one day occupy his i ll admit it s very hard he said it s gotten harder but the 99 per cent can still join the 1 percent it s possible with enough luck and commitment he told them about how he d got up each morning at 5 15 how he d chosen a job that he loved how he d got his phd in being poor hungry and driven how he d followed his instincts how he d attacked each day like a lion chasing a gazelle as he raced to the pinnacle of the economy and the 99 per cent receded behind him i can speak to the issues of both being rich and being poor he told them and as a billionaire in the bifurcating american economy there was one truth of which he felt certain being rich is better he said washington post
the workers party pt has marked the beginning of brazil s 2022 electoral year with a series of announcements meant to suggest that the party is intent on reversing the austerity imposed over the past five years the most significant claim is that if it returns to power the party will revoke the 2017 labor reform enacted under president michel temer the former vice president of the pt s dilma rousseff who succeeded her after the trumped up 2016 impeachment the reform widely expanded casual labor and provoked a massive reduction of wages at the same time it drastically cut funding for the demoralized unions leading many of them to fire scores of officials the increase in union funding is one of the central aims of the pt s so called revocation the party has also announced it will seek the revocation of the 20 year freeze on spending enshrined in the brazilian constitution in 2017 which has caused a massive deterioration in public services infrastructure and poverty relief programs the pt claims the 2017 spending cap is the only obstacle to a massive investment program to bring back good paying jobs its own version of the fraudulent build back better promises of joe biden in the united states the pt s renewed bid for the presidency with the candidacy of former president luiz inácio lula da silva takes place under extraordinary social conditions massive death from covid 19 has been joined with a sharp growth in extreme poverty hunger unemployment and inflation with the ruling class conscious it is presiding over a social powder keg that is irreconcilable with democratic forms of rule the fascistic president jair bolsonaro and his far right allies are working day and night on preparations to overturn a likely defeat at the polls in october their attacks on the electoral system have reached such a pitch that the chiefs of the armed forces themselves warn of a putsch or a capitol scenario ordering that military exercises be brought forward in order to have the entire armed forces available for action during the elections above all to suppress workers resistance to a coup under these conditions the workers party is entirely dedicated to stabilizing brazilian capitalism and preventing popular opposition to bolsonaro developing into a massive movement against capitalism itself the pt s recent announcements are designed to lend a left veneer to lula s essentially right wing pro business electoral campaign that campaign has followed in the footsteps of the pt s right wing opposition to bolsonaro since 2018 based entirely on criticisms of his incapacity to please foreign capital peppered with feigned concern over the massive covid death rate and the record poverty engulfing brazilian workers in launching his presidential bid in november 2021 lula toured europe meeting germany s then chancellor in waiting olaf scholtz spain s pedro sánchez and france s emmanuel macron who staged a high profile reception with honor guards as he used lula s visit to bolster his own right wing presidential campaign speaking before the european parliament lula extolled the ever more right wing and militarized european union as a beacon of peace and democracy signaling to european capitalism a future shift from bolsonaro s us centric foreign policy which has attracted both internal and external criticism later in december lula made public his negotiations to have as his running mate geraldo alckmin the four time são paulo governor who twice led the presidential ticket of the brazilian social democracy party psdb the main right wing opposition to pt rule in a de facto two party system that prevailed from 1994 to 2018 alckmin finished the 2018 race with only 5 percent of the vote the worst performance since the psdb was founded in 1988 alckmin left the psdb in november after years of a thoroughly opportunistic feud with current são paulo governor joão doria supporting bolsonaro against him in 2018 and pushing the psdb even further to the right doria also blocked alckmin s internal party bid to reclaim the são paulo governorship in 2022 alckmin has a firm base in the murderous são paulo military police corps and the conservative countryside of the state as well as in the most right wing unions which have historically opposed the pt and are dominated by the solidarity and social democratic psd parties alckmin has been chosen by lula as the ideal running mate to reassure brazilian and foreign capital that the pt will defend their interests whatever talk of social reform it feeds into the electoral propaganda mill for the benefit of the party s left wing the pseudo lefts that orbit it and the unions both of the high profile economic promises made by the pt must be taken for what they are lies the use of the term revocation for the pt s proposal for new labor laws is a lie in itself it is used deliberately by the party president gleisi hoffmann and the likes of brasil de fato and brasil247 in a bid to hide the true content of the proposal lula himself cited as his model a law in spain sponsored by the pseudo left podemos the junior partner in the ruling coalition which it claimed during its own electoral campaign would reverse the 2012 labor reform imposed by the european union the 2012 bill made casual labor in spain grow to 25 percent of the workforce and imposed massive cuts to severance pay allowing employers to fire workers en masse despite the pt s false claims not even spain s labor minister yolanda diaz claims the new podemos bill to be a revocation of the 2012 act it barely touches the casualization of labor and the previous cuts to severance pay the new bill in spain is part of a brutal austerity package demanded by the european union in exchange for funds that will immediately be diverted to the stock markets it was tied to yet another pension reform increasing contributions and retirement age at the same time the socialist party podemos government has doubled the state funding for the unions which are needed in the words of prime minister pedro sánchez to maintain social peace and allow flexibility for employers to adapt to circumstances through the use of furlough schemes such as those authorized in brazil by rousseff in 2015 the increase in union funding is also the sole concern of the brazilian unions the alckmin allied força sindical reacted to the pt s announcement of the revocation program by declaring the unions are seeking improvements in the law but not its revocation the need to increase union funding in exchange for social peace that is the suppression of class struggle was recognized by one of the chief sponsors of the brazilian labor reform former house speaker rodrigo maia who is currently a coordinator in the campaign of the psdb s doria for the presidency maia reacted to the pt s proposal with a heavy handed overture to the unions disguised as democratic concerns i m convinced they are right he said unions are a fundamental structure for the defense of workers and democracy the first thing hitler did in germany was to suppress german unions we really went too far in the reform as for the promise to repeal the spending cap its starting point is a thoroughly right wing attack on a series of measures bypassing the cap sponsored by the bolsonaro government which the pt claims hurt brazil s credibility pt president hoffmann has repeatedly declared that the spending cap is effectively defunct she told cnn last week that this spending cap has already been abandoned by everybody by the way this is an embarrassment nobody respected it concluding that the markets can t defend something that nobody respects in other words the pt s program is to sponsor a spending cap that is respected i e more reliable austerity nelson barbosa who was rousseff s economy minister spoke recently to folha de s paulo as a representative of the pt s perseu abramo think tank economics team and explained the pt s proposal is to start the government with a civil service reform that would cut entry level wages and lengthen the span of career progression that would allow freeing up room for investments that is a boon to major companies and stock markets such as the furlough schemes of 2015 before rousseff s impeachment the pt s austerity promises are being welcomed by the financial markets with the financial daily valor crediting the fall of the us dollar against the brazilian real on january 19 largely to lula s defense of alckmin to a group of pt aligned websites such as brasil247 excluding major dailies and tv stations the true aim of the pt s economic announcements was to provide the pseudo lefts and the unions talking points to convince workers and youth that the party can be pushed to the left and that lula s right wing campaign is to be disputed with the likes of his running mate alckmin the lies about the revocation of the labor reform were immediately echoed by the leader of the pt s supposed left wing rui falcão who currently feigns opposition to the alliance with alckmin falcão declared that lula s and hoffman s declarations about changing the labor laws set a good tone for the program by bringing the working class to the agenda predictably the issue was also amplified by the international voice of pro imperialist socialists jacobin magazine which ran an article on january 20 claiming lula s declarations were causing desperation in the ruling class that would imply a possible third lula government would be nothing less than anti capitalist the turn to the unions by the pt in alliance with major right wing figures such as maia and alckmin with força sindical and the solidarity party playing a major role in the rehabilitation of the hated former são paulo governor is designed to push a corporatist agenda in which the unions take center stage in anticipation of a major eruption of class struggle such opposition is already developing with workers unwilling to accept the economic disaster engulfing tens of millions the threats of dictatorship and the onslaught of omicron for which the pt offers no solution except for an entirely inadequate campaign to expand vaccinations the task of the unions is to impose poverty wages in so called negotiations in the name of national unity and keeping up the economy as the ruling class seeks competitiveness by cutting labor costs the pt s senate leader paulo paim had already declared in july that the party intended to emulate the pro union campaigns of us president joe biden which are an integral part of us war preparations against china while the pt is nominally seeking a rapprochement with china and the european union the nationalist logic of international geopolitical competition imposes the same need to increase working class exploitation and suppress opposition in every country workers must oppose this campaign the only way forward in the struggle against austerity poverty and the herd immunity policy sponsored by all factions of the brazilian ruling class including those represented by the pt is to base it on a socialist and internationalist program independent of and opposed to the existing unions the pt and its apologists

aim biologicals auto immunity modifying biologicals utilize a novel mechanism which is believed to demonstrate that peptide antigens presented on immunosuppressive mhc class i molecules can selectively and efficiently induce antigen specific tolerance based on this mechanism the targeted immunomodulating therapeutics are being designed as optimized soluble molecules with the goal that they may be adapted to selectively induce tolerance to various autoantigens during pregnancy the maternal immune system tolerates paternal antigens from the embryo but is still effective to protect mother and embryo from foreign pathogens parts of the natural mechanisms responsible for this feto maternal immune tolerance form the scientific basis for the concept of aim biologicals pre clinical studies conducted by the julius maximilians university thus far indicate that tolerance induction appears to be achieved via selective elimination of antigen specific immune effector cells and via

occupancy rates in suntec city rose to 97 2 in december the highest in six quarters photo suntec reit suntec reit by andy mukherjee bloomberg opinion singapore offices aren t exactly humming with activity yet but they have at least stopped hollowing out occupancy rates in suntec city rose to 97 2 in december the highest in six quarters rents are nearly 8 steeper than two years ago when there was no pandemic and no to let signs in the five tower 2 3 million square foot complex in the heart of the asian financial centre yet the stock market continues to be cautious almost pessimistic shares in suntec real estate investment trust the landlord are still trading 30 below their book value some of the bearishness arises from short term uncertainty not knowing how high global interest rates will go or if the worst of covid 19 is indeed over another part comes from a decline in the perceived long term utility of office buildings as valuable assets that s the wfh effect the financial sector historically the most important tenant in singapore s office market has also been at the forefront of adopting work from home arrangements dbs group holdings ltd the city s largest bank trimmed its office space requirement following citigroup inc and mizuho financial group inc those pressures are now being offset by normalising economic activity and pragmatic policies after allowing quarantine free travel from a couple of dozen countries under so called vaccinated travel lanes singapore is committed to reopening its borders more fully this year that gives it a leg up over rival hong kong whose zero infections strategy is isolating it from the world making it tough for businesses to use the chinese special administrative region as an asian hub bank of america corp is looking at moving an unspecified number of employees from hong kong to singapore the financial times reported thursday even with flexible work arrangements more bankers in the city state should translate to demand for more office space besides the source of demand is shifting finance might soon cease to be biggest driver of singapore s office market according to property broker jones lang lasalle inc the technology industry accounted for 22 of the uptake between 2015 and 2020 up from 8 in the previous 10 years the share of financial services and insurance came down to 30 from 54 story continues that trend seems to be picking up bytedance ltd the chinese owner of video app tiktok has moved into one raffles quay a plush address in the central business district even as ubs group ag moved out about 31 of the space leased out last year to new tenants at the suntec city office complex went to technology media and telecom firms according to the full year results released on jan 26 by suntec reit more than the 20 taken up by banking and insurance clients office landlords fortunes are on the mend suntec reit posted an 18 2 jump in distributable income from operations last year after an 11 6 slump in 2020 still the prospect of higher interest rates may be making investors worry about capital losses those concerns may be overdone when the u s federal funds rate went up between december 2015 and july 2019 singapore reits delivered 33 gains a rising rate environment as such is not necessarily bad for the sector s outlook if it is accompanied by economic growth this is as earnings growth generally tends to outpace rate hikes writes shekhar jaiswal an rhb bank bhd analyst they re likely to underperform when central banks are forced to raise interest rates to tame surges in inflation while economic growth stagnates growth may indeed slow from last year s 7 2 but it s unlikely to stagnate the official 2022 forecast is for a creditable pace of 3 to 5 expansion in gross domestic product as long as monetary tightening both at home and overseas doesn t derail those projections economic activity should be brisk enough to earn higher rents for singapore landlords shielding them from the impact of higher rates limited supply should also help assuming there s no crunch of construction workers three projects may finish in 2022 in hong kong where more than 10 of grade a space is vacant nine new office properties may add to the glut this year possibly extending the decline in major landlords potential rental revenue for several years according to bloomberg intelligence analysts patrick wong and michael tam before the covid 19 outbreak singapore came up with the idea of remaking its central business district by dismantling the rigid boundaries between spaces where people work live shop and dine as older properties get torn down to make way for integrated mixed use developments displaced commercial establishments will need to find new addresses that

susan tompor detroit free press their checks to the u s treasury were cashed nearly a year ago but taxpayers say they re now receiving letters from the internal revenue service asking them to immediately file their 2020 federal income tax returns yes copies of their 2020 returns yes the same paper returns they filed last spring please file today the letter begins send your signed return to the address shown above we ll assign the credit to the tax you owe and refund any over payment if you owe no other taxes or obligations some readers who contacted me wondered whether if this could be some sort of scam it wasn t a text message it wasn t an email it was a letter said anne hovell 72 who recently received the irs letter dated jan 24 according to the letter sent to the couple in gibraltar the credit on their account is 1 056 the irs letter warns that there can be more problems ahead if we don t hear from you if you don t file your return or contact us the form letter says you may lose this credit the internal revenue code sets strict time limits for refunding or transferring credits can you finally stop working this year with stock market taking a hit can you still afford to retire in 2022 rough stretch over for now stocks surge to salvage a volatile week on wall street hovell who keeps track of transactions in her checking account knows the money cleared a year ago and she recognized that the amount listed as a credit is what she paid in taxes if a check doesn t clear i follow up she said it did clear hovell who retired as a consultant for a tech company knows that scammers often use email or texts but she wondered if somehow the scammers were getting even more sophisticated and created actual letters to demand copies of tax returns the notion of a scam seemed to make even more sense than thinking that the irs could be sending letters to people who already paid their taxes and filed their returns why would the irs need another return if the federal government cashed their checks she and others wondered doesn t that mean the irs received their return in the mail since the return and check were mailed together why wouldn t the irs already have their tax returns it s a good question and frankly one that could leave you in shock when you re thinking about all the work that goes into filing your tax return in the first place it s very unsettling to get an irs notice when you think you did everything by the book filed the return on time sent the money that was due the less scary part here of course is that the irs wasn t trying to collect money from the couple the letters that readers sent to me are marked notice cp80 and the letters i saw were sent out of kansas city missouri the letter goes on to say if you have already filed this return please send a newly signed copy to the address shown above be sure to attach copies of all schedules and other documents you included with the original return unprocessed returns built up the pandemic has flipped a lot of things in life upside down the tax system has undergone sizable challenges since the two year long pandemic began in early 2020 as of dec 4 2021 the irs said it had a backlog of 6 7 million unprocessed individual returns and 2 6 million unprocessed amended individual returns mark luscombe principal analyst for wolters kluwer tax accounting said the irs is still processing millions of 2020 returns and these notices go out automatically when the irs believes it has not received a return while it might seem on the surface that delays have gone on so long that the irs is unable to find many of the paper returns many experts say that s not likely to be the case at all a glut of automated notices might have been sent to many people who likely should not have received them edward karl vice president of tax policy and advocacy for the american institute of cpas said the cp80 notice has an important place in the process the notice would normally be sent when a tax return for a given year wasn t received even though the filer might have paid a good deal of money already into the system such as through estimated taxes someone might have forgotten to file a return when they have a credit to their account money that could be owed to them in a refund when there s been a troubling event such as a trauma a divorce a death or natural disaster the cp80 notice lets the taxpayer know that when a return hasn t been filed and they can file one in time to claim any refund money owed in most cases an original return claiming a refund must be filed within three years of its due date for the irs to issue a refund the only issue is we re not in normal times karl said the irs like the rest of the country has faced more than its fair share of challenges since the covid 19 pandemic hit to stem outbreaks of the virus the irs had to shut down its centers earlier in the pandemic and irs employees had to be protected but piles of unprocessed returns built up they have such a backlog of processing karl said the pandemic has put them in a deep hole the irs backs off but not soon enough for some the notices sent out in january though seem to be adding to the paperwork on thursday the irs announced that it would suspend notices in situations where we have credited taxpayers for payments but have no record of the tax return being filed the idea behind stopping the notices is to avoid even more confusion the irs noted in its statement in many situations the tax return may be part of our current paper tax inventory and simply hasn t been processed stopping these letters which could have otherwise been sent to thousands of taxpayers will help avoid confusion unfortunately many taxpayers opened their mail already and read the notices before the irs announced that it was halting some of these mailings diana vollmayer of rochester hills said she and her husband already mailed the copy of their 2020 return certified with return receipt we are keeping records of all transactions she said noting that she too was told via her notice of a credit to the couple s account they made estimated tax payments but had filed their 2020 return by paper last spring and paid the rest of the money that they owed when they filed the return she said her friend received one of these letters too but hired a cpa to review her 2020 taxes and handle the situation for her the irs didn t offer a clear detail of what notices it is suspending in its statement as it doesn t even mention cp80 in its statement in an email response to the free press the irs said it has suspended issuing the cp80 and cp080 unfiled tax return credit on account notices the irs said the cp80 is a notice letter that informs a taxpayer that the agency has credited payments and or other credits to their tax account for a certain tax period but the agency hasn t received their tax return the irs has not disclosed how many of the notices went out this month but confirmed that the letters aren t a scam if a taxpayer has received a notice for a 2020 return they should not refile according to luis garcia a spokesperson for the irs in detroit for taxpayers who timely filed their 2019 tax return including extensions and have received a notice they should refile their return garcia said taxpayers also can establish and log into their tax account online at irs gov to view their tax status and any correspondence the irs has sent karl maintains that taxpayers who received a notice now regarding a 2020 return would not have to send a copy of the return if they already filed a 2020 return and know that their payment went through if you didn t file a return obviously you could have money that you might be owed based on the notice and would want to file to claim a refund if you received a notice regarding a 2019 return karl said you would need to send in another signed copy the aicpa is part of a group of stakeholders called the tax professionals united for taxpayer relief coalition which is seeking more relief for taxpayers in light of the pandemic related challenges the coalition s recommendations submitted to the irs include discontinuing automated compliance actions until the irs is prepared to devote the necessary resources for a timely resolution similar recommendation also included in the 2021 national taxpayer advocate report the automated system makes more sense in more normal times when the backlog isn t so great but bulk batches of notices now pose a great risk of alerting many taxpayers to problems that aren t real on their end according to professionals they re going to be wrong in many instances because of the backlog karl said he said the news thursday was welcome but more needed to be done the group also wants to see among other changes the irs providing taxpayers with targeted relief from the underpayment and the late payment penalty for the 2020 and 2021 tax year the irs maintains that making significant operational changes to our systems including stopping certain notices from being printed and mailed may require programming and other operational changes with an outdated technological ecosystem these are changes that cannot be made as efficiently as they should be and that is part of the reason why investing in irs it modernization is so important getting one of these letters of course raises other questions such as why would the irs have cashed the check if the return that was filed wasn t processed karl noted that cashing the check when it s its received is part of the normal process it s not a cause for alarm it s prudent karl said the u s treasury uses this money to cover a wide range of government expenditures you make your check payable to the united states treasury and include a payment voucher called form 1099 v that goes with the paper check the irs notes when we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment the returns are separated from the check and then returns are processed further down the line after the check has been cashed normally we re not thinking about the ins and outs of how the irs handles all that paperwork but again not much has been normal for the past two years contact susan tompor stompor freepress com follow her on twitter tompor

the pulitzer prize winning graphic novel maus about the holocaust which was banned by a tennessee school district over a few curse words and a nude image has topped amazon com s best sellers list art spiegelman s poignant tale about his parents survival against nazi atrocities went from no 12 on amazon s list on friday evening and was no 1 by sunday night the book is not available for delivery until mid february the complete maus which includes a second volume was at no 3 and is also completely out of stock two editions of art spiegelman s pulitzer prize winning graphic novel maus have topped amazon s bestseller s lists two books of the graphic novel maus by american cartoonist art spiegelman are now top of the bestseller s list on amazon pages from the graphic novel maus by american cartoonist art spiegelman are pictured author and artist art spiegelman shown in his new york studio in 2004 turned the pain of the holocaust into a pulitzer prize winning comic book novel the various editions are also dominating the top of the lists of amazon best sellers in the history comics graphic novels graphic novels historical biographical fiction graphic novels and biographies categories neither book was in the top 1 000 at the start of last the week recent reviews of the versions appear to credit the recent controversy for its purchase thank you mcminn county sb for being the impetus to discover this masterpiece one reviewer identified as a wwii era history buff of many years wrote it will be a treasured addition to my wwii library one tennessee local has set up a gofundme in order to purchase more copies of maus for students who have since been deprived of the book so far 78 000 has been raised earlier this month the mcminn county school board in tennessee voted to remove maus from its curriculum due to inappropriate language eight swear words and its not wise or healthy content the book includes an illustration of a nude woman according to minutes from a board meeting the mcminn county board of education voted 10 0 to remove maus on january 10 despite educators arguing that the graphic novel is an anchor text in eighth grade english language arts instruction and the centerpiece of a months long study of the holocaust artist and author art spiegelman is seen during a book signing in 2004 published in 1991 maus is inspired by the story of spiegelman s parents vladek and anja who survived the holocaust after being shipped to auschwitz concentration camp in occupied poland the graphic novel depicts nazis as cats and jewish people as mice spiegelman s autobiographical book won a pulitzer in 1992 the tennessee board s decision came amid a wave of conservative sponsored legislation and other actions to pull books from schools with other banned works including toni morrison s the bluest eye and harper lee s to kill a mockingbird the board heard from instructional supervisors and other school officials who defended the use of the book in class but were unanimously overruled i went to school here 13 years i learned math english reading and history i never had a book with a naked picture in it never had one with foul language so this idea that we have to have this kind of material in the class in order to teach history i don t buy it said board member mike cochran spiegelman 73 called the ban orwellian in an interview with cnbc saying that he learned about it on wednesday a day before holocaust remembrance day experts say the book has been taught at schools for nearly two decades the mcminn county school board in tennessee voted 10 0 to remove maus by art spiegelman from the eighth grade curriculum over eight swear words and nudity the graphic novel by art spiegelman above is inspired by the story of art s parents art s father vladek spiegelman above survived the auschwitz concentration camp the holocaust museum has defended maus as playing a vital role in educating children about the genocide their tweet came on wednesday the eve of holocaust remembrance day the holocaust museum has defended the book and said it plays a vital role in teaching about the world war ii era genocide the mcminn board of education declined to comment on the ban or how long the book has been taught at its schools the board members objections centered around a drawing of a nude woman and eight swear words that appeared throughout the 296 page book according to minutes from the meeting lee parkison the board s director of schools said he tried to find a workaround to the profanity i consulted with our attorney mr scott bennett after consulting with him we decided the best way to fix or handle the language in this book was to redact it considering copyright we decided to redact it to get rid of the eight curse words and the picture of the woman that was objected to parkinson said but bennett told him there were copyright issues associated with censoring swear words from an artistic work board member tony allman said the book was unacceptable with or without the redacted portions being in the schools educators and stuff we don t need to enable or somewhat promote this stuff it shows people hanging it shows them killing kids why does the educational system promote this kind of stuff it is not wise or healthy instructional supervisor julie goodin responded i can talk of the history i was a history teacher and there is nothing pretty about the holocaust and for me this was a great way to depict a horrific time in history mr spiegelman did his very best to depict his mother passing away and we are almost 80 years away it s hard for this generation these kids don t even know 9 11 they were not even born for me this was his way to convey the message board member tony allman left suggested the book should at least be censored why does the educational system promote this kind of stuff it is not wise or healthy he said the 296 page book details the suicide of the author s mother who also survived auschwitz it depicts nazis as cats and jewish people as mice melasawn knight also an instructional supervisor concurred people did hang from trees people did commit suicide and people were killed over six million were murdered she said allman was not swayed by the argument i am not denying it was horrible brutal and cruel it s like when you re watching tv and a cuss word or nude scene comes on it would be the same movie without it well this would be the same book without it allman said cochran added so my problem is it looks like the entire curriculum is developed to normalize sexuality normalize nudity and normalize vulgar language if i was trying to indoctrinate somebody s kids this is how i would do it mcminn county is a heavily conservative area in southeastern tennessee in the 2020 election nearly 80 percent of votes went to donald trump maus uses a frame tale timeline in which art spiegelman in new york city in 1978 interviews his father vladek about his experiences during the holocaust people did hang from trees people did commit suicide and people were killed over six million were murdered said one instructional supervisor while defending the use of the book art s mother anja had also lived through the nazi regime but she killed herself when spiegelman was 20 a story that is touched on in the book the novel won the pulitzer in 1992 and has since been lauded for helping to usher in a new era of graphic novels in which they were seen as a respectable form of adult media maus is used in schools all across the us as i regularly have students tell me they read it before arriving at college said dr gregory spinner a professor of religion at skidmore college in saratoga springs new york spinner s research focuses partly on jewish studies and draws from graphic novels it s been this way for well over a decade probably closer to two decades he said i can not hazard a guess as to why maus would be banned except to observe that if one wants to teach about the holocaust without the subject being upsetting then one does not actually want to teach about the holocaust spinner told dailymail com eliyana adler a professor of history and jewish studies at pennsylvania state university says maus is taught in many college courses as well author neil gaiman compared the school board members to nazis in a tweet on wednesday i m kind of baffled by this spiegelman told cnbc after learning of the ban it s leaving me with my jaw open like what the decision drew outcry from british author neil gaiman who compared the school board members to nazis in a tweet on wednesday there s only one kind of people who would vote to ban maus whatever they are calling themselves these days gaiman said the holocaust museum in washington dc tweeted about the importance of the book on wednesday as news of the tennessee school board s decision traveled far beyond rural mcminn county maus has played a vital role in educating about the holocaust through sharing detailed and personal experiences of victims and survivors the museum said teaching about the holocaust using books like maus can inspire students to think critically about the past and their own roles and responsibilities today the ban comes as parents and school boards across the country debate how to teach the history of racism at schools if at all last year the republican controlled tennessee general assembly voted to withhold funding from schools that teach critical race theory effectively banning it according to the tennessean

washington the u s chamber of commerce is taking on an increasingly visible role in the confirmation process for the biden administration s financial regulatory nominees another indication of the ripple effects banking policy is having across the broader business community one of the nation s oldest and most prominent advocates for the business sector the chamber has historically maintained a solid distance from senate confirmations particularly when bank regulatory nominees are involved but that appears to be changing under the biden administration in september the chamber blasted cornell university law professor saule omarova the white house s pick to lead the office of the comptroller of the currency who later withdrew after significant industry pushback and this week the chamber sounded yet another alarm in a letter to the senate banking committee this time over sarah bloom raskin who was nominated earlier this month to be the federal reserve s vice chair for supervision this position enforces and helps develop the regulations that are the bedrock of competitive financial markets wrote tom quaadman executive vice president of the chamber s center for capital markets competitiveness some of ms raskin s past actions and statements have raised concerns among the u s business community and merit the committee s scrutiny cornell university law professor saule omarova left was openly opposed by the u s chamber of commerce in september an unusual development that helped sink her nomination to be comptroller of the currency the chamber now says it has reservations about sarah bloom raskin the white house nominee to be the fed s next vice chair for supervision duke law bloomberg news quaadman s letter stops short of an outright condemnation of raskin s candidacy but it poses more than a dozen questions for u s senators to ask the former treasury official across several important issues including the central bank s response to the covid 19 pandemic the future of climate sensitive bank regulation and the fed s broader regulatory independence raskin along with fed nominees lisa cook and philip jefferson will testify before the banking committee on thursday the hearing is expected to be contentious and may focus in large part on raskin sen pat toomey of pennsylvania the committee s top republican has made clear he has deep reservations with her past writings on the role of climate in bank regulations and financial policy in particular but the chamber s recent dip into confirmation politics is far more unusual than party line gop opposition especially for an organization that has sought to rebuild relationships with democratic lawmakers in recent years analysts say the chamber s behavior is emblematic of the financial system s expanding role in the broader economy over the past couple of decades it reflects the importance of financial regulation in a financialized economy said karen petrou managing partner at federal financial analytics the structure of the financial system has also changed considerably in recent years and a more concentrated banking and markets landscape means that the policy choices made by the nation s bank regulators could have more immediate implications for the economy if a bank regulator takes a position on climate risk that would have been germane only to banks and there was enough diversity in the institutions and in the markets that it would not have been structurally significant petrou said now it is other analysts say that the u s chamber is also likely responding to specific policy preferences of the biden administration and its nominees that appear to be more ambitious and progressive i think it s really recognizable that the democratic party when it comes to banking is more progressive than previously said todd phillips director of financial regulation at the center for american progress even among folks who have spent time in the industry there s a recognition that progressive values on banking are ascendant the chamber s wariness may not be unwarranted especially if biden s bank regulators pursue any policies that limit any particular industry s access to credit raskin penned an editorial for the new york times in may 2020 urging the fed not to change the rules of its main street lending program to allow oil gas and coal companies to access government funds i think that the fed and other banking regulators are weighing in on issues that could materially affect the chamber s membership phillips said that could be bank loans that could be the federal reserve s liquidity facilities all of these things are beginning to touch on issues beyond traditional bank regulation carter dougherty a spokesman for americans for financial reform said the chamber s letter about raskin was simply an attempt to limit her ability to craft ambitious policy if she is eventually confirmed the big banks want regulators who will go easy on them like trump appointees did and that s why a no nonsense type like sarah bloom raskin scares them dougherty said they re trying to hide behind things that have become politically charged while attempting to extract promises from nominees that will limit their ability to act when in office in questions posed by the chamber for raskin ahead of thursday s senate hearing quaadman asked whether it was the role of the federal reserve to direct capital away from certain industries that are politically disfavored or direct capital towards industries that are politically favored the letter to the banking committee also urged lawmakers to secure a commitment from ms raskin to maintain the political independence of the board and stay committed to its statutory mission pointing to a recent power struggle at the federal deposit insurance corp the federal reserve is designed to adhere to its statutory mandate and remain independent from political influence quaadman wrote after the recent push by board members at the federal deposit insurance corporation to usurp the chair s authority we have serious concerns about similar politicization at the federal reserve

in china s most forthright yet comments on the mounting us confrontation with russia over ukraine chinese foreign minister wang yi warned washington and its allies not to hype the crisis he called on all parties to remain calm and refrain from doing things that stimulate tension wang made the remarks in a virtual meeting with us secretary of state antony blinken last thursday the biden administration and american media have deliberately manufactured extreme tensions over ukraine by repeatedly declaring that russia is on the point of invasion a claim that even the ukrainian president has publicly denied wang clearly signalled beijing s support for moscow declaring that russia s reasonable security concerns should be taken seriously and resolved russia has repeatedly called on the us and its european allies to guarantee that ukraine will not be inducted as a nato member a move that would bring the us led military alliance to the russian border indirectly referring to nato s expansion into eastern europe since the 1991 dissolution of the soviet union wang pointedly told blinken that european security could not be guaranteed by strengthening or even expanding military blocs china s opposition to aggressive us moves in ukraine is connected to concerns about washington s warnings of a possible chinese invasion of taiwan claims which like those directed against russia have been manufactured out of thin air the biden administration has exploited these unsubstantiated allegations of chinese aggression as the pretext for strengthening ties with taiwan breaching longstanding us diplomatic protocols on the status of the island wang declared that the us attitude toward china had not substantially changed since president biden met his chinese counterpart xi jinping in november the chinese foreign minister accused the us of continuing to make mistakes in relation to china causing new shocks to the relationship between the two countries he warned the us against playing with fire over taiwan which china regards as a renegade province and against interference in the beijing winter olympics due to start on friday later this week xi is due to meet russian president vladimir putin who is flying to beijing to attend the olympics in part to demonstrate his opposition to the us led diplomatic boycott of the event it will be xi s first in person meeting with a foreign head of state since march 2020 when he met with pakistan s president as tensions mounted over ukraine putin and xi held an online meeting in mid december in which the russian president reportedly called xi his dear friend and said relations between the two countries had reached an unprecedented high level xi called for greater joint efforts to effectively safeguard the security interests of both countries as certain international forces were interfering in the internal affairs of china and russia and trampling on international law under the guise of human rights a steady stream of commentary in the us and european media speculates on the growing strength of relations between moscow and beijing the consequences for a us led conflict with russia and the prospect of china taking advantage of the ukraine crisis to invade taiwan a financial times article today along these lines is entitled ukraine conflict shines light on deepening ties between beijing and moscow its evidence for china s intentions is the rantings of a right wing chinese nationalist blogger who declares that the ukraine crisis will be a historic opportunity for us to solve the taiwan problem the flimsy character of the argument reflects the topsy turvy world of us propaganda in which concocted threats of russian and chinese invasions are used to justify us military provocations against both countries as the us and its allies put troops on alert and provided arms to ukraine the us navy mounted a series of major military drills in the south china sea and waters off taiwan as the financial times itself acknowledged the 2014 ukraine crisis ruptured russia s relations with the west and drove moscow into china s arms or to put it more accurately mounting us threats and provocations against both russia and china aimed ultimately at their break up and subordination has driven the two countries into a quasi alliance china s backing for russia is in contrast to its equivocal response to the 2014 conflict which was provoked by a us backed far right coup in kiev that ousted a pro russian ukrainian government china blamed western foreign interference for causing the crisis but did not back russia s annexation of crimea or its support for separatists in eastern ukraine in 2014 china abstained on un resolutions regarding the russian annexation of crimea and still does not recognise crimea as part of russian territory at the same time while it rejected us and european sanctions on russia china tacitly allowed chinese corporations including its huge state owned banks to abide by the sanctions to avoid being cut off from us financial markets and the international banking system since 2014 however russia and china have steadily strengthened their diplomatic economic and strategic relations according to the financial times between 2013 and 2021 china s share of russia external trade doubled from 10 to 20 percent at their meeting in december xi and putin noted that bilateral trade in the first three quarters of 2021 exceeded us100 billion for the first time and was expected to hit a new record for the full year russia and china have strengthened their military ties through the shanghai cooperation organisation established in 2001 starting on january 21 china russia and iran held their third joint naval exercises in the gulf of oman to strengthen security and multilateral cooperation this followed naval drills by russia and china off the russian coast in the far east in october and joint military exercises in northwestern china in august involving some 13 000 troops and hundreds of aircraft as well as artillery anti aircraft batteries and armoured vehicles alexander korolev an analyst based at the university of new south wales in sydney told the financial times that more frequent and substantive joint exercises collaboration on weapons development regular consultations on military and security issues and long running military personnel exchanges were enabling the russian and chinese militaries to jointly operate in real wars in the future at his press briefing last thursday chinese foreign ministry spokesman zhao lijian declared that china and russia see their relations as a priority there is no ceiling to china russia mutual trust no forbidden zone in our strategic cooperation and no limit on how far our longstanding friendship can go he said zhao mingwen a former chinese diplomat made a similar point to the financial times even though russia and china are not formal allies you could say we are even more allies than allies he said the two countries would support each other in conflicts if provoked by external powers if china were forced to unify taiwan by force and the us intervened i believe russia would not sit by idly zhao said the strengthening military ties between china and russia in the face of us threats highlights the utter recklessness of us foreign policy having driven china now the world s second largest economy and russia with its huge nuclear arsenal into each other s arms the us is deliberately stoking a conflict over ukraine any war in ukraine far from being a local affair would threaten to rapidly escalate into a catastrophic war on a global scale

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news everyone who s been following the story of tesla is well aware of the war between the iconoclastic automaker and the country s hidebound auto dealerships after a decade of highly colorful struggle and strife which i cover in detail in my history of tesla the us is a patchwork of policies regarding tesla s direct sales model some states allow tesla to sell cars directly to consumers some prohibit it and some have reached some sort of compromise to be clear one can buy a tesla in any state by ordering it online the main issue is whether tesla can sell vehicles at physical showroom locations a look at one of tesla s stores photo by zach shahan cleantechnica now that the mainstream media is beginning to cover the tesla vs dealerships battle consumers may be surprised to learn that while they ve been buying most products and services online directly from their producers for a decade or two many of them are legally prohibited from buying cars this way however while consumer advocates may wax indignant about the situation few of us have any love for auto dealers the ponderous political power of the dealerships will probably prevent the legacy automakers from adopting tesla s direct sales model any time soon liam denning writing in bloomberg and robinson meyer writing in the atlantic argue that antiquated dealer protection laws in the us are distorting the national auto market and holding back the transition to evs they point out that overall ev sales are higher in the states that don t restrict direct sales as it stands at the moment 17 states prohibit all automakers from selling vehicles directly to customers while another 11 states have carved out specific exceptions for tesla and in some cases other automakers that sell only evs which means rivian and lucid messrs denning and meyer point out a number of ironic aspects of the current situation consider the puzzling fact that far more evs are being sold in florida than in new york the two states have similar populations but are poles apart when it comes to ev policy the bright blue empire state has implemented a wide range of policies to fight air pollution and carbon emissions including a plan to phase out ice vehicles by 2035 new york offers incentives of up to 2 000 for ev buyers and up to 5 000 for companies that install ev chargers new york has adopted california s stringent emissions standards and has directed substantial investment to public charging and electrification of public transit in the sunshine state where all branches of state government have been in red hands for two decades and the governor describes himself as not a global warming person there are no state incentives for ev buyers and funding for high speed highway chargers is just beginning to trickle out incidentally florida utilities and their representatives in the state legislature are also working to kill rooftop solar in the state by implementing a monthly minimum charge and reducing net metering so how can it be that for the past three years according to research firm ihs markit floridians have bought over 60 percent more evs than new yorkers have could it have something to do with the fact that tesla which currently sells the vast majority of evs has opened 17 stores and galleries in florida whereas in new york it has only 5 stores and is prohibited from opening more tesla recently launched a new campaign to expand the number of permitted stores in 2020 new york s nearly 1 000 franchise dealers collectively sold less than two evs per location james chen rivian s vp of public policy told the atlantic s mr meyer in the same year tesla sold nearly 1 890 vehicles at each of its new york stores if you want to see more rapid market penetration of electric vehicles then prohibitions on direct sales are a major barrier whether you re free market or pro consumer or pro environment or pro competition there s something here for everyone says daniel crane a law professor at the university of michigan adding that in one case both the sierra club and the koch brothers signed a letter opposing a dealer protection law dealers of course do not agree and tend to depict themselves as the advocates of consumer choice to cater effectively to mass market buyers of any drivetrain you need to capitalize on what has worked for mass market buyers for generations jared allen a vp at the national automobile dealers association told the atlantic the assumption that future ev buyers want the tesla direct sales model is just flat wrong one of the reasons tesla s experiment with selling direct worked was only because the company never gave their customers any other choice dealers may argue that they can provide better customer service but that certainly hasn t been the case for ev buyers to date ev advocates consider dealers to be a major bottleneck for ev sales several secret shopper campaigns have found that most dealerships keep few or no evs in stock and that sales associates tend to discourage buyers from considering evs the atlantic cites a 2019 sierra club study which found that legacy car dealerships were totally unprepared to sell evs many didn t even bother to keep their demo models charged there were lots of untrained salespeople who couldn t answer questions about the technology study author hieu le told mr meyer in the worst case the volunteer was urged by the salespeople to buy a gasoline vehicle as long as legacy automakers were producing evs in limited numbers just enough to satisfy california regulators this situation probably suited them fine now however we re cautiously optimistic that some of them gm ford vw hope to start selling evs in volume and there are already signs that they re coming into conflict with their dealers among other issues some dealers have been taking advantage of the ongoing supply crunch to slap huge markups on in demand ev models such as the ford f 150 lightning to their credit both ford and gm have put dealers on notice that they won t allow this to continue another preview of the upheavals to come in late 2020 gm decided to buy out dealers who don t want to electrify the automaker plans to make cadillac an electric only brand and rather than force its dealers to make substantial investments in chargers and other required equipment and training gm gave them the option to drop the cadillac brand and accept a cash buyout according to the detroit free press about 20 of cadillac s national dealer network took the buyouts savvy dealers realize that fighting electrification is a losing battle and some are taking steps to make sure they re still adding value under the new order last november john voelcker reported in car and driver that the national auto dealers association nada will work with startup chargeway to teach ev sales techniques to its member dealers and to help them get up to speed on charging available incentives for ev purchases and other important topics no legacy automaker would ever publicly admit to any dissatisfaction with the current dealership system but it certainly appears that they and some of the dealerships themselves look at tesla s direct sales model with more than a touch of envy during the pandemic induced lockdowns many auto dealers started exploring things like online sales and valet style pickup and delivery services in europe where the dealership model is less rigid automakers have been flirting with the brave new world of direct sales however even if big auto wanted to break it off with big auto dealership it isn t going to happen in the us where auto dealers and their trade associations wield a lot of political power the top dealership groups in america have collective annual revenue of 10 billion and they command more market share than any automaker these are huge multistate businesses lots of them are publicly traded and they re politically extremely powerful says professor crane dealers are major donors to local and state campaigns and more than a few state and federal legislators own auto dealerships themselves this local concentration of political power has created another strange situation state dealership laws don t correspond to political divisions deep red utah allows direct sales but blue blooded connecticut does not mr meyer writes tax and spend california permits direct sales but free market loving texas doesn t supposedly freedom loving texas has been one of the major fronts in the tesla vs dealers conflict as recounted in a certain book in 2013 elon musk personally testified in favor of a bill that would have carved out an exception to the state s ban on direct sales it is crazy that texas which prides itself on individual freedom has the most restrictive laws in the country protecting the big auto dealer groups from competition said he the pro tesla bill failed to move forward in the legislative session tesla s supporters tried and failed again in 2015 2017 2019 and 2021 the texas legislature meets every other year tesla still has political opposition in texas youtube kvue tesla continues to campaign against the law but for now it stands when the austin gigafactory starts producing cars they will apparently have to be shipped across the state line then back again before they can be sold to texas buyers it s a puzzling policy for a state that prides itself on its laissez faire pro business atmosphere it s even more puzzling that tesla has embraced a state whose leadership is implacably opposed to the company s mission of addressing air pollution and climate change but that s a subject for another day originally posted on evannex by charles morris have a tip for cleantechnica want to

infections get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters finance minister nirmala sitharaman will be releasing details of the budget for the fiscal year that starts april 1 economists are expecting measures that support growth and also allow the government to reduce its deficits and debt accumulation at the same time she will have to strike a fine balance between the persistent ask for demand stimulus continued capex push and fiscal consolidation bank of america economists said in a jan 25 note they pointed out that with a number of indian states heading to the polls as early as february there are some simmering concerns that the feb 1 budget may turn into a populist one despite the polls pressure we expect union budget to stick to the reform agenda the economists said india will likely rely on strong tax receipts as well as asset sales according to santanu sengupta senior economist at goldman sachs it would probably pull back on a number of covid related subsidies to fund capital spending plans for the next year without excessively accumulating debt he added if you look at tax collections this year it has surprised ahead of budget estimates he said monday on cnbc s street signs asia that includes both direct and indirect taxes with an improved growth trajectory and more formalization of the economy india s tax receipts are getting a boost sengupta explained we expect this tax buoyancy to continue into next year as well he added fiscal deficit india s fiscal deficit target for the new year will be closely watched by investors and ratings agencies a fiscal deficit is the gap between a government s income and spending and it implies that the country is spending more than its revenue india plans to set its deficit target between 6 3 to 6 5 of gdp local media reported citing several government officials that s a touch lower than the current year s target of 6 8 which sitharaman previously said was necessary to get the indian economy back on track after the covid outbreak derailed growth citi analysts this month said their base case projections predict a fiscal deficit target of 6 2 of gdp but they pointed out it remains a broad political call the 60bps of gdp reduction in fiscal deficit would amply demonstrate the government s resolve to get back to the path of fiscal discipline and comfort the investors in the year of possible global bond index inclusion they wrote reports say that indian government bonds could potentially be included in a few global bond indexes this year in what would be a significant milestone for the country the inclusion would allow debt capital to flow into india and could increase foreign ownership of indian government securities bank of america economists expect a comparatively lower but still high fiscal deficit target of 5 8 of gdp goldman sachs expects the figure at 6 3 of gdp while japanese investment bank nomura expects a target of 6 4 of gdp the government s fiscal policy since the pandemic began has prioritised growth and fiscal transparency over fiscal consolidation in the hope that robust medium term growth prospects will help with debt sustainability nomura analysts wrote in a recent note we expect this theme to persist fiscal transparency is where citizens are informed about how the government spends its revenue from tax receipts and other sources infrastructure push economists expect infrastructure push to be one of the key themes of tuesday s budget it comes amid signs that investment demand in the country might finally be picking up while pent up consumer demand fizzles out last year india said it planned to monetize some 81 billion worth of state owned assets over the next four years to boost infrastructure spending and stimulate growth the government planned to lease out assets like gas pipelines roads railway stations and warehousing facilities to the private sector to operate reports said the government is also set to take state owned life insurance corporation public this year in what is said to be india s largest initial public offering visible implementation of the asset monetization pipeline infra pipeline and disinvestment plans will be high on the government agenda and a key market focus citi analysts said restoring jobs and reforms other likely budget priorities would include restoring jobs supporting sectors disproportionately affected by the pandemic banking sector reforms climate policies as well as measures for the health and education sectors according to economists while india s national unemployment rate has climbed back to pre pandemic levels of around 7 it is accompanied by a lower rate of labor participation and employment rates that are below the early 2020 levels according to radhika rao senior economist at singapore s dbs group that pointed to the absence of broad based improvement in job conditions she said in a note this month when this is juxtaposed against the faster restoration of formal jobs vs informal jobs and dominance of casual labour lack of a security net as well as self employed in the labour mix the adverse impact on incomes and purchasing power becomes apparent rao said whilst farm jobs were little changed manufacturing followed by service sectors are still below pre pandemic levels she added the government needs policies to revive and support the micro small and medium scale businesses which are the biggest job creators in india according to rumki majumdar an economist at deloitte identifying their pain areas and devising a solution to help them become a part of atmanirbhar bharat will aid in their recovery she wrote atmanirbhar bharat is a campaign that s part of the government s policy push to make india more self reliant in addition access to credit is critical and providing targeted credit support to these enterprises should be considered majumdar added
spot or leiostomus xanthurus photo courtesy of ncfishes com spot a favorite catch for many recreational anglers gets its name from the dark marking behind both gills it s a fish with a relatively short lifespan that spawns in the ocean but spends much of its life in estuarine waters and spot can be found as far north as the gulf of maine to as far south as florida in general commercial harvests of spot have been on the decline since 2001 with recreational catch totals fluctuating throughout the years spot is managed as a coastwide species because it is found far beyond the boundaries of any one state the atlantic states marine fisheries commission or the asmfc oversees multistate management of spot from delaware to florida the asmfc makes the ultimate management decisions and then it is up to the individual states to meet the prescribed requirements morgan paris morgan paris is the spot and atlantic croaker species lead at the north carolina division of marine fisheries when a fish has a multistate range like spot collaboration across boundaries is necessary paris recently told coastal review i wouldn t say it s hard paris said it s more just requiring collaboration between states and making sure that you have the open line of data transfer communication so everyone can get what they need and can process the material correctly the asmfc s first spot management plan was implemented in 1987 since then the plan has been amended a few times and in 2014 the plan was altered to include a management technique called the traffic light approach this technique was updated again in 2020 the traffic light approach uses harvest and abundance metrics to identify thresholds that trigger certain management actions the 2020 traffic light analysis review of spot triggered at the 30 threshold this is categorized as moderate concern the harvest and abundance indices that the traffic light analysis uses were above 30 for two of the previous three years this triggered two specific management actions at a minimum states have to reduce commercial harvest by 1 of the average state commercial harvest for the previous 10 years and institute a 50 fish bag limit in the recreational sector north carolina s bag limit is in place and there s a commercial season closure in effect from dec 10 2021 through april 4 management actions are required to be in place for a minimum of two years according to the asmfc work on the next coastwide stock assessment will likely begin next year and be completed in 2024 states can still choose to have more strenuous measures in place but at the bare minimum you have to follow what asmfc guidance is putting out paris said related analysis why nc imposed new limits on spot croaker fortunately for commercial fishermen the winter months are not the typical time for harvesting spot anyway this was an intentional decision said paris they wanted the imposed restriction to help the species without negatively impacting fishermen when we did all the crunching of the numbers we looked at when the effort was concentrated and what time of year will be the best for the actual fishermen paris said as to what influence these trends that s a little harder to define said paris research on how different environmental factors may be influencing spot recruitment or how many young are produced and survive to become juveniles year over year is something that the asmfc has listed as a research need the environmental side of it is not a new one but definitely one that s becoming more relevant paris said dr troy tuckey senior research scientist at the virginia institute of marine science is particularly interested in what influences population abundance for juvenile fish for more than a decade he has been an author on the juvenile fish and blue crab trawl survey an assessment that helps keep track of fish populations in chesapeake bay troy tuckey it s a fisheries independent survey that goes out every month of the year to take assessments on population abundance of as many fish as possible the researchers also test location specific water temperatures dissolved oxygen and salinity conditions this survey has been conducted regularly since the 1950s and standardized in terms of methodology since 1988 we don t target any species we just use the same gear the same methodology year after year and assess measure identify and count everything that we catch tuckey said they use nets with a small mesh in order to help focus on juvenile fish and survey throughout the year to keep track of young populations at different points in time tuckey said they have surveyed spot in areas that recorded average dissolved oxygen temperature and salinity this shows that spot tend to gravitate toward conditions that are not too polarized year over year spot recruitment varies because they spawn in the coastal ocean which is that area between shore and the continental shelf and because changes in current or wind may influence how many juveniles end up in the estuaries according to tuckey it s not unusual to see big boom or bust fluctuations in a species like spot because of how short their lifespans are the conditions year to year will directly impact population levels beyond that there s still a lot that is unknown about how environmental factors influence spot populations it s really important said tuckey to know how fish respond to environmental factors we need to understand those external factors so that we can manage them better to make sure that the populations are sustainable for future years tuckey said
travel and tourism was hit hardest during the pandemic with norwegian being the biggest pandemic loser getty pandemic winners came from many different industries but most losers were from travel and tourism not really a big surprise norwegian cruise line is at the bottom of a list of companies whose stock price declined the most since january 13 2020 it is followed by carnival cooperation a close competitor and the third big cruise line operator royal caribbean also makes the list but even in struggling industries companies have options take the cruise operators it s no coincidence that norwegian with the lowest pre pandemic cash reserves is at the bottom in tough times solid finances give you an edge a study of century champions revealed that those who took a more conservative approach were more likely to survive and thrive during the great depression siemens for example was able to gain an edge over rival aeg as it was had access to new cash once it re valued its assets aeg did not have this option as it had taken an aggressive stance earlier the list also points at the dangers of shareholder value obsession boeing is still haunted by the 373 max disaster where engineers under pressure to put profits first ignored strong warning signals finally bold moves and this should be obvious are risky at t hoped to make a leap forward with the help of two big acquisitions but unfortunately ended up in markets they should have avoided las vegas sands and wynn resorts were not able to benefit from the bounce back of us casinos due to their aggressive move into the chinese market raising questions about political risks here is a brief overview of what went wrong for pandemic losers norwegian cruise line down 60 percent carnival cooperation down 54 percent and royal caribbean group down 37 percent industry executives got an early warning sign that the pandemic might hit them hard when in early february 2020 the diamond princess was the first cruise ship reporting a major outbreak of covid 19 700 people were infected and 9 died it is not surprising that three of the ten worst performing companies are cruise operators still there is variation norwegian being ill prepared for the downturn was the worst performer big three operators norwegian had the lowest amount of cash reserves when the covid 19 outbreak started with around 225 million ben cordwell globaldata travel and tourism analyst explains in may they narrowly avoided bankruptcy raising 2 2 billion from investors royal caribbean not only had more cash but also raised equity to strengthen its balance sheet the struggle of norwegian in particular serves as a reminder that being financially conservative is a core tenant of long term survival looking ahead there is more bad news for norwegian the company faced legal troubles over its marketing practices during the pandemic the bad publicity will make it more difficult to bring passengers back on board las vegas sands down 48 percent and wynn resorts down 45 percent casino stocks have come back strongly when las vegas opened again in 2021 las vegas sands and wynn resorts did not join the rally both companies had decided to shift towards asian markets las vegas sands has gone as far as exiting the us entirely selling its last big assets including the flashy venetian hotel in march 2021 las vegas sands ceo rob goldstein is upbeat about this strategy saying that the singaporean japanese korean and malaysian markets are very very fat and happy for us he is also optimistic that macao will come back strongly after the pandemic he could be right but the bigger question is whether it makes sense for a us companies to leave its home market and make a big bet on china it is easy to imagine a scenario where tensions between the two governments result in restrictions for us companies and even if las vegas sands and wynn resorts are not specifically targeted there are indications that the chinese government wants to tighten regulation and increase local ownership united airlines down 45 percent and delta airlines down 30 percent airlines had a rough ride during the pandemic united airlines was particularly exposed as it makes most of its money on international routes delta has a better mix of domestic and international but southwest airlines with very few international destinations was the one that performed best still down 15 percent though the network structure can turn into an advantage once international travel restrictions are less of an issue but united airlines is also behind southwest airlines and delta in terms of offering value for money according to the points guy s annual list of the best and worst airlines they consider reliability which was weighted at 30 experience weighted at 25 loyalty 25 and costs and reach 20 delta has topped the list three years in a row suggesting that they are in a strong position to recover in 2022 boeing down 32 percent an obsession with profit sits at the heart of boeing s downfall during the investigations following the 737 max crash a number of emails surfaced suggesting that engineers tried to cut corners big efforts went into convincing the federal aviation administration that pilots would not need simulator training despite knowing that this would be necessary all this in the name of delivering shareholder value ironically it is airbus who is delivering value to shareholders today with the 737 max grounded airbus managed to carve out a dominate position in the market for single aisle planes the industry s workhorses during the pandemic this allowed airbus to bargain hard giving airlines little leeway to renegotiate plane deliveries boeing executives should have listened more carefully to the concerns from the engineering core rather than pressuring them to put profits first a dose of open strategy might have done wonders vornado realty trust down 31 percent more than 50 percent of vornado reality trust s net operating income comes from the new york city office this market was hit hard by the pandemic with tenants moving out into the suburbs offices being unoccupied and retailers being in no position to pay their rent in the second quarter of 2020 only 72 percent of them paid up but it is not the pandemic alone that is causing headaches the market for retail properties is in long term decline as e commerce is growing with retail contributing over 20 percent of vornando s net operating income this is a problem getting out of this market is not easy either recently the company sold a commercial condo in soho for less than it had paid at t down 30 percent the fastest way to destroy value is mergers and acquisitions going wrong at t managed to do it twice in a row in 2015 it acquired directtv when pay tv was at its peak since then millions decided that netflix offers a cheaper and more attractive service the acquisition of timewarner followed unfortunately strategic misfit to gain an edge in pay tv time warner produced content needs to be exclusive but for shows to make money they need to be distributed as widely as possible a unfortunate dilemma at t is now spinning out these businesses going back to be primarily a wireless company with strong competition from t mobile and verizon in a saturated market this won t be a walk in the park either
the biden administration and the democratic party are spearheading a campaign for war against russia that is bringing the entire globe to the brink of world war iii on cnn s sunday television interview program state of the union senator robert menendez of new jersey democratic chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and the ranking republican on the committee james risch of idaho appeared side by side to demonstrate the bipartisan unity of the two big business parties against russia menendez dismissed the warning by ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky that us talk about an imminent russian invasion of his country was unwarranted he wants to create a semblance of calm as it relates to his economy the democrat said so i understand that he hailed the bipartisan legislation authorizing the biden administration to impose the mother of all sanctions that ultimately would crush russia s economy and the continuing lethal aid that we are going to send which means putin has to decide how many body bags of russian sons are going to return to russia this is beyond ukraine menendez warned we cannot have a munich moment again putin will not stop with ukraine if he believes that the west will not respond the top congressional democrat on foreign policy was only one of dozens of democrats comparing putin to hitler and advocating measures that lead inexorably to a military confrontation between russia and the united states the countries which possess the two largest arsenals of nuclear weapons there are two interrelated political and social processes at work in the increasingly hysterical campaign against russia 1 the disintegration of the anti war faction of the democratic party that emerged during and in the aftermath of the vietnam war and 2 the pro imperialist evolution of the affluent middle class which beyond wall street and the military itself forms a principal social base for the democratic party the democratic party has always been a party of the american capitalist class a democrat was president and commander in chief in world war i world war ii the korean war and the first half of the vietnam war but as the mass antiwar movement gathered strength in the course of the 1960s the democratic party took on the role of co opting and containing antiwar sentiment within the framework of bourgeois politics a substantial faction of the democratic party came out against the vietnam war associated with figures like chairman of the senate foreign relations committee j william fulbright arkansas indiana senator vance hartke minnesota senator and 1968 presidential candidate eugene mccarthy idaho senator frank church connecticut senator abe ribicoff and tennessee senator al gore sr in 1972 south dakota senator george mcgovern won the democratic party nomination for president on an anti war program senator church headed the church committee established in 1975 to investigate abuses and illegal activities carried out by us intelligence agencies throughout the world even into the 1980s most democrats opposed us military intervention against the nicaraguan revolution and other radical movements in central america as late as january 1991 45 democrats in the senate voted against the resolution authorizing george h w bush to launch the first gulf war against iraq although 10 supported it just enough to ensure passage by a 52 47 margin the administration of bill clinton 1993 2001 marked a significant shift clinton picked al gore jr one of the 10 democratic senators who had voted for the gulf war as his running mate and his administration used military force aggressively in bosnia serbia afghanistan iraq sudan somalia and haiti when gore became the democratic presidential nominee in 2000 he chose another hawkish senator joe lieberman as his running mate by 2002 when the authorization for use of military force came before the senate authorizing the administration of george w bush to wage a second us war against iraq the balance within the democratic party had been reversed the vote among senate democrats was 29 21 in favor of the resolution compared to 45 10 against the equivalent resolution in 1991 the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee who backed the resolution and managed its passage was joe biden of delaware now the us president when mass antiwar demonstrations erupted in america and throughout the world the democratic party turned its back on them and embraced the war drive of bush cheney rumsfeld and powell two more significant steps to the right followed in the 2008 campaign for the democratic presidential nomination barack obama attacked hillary clinton incessantly over her 2002 vote for the iraq war he was silent about his own close ties to the us intelligence agencies which personified the deep connections between the democratic party and the wall street military intelligence complex president obama quickly ditched the antiwar rhetoric of candidate obama using us military power just as aggressively as previous administrations he escalated the war in afghanistan as he carried out the drawdown in iraq at the pace set by bush and launched new wars via nato in libya and via islamic proxies in syria and yemen obama then sent us forces back into iraq against isis us forces conducted drone missile warfare on an ever wider geographic scale from pakistan through central asia and the middle east and across north africa the obama administration was part of a broader elevation within the democratic party of candidates with a background in the intelligence agencies and the military whom the world socialist web site refers to as the cia democrats the final chapter in the democratic party s abandonment of any pretense of opposition to war came in the course of the trump administration the principal even the sole axis of the democratic opposition to trump was the anti russia campaign based on the bogus claim that trump was either a russian stooge or an outright agent of vladimir putin this campaign led to the investigation by special counsel robert mueller which turned up no evidence and then to the first impeachment of trump based on his pressuring ukraine to dig up dirt on the bidens by withholding a shipment of us weapons which disrupted long running us plans to escalate the conflict with russia alongside and connected to the transformation of the democratic party is the pro imperialist shift that took place in the middle class particularly its most privileged layers as it emerged in the 1960s the antiwar movement was dominated by sections of the middle class particularly on the campuses the end of the military draft in 1973 was part of a broader strategy of the ruling class to integrate a section of the middle class into the political establishment including through the cultivation of identity politics beyond the corporate and financial aristocracy a section of the upper middle class the top 5 or 10 percent of american society has enriched itself in the course of the four decades long wall street boom which is dependent on the dominant global position of american capitalism the balkan war of the 1990s promoted by the clinton administration as a war for human rights was a turning point as the wsws wrote at the time the objective modus operandi and social implications of the protracted stock market boom have enabled imperialism to recruit from among sections of the upper middle class a new and devoted constituency the reactionary conformist and cynical intellectual climate that prevails in the united states and europe promoted by the media and adapted to by a largely servile and corrupted academic community reflects the social outlook of a highly privileged stratum of the population that is not in the least interested in encouraging a critical examination of the economic and political bases of its newly acquired riches these social processes find their reflection in all the official institutions of the ruling class in the media one cannot find a single voice that questions let alone opposes the official government lies being used to justify war against russia from a left wing standpoint there is no equivalent to cbs anchorman walter cronkite who famously declared his opposition to the vietnam war in the wake of the 1968 tet offensive among the well paid media talking heads as well as the privileged layers in academia imperialism finds an absolutely devoted constituency pseudo left organizations like the democratic socialists of america play a central role in supporting american imperialism and channeling opposition behind the democratic party the liberal magazine american prospect reported on the weekend that in response to questions about us policy in ukraine senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren and representatives alexandria ocasio cortez ilhan omar ayanna pressley and rashida tlaib either declined to answer or did not return calls such transformations are a worldwide phenomenon in germany the green party formed by environmentalists and antiwar activists in the 1970s finally came to power as part of a coalition government in 1998 and the green foreign minister joschka fischer a former radical street fighter spearheaded the dispatch of troops to the former yugoslavia in the first deployment of german forces outside the country since the third reich similar political metamorphoses took place in france britain italy canada australia spain and other countries opposition to war is and must be centered in the working class opinion polls show overwhelming popular opposition to us intervention in any military operations in ukraine or eastern europe but this opposition finds no expression within the official us two party system the struggle against imperialist war cannot be waged through the democratic party or through any of the institutions of the capitalist political establishment it requires the independent mobilization of the working class on the basis of a socialist and internationalist program

india s finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present the country s annual budget on tuesday for the fiscal year that starts on april 1 the budget comes at a time when south asia s largest economy is trying to boost growth back to pre pandemic levels while tackling a third wave of coronavirus infections economists expect infrastructure push to be one of the key themes of tuesday s budget amid signs that investment demand in the country might finally be picking up while pent up consumer demand fizzles out other likely budget priorities would include restoring jobs supporting sectors disproportionately affected by the pandemic banking sector reforms climate policies as well as measures for the health and education sectors t narayan bloomberg getty images india is set to announce its annual budget on tuesday it comes at a time when south asia s largest economy is trying to boost growth and return to pre pandemic levels of expansion while tackling a third wave of coronavirus infections get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters finance minister nirmala sitharaman will be releasing details of the budget for the fiscal year that starts april 1 economists are expecting measures that support growth and also allow the government to reduce its deficits and debt accumulation at the same time she will have to strike a fine balance between the persistent ask for demand stimulus continued capex push and fiscal consolidation bank of america economists said in a jan 25 note they pointed out that with a number of indian states heading to the polls as early as february there are some simmering concerns that the feb 1 budget may turn into a populist one despite the polls pressure we expect union budget to stick to the reform agenda the economists said india will likely rely on strong tax receipts as well as asset sales according to santanu sengupta senior economist at goldman sachs it would probably pull back on a number of covid related subsidies to fund capital spending plans for the next year without excessively accumulating debt he added if you look at tax collections this year it has surprised ahead of budget estimates he said monday on cnbc s street signs asia that includes both direct and indirect taxes with an improved growth trajectory and more formalization of the economy india s tax receipts are getting a boost sengupta explained we expect this tax buoyancy to continue into next year as well he added fiscal deficit india s fiscal deficit target for the new year will be closely watched by investors and ratings agencies a fiscal deficit is the gap between a government s income and spending and it implies that the country is spending more than its revenue india plans to set its deficit target between 6 3 to 6 5 of gdp local media reported citing several government officials that s a touch lower than the current year s target of 6 8 which sitharaman previously said was necessary to get the indian economy back on track after the covid outbreak derailed growth citi analysts this month said their base case projections predict a fiscal deficit target of 6 2 of gdp but they pointed out it remains a broad political call the 60bps of gdp reduction in fiscal deficit would amply demonstrate the government s resolve to get back to the path of fiscal discipline and comfort the investors in the year of possible global bond index inclusion they wrote reports say that indian government bonds could potentially be included in a few global bond indexes this year in what would be a significant milestone for the country the inclusion would allow debt capital to flow into india and could increase foreign ownership of indian government securities bank of america economists expect a comparatively lower but still high fiscal deficit target of 5 8 of gdp goldman sachs expects the figure at 6 3 of gdp while japanese investment bank nomura expects a target of 6 4 of gdp the government s fiscal policy since the pandemic began has prioritised growth and fiscal transparency over fiscal consolidation in the hope that robust medium term growth prospects will help with debt sustainability nomura analysts wrote in a recent note we expect this theme to persist fiscal transparency is where citizens are informed about how the government spends its revenue from tax receipts and other sources infrastructure push economists expect infrastructure push to be one of the key themes of tuesday s budget it comes amid signs that investment demand in the country might finally be picking up while pent up consumer demand fizzles out last year india said it planned to monetize some 81 billion worth of state owned assets over the next four years to boost infrastructure spending and stimulate growth the government planned to lease out assets like gas pipelines roads railway stations and warehousing facilities to the private sector to operate reports said the government is also set to take state owned life insurance corporation public this year in what is said to be india s largest initial public offering visible implementation of the

priorities would include restoring jobs supporting sectors disproportionately affected by the pandemic banking sector reforms climate policies as well as measures for the health and education sectors according to economists while india s national unemployment rate has climbed back to pre pandemic levels of around 7 it is accompanied by a lower rate of labor participation and employment rates that are below the early 2020 levels according to radhika rao senior economist at singapore s dbs group that pointed to the absence of broad based improvement in job conditions she said in a note this month when this is juxtaposed against the faster restoration of formal jobs vs informal jobs and dominance of casual labour lack of a security net as well as self employed in the labour mix the adverse impact on incomes and purchasing power becomes apparent rao said whilst farm jobs were little changed manufacturing followed by service sectors are still below pre pandemic levels she added

china s pandemic controls may outlive the virus during the coronavirus pandemic china has honed its powers to track and corral its 1 4 billion citizens backed by upgraded technology armies of neighborhood workers and broad public support the foundation of the controls is the country s health code based on location travel history test results and other health data people are assigned a color green yellow or red that determines whether they are allowed into buildings or public spaces legions of local officials now have the power to quarantine residents or restrict their movements now officials are turning their sharpened surveillance against other risks including crime pollution and hostile political forces this amounts to a potent techno authoritarian tool for xi jinping china s leader as he intensifies his campaigns against corruption and dissent concerns zan aizong a former journalist in hangzhou said that more surveillance could help the authorities break up dissenters activities he has refused to use the health code but it means that moving around is difficult and he finds it hard to explain his reasoning to workers at checkpoints
errol ross brewster is a caribbean artist from guyana who has lived in barbados and is currently living in the united states he was educated at the ontario college of art in toronto canada and served as director of studies at the e r burrowes school of art in guyana with more than four decades of a caribbean wide multimedia imaging practice he has participated in multiple carifesta s the eu s centro cultural cariforo between the lines travelling exhibition 2000 the first international triennial of caribbean art 2010 and the inter american development bank s sidewalks of the americas installation 2018 you can read more about him and the influences on his artistic practice online in his conversation carried on veerle poupeye s blog about art in the caribbean and beyond being a frequent visitor to the guyana speaks facebook page i saw posted there a call for artwork for the british writer thomas harding s book on the 1823 demerara revolt white debt the demerara uprising and britain s legacy of slavery which has just been published by weidenfeld nicolson as a text about a history i was familiar with i was immediately interested much of my work is inspired by history so this was right up my alley the idea of doing imagined portraits of historical characters for publication in an historical text was something to hotly pursue especially as one of the desired portraits was of an obscure woman leader amba i dove into the book written by the brazilian historian emilia viotti da costa crowns of glory tears of blood the demerara slave rebellion which was recommended to me by dr juanita cox westmaas of ghanaian british heritage and a naturalised guyanese citizen who with rod westmaas co ordinates guyana speaks an initiative that was set up in 2017 and that hosts monthly gatherings on a topic pertaining to guyana from the details in da costa s book i conjured up amba and jack gladstone two of the leaders of the 1823 rebellion portraiture arises out of good eye hand coordination by that i mean that what is required is accurate recording of keen observation of the subject descriptions of jack gladstone appearing in a wanted advertisement in a local newspaper in 1823 offering one thousand guilders for his capture alive it stated that he was about twenty five years of age handsome well made rather a european nose good white teeth other descriptions of him were revealed in da costa s book which provided wide ranging details of the man s character and personality through its reports of his interactions with a cross section of society from the governor s personal servants to fugitives from other plantations hiding in broad daylight the most useful description of jack gladstone s physicality for me was that he was 6 feet 2 inches tall this information was also provided in the wanted advertisement people are proportioned roughly at one to six his head would therefore have to be about twelve inches if his whole body was seventy four inches everything else was about what kind of man jack gladstone was it s not a keen observation kind of business this it s a reverse engineering job i would have to understand who he is and translate that to what physical characteristics people associate such qualities with folks tend to know who s a scamp and who s bright as a lamp from their physical appearance this is quite commonplace so who was this son of an enslaved ghanaian man of god the christian god the archives reveal that his father who had the akan name quamina was a deacon in rev smith s church a man of influence in the community respected and trusted by his congregations including some whites his son jack with whom he was close was associated with the church but not an adherent i made a mental note to self he s of his own mind we learn also that the prosecutor in the kangaroo court case found jack to be an extraordinary man the governor also recognized that his motives were purely political and this would have an impact on the outcome of the case too banishment to st lucia with hard labour instead of death these are no ordinary set of circumstances he was engaged in they would necessitate a highly contemplative man to navigate i think and this had big implications for the drawing it meant jack gladstone must have had tremendous presence an engaging aura da costa s text also revealed that europeans who in their low regard of africans ordinarily reduced them to other invisibility found him to be of a striking appearance as a skilled artisan jack had a certain freedom he would be hired out to neighbouring plantations the text reveals him as a man who wielded influence among men and women he was said to throw himself into all his undertakings with full heart and hand as an artist i had to translate this into features in my mind s eye strength of character bold decisiveness daring intensity questioning concentration they gave good direction to the hundred and one dots scattered across the page to bring jack gladstone to life the text s telling of a range of interactions with others confirmed these qualities that gave all great confidence in his leadership these got translated to a furrowed brow square set jaw line determined chin dimpled for good measure a penetrating gaze from out sensitive eyes and lips fulsome with probing question the level of clandestine organization and coordination along miles of coast and over weeks of planning spoke to a clever mind and a high determination these necessitated the domed forehead of an ample crown tilted in anticipation of weighing what response the enquiry on his lips would bring to his ear their cross referencing convincing jack that all the rumors that the planters were hiding the news of emancipation were true this filled him with an impatience for his longed for freedom to be his own man and da costa s text reveals the surprising fact of his wish to avoid violence his actions saved some whites from certain death including the very man who arrested and detained him such was his ennobled intent and the extent of his influence in steering others to that goal that the governor recognizing it pleaded for leniency he feared that execution the court s verdict on jack would mean that regent street might bun dung amba a leader in the revolt was a young woman exhibiting deep anguish calm but determined with an implacable intent to revenge her people with no compunction she has come to appear to me as an artist as she does by the same reverse engineering i employed with jack the text revealed that she led the freedom fighters on that fateful morning in august 1823 marching them miles to the overseer s house where they stood in the cold dark foreday morning to await his emergence into the hostility of her intent amba was a woman apart exercising an outsized influence over others of the enslaved on the plantation she laboured at like most african women her age she was likely possessed of a lissome figure she was said to be tall wiry with narrow shoulders i imagined her to be a gawky woman whose influence over other came not so much from her physicality she was like a broomstick but strong the force of her command came from her determination seeming to be all seeing she would look people over with her big baleful eyes which signaled that she did not tolerate frivolity the men she commanded well knew this her locks which she did not cover as did other women stood prominently on her head seeming to mirror the fighting men standing in a seething silence that morning outside the overseer s house who among the enslaved women wore jewelry no one but in my mind s eye amba fashioned hoop earrings for herself and i imaged her as having the extraordinary presence of a runway model one modeling such fierce intent that she was aghast that her men were having difficulty disarming the overseer according to the declaration of one mr shepard of porters hope in the court transcripts she ordered that they shoot the overseer what just the day before the overseer would have seen as insubordination on amba s ready lips he would now have understood as being her strong self assertion on this particular morning suited in his well pressed short khaki pants her demeanor held a frightening control over him and in that moment he could tell that by her nose she understood the fear he was feeling she signaled the men to drag him off to the plantation stocks these leaders could make such choices because of their confidence in the justice of their cause it gave them a steely laser focused determination a sure knowing of their purpose the commendable attributes of great leadership not hatred not anger astonishingly look them in their face you ll see that humanity this is what i tried to communicate in the two portraits i produced having an equal part of my heritage according to dna test results tied to the tumultuous horror of enslavement and being a descendant of those of the fante people ripped from their homeland family name traditions and language i feel an urgent imperative to help gather the scattered fragments of history through my art this request of thomas harding the author of the just published white debt for portraits of the leaders of the 1823 demerara revolt played directly into that aspiration of mine and i thank him sincerely for the opportunity to contribute to the book i hope to parlay this visualizing of these two important historical figures into the commissioning of local artists by the guyana government and the private sector to involve our young people in the creation of a series of large fresco murals of the significant leaders of our historical resistance efforts and to also embed them in our currency this way people may have them at hand to bring to bear on us in a directly felt manner our awesome responsibility to be free of domination local or foreign a celebration of the1823 revolt with a two hundred dollar coin in 2023 and as a fitting tribute to our ancestors let us rename middle street along which the decapitated heads of freedom fighters were placed on stakes to dissuade further attempts to be free to avenue of the 823 demerara revolt tuh please
india s finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present the country s annual budget on tuesday for the fiscal year that starts on april 1 the budget comes at a time when south asia s largest economy is trying to boost growth back to pre pandemic levels while tackling a third wave of coronavirus infections economists expect infrastructure push to be one of the key themes of tuesday s budget amid signs that investment demand in the country might finally be picking up while pent up consumer demand fizzles out other likely budget priorities would include restoring jobs supporting sectors disproportionately affected by the pandemic banking sector reforms climate policies as well as measures for the health and education sectors t narayan bloomberg getty images india is set to announce its annual budget on tuesday it comes at a time when south asia s largest economy is trying to boost growth and return to pre pandemic levels of expansion while tackling a third wave of coronavirus infections feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here finance minister nirmala sitharaman will be releasing details of the budget for the fiscal year that starts april 1 economists are expecting measures that support growth and also allow the government to reduce its deficits and debt accumulation at the same time she will have to strike a fine balance between the persistent ask for demand stimulus continued capex push and fiscal consolidation bank of america economists said in a jan 25 note they pointed out that with a number of indian states heading to the polls as early as february there are some simmering concerns that the feb 1 budget may turn into a populist one despite the polls pressure we expect union budget to stick to the reform agenda the economists said india will likely rely on strong tax receipts as well as asset sales according to santanu sengupta senior economist at goldman sachs it would probably pull back on a number of covid related subsidies to fund capital spending plans for the next year without excessively accumulating debt he added if you look at tax collections this year it has surprised ahead of budget estimates he said monday on cnbc s street signs asia that includes both direct and indirect taxes with an improved growth trajectory and more formalization of the economy india s tax receipts are getting a boost sengupta explained we expect this tax buoyancy to continue into next year as well he added fiscal deficit india s fiscal deficit target for the new year will be closely watched by investors and ratings agencies a fiscal deficit is the gap between a government s income and spending and it implies that the country is spending more than its revenue india plans to set its deficit target between 6 3 to 6 5 of gdp local media reported citing several government officials that s a touch lower than the current year s target of 6 8 which sitharaman previously said was necessary to get the indian economy back on track after the covid outbreak derailed growth citi analysts this month said their base case projections predict a fiscal deficit target of 6 2 of gdp but they pointed out it remains a broad political call the 60bps of gdp reduction in fiscal deficit would amply demonstrate the government s resolve to get back to the path of fiscal discipline and comfort the investors in the year of possible global bond index inclusion they wrote reports say that indian government bonds could potentially be included in a few global bond indexes this year in what would be a significant milestone for the country the inclusion would allow debt capital to flow into india and could increase foreign ownership of indian government securities bank of america economists expect a comparatively lower but still high fiscal deficit target of 5 8 of gdp goldman sachs expects the figure at 6 3 of gdp while japanese investment bank nomura expects a target of 6 4 of gdp the government s fiscal policy since the pandemic began has prioritised growth and fiscal transparency over fiscal consolidation in the hope that robust medium term growth prospects will help with debt sustainability nomura analysts wrote in a recent note we expect this theme to persist fiscal transparency is where citizens are informed about how the government spends its revenue from tax receipts and other sources infrastructure push economists expect infrastructure push to be one of the key themes of tuesday s budget it comes amid signs that investment demand in the country might finally be picking up while pent up consumer demand fizzles out last year india said it planned to monetize some 81 billion worth of state owned assets over the next four years to boost infrastructure spending and stimulate growth the government planned to lease out assets like gas pipelines roads railway stations and warehousing facilities to the private sector to operate reports said the government is also set to take state owned life insurance corporation public this year in what is said to be india s largest initial public offering visible implementation of the asset monetization pipeline infra pipeline and disinvestment plans will be high on the government agenda and a key market focus citi analysts said restoring jobs and reforms

together russia and its neighbour produce a quarter of global wheat barley and corn half of sunflower products and a fifth of rapeseed according to rabobank its analysts say fighting could impact half of ukraine s wheat production meaning prices could be pushed up at a time when global food costs are already at their highest level since 2011 is incredibly fertile and you can get a huge yield on agriculture says liam peach at capital economics it s why ukrainian agriculture is such a large industry and ukraine is one of the biggest exporters of wheat for example is incredibly fertile and you can get a huge yield on agriculture liam peach capital economics that s one of ukraine s biggest geographical benefits that russia would be able to benefit from already putin has seized some of its most valuable assets after the 2014 conflict dealing a big blow to ukraine s industrial and energy hubs the country says 80 per cent of its oil and gas assets in the black sea were taken in the annexation of crimea warning it could cost kyiv hundreds of billions of dollars russian backed separatists also seized some of eastern ukraine s industrial hubs such as around the city of donetsk with more manufacturing vulnerable to further incursions ukraine s iron ore is its third biggest export and production is concentrated in its central and eastern regions when it lost control of areas of donbas that was quite painful because donbas is the main industrial region in ukraine says orlova ukraine was exporting coal now ukraine is importing coal because it lost control over the coal producing regions experts say regions still under ukrainian control to the east remain vital to its economy but are also most likely to be disrupted in any attack while kyiv is the beating heart of its economy goldman sachs estimates that around 22 per cent of ukrainian output is the eastern regions of donetsk kharkiv and dnipropetrovsk a hub for the manufacturing of agricultural machinery and aerospace equipment that makes up a tenth of gdp despite the deep historical and cultural links between russia and ukraine the latter has been moving closer to the eu both politically and economically since 2014 slipping from moscow s sphere of influence just as the russian bear becomes more aggressive some six in 10 ukrainians want to join the eu compared to a fifth that would support a customs union involving russia according to a poll late last year while 54 per cent back joining nato while russia remains the top destination for ukrainian products around a tenth of exports this is dwarfed by rising exports to eu countries which account for about 40 per cent meanwhile ukraine plans to apply for eu membership as the economies of recent entrants boom such as poland loading i think putin s greatest concern is a stable prosperous ukraine right across the border from russia says joseph dresen an expert at the woodrow wilson center in the far distant or maybe not far distant future russian citizens have an example of people who very much look like them and talk like them that are enjoying a normal life a prosperous ukraine on its border serving as an example of how russians could be living for russia s oligarchs he adds that there would be a lot of opportunity for further theft and graft from the state efforts to reconstruct ukrainian territory following an invasion last week us president joe biden reportedly told ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky to prepare for impact as an invasion is almost a certainty warning that the capital kyiv could be sacked loading despite the economic prizes and political control on offer in ukraine dresen and other experts question whether these could possibly outweigh the costs of harsh sanctions and market turmoil that russia could face already russian and ukrainian assets have sold off heavily in anticipation of an invasion with the rouble last week slumping to its lowest level versus the dollar since november 2020 sliding stock prices and plunging bonds would tighten financial conditions for russian businesses and a suite of sanctions would ramp up the pressure on moscow sanctions that have been floated include in effect banning russia from using us dollars restricting access to debt markets and excluding the country from international payments system swift making it harder for its banks to do business sanctions on russian oil and gas meanwhile would deal a huge blow to its energy dependent economy yet would also come at a highly sensitive moment for inflation battered european households in the event of an invasion says peach we can be pretty certain that there s going to be a pretty ferocious response from the us and the eu there s going to be some very restrictive sanctions that are going to cause a lot of pain to russia s economy and financial markets moscow has had a taste of the potential impact with its economy having badly suffered in the mid 2010s after being hit by a combination of plunging oil prices and international sanctions sofya donets russia economist at moscow based renaissance capital says there is no economic reasoning and no economic benefits for russia to attack given the potential fallout primarily economic implications of previous tensions and previous sanctions went through investments and went through currency the sensitivity of the currency to all kinds of external tensions is quite high she says the economic impact of sanctions on the government or individuals is not that important but warns measures targeting large banks or companies could be quite costly meanwhile according to donets any ukrainian territory taken by russia will need huge spending and investments nonetheless since its last land grab russia has been preparing for its next it s about russian identity it s about his view of ukraine being part of russia s sphere of influence says tim ash at bluebay asset management moscow has been building up the defences of its economy and businesses against the threat of more western sanctions becoming more self sufficient to cushion any future blow from a flare up in tensions the strategy dubbed fortress russia has included bolstering its foreign currency and gold reserves while shifting trade towards china amid the threat of america imposing an export ban of certain technologies and equipment loading certainly invested considerable effort in trying to ensure that were they to be targeted by sanctions again then they have got themselves in a more robust position economically says tom keatinge at defence think tank the royal united services institute arguably the west has got more entwined with russia in the last eight years at a point when actually the west should have been getting less entwined and preparing for the worst which we re potentially looking at now

a former ames at the nearly empty diamond point plaza outside baltimore maryland image via google maps by addison del mastro i was driving around maryland last week and i stopped at a large thrift store in wheaton a dc suburb in montgomery county this particular store began life in 1961 as a towers mart a local discount chain then became a zayre and finally an ames zayre acquired it after towers went bankrupt ames bought zayre ames one of the largest and longest surviving major competitors to walmart gave up the ghost in 2002 by the mid 2000s retail had become both larger and more concentrated than it was in the postwar era stores of this size are not as common as they once were hundreds of such buildings vacated in the 1990s and 2000s remained empty for years sometimes decades some still are for example take a look at this modern fossil outside baltimore preserved by neglect the former ames building in wheaton sits on an odd parcel with part of the parking lot built on a steep slope it s also obviously a pretty old building as box stores go it s too small for a walmart or target which are pretty much built out anyway and it s too large for a supermarket or a medium box store like a dick s petco barnes noble best buy etc the giant thrift store that occupies it which imitates the layout and product range of a discount department store is basically a perfect fit it allows people in this crowded deeply settled area to donate a lot of stuff that would otherwise end up in a landfill and it provides cheap and often pretty good merchandise to the area s less affluent residents it was also a fun diversion when i was a grad student in nearby college park here s the satellite view of the strip plaza where the store is located and below it a photo of the store s cavernous interior the drop ceiling and exposed fluorescent lights scream ames or k mart don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free the stoneymill square shopping center image via google maps interior of unique thrift store in wheaton maryland image provided by author notice how many homes mostly modest postwar construction are within walking distance of the plaza which also includes a small korean focused international supermarket also notice how it s an island bounded by roads including a six lane stroad what does that mean in an area that s trended a little more working class over the decades lots of pedestrians navigating a built environment that was designed for motoring it s quite common in this area of maryland to see food trucks or carts set up in parking lots the space is freed up either due to retail vacancies or to higher than planned pedestrian traffic often selling latino foods or snacks in the overbuilt parking lot of the giant thrift store there were not one not two but three food trucks at least on the day i visited i was there too early for lunch and they still appeared to be setting up two food trucks in the back section of the unique stoneymill square parking lot there was a third one on the other end image provided by author how many such vendors are licensed if the washington dc food truck scene is any indication not all of them washington city paper ran a march 2021 piece on the fight for business between flashy licensed food trucks and their plainer often unlicensed competitors in dc as in maryland most of these are latino owned and serve latin american staples it s sometimes suggested that latino immigrants tend to treat american strip plazas like mexcian or central american town squares places to hang out or engage in small scale commerce spaces to be by contrast native born americans and particularly white suburbanites tend to regard strip plazas as places to go for specific narrow reasons and then leave i m sure this oversimplifies things but it seems to hold some explanatory power this parking lot is apparently used for a few other things too which i did not notice or were not set up when i was there according to a montgomery county based transit activist people use this parking lot for food trucks with seating wholesale retail vending of produce coconuts guavas collard greens religious services and car repair in addition to parking if only more parking lots were like that pic twitter com 6pdun4gq3l action committee for transit actfortransit august 10 2021 for something similar take a look at this row of repurposed multifamily houses now various offices and businesses in the relatively poor and heavily immigrant community of langley park about 20 minutes away langley park suffers even more intensely from the dynamic of heavy pedestrian traffic in a working class and largely car less community originally designed for the motoring middle class a row of multifamily structures along maryland 193 now house businesses and offices in langley park this isn t aesthetically pleasing in fact it s the kind of environment that growing up in quiet affluent white suburbia you instinctively learn to avoid in some cases though there s nothing malign going on there s just no particular reason to go to these places i frequented a thrift store and international supermarket along here in grad school but lots of people didn t and most of them didn t have offensive reasons not to this isn t to glorify it either this community does have an elevated rate of poverty dangerous highways lots of traffic and a very old housing stock don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free but while i might once have just seen run down buildings through my windshield and kept on driving now i see people doing what they can with what they have it s not perfect they don t think it s perfect but it s better than abandonment and blight many hold the impression that the working class immigrants who often own and patronize these businesses are to blame for the physical decay but they re simply buying or renting what s available often from commercial landlords who are speculating on the land maryland s purple line light rail project is expected to drive some revitalization as well as gentrification here what s more suburbia doesn t physically age well most of the structures along here and many throughout the whole area are well past their design life i see people trying to make this landscape into something better something it wasn t designed for and to find a way to blame them for its shortcomings strikes me as cruel if it didn t look like this what would it look like not like how it began that s baked into it from the start there s a tendency to view this kind of informal reuse of once pristine suburban landscapes as sort of akin to downcycling a term that denotes the reuse of something in an inferior manner to its original use it codes as decline poverty disinvestment it suggests crime or maybe just a little unchosen and occasionally fraught human interaction like busking or begging or unlicensed food carts we ve come to have a low tolerance for chaos and disorder we expect things to be neat organized clean frictionless this expectation is ironic because we glorify our country s rough and tumble entrepreneurial history yet we often look down on people who embody it today and on the commercial landscapes that result back in 2019 i attended charles marohn s strong towns book talk fittingly in the nearby dc suburb of greenbelt maryland he may not have used the word chaos but he argued that affluent suburbanites were basically wrong in their expectation that we were rich enough to buy our way out of that rough and tumble the need to be constantly productive and the certain messiness that comes with it in reality it s more like we re living on accumulated capital that we re no longer producing even a couple of years ago this wasn t something that would have occurred to me until i learned more about these issues it was at most an intellectual proposition now it s a part of my everyday perception i hope others can see things like this differently too and next time i ll go thrifting at lunch time and try the tacos strong towns is inspiring new advocates and changing the

fixating on vaccinations as a way of addressing the current crisis may blind us from addressing the social fallout the developing world is going through as a result of the pandemic divesh kaul writes the united states and several industrialized countries are in the grips of a supply chain hiccup and explaining it appears to get mired in heated ideological debates that tend to miss the impact the pandemic had on much of the world s poor people and households who actually power these supply chains whereas global poverty was on a downward trend in pre pandemic times multiple crises as a result of the covid 19 pandemic and a global recession have led the world bank to note that almost 100 million more people were added to poverty in 2020 a majority of them living in south asia and sub saharan africa although vaccination drives are a positive step the pandemic is far from over and will not be over just by inoculating the world since covid 19 was declared a pandemic in march 2020 lives have been lost healthcare systems came under unprecedented pressure and the global economy took a nosedive upending countless livelihoods around the world however developing countries have faced significantly sharper challenges than rich nations largely because the pandemic is not just a health emergency there but more so a social and economic catastrophe for instance the pandemic has exacerbated food insecurity with rising food prices leaving a greater impact in low and middle income countries in 2020 the pandemic wiped close to 255 million jobs with losses exceptionally higher in the global south also read sustaining post covid economic recovery is a challenging task and much will depend on the performance of financial sector disruptions caused in food supply by the pandemic among other factors may soon double hunger levels in the global south this is due to supply chain problems export restrictions by on food grains hoarding of commodities a disruption in the supply chain of food commodities due to fear of covid exposure among workers limitations on the movement of migrant labour reduction or loss of family income and inflation in food prices a commentator notes that disruptions in the supply chain including short term undersupply hoarding and overcharging have resulted in a global price rise in the food basket of 20 to 50 per cent even in countries with a high gdp economic inequalities meant lower access to health which led to disproportionately high numbers of covid cases amongst marginalized social groups for instance in spain and in the united states neighbourhoods of working class and racial minority groups respectively have suffered relatively more disruptions in the supply chain including short term undersupply hoarding and overcharging have resulted in a global price rise in the food basket of 20 to 50 per cent even in countries with a high gdp economic inequalities meant lower access to health which led to disproportionately high numbers of covid cases amongst marginalized social groups these far reaching effects in the developing world are set to generate shocks to global trade due to unforeseen supply chain disruptions intermediate and finished commodities either slowed down or were delayed demand shock as a result of shrinking consumer action could translate into lower economic growth central banks have responded by lowering interest rates and boosting financial markets governments expanded some social policies including cash transfers food assistance and support for low wage workers the pandemic also has implications for individual rights such as the right to life freedom of expression the right to privacy and protection against discrimination governments around the world are navigating a complex tension between patient rights and citizen privacy on one hand and public safety and health on the other these coercive public curtailing freedoms in the interest of containing the virus run the hazard of turning into absolutist measures if they are used disproportionally extended beyond their scope or prolonged indefinitely also read lack of political will and ipr rules stand in the way of mass vaccination for covid 19 impact on right to health the right to health is also under threat although it is guaranteed as a right under international covenants it often comes down to the ability of states to provide resources to meet that ideal for instance the 1997 judgment by the south african constitutional court in the case of thiagraj soobramoney vs minister of health kwazulu natal highlighted that a right is not absolute and that a state can only guarantee those rights for which it has commensurate resources available it held that non emergency medical treatment is qualified by the availability of resources for the progressive realization of such a right also read covid 19 pandemic has shown india why healthcare reforms are imperative in the midst of the covid 19 crisis there were countless media reports showing severe shortages of oxygen beds and other medical necessities these crises force those families to spend their entire life savings or incur debt many have resorted to crowdfunding portals for financial support this health crisis will likely further complicate the economic picture in those countries the situation as regards healthcare calls for a paradigm shift whereby in lieu of regarding it as an expenditure healthcare is sought as a high return investment which can materially reduce out of pocket spending and at the same time raise output as the 2014 nobel peace prize laureate and child rights activist kailash satyarthi noted there is a variance between a right and a service delivery model of development the situation as regards healthcare calls for a paradigm shift whereby in lieu of regarding it as an expenditure healthcare is sought as a high return investment which can materially reduce out of pocket spending and at the same time raise output in economist and 1998 nobel prize in economic sciences laureate amartya sen s words a basic minimum of protections is essential to justice and to further one s freedoms and capabilities health and access to healthcare being one such indicator also read lessons from private sector engagement with covid 19 for universal health care impact on marginalized groups the right to health implies that this obligation is granted without discrimination on the grounds of race age or ethnicity this extends to protecting vulnerable minority groups we know that when a health crisis unravels racial or religious minorities are often portrayed villainously as the cause of the crisis chinese immigrants in some cities in the u s were afflicted with discriminatory treatment during the bubonic plague of the 19th century a u s city council s quarantine ordinance was claimed to have been enforced only against residents of chinese nationality or race and resulted in arbitrary unjust and wrongful interference with their personal liberty we are no longer in the 19th century yet problems of a similar kind persist the outbreak has spurred xenophobic rhetoric and hate crimes against asian americans and other racial minorities so much so that a new law the covid 19 hate crimes act has been needed india is no less immune to the hate virus fanned by disinformation and bias against religious and racial minorities while the covid pandemic lingers around the world it has exacerbated the plight of refugees who have been forced to leave their homes as a result of civil war and other conflicts or hardships restricted access to health services and vulnerability toward the virus further aggravate their suffering and misery at the time of a crisis there needs to be sensitivity and empathy toward minority groups instead of blaming them for the crisis and continue a renewed support to the displaced also read politics around covid vaccine access in context of covid 19 prevalence and mortality women have also suffered disproportionately during the pandemic they populate critical sectors like healthcare and are often the primary caregiver in households in many communities around the world they drive the informal economy particularly in lower and middle income countries on top of that they have suffered such an exacerbation of domestic violence that united nations women called it a shadow pandemic these issues will together widen the gender gap for instance decrease in family income coupled with inadequate safety nets may result in several negative coping mechanisms such as reduced nutrition marrying off a minor girl child child labour or cancelling their school enrolment covid 19 is not gender blind the response should not be either governments ought to target health and social protection responses for single mothers with children widows or female farmers in the form of cash transfers or other adequate safety nets that are equitable and just also read food for thought covid 19 makes life precarious for app based delivery men ip restrictions inhibiting vaccine access in global south as we attempt to address these global inequities we need a people friendly international economic law as popularized by legal scholar b s chimni this means for example loosening intellectual property rights protection in events like the pandemic we are in it is an instance where domestic policy needs and the general welfare of the global community are in tension with the private commercial interests of pharmaceutical companies india the pharmacy of the developing world plays an important role in providing low cost life saving medicines to developing countries where the key to a critical ip protection regime is maintaining a balance between economic incentives for innovation and not deprive marginalized groups of medicines a un panel advised that a higher threshold of international agreements in the form of trips plus commitments would compromise access to health technologies with serious implications for low income groups for instance repudiating compulsory licensing would directly affect the supply of low cost generic medicines which are a lifeline to developing countries also read covid 19 and the shortage of drugs a case for compulsory licensing according to the scientific publication our world in data as of january 12 2022 in low income countries less than 10 per cent of people have received at least one dose against covid 19 while in some countries with high gdp upwards of fifty per cent of the total population e g united arab emirates 91 per cent spain 81 per cent chile 86 per cent france 74 per cent united states 62 per cent have been fully vaccinated its statistics also indicate that in india roughly 46 per cent of the total population has been fully vaccinated until january 12 2022 whereas in the entire continent of africa less than 10 per cent of the total population have been fully vaccinated a number of states such as india and south africa have insisted that the covid 19 vaccine be made a public good by temporarily waiving ip rights by world trade organization and mandating emergency production otherwise as argued by fatima hassan a south african social justice activist and human rights lawyer the situation risks becoming vaccine apartheid similarly global leaders and philanthropists have urged the relaxing of ip rules for the vaccine that vaccination and the distribution thereof should not rely on market forces and that vaccines should first go to people who need them most and not the highest bidder also read how long must poorer nations wait for access to covid vaccine needed solutions with global ownership a pandemic of such magnitude begs global solidarity and cooperation otherwise we are likely to face second order and third order effects that will be hole we will take years to dig ourselves out of the implications are global and there is a socioeconomic upshot in africa the covid 19 shock can convert into a social and economic emergency with short and long term adverse effects such as lower trade and foreign investment a demand slump a supply shock affecting international trade and a detrimental impact on people s livelihoods and well being at the time of a crisis there needs to be sensitivity and empathy toward minority groups instead of blaming them for the crisis and continue a renewed support to the displaced furthermore the pandemic may disrupt and contract african imports from western and asian countries at present over 50 per cent of the industrial machinery manufacturing and transport equipment utilized by african industries are imported from countries located in other continents similarly in the asia pacific region a protracted pandemic may result in a social crisis and a shock to critical supply chains a variety of measures could prevent this health crisis from becoming a social and economic nightmare also read covid 19 pandemic calls for early relaxations on iprs first we should temporarily reduce trade barriers on health and pharmaceutical products including ventilators medicines and personal protective equipment for instance brazil and pakistan have temporarily eliminated duties on medical equipment and hospital products india has waived duties on vaccines for some time second we should facilitate the mobility of health services and personnel cuban doctors offering medical assistance in italy and south africa is an instance third we should enhance trade environment and production capacities and remove barriers to trade particularly tariffs of up to 10 per cent that some countries have kept on essential items such as covid test kits and tariffs on face marks as high as 55 per cent of the import value remedial steps include lowering trade measures and avoiding unnecessary trade barriers and export restrictions on agricultural food and other essential products raising transparency about national trade measures and policy responses improving access to trade finance fourth we should prioritize global supply chains particularly for essential and medical commodities responding to supply side restraints and setting up green lanes to facilitate the processing of essential items through entry ports and border crossings with minimal human contact and delays by enabling e payments e signatures and e contracts would help restore global supplies and last we should involve regional and global financial institutions and development banks in streamlining fiscal constraints without however undermining the national policy space mandates steered by global institutions states such as fiscal austerity must not compromise states capability to ensure a social protection floor and other public spending measures that may deprive or encroach upon people s economic social and cultural rights there is a real risk the pandemic is widening inequality so much so that some have warned of an upcoming neo feudalism in the united states roughly 40 per cent of households earning below 40 000 a year lost their a job early on the in the pandemic the unemployment rate shot up from 6 8 per cent to 21 2 per cent in a month march to april 2020 for those not possessing a high school degree those working in the informal sector or in blue collar jobs mostly work in crowded urban settings where social distancing is not always a possibility the same is true about dwelling in slums where people live in close proximity often without access to basic daily necessities such as clean water vaccination and the distribution thereof should not rely on market forces and vaccines should first go to people who need them most and not the highest bidder also read covid 19 pandemic benefitted india s rich and impoverished india s middle class those driven into poverty as a result of our mismanagement of the pandemic will likely rise up and those with abundant socio economic resources may concentrate more power in their hands we are seeing glimpses of that in the recent labour strikes besetting america as workers compare their fate to their chief executive officers raking in massive sums of compensation we should know that unless we are able to vaccinate the last human in the remotest corner of the planet and do so as we remedy the social fallout we will not triumph against the

india s finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present the country s annual budget on tuesday for the fiscal year that starts on april 1 the budget comes at a time when south asia s largest economy is trying to boost growth back to pre pandemic levels while tackling a third wave of coronavirus infections economists expect infrastructure push to be one of the key themes of tuesday s budget amid signs that investment demand in the country might finally be picking up while pent up consumer demand fizzles out other likely budget priorities would include restoring jobs supporting sectors disproportionately affected by the pandemic banking sector reforms climate policies as well as measures for the health and education sectors t narayan bloomberg getty images india is set to announce its annual budget on tuesday it comes at a time when south asia s largest economy is trying to boost growth and return to pre pandemic levels of expansion while tackling a third wave of coronavirus infections get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters finance minister nirmala sitharaman will be releasing details of the budget for the fiscal year that starts april 1 economists are expecting measures that support growth and also allow the government to reduce its deficits and debt accumulation at the same time she will have to strike a fine balance between the persistent ask for demand stimulus continued capex push and fiscal consolidation bank of america economists said in a jan 25 note they pointed out that with a number of indian states heading to the polls as early as february there are some simmering concerns that the feb 1 budget may turn into a populist one despite the polls pressure we expect union budget to stick to the reform agenda the economists said india will likely rely on strong tax receipts as well as asset sales according to santanu sengupta senior economist at goldman sachs it would probably pull back on a number of covid related subsidies to fund capital spending plans for the next year without excessively accumulating debt he added if you look at tax collections this year it has surprised ahead of budget estimates he said monday on cnbc s street signs asia that includes both direct and indirect taxes with an improved growth trajectory and more formalization of the economy india s tax receipts are getting a boost sengupta explained we expect this tax buoyancy to continue into next year as well he added fiscal deficit india s fiscal deficit target for the new year will be closely watched by investors and ratings agencies a fiscal deficit is the gap between a government s income and spending and it implies that the country is spending more than its revenue india plans to set its deficit target between 6 3 to 6 5 of gdp local media reported citing several government officials that s a touch lower than the current year s target of 6 8 which sitharaman previously said was necessary to get the indian economy back on track after the covid outbreak derailed growth citi analysts this month said their base case projections predict a fiscal deficit target of 6 2 of gdp but they pointed out it remains a broad political call the 60bps of gdp reduction in fiscal deficit would amply demonstrate the government s resolve to get back to the path of fiscal discipline and comfort the investors in the year of possible global bond index inclusion they wrote reports say that indian government bonds could potentially be included in a few global bond indexes this year in what would be a significant milestone for the country the inclusion would allow debt capital to flow into india and could increase foreign ownership of indian government securities bank of america economists expect a comparatively lower but still high fiscal deficit target of 5 8 of gdp goldman sachs expects the figure at 6 3 of gdp while japanese investment bank nomura expects a target of 6 4 of gdp the government s fiscal policy since the pandemic began has prioritised growth and fiscal transparency over fiscal consolidation in the hope that robust medium term growth prospects will help with debt sustainability nomura analysts wrote in a recent note we expect this theme to persist fiscal transparency is where citizens are informed about how the government spends its revenue from tax receipts and other sources infrastructure push economists expect infrastructure push to be one of the key themes of tuesday s budget it comes amid signs that investment demand in the country might finally be picking up while pent up consumer demand fizzles out last year india said it planned to monetize some 81 billion worth of state owned assets over the next four years to boost infrastructure spending and stimulate growth the government planned to lease out assets like gas pipelines roads railway stations and warehousing facilities to the private sector to operate reports said the government is also set to take state owned life insurance corporation public this year in what is said to be india s largest initial public offering visible implementation of the asset monetization pipeline infra pipeline and disinvestment plans will be high on the government agenda and a key market focus citi analysts said restoring jobs and reforms other likely budget priorities would include restoring jobs supporting sectors disproportionately affected by the pandemic banking sector reforms climate policies as well as measures for the health and education sectors according to economists while india s national unemployment rate has climbed back to pre pandemic levels of around 7 it is accompanied by a lower rate of labor participation and employment rates that are below the early 2020 levels according to radhika rao senior economist at singapore s dbs group that pointed to the absence of broad based improvement in job conditions she said in a note this month when this is juxtaposed against the faster restoration of formal jobs vs informal jobs and dominance of casual labour lack of a security net as well as self employed in the labour mix the adverse impact on incomes and purchasing power becomes apparent rao said whilst farm jobs were little changed manufacturing followed by service sectors are still below pre pandemic levels she added the government needs policies to revive and support the micro small and medium scale businesses which are the biggest job creators in india according to rumki majumdar an economist at deloitte identifying their pain areas and devising a solution to help them become a part of atmanirbhar bharat will aid in their recovery she wrote atmanirbhar bharat is a campaign that s part of the government s policy push to make india more self reliant in addition access to credit is critical and providing targeted credit support to these enterprises should be considered majumdar added
