jocelyn gecker associated press san francisco when classrooms in california reopen for the fall term all 6 2 million public school students will have the option of free school meals regardless of their family s income the undertaking made possible by an unexpected budget surplus will be the largest free student lunch program in the country school officials lawmakers anti hunger organizations and parents are applauding it as a pioneering way to prevent the stigma of accepting free lunches and to feed more hungry children this is so historic it s beyond life changing said erin primer director of food services for the san luis coastal unified school district on california s central coast several u s cities including new york boston and chicago already offer free school meals for all but until recently statewide universal meal programs were considered too costly and unrealistic california became the first state to adopt a universal program late last month and maine followed shortly after with a similar plan we ve completely leveled the playing field when it comes to school food primer said the extra funding will also allow her to offer tastier better quality food such as fresh bread produce and cheese from local producers she said under federal rules a family of four must make less than 34 000 a year to qualify for free meals and 48 000 to qualify for reduced price meals the caps shift annually but are based on federal poverty measures that don t take into account the high cost of living and taxes in california millions of californians to get 600 stimulus checksfrom the state starting in september so it s just for the most poor families and not even all of them because some people failed to sign up or were fearful to sign up said kat taylor a philanthropist and major funder of the center for ecoliteracy and the tomkat ranch that backed california s plan about 60 of california students qualify but experts say the number of children who need food assistance is much higher in a state with vast income inequality communities of color are disproportionately affected and immigrant communities in particular are fearful of applying because of detailed forms that ask intrusive questions such as their family income social security number and children s immigration status schools reported a declining percentage of families applying for free and reduced price meals during the trump administration which attempted to tighten immigration policies and public benefits like school officials statewide primer has countless tales of children who struggled to pay for school meals or were too ashamed to eat for free there was the child whose mother called primer distraught because she made a few hundred dollars too much to qualify the father who is in the country illegally and feared that filling out the free meal application could get him deported and constant cases of high schoolers not wanting friends to know they need free food so they skip eating when the pandemic hit it changed everything including how school meals were served and provided an impetus for the universal program which had bipartisan unanimous support lawmakers previously had only pursued targeted bills such as easing school lunch debt after schools shut in march 2020 many transformed their parking lots into pickup sites and federal funding allowed schools to offer meals to anyone there were no applications or qualifications and no questions were asked the massive turnout showed how much families rely on the meals bug infestations tent lined streets california s homelessness crisis is at a tipping point will a 12b plan put a dent in it the los angeles unified school district the state s largest with 600 000 students handed out upward of 400 000 meals a day said spokeswoman shannon haber san luis coastal with 7 500 students gave out 30 000 meals a week at the height of the pandemic nearly triple the number before the district includes the wealthy city of san luis obispo and lower income areas i thought it was a pipe dream for a long time said sen nancy skinner a longtime advocate for universal free meals backed by over 200 organizations in a coalition called school meals for all skinner and other lawmakers pushed for funding in the state budget seizing the momentum at a time when california is flush with cash the 262 billion budget provides 54 million for the coming school year supplementing funding from the biden administration through june after that california will spend 650 million annually if you re a hungry child you re not going to learn well said skinner a democrat representing berkeley why should we have to go through a bureaucratic hassle to get a kid fed when we could just have universal meals senate education committee republicans supported the plan as a way to help families struggling with california s high cost of living sen brian dahle a republican from a largely rural area of northern california said he had watched kids at his children s school steal leftover food when cafeteria workers weren t looking for a lot of them that was their dinner and they were sneaking it or taking it off someone s plate when they didn t finish it said dahle schools rarely turn hungry kids away but for children who didn t qualify and needed lunch their parents were billed and many racked up huge debts in recent years some schools threatened to not let students graduate middle or high school until lunch debts were paid or stamped the hands of students who owed money said jessica bartholow chief of staff for skinner who previously was an anti hunger advocate

june 1949 the american medical association s annual convention was held in atlantic city filling the run down seaside town s parking lots with out of state cadillacs one of the main events of the weekend was demonstrating a new tool for training doctors medical color television a futuristic seeming replacement for the tiers of ringed seats of the traditional operating room surgical amphitheater but tv was too poor a teaching substitute until color came along after an elaborate luncheon was over a spokesman for the manufacturer smith kline and french strongly suggested that the doctors wives leave the hall as the live images would be very graphic to his surprise most of the ladies stayed and watched most of them impassively sipping coffee and smoking cigarettes i mentioned it was 1949 right someone explained to the skf man that the women were or had been nurses and had seen far worse they met their husbands on the job in 1949 that was as common a fact of women s lives as hats white gloves and handbags for women getting ahead in life generally involved marriage with the goal of marrying up it had always been the way of the world november 1977 a brave new world for men and women after the overlapping but different 50s 70s cultural revolutions associated with playboy cosmopolitan and ms magazines but far from a completely changed one xerox corporation held its worldwide conference for executives in boca raton the last day was futures day when most of the attendees would finally get their first ever look at the next generation office technology that the company had been creating since 1973 to them the xerox alto workstation was a tv you could type on like the personal computers that were just beginning to appear but alto came with word processing a new term built in networking and a new invention that played to xerox s strengths the laser printer attendees were invited to step forward and spend some time using the new equipment the men were moderately impressed interesting was the consensus but by and large they weren t that excited by seeing what a productivity step like this could mean for business by contrast their wives nearly all of them well to do or outright wealthy jumped right in folded their chanel tweed jackets kicked off their high heels and started typing and formatting exclaiming to each other what an amazing thing this was it looked incongruous even funny as the rich ladies quickly figured the system out but it made sense almost all of them had been secretaries that s how they met their husbands on the job for the 1977 wives many of the furtive office romances that led to matrimony took place in the mad men era 1960 70 back in that mixed time that fell between playboy and the phenomenon we d come to call simply the women s movement in 1974 new york magazine did an issue about the world a quarter century back the lead article was titled 1949 feminism s nadir only a few years later now forty years ago where does the time go i encountered that future office even the very same networked computer system now christened the xerox star a friend of mine a fledgling lawyer got me a temp job in a large busy law firm when another job offer fell through and i needed rent money fast i was there for a couple of months first as a file clerk then as organizer of their rapidly growing stock of magnetic media the law firm was a well oiled machine that ran lean and stacked up the billable hours think litigation not perry mason except for the three partners the other two dozen or so lawyers spent their long workdays reading documents dictating into a microphone or more rarely talking on the telephone the product of all this endless day in and day out talking and dictating and interviewing and deposing was handed off to a large secretarial pool pounding away at ibm selectrics only the three partners had their own assigned staff everyone else competed for resources and if the firm were an army the officers were all men and the enlisted ranks were about 90 women that was pretty typical in those days not one of the lawyers so much as had a typewriter in his office there were no computer keyboards on their desktops either not quite yet by contrast by 1981 there had already been generations of college women who d helped their boyfriends by typing their papers wives typed their husbands ways through law or medical school that was perfectly normal in those days unless they d been clerks in the armed forces few men even knew how to type many men prided themselves on it the costly xerox star system was so far only used for editing and formatting the most valuable of their legal documents only the top echelon of secretaries the firm s uncompromising bene gesserit was permitted to work with it and the elite corps of young women at its three terminals were accompanied by one full time male systems technician who i suspected even 40 years ago of merely pretending he was needed five days a week until well after five the two dozen men with fancy sheepskins on their walls were separately trapped in their surprisingly small and un fancy offices although making a lot of money by contrast the five dozen or so women were all massed in big noisy open form offices a vast busy and very social unit that amounted to a female company within a company they spent most of their work lives typing correcting and editing the work product they got on tape from the lawyers the rivers of talk led to rivers of printed text which led to rivers of money which led to all of our paychecks the older ladies frequently showed patience while tacitly helping teach newly hired but green young male lawyers how to deal with the firm s assembly line pace the women weren t lawyers and in that era had rarely expected to be they expected deserved and got respect for the jobs they did choose so it was with muted oddly mixed feelings that they greeted a young woman fresh from a florida law school newly admitted to the california bar this wasn t a rarity by 1981 but it was still new to most of the lawyers and secretaries if this were a lifetime made for tv movie the women would have stood up as one proud and sassy with a big smiling round of applause for the new attorney sure a couple of unattractive clueless men in the office might have tried to get handsy with her but she d have effortlessly put them in their place gestures of sisterly solidarity would have covered her path like rose petals in real life though it didn t work out as simply as that so far as i could tell admittedly a real limitation but there was little to no privacy there the men didn t try to hit on her she got an office and staff support equal to her male coworkers a no nonsense sort she got right down to business a brisk successful transition by all appearances but the stereotype breaker was the women didn t like her and didn t like working with her partly it was her chilly personality she didn t go out of her way to relate and she clearly didn t see herself as being much like the other women in effect she saw herself as needing to prove herself as if she were an officer among enlisted ranks they saw her as a stuck up snob who thought she was better than the rest of them neither was entirely wrong despite what the era s slogans said sisterhood isn t always powerful there was another entirely human and understandable element in the secretaries reactions that did track with female dissatisfaction with the workplace a mixture of only semi admitted envy and an undercurrent of self blame here she was making the big bucks and giving orders what did i do wrong my temp job lasted four months the managing partner offered me a full time gig which was more than decent of him but the real job that i d been holding out for came through about a year later out of nowhere a lawyer sent me an invitation to one of their elite social mixers at the beverly hills country club which i was happy to attend as the evening drew to a close and i started drifting towards the exit i fell into the conversational circle of an elegantly dressed woman in her late forties i d later learn she was the wife of one of the partners i was introduced rather generously as someone who d once worked at her husband s law firm when i told her i wasn t a lawyer she perked up oh thank god she said laughing she asked what sort of things i d seen in my time there and i told her i wasn t surprised that she was conservative in beverly hills it was not nearly as rare then as it would be now the boards of directors of l a s other country clubs went after studio chiefs as marquee names bhcc went after buzz aldrin one of the other guests lit her cigarette while the valet ran to fetch her car she turned her attention back towards me i know you ve heard lots of bad things about the fifties but for me it was a wonderful time in my life i liked being an office girl she looked amused at my no doubt doubting expression oh i knew i was luckier than most there were some drawbacks once in a while but i met a fine man and married him women today don t get a full picture of back then that old quote came to mind the past is a foreign country they do things differently there its lessons are rarely simple or one sided she was talking about her life twenty five years earlier it s been forty years since this conversation took place she sighed stubbed out the cigarette and donned her fur coat blackgama the best of its time the valet re appeared with the car she smiled and nodded goodbye the big black cadillac swallowed her up and she vanished down wilshire boulevard published in

juno alaska the alaska supreme court has ruled that steps to recall governor mike dunleavy can proceed specifically the high court said that arguments that he neglected his duties as governor and lacked fitness and competence to serve in office satisfied legal requirements to be presented to voters the supreme court hearing was scheduled after the alaska division of elections rejected the application for the recall which accused the governor of using his budget veto to pressure judges who ruled in favor of abortion rights and using government funds for partisan political purposes in their ruling the alaska supreme court said that the petition indicated the recall committee s motivations were legally sufficient and are particular enough to give the targeted official fair notice of the claim the court added that it was not the high court s job to judge the seriousness of an alleged ground but that it had the responsibility to allow the people to determine if the allegations are serious enough to warrant a recall election each voter in the voting booth must decide whether the allegations are serious enough to warrant removal from office the ruling stated dunleavy had been a teacher and school administrator prior to being elected in 2018 he has 17 months left on his term he issued a statement on friday condemning the court s decision the alaska supreme court today issued an opinion that creates a standard less recall process subjecting elected officials at every level and across the political spectrum to baseless expensive and distracting recall elections by their political opponents he said the court has made it clear that even plainly false allegations of wrongdoing can trigger this process undermining our election process and prevents our elected officials from focusing on many serious issues facing alaskans

skeptical of the four year college degree it s still your best bet to make money backlash against college as a common stop on the road to adulthood has mounted over the past decade critics say four year degree programs saddle most students with five digit debt without a clear path from classroom to career nearly half 46 of all families surveyed in november and december 2020 by gallup for the carnegie corporation of new york said they would prefer their children attend alternatives to four year institutions even when there were no financial barriers but when you compare the value of a four year degree with other credentials a high school diploma certificate programs and associate degrees it still puts workers at an advantage in the labor market and leads to higher lifetime earnings on average bachelor s degrees are typically a good investment if a college degree is an investment it s a good one according to the new york federal reserve the annual return on a typical four year degree is around 14 it calculates well above the threshold of good returns for stocks around 7 and bonds 3 in dollar terms graduates with a bachelor s degree will earn on average about 78 000 annually compared with a high school diploma earner who receives around 45 000 annually according to 2019 data from the new york federal reserve however on average doesn t mean that the return on your education or college earnings premium will always be a gain where you attend school how much debt you take on what you study and where you live after school all help determine your return many of those factors are influenced by your race ethnicity and gender your ability to repay debt affects your degree s value student loan debt is difficult to avoid and even more challenging to repay college costs rose 117 from 1985 86 to 2018 19 according to federal data wages meanwhile didn t keep pace growing only 19 during the same period according to the federal reserve bank of st louis however loans are still the primary vehicle for families without wealth to obtain college degrees in order to make your degree worth it you have to earn enough to justify it that means carrying debt that won t put you underwater a manageable student loan payment is around 10 of your discretionary after tax income to get the best return and be able to repay debt graduation is crucial many borrowers who default will have debt but no degree that s the worst case scenario you re incurring some of those costs but with very very little benefit says jonathan rothwell principal economist at gallup demand for your major matters what you study in school will affect the type of job you can get your earnings and your ability to repay debt average earnings at mid career are highest among those who hold a bachelor s degree in fields like science technology engineering and math or stem 76 000 business 67 000 and health 65 000 according to a 2015 data report from georgetown university s center for education and the workforce the same report found the lowest median mid career earnings among those whose bachelor s degrees were in fields like arts humanities and liberal arts 51 000 as well as teaching and serving roles such as social work 46 000 to estimate earnings graduation rates typical student debt loads and other factors at individual schools use the education department s college scorecard tool you can search and compare earnings as well as debt by fields of study where you live after graduation also matters where you live after attaining your degree also affects its value according to the results of a may 2020 study for the thomas b fordham institute a conservative nonprofit think tank in general college degrees are a good investment but the return in terms of cosmopolitan areas is phenomenal says john winters associate professor of economics at iowa state university who conducted the study in cities bachelor s degree holders earn 95 229 on average an 86 2 premium compared to a worker with a high school diploma and a 55 7 premium compared to an associate degree holder winters says that s primarily because cities have a higher concentration of jobs in fields that often demand workers have four year degrees such as tech finance and marketing workers in these fields earn higher wages which leads to a greater return on investment for degrees however winters findings also mean it s less critical to have a four year degree if you want to live in a smaller metro or rural area bachelor s degree holders in nonurban areas have mean earnings of 67 893 which puts their wages at a 46 4 premium compared to high school diploma holders and a 29 6 premium compared to associate degree holders degree attainment doesn t guarantee equity in some ways a college degree can exacerbate income and racial inequalities such as student debt and ability to repay that debt says marshall anthony jr a senior policy analyst at center for american progress a public policy research organization a college degree doesn t usually work the same for everybody anthony says black borrowers tend to take on greater amounts of debt about 25 000 more on average than white borrowers according to federal data in 2016 among those with a bachelor s or higher degree asian full time year round workers ages 25 34 had higher median annual earnings 69 100 than their white peers 54 700 and median earnings for both racial ethnic groups were higher than those of their black 49 400 and hispanic 49 300 peers according to the most recent available data by the national center for education statistics higher debt and lower wages also mean black borrowers will accrue more interest over time four years after graduating from college black graduates have 52 726 in student loan debt compared to white graduates at

bro the unfolding worldwide pegasus scandal is nothing new for panama pegasus is an israeli electronic weapons system that allows its users to break into people s cell phones and computers to turn phones into room bugs to rummage through and steal information from public or private databases to vandalize websites it s on the international news again as the specific activities of at least 11 of its users generally thuggish regimes have come to light in the form of more than 50 000 phone numbers of victims against which it was deployed public officials high and low ragtag dissidents and serious opposition leaders the families of people killed by government death squads and especially journalists populate that list it s the same sorts of people against whom ricardo martinelli used the pegasus system when he was president as he never turned the equipment programs and data over to his elected successor he may be using pegasus to this very day as to panama israel may have close government to government relations and there are also long standing people to people ties but it s an enemy of panamanians freedoms it was back in noriega times when they had a mossad guy attached to the dictatorship s uesat death squad when shin bet guys trained spï presidential guards and used photos of arab characters and those were published it drew a target on panama and our supposed to be neutral canal as enemies of the arab world and it wasn t just 150 people on martinelli s enemies list whose communications were intercepted it was thousands of people at the very least everybody to talked with any of the specified targets on the phone or exchanged email or whatsapp messages with them despite historic ties and despite israel s attraction to panama as another small country without many raw materials that lives by its wits the deployment of the pegasus weapons system against panamanians ought to affect panama s economic political and diplomatic relations with israel no foreign country should be able to pull that stuff on panama without accountability martinelli will go on trial before our defective court system about the use of pegasus some people have actually been jailed over it perhaps however in the great hue and cry that s just beginning there will be an international treaty against the trafficking and use of such surveillance systems if the world can agree on that it would be better than the expected circular finger pointing muster out of the drug wars the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc report that more than 93 000 people died from drug overdoses in 2020 in the united states that s the most ever that s 52 years after richard nixon declared the war on drugs with the united states having drafted more than two generations of latin american police and military forces into tricky dicky s jihad let s not hear any stuff about how the drugs are different and those in the business are different and run different sorts of organizations it has been an expensive loss all across the americas and was a war undertaken in bad faith all along in panama and in the united states and in many other places it has corrupted public officials from the cops on the beat to the magistrates on the bench to the top circles of governmental power with all sorts of people in between it s time to end this ignominious defeat which is not to say that substance addiction and abuse do not present problems they are major health problems that sap society of a lot of its productivity they break up families they shorten lives but like with two other addictive substances that are part of the us and panamanian cultures and economy alcohol and tobacco there are betters ways to address the problems than by using the criminal law up to and including military force to impose prohibition or really to tell the truth about it to try in vain to impose prohibition it would be proper international etiquette to prevent panama s use as a platform for smuggling substances legal here to places where they are illegal so although we can t relate to their values a certain amount of cooperation to stop the smuggling of rum to saudi arabia pork to iran or cocaine to the european union might be in order but it is and has been way out of order to concentrate or police forces and legal system on the us anti drug crusade washington may pay for a lot of the training and toys but despite the loss of those things panama can do a better job of protecting the panamanian people by allocating law enforcement resources in much different ways

john payne knows what is to be done the next time he dies a little more than 20 years ago he purchased the land where he was born in downtown shidler oklahoma there is no longer a small doctor s office there that was torn down long ago but payne has put a large wire basket corner post filled with rocks to mark the spot it is topped off by a large metal cross with the metallic sentiment of didn t get a lot done but sure had a lotta fun payne figures the second time around he will do a better job of burning himself up by being cremated and the ashes can reside among the rocks of the corner post there is also an old metal rim of a wagon wheel that will symbolize the complete journey made i started here and ended up here after being around the world he would have never made it around the world if he hadn t died the first time payne and his four brothers were raised in a ranching family outside of shidler in the grass and brush of the osage oil patch it was here that the early 20th century surprised so many tribal members with sudden wealth the young john payne couldn t see himself being anything be a cowboy but only two months after his 20th birthday he was helping his dad tear down an old house when he climbed a pole 25 feet in the air to cut the electric lines feeding the run down structure he thought the power was off it wasn t and 7200 volts shot through his body for at least 10 seconds later he would recall how he felt his blood boiling inside he fell the full 25 feet to the ground and his friend gary hughes began pounding his chest and giving him mouth to mouth it was later estimated that he had been dead for about five minutes the closest er was ponca city and by the time he was hauled there he had regained at least part of his sense of humor and dry view of life which was getting drier a nurse was trying to get some basic information as they were getting him ready for surgery and ask if he was allergic to anything electricity makes me break out a bit was the quick answer the fingers of the right hand had been burnt through as had most of the arm and the thighbone of the left leg was exposed the doctor determined that the right arm had to come off at the shoulder and also the left leg payne let them have the arm but the leg would have to stay taking it would mean he couldn t ride a horse and then there would be no point in saving him anyway after five weeks the doctors announced there was no apparent brain damage both payne and all who knew him for 20 years wondered how they could tell more times than not tragedies open doors we would have never guessed they almost always show our true nature individually and nationally for the next 15 years or so john payne proved over and over again that a one armed cowboy can be a hell of a hand he even managed to keep rodeoing some pinning that empty right sleeve to his shirt to keep it from flapping in his face while on a bareback or saddle bronc unlike most he never had to worry about being dqed for slapping the horse with a free hand he ranched on his own owned a saloon for a while and with the help of some well trained cow ponies and a few blackmouth cur dogs were known far and wide for his ability to gather wild cattle he took calls from all over the nation to pen cattle no one else could get near in fact it was a bunch of wild bulls captured in the swamps of florida that started him on his last at least for now career path and worldwide acclaim he had them pastured but had to bring them in every evening to water he found that with some patience and help of a good horse the cracks of his bullwhip and those cur dogs he could put the bulls up on the covered porch and have them stay as long as he wanted his wife and grandmother it was her house objected strongly and so he dragged an old flatbed dump truck that wouldn t run any moreover from his dad s and started doing the same thing on it this was toward the end of the 1980s and the combination of a fading cattle market interest rates and a couple of questionable decisions had payne over 100 000 in debt and living with his grandmother so when the great walter alsbaugh of the 101 wild west rodeo company offered to buy those florida bulls to see if they would buck john jumped at it if mr walt were still alive you would know him in a minute he would be the one behind the bucking chutes giving the order in a slow drawl and a smile big enough to see that the front tooth on the right side was missing but he was close with a dollar when payne showed up at ponca city to watch the bulls perform he commented to alsbaugh about the poor entertainment they had between events mr walt told him if he thought he could do any better he was welcome to try and john told him he would be ready by the next year s rodeo he had thought he could maneuver stock on anything if he had a ramp for them he bought an old stock trailer from his brother for 800 it only took him three years to pay it off and with a cutting torch welder and one good arm began making alterations the old trailer soon had a ramp that could be accessed from the flatbed truck pulling and what could best be described as a runway on top at the next ponca city rodeo payne put four corrientte roping steers on top of the trailer by way of the bed of a truck and a built on ramp that performance was for free as were the next few done for alsbaugh payne s first paid performance occurred when the great hall of fame rodeo announcer clem mcspaden hired him to do his thing at a pasture roping he was contracting outside of brushyhead oklahoma a pasture roping is just a team roping contest in an 80 acre arena with few rules other than catch the cattle on both ends clem always paid me upfront he never paid me much but he always paid me that was the beginning of probably the most successful specialty act rodeo will ever have the next year he worked over 90 rodeos over a 22 year period john payne the one armed bandit was named the prca specialty act of the year a record 15 times the animals used in the act have ranged from cattle to zebras to buffalo all paraded around through their steps by payne riding a well trained horse or mule mostly a full speed with the reins down john payne is a natural ham and character but he was above all a first rate sure enough horsebacker and a patient and insightful trainer of animals i look at animals and people pretty much the same there are some who just naturally want to be the stars you might have to go through a lot of em to find what you want but they are there if you doubt either his skill or nerve try getting on a horse or mule and then asking it to jump three feet up on a truck bed climb a ramp onto the top of a trailer then with no reins put the animal into a full reiner s spin on that metal walkway which is no more than 6 feet wide then take out a pistol in your one good hand and begin firing it into the air during the spin be sure and keep it up while you the horse and the trailer are pulled from the arena at about 10 mph john likes to use a horse with some white on them because they show up good in the arena especially under the lights he is really fond of tri colored paints that he buys from the rosebud sioux mules are a little more sure footed on those ramps and trailer tops but they also come with a different disposition if a mule don t like ya they ll wait for a chance to buck you off and then kick at ya on the way down one broke my good arm like that he is not sure how many horses he has on the place i would count em but if judy wife ever heard a hard count on em i might have to sell some the one armed bandit has traveled the act as far as asia and the middle east done request performances for kings in empty stadiums and waved to thousands with one pass of the hat in packed coliseums but it is still pretty hard to tell his present self from the cocky but folky show off who still had two arms before he climbed that power pole neither tragedy or success affects him much if you meet john payne today on the streets of shidler he will have a big brimmed hat hair brushing his shoulders which in your mind could stand some washing a beard of sorts that some who call a little ragged and probably be wearing a pair of wrap around dark sunglasses regardless of the weather there are those who say his voice is a little high pitched with a drawl and twang to it i don t hear it myself sounds kinda regular to me he doesn t sound funny you know like those people from the ivy league do next spring the one armed bandit will turn 70 years young he thinks he might not show quite so much and spend some more time with judy but the act itself is safe his son lynn and daughter amanda have been a part of it for some time now and have according to him become his right arm and who knows there might even be yet another career for a man who takes life as a joy ride at full cock the lord just keeps giving me fun chances but regardless of the turns in the remaining path john payne knows where he will end up there will be ashes placed among those rocks in the wire basket and then there will be a party and it will be a celebration anyone with a tear in their eye will be sent home it won t be about dying it will be about living one of the truths of history is that men and nations will be tested often their greatest trials will come from their own mistakes there are few things that seem more fatal than cutting into 7200 volts it might just be that both men and nations are intended to take those seemingly darkest days and make them shine with energy and purpose and then look with expectation for the next turn of fate that will grow us even more published in

new york resurgent pandemic worries knocked stocks lower from wall street to tokyo on monday fueled by fears that a faster spreading variant of the virus may upend the economy s strong recovery the s p 500 fell 68 67 or 1 6 to 4 258 49 after setting a record just a week earlier in another sign of worry the yield on the 10 year treasury touched its lowest level in five months as investors scrambled for safer places to put their money the dow jones industrial average slumped 725 81 or 2 1 to 33 962 04 while the nasdaq composite lost 152 25 or 1 1 to 14 274 98 airlines and other companies that

of benchmark u s crude meanwhile fell more than 7 after opec and allied nations agreed on sunday to eventually allow for higher oil production this year increased worries about the virus may seem strange to people in parts of the world where masks are coming off or already have thanks to covid 19 vaccinations but the world health organization says cases and deaths are climbing globally after a period of decline spurred by the highly contagious delta variant and given how tightly connected the global economy is a hit anywhere can quickly affect the other side of the world even in the u s where the vaccination rate is higher than in many other countries people in los angeles county must once again wear masks indoors regardless of whether they re vaccinated following spikes in cases hospitalizations and deaths across the country the daily number of covid cases has soared by nearly 20 000 over the last two weeks to about 32 000 the vaccine campaign has hit a wall with the average number of daily inoculations sinking to the lowest levels since january and cases are on the rise in all 50 states that s why markets are concerned even though reports show the economy is still recovering at a fantastically high rate and the general expectation is for it to deliver continued growth any worsening of virus trends threatens the high prices that stocks have achieved on expectations the economy will fulfill those lofty forecasts financial markets have been showing signs of increased concerns for a while but the u s stock market had remained largely resilient the s p 500 has had just two down weeks in the last eight and the last time it had even a 5 pullback from a record high was in october several analysts pointed to that backdrop of high prices and very calm movements for weeks while dissecting monday s drop it s a bit of an overreaction but when you have a market that s at record highs that s had the kind of run we ve had with virtually no pullback it

says the stock market may be in the early stages for a drop of as much as 10 following its big run higher the s p 500 nearly doubled after hitting its bottom in march 2020 the valuations they just got too frothy he said there was just so much optimism out there the bond market has been louder and more persistent in its warnings the yield on the 10 year treasury tends to move with expectations for

after a dizzying rally this year stock markets were hit hard on monday as a spike in coronavirus infections around the world reinforced the reality of living with a pandemic that refuses to go away the dow jones industrial average tumbled 725 points or 2 1 and had its worst day since october while the s p 500 fell 1 6 the losses mark a rare day of declines for a market that was at record highs as early as last week here are three key things to know about the market s fall what led to the sharp falls in a word covid 19 though the rollout of vaccines has allowed some semblance of normalcy to return to the u s countries such as indonesia continue to see surging infections especially from those tied to the delta variant of the coronavirus the continued rise in cases is starting to spook investors as the world continues to deal with the economic and health fallouts from the coronavirus pandemic among the leading decliners on monday were travel and leisure stocks such as united airlines which fell 5 5 and cruise operator carnival which slumped 5 7 the pandemic worries come at a time when investors are already concerned about inflation data last week showed consumer prices surging 5 4 in june from a year earlier the biggest hike in nearly 13 years although the federal reserve has insisted that inflation is transitory not all investors all convinced higher than expected inflation could force the fed to apply the brakes to the economy earlier including by raising interest rates earlier than in 2023 when it s currently expected to do so how worrisome are the falls it s hard to say with one day of falls alone these types of declines are not uncommon but they feel more jarring because markets so far have been on a dizzying run as of friday the dow was up 13 3 for the year while the s p 500 was up 15 2 for the year with both hitting a series of ever climbing record highs in fact experts have been warning for a while that markets were due for a pullback and chances are that markets could remain volatile for a while savita subramanian the head of u s equity strategy and quantitative strategy at bofa securities says it s important to remember that some market volatility is normal and she called monday s falls not something to write home about it s actually kind of a normal market environment she says for the most part analysts still expect gains in markets to continue but the pace might slow down if inflation and covid 19 worries continue to take hold valuations are high and investors will likely want to see more confidence that recent gains are justified so where do markets head to from here a lot will depend on the trajectory of the economy and the pandemic the economy is coming off a blockbuster first half of the year that s likely to be reflected in the economic growth data for the april june quarter due out next week which is likely to show a blistering pace of expansion that pace of gains is likely to be unsustainable especially as most of the impact from government stimulus measures fades bond investors in fact have been betting for weeks now that they expect a slower economy in the second half and those bets are starting now to be reflected in stocks as well a slower but still solid economy is not a bad thing for markets but a lot can still go wrong coronavirus infections could continue to spike key sectors of the economy also continue to be hobbled by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and inflation could prove harder to reverse i think common sense will tell you that there are going to be issues coming along says michael purves ceo of investment firm tallbacken capital and a lot of that will probably weigh on some part of the recovery story copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

the recent opec meeting ended with an agreement that would gradually increase the cartel s monthly production until in late 2022 all of the 9 7 mm bopd that had originally been withheld from the market was restored there was already an agreement in place through december of 2021 but the kingdom of saudi arabia s ksa desire to extend it to the end of next year was a bone of contention with the united arab emirates uae this agreement was not reached easily and required some negotiation and compromise to achieve it has been widely reported that the crux of the disagreement between ksa and the uae was the latter s desire for a higher output ceiling from which its share of curtailment would be calculated this while certainly true is not the only factor in the new assertiveness demonstrated by the uae in opec affairs there is a dichotomy of perspective about the peak for oil that has developed between the ksa and the uae the saudis five year plan to diversify their revenues away from oil has not been as successful as initially hoped and they now view oil production as underpinning their economy for decades to come they also view the transition to renewables as having a multi decade arc that will keep demand for oil and derivatives relatively high over this period the new higher price regime in or near the 70 s is a breath of fresh air for their economy the uae have had more success in attracting foreign investment and on a parallel track have energized their oil sector with a 122 bn investment plan to dramatically increase production in the near term their view on the energy transition is that it will have a much shorter arc that could lead to substantial reserves being stranded a very undesirable outcome for this tiny middle eastern nation and makes them want to up production regardless of the impact on prices this the underlying fear behind their insistence on a higher baseline for allocating their share of opec production this led to the impasse that resulted in the first meeting ending abruptly with no statement forthcoming as per usual this divergence in viewpoint has caused the uae to purposefully step out of the shadow of the saudi s in discusses revolving around output as we will learn there was considerably more involved between these two key opec members than just raising the output levels in this article we will take a deeper look at the regional tug of war that has developed for shaping the cartel s destiny a tug of war that has global implications on oil availability and price first we will take a quick look at these competing philosophies as regards peak oil the saudi vision 2030 plan the saudi vision 2030 plan was rolled out in 2016 with considerable fanfare when mohammed bin salman mbs was named crown prince becoming the defacto heir to the throne the 2030 plan included a series of mega projects including a futuristic city called neom that was intended to dramatically lessen the kingdom s reliance on oil exports for revenue by 2030 this year the five year point since its implementation the 2030 plan has under performed its billing with less than half the planned revenue forecast from non oil sources being achieved masked in the details is the fact that much of the actual increase has come from new taxes and not new outside investment as noted in the linked article some of this may be associated with some missteps by the crown prince along the way the kashoggi killing the privatization of aramco failing to draw much external interest a 200 bn solar farm that failed to draw enough support to get off the drawing board and an attempt to launch a nuclear power project have all contributed to a sense of a lack of direction in the investment community with many internal problems associated with a young population that lacks preparation for modern employment an economy that shrank 3 from the impact of the pandemic and weaker growth internally from high taxes and subsidy cuts ksa has struggled to balance its books with external cash inflow insufficient to meet its economic needs the kingdom has renewed its commitment to a heavier reliance on oil for longer into the future than it thought would be necessary just a few years ago an energy consultant located in dubai was quoted in the linked article as saying in the past five years saudi arabia has made little progress in alleviating its reliance on oil export revenues it is probably going to take over 30 years to move away from oil dependency the uae 5 year plan by contrast the uae s plan doesn t have an iconic name as does ksa s but the country has met with more success on a number fronts on a relative basis its privatization of certain aspects of adnoc properties selling stakes in adnoc subsidiaries drew 25 bn of foreign capital into the country without the trauma of actually going through an ipo process for the holding company something that was painful for the kingdom the uae is now producing power from a 400 mw plant in dubai and even in the nuclear power area the emirates have outstripped their larger neighbor with a nuclear generating plant that s come online just this year related everything you need to know about opec s new agreement the uae has even gone a step further and successfully introduced a new futures contract on their production known as the murban this is meant to facilitate their trading and optimize pricing and volumes within the production limits set by opec the emirates are also looking to move higher in the petroleum value chain with a 45 bn expansion of the ruwais industrial complex in this effort the country s refining capacity will be doubled and a huge petrochemical complex will be built euro major oil companies bp nyse bp totalenergies nyse tte and eni nyse e are partners in this enterprise and hold production sharing agreements psa s for upstream development in the country the major piece of this initiative was not launched until november of last year when it was announced that the country would begin a 122 bn expansion of adnoc s oil output with a goal of raising production to 5 mm bopd which brings us back to the current state of affairs and competing philosophies regarding how best to extract the maximum value from their petroleum reserves but first let s look at some of the regional power struggles that contribute to the tension between the two countries behind the scenes the middle east seems an eternal hotbed of conflict of one type or another many factors play into this and we will focus on the competition for ascendancy in the region between ksa and the uae the saudi iran proxy war in yemen has been in and out of the news in recent years but it drags on year after year a key supporter of ksa in the effort to subdue the houthi rebels has been the uae in 2019 it announced it would withdraw its troops from the conflict a blow to saudis attempt to call the war effort a regional coalition the easing of tensions between the uae and israel in a u s brokered peace deal have deepened the mistrust between these two states as well saudi remains deeply divided about israel because of the palestinian question and looks to regional neighbors for support for their cause then in another regional power shift ksa buried the hatchet with qatar leaving the uae out in the cold and forced go along the two countries for years had engaged a blockade of qatar until a u s brokered peace agreement led to a truce early this year in the last administration with the regional back and forth taking place on other fronts it was clear that the uae had to at least rattle the cage of opec to protect its interests what will the impact be on oil supplies from the announcement that came out of sunday s meeting it appears that the uae got most of what they were seeking in terms of increasing their production baseline other countries including saudi arabia russia kuwait and iraq also saw their baseline quotas raised so this was a shared victory with the production management agreement extended through december of 2022 saudi also got a key win for their concerns about too much oil driving prices down on the horizon also is the potential return of about 1 5 mm bopd from iran once sanctions are lifted the statement included language about the cartel reviewing this policy in the event this crude lands in the market prices for many grades of crude fell on the announcement of 400k barrels being returned to the market with august contract for wti dipping below 70 in monday s futures for the first time since early june as i noted in an earlier oilprice article when this outcome for opec was on the horizon the global market can easily absorb this crude assuming the recovery from covid 19 continues i think it will the eia projects that u s ye 2022 production will be 12 2 mm bopd this breaks down to 1 8 mm bopd from the gom and 400k bopd from alaska thus requiring shale production at 10 mm bopd a boost of 2 2 mm bopd from today s rate of 7 8 mm bopd and taking it far beyond the highest level ever produced in the shale patch advertisement i think expecting this variable to perform at the eia s assumed level is unrealistic this agency has some rather simplistic assumptions used in making these estimates that mainly are backward looking and assigning rig numbers with crude production this doesn t take into account the fact that duc drilled but uncompleted wells withdrawal have been largely responsible for controlling the rate of decline this year in the face of reduced activity from prior years in march of 2020 shale production peaked at 9 3 mm bopd on the strength of a peak 1 100 rigs in the prior 15 months and 420 active frac spreads data eia primaryvision as we know the service and supply industry has been turned on its head the last three years and is much smaller in terms of deployable rigs and pumps personnel have also been eliminated at a rate never before seen in an industry known for wide swings in activity in our view these reductions along with the stated intent by the industry to repair balance sheets and reward investors with stock buybacks and improved dividend payouts augurs against a return to 2019 in terms of activity the next variable is the rapid spread of the delta covid variant this in my view is more a matter of perception than a sea change in the general direction of the recovery while more transmissible than the original strain it seems to result in a milder infection and the vaccines are near 97 effective in preventing infection and of course the good news that seldom gets reported is the infection itself in the unvaccinated will eventually bring about the herd immunity among the population that will render covid to essentially the same status as the flu some you live with and doesn t cause a wide spread panic your takeaway the upshot of all of these factors the opec agreement production rates and north american shale activity levels is that despite fluctuations due to market driven changes in sentiment the price trend for oil will be higher these changes in sentiment will be transitory in my view creating opportunities to add to positions in key companies likely to benefit from these higher prices companies like halliburton nyse hal schlumberger nyse slb devon energy nyse dvn occidental nyse oxy conocophillips nyse cop pioneer exploration nyse pxd are poised to report a resoundingly improved qoq performance from q 1 that will drive their stock prices higher investors who believe that the economic recovery that began last year with the announcement of the effectiveness of the vaccines will continue should view the current 20 average sell off in the last couple of weeks as a buying opportunity by david messler for

simon mawhinney portfolio manager at oil search investor allan gray said while he was sympathetic to oil search s rebuff of the proposal on value grounds it would be reasonable to engage with santos there could be a transaction to be had there he said pointing also to serious synergies that could be achieved also with another bidder such as exxonmobil or total the operators of oil search s liquefied natural gas ventures in png the mooted combination of santos and oil search has been a favourite among market pundits for several months amid a global rise in m a in the sector due to capital constraints esg concerns among investors and low equity valuations it would create an asian oil and gas player with significant lng interests in australia and png and with a potentially promising but uncertain oil project in alaska the merged company would be bigger than rival woodside petroleum in both market capitalisation and reserves we believe that the merger proposal presents an extremely attractive proposition that delivers compelling value and is in the best interests of our respective shareholders santos chairman keith spence wrote in a june 25 letter to mr lee outlining the proposed deal advertisement he said a merger would create a regional champion of size and scale that is well positioned to compete with larger global peers and would have a combined portfolio of high quality long life low cost assets that provides balance optionality and a reduced risk this is particularly important in the context of the recent international energy agency recommendations that there should be no new oil and gas fields approved for development beyond 2021 mr spence wrote santos disclosed on tuesday it had offered an all scrip deal to merge with oil search last month but the proposal was rejected by oil search s board and its advisers oil search had earlier reported it had received an approach last month correcting a statement by mr lee to investors on monday the proposal offered oil search shareholders 0 589 santos shares for each of their shares implying a price of 4 25 per oil search share and valuing the target at about 8 8 billion but oil search said a bigger premium was warranted given control would be firmly with santos which would hold 70 per cent more equity in the combined company advertisement shares in oil search jumped 6 3 per cent to 3 90 while shares in santos one of oil search s partners in the png lng venture dropped 5 per cent giving it a market value of about 14 billion under santos s proposal oil search shareholders would own 37 per cent of the combined group and santos shareholders 63 per cent santos said it was still seeking to engage on the proposed deal but oil search while acknowledging the strategic logic of a merger said it would only negotiate on a higher priced proposal oil search has communicated to santos that it is open to receiving a revised proposal which more appropriately reflects the value which oil search would bring to any combined entity oil search said at this stage no such proposal has been forthcoming santos s disclosure of its approach came after oil search s earlier clarification to a statement by mr lee in an investor briefing on monday on the surprise resignation of dr wulff because of ill health and after complaints about his behaviour advertisement investors shocked asked about takeover approaches mr lee had then said we re obviously working very hard to create value for shareholders and we are well prepared for that and we are just as well prepared if someone were to approach us but that hasn t happened investors were unsettled and angry at the contradiction in the chairman s comments that has now been brought to light which has added to a loss of confidence in the board and management over strategy and capital allocation that is either a lie or at best deliberately misleading and it is completely unacceptable for board members to lie to shareholders mr mawhinney said the big issue with oil search and the reason investors have lost trust and confidence in the board is that messages are always cloaked in ambiguity there is no company i can think of that needs to put a clarification on comments previously mentioned if those comments themselves were not misleading you don t clarify things when they are clear advertisement oil search s weak share price combined with the exit last month of its anchor shareholder abu dhabi government owned mubadala and now the leadership upset had fuelled market speculation that the company could become a takeover target the stock remains at less than half its value from before the plunge in crude oil prices in march 2020 despite the recovery in brent oil prices to more than us70 a barrel the company owns a stake in exxon s png lng venture as well as in the proposed papua lng project and in an undeveloped oil project in alaska

after a dizzying rally this year stock markets were hit hard on monday as a spike in coronavirus infections around the world reinforced the reality of living with a pandemic that refuses to go away the dow jones industrial average tumbled 725 points or 2 1 and had its worst day since october while the s p 500 fell 1 6 the losses mark a rare day of declines for a market that was at record highs as early as last week here are three key things to know about the market s fall what led to the sharp falls in a word covid 19 though the rollout of vaccines has allowed some semblance of normalcy to return to the u s countries such as indonesia continue to see surging infections especially from those tied to the delta variant of the coronavirus the continued rise in cases is starting to spook investors as the world continues to deal with the economic and health fallouts from the coronavirus pandemic among the leading decliners on monday were travel and leisure stocks such as united airlines which fell 5 5 and cruise operator carnival which slumped 5 7 the pandemic worries come at a time when investors are already concerned about inflation data last week showed consumer prices surging 5 4 in june from a year earlier the biggest hike in nearly 13 years although the federal reserve has insisted that inflation is transitory not all investors all convinced higher than expected inflation could force the fed to apply the brakes to the economy earlier including by raising interest rates earlier than in 2023 when it s currently expected to do so how worrisome are the falls it s hard to say with one day of falls alone these types of declines are not uncommon but they feel more jarring because markets so far have been on a dizzying run as of friday the dow was up 13 3 for the year while the s p 500 was up 15 2 for the year with both hitting a series of ever climbing record highs in fact experts have been warning for a while that markets were due for a pullback and chances are that markets could remain volatile for a while savita subramanian the head of u s equity strategy and quantitative strategy at bofa securities says it s important to remember that some market volatility is normal and she called monday s falls not something to write home about it s actually kind of a normal market environment she says for the most part analysts still expect gains in markets to continue but the pace might slow down if inflation and covid 19 worries continue to take hold valuations are high and investors will likely want to see more confidence that recent gains are justified so where do markets head to from here a lot will depend on the trajectory of the economy and the pandemic the economy is coming off a blockbuster first half of the year that s likely to be reflected in the economic growth data for the april june quarter due out next week which is likely to show a blistering pace of expansion that pace of gains is likely to be unsustainable especially as most of the impact from government stimulus measures fades bond investors in fact have been betting for weeks now that they expect a slower economy in the second half and those bets are starting now to be reflected in stocks as well a slower but still solid economy is not a bad thing for markets but a lot can still go wrong coronavirus infections could continue to spike key sectors of the economy also continue to be hobbled by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and inflation could prove harder to reverse i think common sense will tell you that there are going to be issues coming along says michael purves ceo of investment firm tallbacken capital and a lot of that will probably weigh on some part of the recovery story copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

washington says beijing contracts hackers to conduct attacks like the one on microsoft in march a man looks at his smartphone as he walks by the microsoft office in beijing china aug 7 2020 the u s has formed a coalition with its allies and other partners to identify and condemn malicious cyber activities orchestrated by china s ministry of state security mss the white house said monday warning it is weighing additional measures to hold beijing accountable for its actions the mss china s secret police knowingly uses criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations around the globe including for their own personal profit through cyber enabled extortion crypto jacking and theft the biden administration said in a statement state affiliated cyber operators are also known to have conducted ransomware operations against private companies that have included ransom demands of millions of dollars it said the prc s people s republic of china unwillingness to address criminal activity by contract hackers harms governments businesses and critical infrastructure operators through billions of dollars in lost intellectual property proprietary information ransom payments and mitigation efforts the white house said it called beijing s behavior in cyberspace inconsistent with its stated objective of being seen as a responsible leader in the world the administration announced that the u s is joining with the eu the u k australia canada new zealand japan and nato to call out those activities promote network defense and cybersecurity and act to disrupt threats to our economies and national security a senior administration official said the collaboration will allow us to enhance and increase information sharing including cyber threat intel and network defense information with public and private stakeholders and expand diplomatic engagement to strengthen our collective cyber resilience and security cooperation monday s announcement formally attributed the malicious cyber campaign utilizing the zero day vulnerabilities in the microsoft exchange server disclosed in march to malicious cyber actors affiliated with the mss with high confidence the attack impacted some 140 000 servers worldwide when asked for additional details on the microsoft hack the senior administration official called it surprising adding that it really gave us new insights on the mss s work and on the kind of aggressive behavior that we re seeing coming out of china monday s statement from the white house came as the u s national security agency cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency cisa and federal bureau of investigation fbi issued a joint cybersecurity advisory csa providing detailed information on the tactics techniques and procedures ttps used by chinese state sponsored cyber actors when targeting u s and allied networks the advisory also provided recommendations to entities in the public and private sectors to mitigate the threat the u s department of justice also announced criminal charges monday against four mss hackers addressing what it said were activities concerning a multiyear campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in key sectors including maritime aviation defense education and healthcare in a least a dozen countries according to the indictment the defendants and officials in the hainan state security department tried to hide the chinese government s role in the information theft by using a front company u s secretary of state antony blinken told reporters that china s mss had fostered an ecosystem of criminal contract hackers who carry out both state sponsored activities and cybercrime for their own financial gain and pointed to the department of justice indictments as examples of how the u s will respond allies condemn beijing in a separate statement on monday the eu said it is still reeling from the attack on the microsoft exchange server and urged china to fight cybercrime occurring within its borders the eu and its member states strongly denounce these malicious cyber activities which are undertaken in contradiction with the norms of responsible state behaviour as endorsed by all u n member states said the statement from josep borrell the european high commissioner of the union for foreign affairs and security policy we continue to urge the chinese authorities to adhere to these norms and not allow its territory to be used for malicious cyber activities and take all appropriate measures and reasonably available and feasible steps to detect investigate and address the situation nato s north atlantic council also issued a statement condemning malicious cyber activities including the microsoft compromise which it said undermine security confidence and stability in cyberspace we call on all states including china to uphold their international commitments and obligations and to act responsibly in the international system including in cyberspace said the statement which marked the first time that the 30 nation bloc has condemned beijing s cyber activities british foreign secretary dominic raab warned in a statement on monday that if china s government does not take action to end what he called systematic cyberattacks it would be held accountable while monday s statements were some of the most damning to date against china for allowing cybercrime to occur on its watch the u s and its allies stopped short of sanctions against beijing the white house said it was not ruling out further actions beijing has yet to issue a response to the allegations made monday but an editorial in the official english language global times newspaper labeled them a huge lie and suggested that the u s is using the issue of cyberattacks to enlist its allies in smearing china cyberattacks are difficult to trace washington is exploiting them to frame china said the unsigned editorial which repeated china s stock response to complaints about its practices cyberattacks have happened in almost all countries and china has suffered more damage than the us the u s the global top technology center has blatantly set up cyber troops but loudly accuses other countries of launching cyberattacks how ridiculous the editorial warned that if the u s takes aggressive measures china will retaliate adding that washington s allies will also incur beijing s wrath sending a message timothy heath a senior researcher at the washington based rand corporation told rfa monday s statements were meant to send a message to china that the u s and its allies are watching but he suggested that they would do little to deter china for now because it is difficult to link the mss to criminal cyber activities based inside the country and the cost of cyberattacks is quite low dustin carmack a technology policy researcher at washington based think tank heritage foundation recently noted that u s cybersecurity posture is undergoing fundamental changes he said washington should employ a blend of offensive and diplomatic frameworks to respond to authoritarian countries and the cybercrimes they support we should tell the governments of russia china iran and north korea that we will not tolerate state sponsored cyberattacks and that deliberate ignorance of cyber operations against the united states will have major consequences carmack wrote

editor s note clarifies per hyzon request that the fuel cell truck maker will not co brand freightliner cascadias but will do test deployments in q4 hyzon motors inc began public trading monday on a terrible note as its shares fell more than 20 on a day when markets fell the most since may the maker of hydrogen powered fuel cell trucks which has more than 37 million in confirmed orders for delivery globally this year was nonetheless upbeat about its prospects total booked orders amount to 86 million we re having some pretty good success we re collecting orders for vehicles in australia new zealand and europe we re starting deliveries in europe this month and we re just executing to plan hyzon ceo craig knight told freightwaves in an interview i know the u s audience doesn t see much of this progress but we re delivering vehicles signing up contracts and setting up our operations the u s trails asia and europe in fuel cell readiness but knight said the decision to base hyzon in honeoye falls new york the former site of general motors co s fuel cell engineering was a play for the future hyzon motors began trading monday on the nasdaq under the ticker symbol hyzn photo hyzon motors testing freightliner cascadias that future begins with hyzon using up to 10 hydrogen fuel cell equipped freightliner cascadias in paid customer tests in the fourth quarter knight said the demonstrations would follow kenworth t680s retrofitted with toyota motor corp fuel cells for drayage runs at the ports of los angeles and long beach california as the first over the road trucks fuel cell trucks in the u s hyundai motor corp is expected to bring its xcient fuel cell truck to the u s before the end of the year startup nikola corp nasdaq nkla plans to deliver fuel cell test trucks to anheuser busch inbev s a nyse bud late this year or in early 2022 business combination details hyzon a spinoff of singapore based horizon fuel cell technologies received 550 million in cash from its special purpose acquisition spac partner on friday when 95 of shares in decarbonization plus acquisition corp nasdaq dcrb voted in favor of the business combination dcrb became hyzon motors inc nasdaq hyzn on monday dcrb raised 150 million in an initial public offering and 400 million from investors in private investment in public equity hyzon s closing was delayed about five weeks knight said because of securities and exchange commission rule changes including accounting of stock warrants as liabilities instead of equity electrification spacs both electric vehicle and infrastructure companies have seen their share prices hammered in recent months after giddy enthusiasm by traders earlier forbes reported sunday that 14 of 15 of the spacs are trading at least 10 below their debut price maybe having a better time than we re having today if it hadn t been for the sec rule changes knight said hyzon shares closed at 8 26 down 20 04 on monday the dcrb sponsors and hyzon founders can sell their shares in the company in six to 12 months which knight said he feels is a little short but it is typical timing for most spacs and it caused the sec to raise concerns about such short term commitments that is something aurora innovation and its sponsor reinvent technology partners y addressed by setting lockups of four years in the spac they announced last week that four years is an extreme example knight said of aurora and reinvent spac it s a very good thing for demonstrating a longer term commitment to a business when we look at a lot of our incentive arrangements with our executives they are on four to five year time horizons so actually four to five years is a good time to make sure you commit to the business spending spac proceeds hyzon will use the proceeds from its reverse merger to add production facilities globally through companies like fontaine commercial trailer inc the largest platform trailer manufacturer in the u s and on additional research and development as much as we re talking about the truck we re getting out now we re making sure we maintain and build out that competitive moat that we have based on the fuel cell technology from parent company horizon knight said to do that we need to not only invest in the core fuel cell technology but also the electric drive in the vehicles the third area of spending will be securing hydrogen for customers who want zero emissions trucks but lack access to hydrogen at pricing that gives the trucks a total cost of ownership on par with diesel trucks unlike nikola hyzon has no plans to build a shed and three walls to make trucks nor will it develop hydrogen fueling stations which nikola has priced at more than 16 million each for a planned 700 station network in the u s and canada all the early orders are customers that have access to hydrogen knight said then there s a three to four year ramping stage where we will play a really important role in helping the customers gain access to the hydrogen one of those plans is using a republic services landfill in california to make hydrogen that will score even better than renewable natural gas because some of its solid carbon is captured in making the gas using a system similar to what republic nyse rsg uses to convert landfill gas for other purposes related articles hyzon expects to deliver fuel cell trucks in europe in q3 hyzon

the price of a regular gallon of gasoline has been increasing month over month since november 2020 trips to the gas station have been financially painful for san diego drivers in recent months but a nosedive monday in oil markets and an announcement over the weekend by opec the global crude oil cartel to increase production may lead to lower prices at the pump i would think we would see relief that would approach 10 to 15 cents a gallon over the next two to three weeks said patrick de haan head of petroleum analysis at gasbuddy a tech company that helps drivers find the cheapest places to fill up advertisement the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline in the san diego area stood at 4 30 on monday according to gasbuddy that s 1 17 a gallon higher than nov 1 of last year for eight consecutive months the average price has been higher than it was at the start of the previous month like so many other things in the economy the financial repercussions of covid 19 have had an outsized effect on the supplies demand and costs of gasoline and oil advertisement prices crashed last year when millions of workers and students greatly reduced the amount of time they spent behind the wheel once stay at home orders went into effect as the national economy rebounded and vaccinations became more widespread consumers started driving more demand regained its footing and prices climbed back up but on monday wall street got socked as fears mounted that the spread of the delta coronavirus variant may put a damper on the global economy the dow jones industrial average dropped more than 700 points a loss of 2 1 percent the tech heavy nasdaq composite slipped 1 1 percent for the day and the s p 500 fell 1 6 percent concerns that an economic slowdown would slacken oil demand resulted in the futures contracts for west texas intermediate crude the benchmark price for u s oil falling to 66 42 a barrel the drop of 7 5 percent marked wti s worst trading day since early september advertisement brent crude the benchmark price for international oil markets finished the day down 6 8 percent at 68 62 a barrel on the supply side members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries along with their trading partners that include russia hammered out an agreement on sunday to increase production 400 000 barrels per day each month through 2022 the collective group known as opec plus will reassess market conditions in december all that combined with wholesale gasoline prices sliding about 13 cents per gallon monday afternoon led de haan to say that it looks at least for now that our prices may have already peaked for this summer advertisement so it would appear very likely that in the coming days we will start to see prices move back down de haan but he was quick to add that everything is contingent on what happens with the pandemic where we go from here is all dictated on covid de haan said as goes the pandemic so go the prices prior to the outbreak u s oil producers churned out about 13 1 million barrels per day they produced about 2 5 million fewer barrels per day in 2020 as of last week the figures had increased to 11 4 million barrels per day advertisement but david hackett president of stillwater associates a transportation energy consulting company in irvine said domestic producers have been slow to ramp up production to prior levels because many of them suffered big financial losses last year they ve been holding off on bringing new oil to the market in order to pay their bills and shore up their bottom lines said hackett who is skeptical that prices will come down soon at least for drivers in california until something changes and more production comes on the price is going to continue to go higher hackett said advertisement gas prices have been on a steady climb throughout the country with the average price for regular in the u s cracking the 3 per gallon mark two weeks ago the first time that threshold had been exceeded since october 2014 according to the u s energy information administration three months ago the average price for regular in san diego surpassed 4 a gallon for the first time since october 2019 gasoline prices have been a major contributor to higher than expected inflation numbers advertisement last week the u s department of labor reported the consumer price index increased 5 4 percent from a year earlier the largest jump in 13 years gas prices have been a rising piece of conversation for decades because of the volatility de haan said and i think it s been made worse by the fact that there are many out there now who may be experiencing economic duress and barely hanging on then they have gas prices going up in the midst of it upon taking office president joe biden revoked the cross border permit for the keystone xl pipeline that was poised to send about 800 000 barrels of oil a day from canada to the texas gulf coast and issued a suspension on new drilling permits and leases on federal land advertisement while fuel analysts have said it s too early for those actions to have directly affected the recent surge in gas prices there were reports the biden administration worked behind the scenes at the opec meeting to urge a boost in production investment bank rbc capital markets said in a note to clients that opec s decision will likely please the white house which has worried not only about the impact of higher gasoline prices on u s consumers but also about a major rift between its key regional allies as it seeks to build a grand producer coalition to tackle climate change

skeptical of the four year college degree it s still your best bet to make money backlash against college as a common stop on the road to adulthood has mounted over the past decade critics say four year degree programs saddle most students with five digit debt without a clear path from classroom to career nearly half 46 of all families surveyed in november and december 2020 by gallup for the carnegie corporation of new york said they would prefer their children attend alternatives to four year institutions even when there were no financial barriers but when you compare the value of a four year degree with other credentials a high school diploma certificate programs and associate degrees it still puts workers at an advantage in the labor market and leads to higher lifetime earnings on average bachelor s degrees are typically a good investment if a college degree is an investment it s a good one according to the new york federal reserve the annual return on a typical four year degree is around 14 it calculates well above the threshold of good returns for stocks around 7 and bonds 3 in dollar terms graduates with a bachelor s degree will earn on average about 78 000 annually compared with a high school diploma earner who receives around 45 000 annually according to 2019 data from the new york federal reserve however on average doesn t mean that the return on your education or college earnings premium will always be a gain where you attend school how much debt you take on what you study and where you live after school all help determine your return many of those factors are influenced by your race ethnicity and gender your ability to repay debt affects your degree s value student loan debt is difficult to avoid and even more challenging to repay college costs rose 117 from 1985 86 to 2018 19 according to federal data wages meanwhile didn t keep pace growing only 19 during the same period according to the federal reserve bank of st louis however loans are still the primary vehicle for families without wealth to obtain college degrees in order to make your degree worth it you have to earn enough to justify it that means carrying debt that won t put you underwater a manageable student loan payment is around 10 of your discretionary after tax income to get the best return and be able to repay debt graduation is crucial many borrowers who default will have debt but no degree that s the worst case scenario you re incurring some of those costs but with very very little benefit says jonathan rothwell principal economist at gallup demand for your major matters what you study in school will affect the type of job you can get your earnings and your ability to repay debt average earnings at mid career are highest among those who hold a bachelor s degree in fields like science technology engineering and math or stem 76 000 business 67 000 and health 65 000 according to a 2015 data report from georgetown university s center for education and the workforce the same report found the lowest median mid career earnings among those whose bachelor s degrees were in fields like arts humanities and liberal arts 51 000 as well as teaching and serving roles such as social work 46 000 to estimate earnings graduation rates typical student debt loads and other factors at individual schools use the education department s college scorecard tool you can search and compare earnings as well as debt by fields of study where you live after graduation also matters where you live after attaining your degree also affects its value according to the results of a may 2020 study for the thomas b fordham institute a conservative nonprofit think tank in general college degrees are a good investment but the return in terms of cosmopolitan areas is phenomenal says john winters associate professor of economics at iowa state university who conducted the study in cities bachelor s degree holders earn 95 229 on average an 86 2 premium compared to a worker with a high school diploma and a 55 7 premium compared to an associate degree holder winters says that s primarily because cities have a higher concentration of jobs in fields that often demand workers have four year degrees such as tech finance and marketing workers in these fields earn higher wages which leads to a greater return on investment for degrees however winters findings also mean it s less critical to have a four year degree if you want to live in a smaller metro or rural area bachelor s degree holders in nonurban areas have mean earnings of 67 893 which puts their wages at a 46 4 premium compared to high school diploma holders and a 29 6 premium compared to associate degree holders degree attainment doesn t guarantee equity in some ways a college degree can exacerbate income and racial inequalities such as student debt and ability to repay that debt says marshall anthony jr a senior policy analyst at center for american progress a public policy research organization a college degree doesn t usually work the same for everybody anthony says black borrowers tend to take on greater amounts of debt about 25 000 more on average than white borrowers according to federal data in 2016 among those with a bachelor s or higher degree asian full time year round workers ages 25 34 had higher median annual earnings 69 100 than their white peers 54 700 and median earnings for both racial ethnic groups were higher than those of their black 49 400 and hispanic 49 300 peers according to the most recent available data by the national center for education statistics higher debt and lower wages also mean black borrowers will accrue more interest over time four years after graduating from college black graduates have 52 726 in student loan debt compared to white graduates at 28 006 according to a 2016 brookings institution study

at 7358 on june 22 and 7348 last friday presumably investors have put faith in recent history which suggests state economies bounce back swiftly once the inmates are released but yesterday was a classic wall street sneeze asx cold situation as the index opened down 100 points or 1 4 to the s p500 s overnight drop of 0 8 the problem is the concentration of market cap in banks and resources from the 11am update nonetheless the index recovered to close the session down 62 at 98 new cases in sydney the numbers are not going down but nor are they going up zombie style a lockdown extension

production increases yesterday which explains why our futures are only down 0 9 this morning to the s p500 s 1 6 drop overnight but the futures are only an indicator and not typically played by share investors more prone to jump at shadows in other words we might be down a lot more than 68 points we ve seen this movie before cast your mind back sixteen months and recall that wall street dropped 35 led by energy world locked down and banks yields plunge as the fed manned the barricades the rebound was nonetheless swift and sharp led by fang and friends consumer staples and a new breed of stay at home stocks such as zoom and peleton last night the wti crude price dropped 7 5 on opec s production increases and the us ten year yield dropped 12 basis points to 1 18 as investors rushed to safety while exiting equities the dow was down 950 points at its low the hardest hit sectors stocks were energy the banks and anything considered a reopening trade such as airlines cruise lines hotels and restaurants along with other cyclical industrials falling only modestly were fang and friends and consumer staples closing solidly in the green were the stay at home stocks zoom actually did fall but only because it announced a takeover peleton jumped 6 although probably a bit of a tadej effect there as well the dow fell 2 1 to the nasdaq s 1 1 all too familiar opec production aside the overriding issue is delta wall street looked across the pond aghast at freedom day and already the government has advised against travel to the uk australia s lockdowns constantly come up in conversation and we re just the tip of a global iceberg the us case and death counts are now rising at a speed last seen early this year before the vaccine rollout began in earnest cases are concentrated in the pockets of the unvaccinated republican states and this time it s the more deadly delta while last night s plunge was wall street s biggest this year there have been a few of these scary days along the way and each time the impact has lasted little more than a heartbeat typically markets have bounced back immediately it s not likely that will be the case this time no matter how stellar earnings reports might be it s old news the september quarter is back to the future yet pundits remain convinced the bull market is still intact we just have to get through some level of overdue correction commodities spot metals minerals energy futures gold oz 1812 60 0 60 0 03 silver oz 25 16 0 48 1 87 copper lb 4 21 0 05 1 21 aluminium lb 1 13 0 01 0 69 lead lb 1 04 0 01 0 84 nickel lb 8 45 0 13 1 55 zinc lb 1

s agreement a positive outcome yes production will be gradually increased but just how long were the members going to sit there and let oil prices run and let us producers benefit at least they have an agreement as history suggests a negative outcome would have been a breakdown in cartel cooperation leading to an every man for himself production surge meanwhile us production has not grown despite rising oil prices no one wants to lend money anymore to the fossil fuel industry so no new holes are being drilled and now delta again threatens to shut down the world metal prices were understandably

if you want to keep more of what you earn one important step is to turn off the spigot of needless spending impulse shopping is a way of life in america and retailers are quite clever at distracting shoppers with bright shiny objects when they re out shopping for something else even if you think you have a lot of willpower you might be surprised to see how much you spend on frivolous purchases over the course of the year if you need proof commit to writing down any time you spend money on an impulse buy that you don t really need for most people seeing this figure in black and white is enough to convince them that they are overspending

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox new york resurgent pandemic worries knocked stocks lower from wall street to tokyo on monday fueled by fears that faster spreading variants of the virus may upend the economy s strong recovery the s p 500 fell 68 67 or 1 6 to 4 258 49 after setting a record just a week earlier in another sign of worry the yield on the 10 year treasury touched its lowest level in five months as investors scrambled for safer places to put their money the dow jones industrial average slumped 725 81 or 2 1 to 33 962 04 while the nasdaq composite lost 152 25 or 1 1 to 14 274 98 airlines and stocks of other companies that would get hurt the most by potential covid 19 restrictions took some of the heaviest losses similar to the early days of the pandemic in february and march 2020 united airlines lost 5 5 mall owner simon property group gave up 5 9 and cruise operator carnival fell 5 7 the drop also circled the world with several european markets sinking roughly 2 5 and asian indexes down a bit less the price of benchmark u s crude meanwhile fell more than 7 after opec and allied nations agreed on sunday to eventually allow for higher oil production this year increased worries about the virus may seem strange to people in parts of the world where masks are coming off or already have thanks to covid 19 vaccinations but the world health organization says cases and deaths are climbing globally after a period of decline spurred by the highly contagious delta variant and given how tightly connected the global economy is a hit anywhere can quickly affect others on the other side of the world even in the united states where the vaccination rate is higher than in many other countries people in los angeles county must once again wear masks indoors regardless of whether they re vaccinated following spikes in cases hospitalizations and deaths across the country the daily number of covid cases has soared by nearly 20 000 over the last two weeks to about 32 000 the vaccine campaign has hit a wall with the average number of daily inoculations sinking to the lowest levels since january and cases are on the rise in all 50 states that s why markets are concerned even though reports show the economy is still recovering at a fantastically high rate and the general expectation is for it to deliver continued growth any worsening of virus trends threatens the high prices that stocks have achieved on expectations the economy will fulfill those lofty forecasts financial markets have been showing signs of increased concerns for a while but the u s stock market had remained largely resilient the s p 500 has had just two down weeks in the last eight and the last time it had even a 5 pullback from a record high was in october several analysts pointed to that backdrop of high prices and very calm movements for weeks while dissecting monday s drop it s a bit of an overreaction but when you have a market that s at record highs that s had the kind of run we ve had with virtually no pullback it becomes extremely vulnerable to any sort of bad news said randy frederick vice president of trading derivatives at charles schwab it was just a matter of what that tipping point was and it seems we finally reached that this morning with worries about the delta variant he and other analysts are optimistic stocks can rebound quickly investors have been trained recently to see every dip in stocks as merely an opportunity to buy low barry bannister chief equity strategist at stifel was more pessimistic he says the stock market may be in the early stages for a drop of as much as 10 following its big run higher in prices the s p 500 nearly doubled after hitting its bottom in march 2020 the valuations they just got too frothy he said there was just so much optimism out there the bond market has been louder and more persistent in its warnings the yield on the 10 year treasury tends to move with expectations for economic growth and for inflation and it has been sinking since late march when it was at roughly 1 75 it fell to 1 20 monday from 1 29 late friday analysts and professional investors say a long list of potential reasons is behind the sharp moves in the bond market which is seen as more rational and sober than the stock market but at the heart is the risk the economy may be set to slow sharply from its current extremely high growth besides the new variants of the coronavirus other risks to the economy include fading pandemic relief efforts from the u s government and a federal reserve that looks set to begin paring back its assistance for markets later this year monday s selling pressure was widespread with nearly 90 of the stocks in the s p 500 lower even big tech stocks fell with apple down 2 7 and microsoft 1 3 lower such stocks seemed nearly immune to virus fears during earlier downturns rising with expectations for continued growth almost regardless of the economy s strength across the s p 500 analysts are forecasting profit growth of nearly 70 for the second quarter from a year earlier that would be the strongest growth since 2009 when the economy was climbing out of the great recession but just like worries are rising that the economy s growth has already peaked analysts are trying to handicap by how much growth rates will slow in upcoming quarters and years for corporate profits
