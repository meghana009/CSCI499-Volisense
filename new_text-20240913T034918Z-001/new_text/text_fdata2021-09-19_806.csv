courtesy of a college friend who won a charity sweepstakes and arranged for sembroski to go instead in advance of the mission the foursome went through months of training including hours upon hours of simulations a zero g airplane flight high g jet flights nausea inducing centrifuge spins and a grueling mount rainier climb during their time in orbit the crew participated in friday s closing bell ceremony on the new york stock exchange chatted with st jude cancer patients and their families took calls from celebrities including tom cruise and u2 s bono and spent lots of time gazing out at earth through spacex s custom built cupola window this flight was different from spacex s three earlier crewed flights in that it didn t include a docking at the international space station instead the crew dragon headed for an orbit that rose as high as 585 kilometers 363 5 miles which is the highest that humans have flown since the space shuttle discovery visited the hubble space telescope in 1999 benji reed spacex s director of human spaceflight programs said the crew faced no major issues during the flight this mission was awesome he told reporters after the splashdown the only issues had to do with a temperature sensor that was reporting bad data about one of the capsule s draco thrusters and a balky fan that s part of the onboard waste management system there are contingency procedures and workarounds that were implemented todd ericson one of inspiration4 s mission directors said without going into detail ericson said that in the early stages of the mission the foursome experienced the normal level of space adaptation syndrome also known as space sickness studies have found that more than half of all orbital space travelers get sick at first but all four looked well and flashed big smiles during spacex s webcast of the descent ericson said isaacman and proctor monitored the crew dragon s autonomous control system throughout the flight but never had to take manual control it s very automated he explained basically the pilots like an airline pilot would do are confirming that things are going along properly they re also prepared for contingency operations at one point during the descent today s webcast showed sembroski watching a video program on his tablet and isaacman later joked that the crew was having a great time with in flight entertainment chris

four people have successfully and safely returned from a three day extraterrestrial excursion aboard a spacex crew dragon capsule their return marks the end of the first ever flight to earth s orbit flown entirely by tourists or otherwise non astronauts the four made a nail biting re entry into the earth s atmosphere aboard their spacex crew dragon capsule before it deployed parachutes and splashed down off the coast of florida saturday evening the reentry process involved the spacecraft which has been traveling at more than 17 000 miles per hour for the past three days diving back into the earth s thick atmosphere a process that heats the exterior of the vehicle up to 3 500 degrees fahrenheit the four made a nail biting re entry into the earth s atmosphere aboard their spacex crew dragon capsule cnn the vessel splashed down off the coast of florida saturday evening cnn the capsule then deployed two sets of parachutes in rapid succession to slow its descent before hitting the ocean a fleet of spacex rescue ships were nearby ready to bring the capsule out of the water and its passengers to safety during a netflix documentary about the inspiration4 mission mr musk described a capsule going through reentry as like a blazing meteor coming in and so it s hard not to get vaporised he added after that the crew dragon then has to deploy parachutes to slow its descent and make

dragon craft known as inspiration4 spacex though they re not the first tourists to travel to orbit their mission called inspiration4 is notable because it did not involve a stay at the international space station under the tutelage of professional astronauts as previous missions involving space tourists have rather the four spaceflight novices have spent the past two days free flying aboard their 13 foot wide capsule on their own at about a 563 kilometre altitude 160 kilometres higher than where the iss is and higher than any human has flown in decades and though the crew spent about six months training and getting to know each other they did not have to undergo the strenuous nasa screening processes or physical and psychological evaluations that most professional astronauts do they also have to prepare for worst case scenarios like someone on the crew becoming a danger to themselves or others axios reporter miriam kramer who followed the crew during their training process said on the how it happened podcast about this mission there are zip ties and medication on board in case somebody needs to be sedated so far however there has been no indication that anything has gone awry with the crew or their vehicle during their stay in space the civilians on board said they d conduct a bit of scientific research focused on how their bodies respond to being in space take time to chat with their families gaze out a large dome shaped window called the cupola and listen to music the inspiration4 twitter account also shared footage of arceneaux speaking to her st jude patients

all of which have been flown for nasa and carried professional astronauts to the international space station the public has had more insight the space agency and its dozens of communications personnel have worked alongside spacex to share practically every moment of the journey from launch until the astronauts dock with the international space station but this mission left the public largely in the dark when it came to questions about the crew s schedule and how they were feeling while in orbit even though development of the crew dragon spacecraft was largely funded by taxpayers and spacex rents nasa facilities to support all its missions inspiration4 is considered a private commercial mission that means the company and the passengers have few transparency requirements the public may not even hear from the tourists after they splash down saturday evening there could be several reasons why the space tourists were publicity shy during their trip it is possible for example that the crew wasn t feeling all that great after first reaching orbit according to a nasa research paper many astronauts report motion sickness symptoms just after arrival in space and again just after return to earth and getting a restful night s sleep in orbit was also a serious challenge for many crew members aboard shuttle missions it s also possible the four novice space explorers wanted their privacy or simply to enjoy the experience without having to stop to talk about it spacex s first private flight streaked into orbit with two contest winners a health care worker and their rich sponsor the most

drinking a glass of french wine a day may help with alzheimer cancer memory loss bone density healthy eyes high cholesterol liver disease stroke depression cavities the common cold here is why a check into the fridge and the wine cabinet and grrrr the bottles are large i want a glass of wine maybe a bit more but surely not a bottle what to do mix a gin and tonic or a scotch on the rocks or settle for a diet coke never a viable alternative for almost two years i have been locked in a space that appears to shrink minute by minute the clock on my computer seems to run very slowly and it takes forever to reach the time to officially stop finally it is 5 pm an appropriate time to shut down and open up a bottle of french wine french wine images there are many levels of pleasures associated with thinking about french wine the beautiful old chateaux the lush green vineyards the vines hanging with grapes bursting with potential fresh sweet and pungent air resplendent with organic fertilization the buzz of bees harvesting nectar to feed their workers and then there is the wine itself french wines are rarely subtle you either love what hits your nose coats your tongue lingers briefly in your mouth and leaves a memory that fleetingly visits and then gently disappears allowing a perfect moment to lift the glass in anticipation of the next sip or you don t challenges for centuries the wines of france have been a coveted cherished savored beverage around the world the french notion of terroir includes everything from the area temperature to the acidity of the soil all significantly impacting and influencing the quality taste smell and flavor of the grapes used to produce the wine throughout history environmental factors have influenced wines from global warming to industrialization and population movements to a myriad of other events that are serendipitous and cannot be controlled currently the challenges facing french winemakers include tariffs shipment delays container shortages late arrivals currency fluctuations and the elephant in the room covid 19 with all the issues facing the french wine business an industry that employs approximately 558 000 workers 2017 people are fearful that many small family vineyards will be unable to withstand the current onslaught of challenges and either close or sell to larger wine producers the reality of a shock to the french wine market was a surprise as the market for fine wines has been dominated by france with bordeaux and burgundy accounting respectively for close to 50 percent and 20 percent of the trading activity in 2019 live ex com fortunately there is good news in the first half of 2021 france exported 7 3 million hectoliters of wine valued at 5 1 billion euros representing increases of 15 percent by volume and 40 percent by value compared with the first six months of 2020 during the lockdown french wine exports are outpacing those during the first wave of covid and are returning to growth rates in excess of pre covid performances the american market is once again buying french wine since the suspension of trump airbus taxes for still wines not to mention record shipments of sparkling wines including champagnes in april 2021 france exported 221 000 hectoliters of wine valued at 208 euros which equates to a staggering 90 percent volume and 131 percent value increase compared to april 2020 vitisphere com benefits of drinking wine it is wonderfully reassuring to know that sipping a glass of french wine is good for my health as the grapes are the source of the many benefits wine delivers manganese potassium iron phosphorus and vitamin b6 it also contains magnesium a mineral that can help to lower blood pressure and blood sugar levels reducing risk of heart disease diabetes and stroke the antioxidants in wine fight cell damage in our bodies caused by aging and environmental factors such as pollution and lifestyle by preventing and reversing this cell damage a diet high in antioxidants can reduce risks of developing chronic diseases including cancer french wines are a wonderful treat for dieters as there are only 121 calories in a 150 milliliter of white wine and moderate sips may promote kidney health and protect against alzheimer s disease red wine with 127 calories has higher vitamin and mineral content and contains almost 10 times the number of polyphenols plant compounds that have antioxidant properties as white wine size matters so there is the news and good news french wines are available in the usa and they not only taste good but they are also good for my health however i still have the dilemma of bottle size a bottle containing 25 fluid ounces is now widely accepted as standard for wine recently smaller bottles have become widely available the impact of smaller bottles on consumption is unknown although the smaller bottle has the potential to decrease consumption by increasing the effort required to open and consume more than one bottle smaller bottles may also increase consumption by reducing barriers and therefore increase the frequency of drinking episodes the amount of wine held in smaller bottles may be perceived as too small studies suggest that visual exposure to larger portion sizes may adjust perceptions of what constitutes a normal sized portion if smaller bottles are perceived as too small this could inadvertently lead to overconsumption of wine as additional bottles are opened and consumed during a drinking event found the answer the good news is that lgv wines are available in slender 6 3 ounces plastic cylinders 8 inches tall a diameter of slightly more than 1 inch with a screw cap offering just a bit more than an average amount poured into a wine glass making for the perfect sip as i sit by myself in front of my computer screen trying to stay awake during a zoom meeting while this single serve size is an incentive for me to keep a stock of red and wine lgv wines in my wine cabinet and chilled in the refrigerator i want to drink wines that are as good or better than anything available in a larger size more good news lgv has partnered with many wineries led or co directed by women including elisabeth prataviera domaine de menard haut marin ines andrieu domaine de caylus and martine nadal domaine nadal hainaut all associated with organic vineyards practicing sustainable farming

by jackie wattles cnn business four people returned to earth from a three day extraterrestrial excursion aboard a spacex crew dragon capsule on saturday evening marking the end of the first ever flight to earth s orbit flown entirely by tourists or otherwise non astronauts thanks so much spacex it was a heck of a ride for us billionaire and inspiration4 mission commander jared isaacman could be heard saying over the company s livestream the crew were shown watching movies and occasionally heard responding to spacex s mission control inside their fully autonomous spacecraft before it began the nail biting process of re entering the earth s atmosphere after traveling at more than 17 000 miles per hour the spacecraft used earth s own thick blanket of air to slow itself down with the outside of the craft reaching temperatures up to 3 500º fahrenheit in the process the crew dragon capsule which is designed not to allow temperatures to go past 85º in the cabin used its heat shield to protect the crew against the intense heat and buildup of plasma as it plunged back toward the ocean after emerging from the spacecraft just before being whisked back to florida by helicopter the crew were seen smiling and waving to the livestream cameras but the flight was apparently not totally flawless from a technical standpoint you know we had a couple of issues that we worked we did work something on the waste management system benji reed spacex s director of crew mission management said during a post flight briefing but that was fine and you know the crew was happy and healthy he added inspiration4 mission director todd ericson clarified that the issues was with the waste management system s fan the spacex team responded by implementing a backup plan my hat s off to them ericson added reed also said that there was an issue with a temperature sensor in one of the draco thrusters used to move the capsule in outer space but the company responded by taking the double redundant sensor offline and in fact that draco itself was redundant it was never a risk reed said nasa officials have however have said the crew dragon is likely the safest crewed vehicle ever flown and the vehicle had already completed two successful trips to space with professional astronauts on board before this group of space tourists took their multi day joyride the passengers included the 38 year old isaacman who personally financed and arranged the trip with spacex and its ceo elon musk hayley arceneaux 29 a childhood cancer survivor and st jude children s research hospital physician assistant sian procotor 51 a geologist and community college teacher with a phd and chris sembroski a 42 year old lockheed martin employee and lifelong space fan who claimed his seat through an online raffle isaacman has billed the mission as a st jude fundraiser and it had netted 160 million of its 200 million goal by saturday evening count me in for 50m musk then pledged in a tweet which would put the fundraiser 10 million over its goal though they re not the first tourists to travel to orbit their mission called inspiration4 was notable because it did not involve a stay at the international space station under the tutelage of professional astronauts as previous missions involving space tourists have rather the four spaceflight novices have spent the past three days free flying aboard their 13 foot wide capsule on their own at about a 350 mile altitude 100 miles higher than where the iss is and higher than any human has flown in decades during their stay in space the civilians on board said they d conduct a bit of scientific research focused on how their bodies respond to being in space take time to chat with their families gaze out a large dome shaped window called the cupola and listen to music during a livestream shared with the public on friday proctor also showed off some artwork she did during her stay with metallic markers and sembroski strummed a ukelele that will be auctioned off as part of the st jude fundraiser the inspiration4 twitter account also shared footage of arceneaux speaking to her st jude patients and isaacman rang the closing bell of the new york stock exchange via satellite feed on friday afternoon other than that few updates were shared with the public while the crew was in orbit the first live audio or visuals from inside the crew capsule were shared friday afternoon nearly two days after they launched during previous spacex crew dragon missions all of which have been flown for nasa and carried professional astronauts to the international space station the public has had more insight the space agency and its dozens of communications personnel have worked alongside spacex to share practically every moment of the journey from launch until the astronauts dock with the international space station but this mission left the public largely in the dark when it came to questions about the crew s schedule and how they were feeling while in orbit even though development of the crew dragon spacecraft was largely funded by taxpayers and spacex rents nasa facilities to support all its missions inspiration4 is considered a private commercial mission that means spacex s customers only have to be as transparent as they want to be there could be several reasons why the space tourists were publicity shy during their trip it is possible for example that the crew wasn t feeling all that great after first reaching orbit according to a nasa research paper many astronauts report motion sickness symptoms just after arrival in space and again just after return to earth and getting a restful night s sleep in orbit was also a serious challenge for many crew members aboard shuttle missions it s also possible the four novice space explorers wanted their privacy or simply to enjoy the experience without having to stop to talk about it but favorable reviews of their experience could be crucial spacex hopes that this mission will be the first of many like it building up a new line of business for the company in which it uses crew dragon to fly commercial missions with tourists or private researchers rather than just professional astronauts spacex already has contracts for five other private missions as well as at least four additional nasa contracted missions the cnn wire 2021 cable news network

an additional 190 affordable apartments will be coming to albemarle county the board of supervisors approval this past week caps more than a year of meetings about the proposal from rst development and a coordinated opposition effort from homeowners in nearby forest lakes and hollymead the only supervisor who didn t vote in favor of the development was bea lapisto kirtley whose rivanna district includes the area where the project will be located wednesday s vote to rezone a 19 5 acre property will allow the virginia beach based firm to build 254 apartments and 78 townhouses the project will be near the intersection of u s 29 and ashwood boulevard neighbors were concerned about traffic green space schools views and the environment however this project is in an area that is marked for density in county plans along a corridor with growing employment opportunities and likely future public transit where affordable housing is needed which is why supervisors said they support the development growth in the county has been a contentious issue for years in response to residents concerns supervisors planning commissioners and county staff have pared back developments in recent years despite around two hours of questioning from the board the project remained unchanged from june s planning commission support seventy five percent of the apartments or 57 of the overall project will be affordable rental units for 30 years we talk a lot about how we re an inclusive and welcoming place to live and this is an opportunity to create a place for people to live that have not been able to live in our community up until now supervisor diantha mckeel said to meet current and future affordable housing needs albemarle needs to add approximately 7 507 affordable units to the housing stock by the year 2040 or 376 units per year for the next 20 years stacy pethia the county s housing policy manager said in a report the county recently adopted an updated housing policy but delayed certain affordable housing requirements including a minimum period of affordability of 30 years for rental units and that rezonings include a minimum of 20 affordable housing until developer incentives are approved even without the new requirements in place the forest lakes area project meets the new policy requirements pethia said the 30 year affordability period will help to ensure affordable housing options for more than 3 400 low and moderate income renter households over the next 20 years based on an average renter length of stay of 27 5 months per household due to its use of low income housing tax credits the project has the potential to provide rental housing to households with incomes as low as 30 of area median income an income category currently severely underserved in the district i represent i have seen many failures in the actual provision of affordable units white hall district supervisor ann h mallek said this process is so much better due to the funding as an affordable project with a wider range of income levels rather than a market rate project where a few affordable units for workforce are sold one time to a lucky buyer lapisto kirtley said she was concerned that two of the apartment buildings will be five stories tall and that she wanted more time for more compromise and more discussions i would have liked to see more time to give the community more time to really be able to digest everything and hear what really is being proposed and offered and to be able to ask additional questions of the developers she said originally rst development proposed a maximum of 370 units but ultimately reduced the request to 332 units the project was deferred at a march planning commission meeting where commissioners questioned the amount of green space and transit stops and wanted more specifics about affordable housing after some changes were made the commission voted 6 1 to recommend approval of the request in june neighbors from forest lakes and other hollymead area developments have come out against the proposal citing concerns about road safety and traffic school overcrowding the height of the buildings and possible stormwater runoff issues albemarle county has a goal of providing safe and sanitary housing approval of this development will not meet that requirement said george pearsall who lives in the neighboring ashland townhomes building 330 apartments and condominiums on a small tract of land is not going to create a quality living area and will significantly degrade the quality of living in the neighborhood the proposal includes five apartment buildings closer to the front of the development three of the buildings will be four stories while two will be five stories the townhouses at the back of the property will be two over two units with one two story townhouse stacked atop another the application plan which is legally binding sets aside 75 of the apartments as affordable rental units for 30 years the apartments will be available to households earning between 30 and 80 of area median income and the average level for all of the affordable apartments in the project will be 60 of area median income current household area median income in albemarle is 93 700 according to the u s department of housing and urban development eighty percent of ami ranges from 52 500 for an individual to 74 950 for a family of four while 30 of ami ranges from 19 700 for an individual to 28 100 for a family of four the application plan says that rents for the affordable apartments cannot exceed hud s fair market rents which change annually current fair market rents for 2021 are 1 077 for a one bedroom unit 1 266 for a two bedroom unit and 1 575 for a three bedroom unit valerie long an attorney with williams mullen who is representing rst development said the company plans to apply for the low income housing tax credit program a federal program used to help subsidize construction of affordable housing albemarle currently has almost 1 000 apartments that have received funding from federal sources such as the lihtc program none of which is in the hollymead area the property s zoning changes from r 1 residential to planned residential development in albemarle s places29 master plan which is part of the county s comprehensive plan most of the property is shown on the future land use map as urban density residential which recommends a density of between six and 34 units per acre a small portion of the property along u s 29 is designated as open space the project has a net density of about 17 85 units per acre and a gross density of 17 02 units per acre some community members were concerned about the project leading to school overcrowding the staff report noted that albemarle county public schools estimated that approximately 73 children could live in this development and hollymead elementary and lakeside middle likely could handle the growth but albemarle high school is already overcrowded the county school division s long range planning advisory committee recently recommended that a new elementary school be built in the northern feeder pattern which this project is in albemarle already has a potential elementary school site in the brookhill development that was given by the developer as part of the agreement to get a rezoning of the 277 acre site the committee recommended that the school board move forward with the long planned 32 million high school center that was paused during the covid 19 pandemic to help address current and projected capacity issues at the high schools three potential options for transit stops are proposed in the project while there is not currently a bus route near the parcel an ongoing feasibility study and implementation planning effort is looking at expanding transit service along u s 29 north of charlottesville according to the county staff report a traffic study recommended lengthening the left turn lane from u s 29 onto ashwood boulevard to accommodate the increased traffic and rst is proposing to install the expanded turn lane a left turn lane on ashwood eastbound also is proposed community members questioned why a traffic study commissioned by the forest lakes community association and completed by consulting firm epr wasn t taken into account kevin mcdermott an albemarle planning manager said the difference between the developer s analysis and the forest lakes analysis was that the association used different vehicle trip numbers in its modeling the traffic study commissioned by the developer was for 375 multi family homes while the forest lakes study used single family home traffic numbers according to documents on the association s website the industry standard uses higher vehicle trip generation rates for single family homes because they are typically the largest home type in size and have more residents and more vehicles per home mcdermott said the addition of more trips would be more on the scale of over 550 units in that development that s a pretty significant increase and we don t really see any reason for that we just don t see that being possible he said supervisor ned gallaway questioned what would happen if the worst case did occur and mcdermott said the state possibly could adjust the signal timing on ashwood boulevard gallaway said public transportation and school capacity are two big problems that us the supervisors need to take on this is big picture stuff when it comes to how we re expending funds and then what we re doing tax rate wise and schools and transit are needed in this area of the county he said county staff said a joint capital improvement program meeting will be happening with the school board and board of supervisors in october where long term and nearer term capital projects will be discussed i hope folks will stay attentive gallaway said sometimes we re very attentive when projects pop up in our quick immediate neighborhoods but those bigger items stay attentive to it and put your feedback in there as well

in october 2009 i was arrested and charged with insider trading i chose to fight the charges against me because i was innocent the prosecutors alleged that 0 01 of my trades between 2005 and 2009 were illegal i understood that in the us there is a 97 conviction rate similar to china and russia and a punitive trial penalty for those who dare to go to trial empirical studies have shown that the trial penalty is just about double that handed to those who plead guilty if a defendant agrees to become a cooperating witness helping the government with testimony irrespective of the truth to convict another defendant the co operating witness gets a much reduced sentence and in many cases just parole i understood the stakes i chose to go to trial why it s a question i ve since been asked hundreds of times why why jeopardize everything because to my core i believed i would get a fair hearing and with a fair hearing and a rational exposition of the facts the truth would have prevailed until my arrest i had the highest regard for the department of justice doj and the federal bureau of investigation fbi i believed that most americans felt that way in 2009 since then of course the american public has become jaded about the sanctity of these institutions with multiple examples of overreach and excess certain doj and fbi sections operate each attempting to further its own agenda without regard for constitutional checks and balances the terms fake news the dark state are now bandied about with almost wild abandon humor and satire the public now assumes the existence of fake news alongside authentic news with little effort towards journalistic integrity during the time of my arrest and trial information from the media doj and fbi was absorbed as unquestioned trust although some would argue that the dark state has existed for many years while i still believe that the vast majority of those who work for the doj and the fbi are people of integrity this book is an attempt to shed light on the corrupt few who act with impunity and destroy lives and families to further their career ambitions from the moment of my arrest the narrative of my story was recast with a precise agenda shaped to direct public attention away from the stark horror of the 2007 2008 financial crisis while promoting media idolatry of the publicity hungry and ambitious rookie us attorney preet bharara who became a demi god the sheriff of wall street riding into battle against myself relentlessly personified as evil incarnate on the front pages of major newspapers around the world wanton disregard for the law recognized by the judge at my trial allowed a corrupt element within the fbi agent kang to falsify documents leading to my arrest and falsify testimony leading to my conviction i faced prosecutorial misconduct at its finest the overzealous media feasting on a human story they could sell every day also profoundly prejudiced any hope of gathering an impartial jury by the time of the trial these three institutions ostensibly guardians of the public interest charged with impartiality and integrity bore down in a concerted campaign to make me the face of the financial crisis my arrest and subsequent trial a two year process deflected attention from a glaring fact not one major banker was held accountable for the 2008 global meltdown no arrests no searing prosecution no jail time in the midst of a financial crisis which brought a multi trillion dollar world economy to its knees these three institutions independently and collectively targeted a tiny slice of the us financial industry hedge funds honed in on a single hedge fund galleon isolated only me its ceo who had recently become one of the few immigrants on wall street to be identified as a billionaire and built a fabulous and intricate tale of sex drugs and rock and roll to entertain the public and build their own reputations their two year reality series was successful beyond measure preet bharara the then us attorney for the southern district of new york used my prosecution to launch an unprecedented press campaign to promote himself bharara ran roughshod over the truth standard department of justice protocols and the office s own dignity in his extraordinary zeal to convict me time magazine put bharara on its cover their headline proclaiming this man is busting wall street it was preet s finest moment bharara did not touch the real perpetrators of the 2008 financial crisis wall street s top bankers in a rare moment of public acknowledgement both preet and the influential new york magazine observed in 2014 that bharara was almost sheepish about the insider cases they made our careers but they didn t change the world bharara s impotent and poisoned approach to the non prosecution of criminal activity on wall street ranging from the mortgage bankers who precipitated the financial crisis goldman sachs lehman brothers the money laundering of drug cartels hsbc and the encouraging of tax evasion by us citizens ubs csfb would become the defining legacy of his tenure each of these firms settled civil charges by paying billions of dollars in fines using shareholder money but no single person was criminally charged or individually fined every one of the insider trader prosecutions was criminal the towering hypocrisy remains startling the prosecution under bharara s watch advanced a theory of trading to prosecute me and several others which the second circuit appeals court subsequently overruled criticizing it for doctrine novelty soon after my trial in may 2011 the then sec commissioner mary shapiro gloated that the beauty of insider trading laws is the flexibility in interpreting them the lead prosecutor in my case jonathan streeter said in december 2012 insider trading cases are confusing to investment professionals he went on to add there is incredible confusion on what is illegal and it s a real problem the law is very complicated and the lines are a bit murky a us attorney the prosecution in my trial and the head of the sec all acknowledged their reservations about a murky set of laws but had no murky reservations using them liberally in my case and at my trial the fbi agent overseeing my case special agent bj kang lied on his sworn affidavit to obtain wiretap authorization of my phone recognizing there had been government misconduct judge richard holwell who presided over my trial case issued a searing criticism of the wiretap application used by agent kang reprimanding him for reckless disregard for the truth with respect to both probable cause and necessity the judge went on to add that false and misleading statements and omissions pervaded the affidavit submitted by special agent kang so extensively that it was impossible for the authorizing judge to have the constitutionally required determination for the issuance of the wiretap rather than provide a full and complete statement as required by the law the wiretap affidavit made full and complete omissions and included literally false information kang did not stop at blowing through truth on paper he menaced and threatened my family and employees with prosecution frightened away crucial defense witnesses and routinely leaked false information to the media churning up an unabated feeding frenzy that shredded me in the court of public opinion kang took his cues from the playbook of the publicly reviled former fbi director j edgar hoover i was tried convicted and sentenced in the press even before i fully understood the charges against me the atmosphere was so toxic that my lead counsel veteran defense lawyer john dowd said the prejudicial publicity orchestrated by the usa was so palpable in the courtroom it was the most toxic atmosphere of any case i ever tried my defense team led by john dowd along with expert testimony from a former sec legal counsel repeatedly highlighted that all the information discussed in the wiretaps was already in the public domain every bit of information was in the public domain it did not matter no amount of truth could overcome the false testimony trained into the co operating witnesses by streeter his team of prosecutors and bharara who sat on the sidelines waiting in eager anticipation for any opportunity for a press conference each of the cooperating witnesses had committed his own set of crimes unrelated to galleon yet each chose to testify against me as an opportunity to reduce their probable sentences that they were perjuring themselves was irrelevant the government coerced them into an immediate mandate to take me down even the government s star witness anil kumar offered damning testimony under oath in my case only to recant the very same sworn testimony three years later during the trial of my brother my brother was subsequently acquitted as a result of the revised and opposite version of anil kumar s testimony a few newspapers picked up on this gross disparity but that was it the fact of perjury had no consequence the cycle was vicious innocent until proven guilty the cornerstone philosophy of the american judicial system was proving to be a farce i was convicted by a jury sentenced to 11 years in jail and paid fines of over 150 million the irony is that even in setting the fines the prosecutors working in tandem with the media kept up the unceasing drumbeat of punishment for the financial crisis never mind that i did not personally make any money from the alleged trades and never mind that not one single investor sued me galleon went through an orderly process of closing down the firm and returned all the funds with a gain of 22 not a single investor lost money most important to me personally was that not one single investor sued me in july 2019 i was released after serving 7 5 years of my 11 year sentence under the first step act i wrote this book entirely in prison and by hand i began by writing about an hour a day soon that increased to two hours then three i am choosing to publish the book for two specific reasons first i want my peers professionals who understand the nuances of managing money to hear the facts of my case i want them to judge me it is my assertion that i was entrapped framed unlawfully wiretapped surveilled and then made to endure a brutal and very public media lynching secondly and more importantly i want to begin a public discussion by creating awareness of how certain corrupt prosecutors and fbi agents are allowed to get away with criminal behavior there are no checks and balances in our justice system recently there has been a lot of discussion as to whether the president should be above the law the president is so closely scrutinized that doing anything against the law would ring alarms bells the world over instead my assertion is that the focus should be on the corruption within the american judicial system on a handful of corrupt us attorneys who live their lives exempt from the law by which they control the lives of others and the rest of the country in this book i will show how ambitious prosecutors actively take advantage of murky laws and coerce testimony from government witnesses to obtain wrongful convictions winning at all costs regardless of the truth appears at every level to be an operative mantra i realize there is only one book i can write to set the record straight this is it my story is also about greed in all its forms greed boils down to avarice hunger power money ambition all of these are readily available and identifiable in the financial industry by definition in fact i would say that in the financial industry greed is effectively a cliché with fear being on the flip side of a pair trade fear and greed are easy to communicate and the media hones in on these aspects of wall street but what i would like to do in this book is to hone in on the excess and greed in the judicial system ambition in the judicial system also translates to power and money a far more insidious and dangerous consequence to society because it goes unchecked after i was convicted the press had a field day speculating whether the new sheriff of wall street preet bharara was actually in line to succeed eric holder as the next us attorney general when holder stepped down while bharara was at first coy about his intentions he eventually made clear his goal to secure the job based on his work prosecuting wall street he may have wanted the job but did not get it the same ambitions were true for the three government prosecutors in my case all three left government shortly after closing out my case for higher paying jobs as partners in leading law firms they and their new employers spent considerable effort drumming up business on the heels of the skills honed during their time as former prosecutors to future defendants accused of insider trading they had no problem making the transition from denouncing apparent greed in the financial markets to defending that same greed switching sides in an effective demonstration of greed as partners at leading law firms they would be highly compensated the protectors from greed sold themselves to the highest bidder all under the trusting gaze of an unaware public the door meant to separate and maintain a balance between the public and the private sectors revolves efficiently and profitably it is important to understand context of the time and the prevailing mood of the country in october 2009 when i was arrested in 2008 we had seen the near collapse of the financial system and the wiping out of trillions of dollars of home equity and life savings of the american middle class the government was forced to bail out the major banks mortgages that were bundled up or securitized and sold by banks had contributed to the crisis millions of american homes went into foreclosure institutions such as lehman brother bear stearns fannie mae aig and freddie mac either filed for bankruptcy or lost over 90 of their market value an estimated 7 trillion in us household assets were wiped out and to add to the catastrophe in late 2008 bernie maddoff admitted to running the largest ponzi scheme under the very eyes of the regulators politicians and the public placed the blame squarely on wall street the pubic was clamoring for blood and there was no blood forthcoming from anywhere i had nothing to do with the housing crisis i was an easy target for politicians for prosecutors for pundits and for bharara who had just been handed leadership of the southern district of ny including a mandate for bringing wall street under control i was a successful and expendable hedge fund manager who employed just 250 people we obtained an overwhelming amount of information on a daily basis and my trading was 100 consistent with the written recommendations of my analysts in all cases i had a pre existing position in the stock before allegedly receiving the tip in 2009 and even today insider trading laws are murky at best and often intentionally misinterpreted by prosecutors the government painted our systematic well researched investing as being criminal theirs was an overreach of enormous proportions to show that wall street fat cats were being brought to justice if i am guilty then the entire investment business should be declared illegal as the wall street journal noted insightfully under standard rhetoric the public is somehow cheated by all this but the standard rhetoric is nonsense the public isn t damaged because another party wants to sell or buy and most hedge funds strive to make sure their trading doesn t affect prices anyway but a cynic might note one thing insider trading law provides a bottomless reservoir of supposed financial crime for washington to investigate whenever it needs a wall street prosecution to flounce in front of the press as a child having gone to boarding school in a foreign country at the age of eleven i learned quickly and early to be a fighter a scrapper this is a blessing and a curse over the years i have learned that you don t always have to fight the kindness of many people has defanged and disarmed me to a large extent however when people try to take advantage of me i have to respond i don t back down and i am fortunate to have been blessed with the mental fortitude and financial resources to fight for my innocence too many people do not they plead guilty to indictments they cannot challenge in my experience about 10 of the inmates at the prison in which i spent seven and a half years were innocent when i was researching the justice department while in prison i came across a paragraph that struck a chord in me unfortunately i did not write down the name of the author or the source criminal punishment is the greatest power that governments use and wield against their own people when employed justly and appropriately it is vital to any safe and productive society but when employed aggressively based on vague laws and personal agendas the criminal justice system unnecessarily destroys lives livelihoods and families oddly my experience of the law has left me without rage or a sense of victimhood while i would never say i am grateful for the experience i can say with confidence that i like myself better because of it when i finally broke through the wall of despair i realized i had gained a sense of peace and awareness that had opened me up and cracked me free i realized how incredibly strong the human mind is and that nothing can beat a person who refuses to be beaten finally i want to say that despite what happened to me as a result of a corrupt prosecutor i love this country just as much as i did before i went to prison i feel truly blessed to be one of the 5 of the world population who live in america i do not see people lined up to emigrate to china russia or japan for example as i reflect on my circumstances and my past if god had arrived at my doorstep when i was 11 with a crystal ball and told me raj i will give you the wife and children you see here these friends and ensure that both your parents live long and happily and give you also the ability to help the less fortunate but you need to sacrifice about seven years of your life i would have taken that deal in a new york second i feel very fortunate i am very fortunate raj rajaratnam february 2021
