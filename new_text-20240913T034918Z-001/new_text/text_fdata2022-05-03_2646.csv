russian president vladimir putin could move to formally declaring war on ukraine as soon as may 9 which would allow for the full mobilization of russia s reserve forces as they attempt to conquer eastern and southern ukraine us and western officials believe may 9 known as russia s victory day commemorates the russians defeat of the nazis in 1945 western officials have long believed that putin would leverage the symbolic significance and propaganda value of that day to announce either a military achievement in ukraine a major escalation of hostilities or both officials have begun to hone in on one scenario which is that putin formally declares war on ukraine on may 9 to date russian officials have insisted that the conflict was only a special military operation with the central goal of denazification i think he will try to move from his special operation british defense secretary ben wallace told lbc radio last week he s been rolling the pitch laying the ground for being able to say look this is now a war against nazis and what i need is more people i need more russian cannon fodder wallace added that he would not be surprised and i don t have any information about this that he is probably going to declare on this may day that we are now at war with the world s nazis and we need to mass mobilize the russian people more context a formal declaration of war on may 9 could galvanize russian citizens and surge popular opinion for the invasion it would also under russian law allow putin to mobilize reserve forces and draft conscripts which officials say russia desperately needs amid a growing manpower shortage western and ukrainian officials have estimated that at least 10 000 russian soldiers have been killed in the war since russia invaded just over two months ago other options for may 9 include annexing the breakaway territories of luhansk and donetsk in eastern ukraine making a major push for odesa in the south or declaring full control over the southern port city of mariupol the us has highly credible intelligence reports that russia will try to annex luhansk and donetsk some time in mid may the us ambassador to osce michael carpenter said on monday there are also indications that russia could be planning to declare and annex a people s republic in the southeastern city of kherson us state department spokesman ned price said on monday that there is good reason to believe that the russians will do everything they can to use may 9 for propaganda purposes we ve seen the russians really double down on their propaganda efforts probably almost certainly as a means to distract from their tactical and strategic failures on the battlefield in ukraine price said at a state department briefing price added that he had seen the speculation that russia may formally declare war on may 9 and said that would be a great irony if moscow used the occasion of victory day to declare war which in itself would allow them to surge conscripts in a way they re not able to do now in a way that would be tantamount to revealing to the world that their war effort is failing that they are floundering in their military campaign and military objectives i m quite confident that we ll be hearing more from moscow in the lead up to may 9 price added i m quite confident that you will be hearing more from the united states from our partners including our nato partners in the lead up to may 9 as well

four days after tony blair swept into number 10 in 1997 his comrade and rival gordon brown staged his own event at her majesty s treasury economic journalists including this writer were summoned to the grand churchill room to the astonishment of all present chancellor brown put an end to the ken and eddie show the cosy meeting between his tory predecessor ken clarke and bank of england governor the late eddie george taking centre stage the bank of england was given operational independence to set interest rates four days after tony blair was made prime minister in 1997 he was granting the bank operational independence to set interest rates in so doing he removed it from the political arena and aligned practice with that at the federal reserve in washington and the bundesbank in germany after the momentous announcement ed balls his then senior economic adviser now better known for his dancing prowess took me and others aside and explained that the ultimate objective was for the bank of england to develop into a monetary and economic institution with a reputation matching that of the inflation intolerant bundesbank as emerged a few hours later so determined was new labour that the newly independent bank would not be distracted from its mission of calming price rises that its role as the regulator of the banks and the city of london was hived off to a new institution it was a decision which almost forced george s resignation a quarter of a century on this week the big central banks are in a very different place under its current governor andrew bailey the bank of england is seen as having lost sight of its core mission of controlling inflation with forecasters projecting double digit price increases this year the bundesbank no longer acts as the bulwark against german inflation a task sub let to the european central bank ecb this has had damaging consequences in a country where the hyper inflation of the weimar republic in the 1920s is etched in the memory in the us the federal reserve under the current chairman jay powell is seen as having lost the plot by pursuing growth and full employment at the expense of letting inflation spiral out of control under its current governor andrew bailey pictured the bank of england is seen as having lost sight of its core mission of controlling inflation going back four decades after inflation soared into double digits across much of the developed world central banks and economic decision makers led by the federal reserve chairman paul volcker were spurred into action with politicians fearful of upsetting voters the bankers moved to centre stage using monetary tools advocated by the chicago school of economists led by milton friedman they were able to crush the over supply of cash to economies the result was that the average rate of inflation in the us britain germany and japan which reached 8 per cent in the 1970s peaking at 25 per cent in the uk was brought down in the years from 1990 to 2007 it averaged 2 1 per cent and only rarely since has it strayed above the 2 per cent target adopted by most of the central banks before covid arrived in 2020 the big debate in western chanceries was whether the world was heading into a period of deflation and should central banks adopt negative interest rates so as to penalise commercial banks which declined to lend stagnation across the eurozone following the greek debt implosion and pressure on the whole eurozone led the frankfurt based ecb into this territory in early 2021 bailey wrote to the commercial banks asking them how negative rates might affect their businesses steady eddie the late eddie george inset was bank of england governor for 10 years between 1993 and 2003 the skill with which central bankers controlled inflation through most of this century turned them into global celebrities former fed chairman alan greenspan was worshipped by financial markets and politicians alike for his brilliant reading of the data and ability to steer the us economy through the difficulties posed by inflation while not smothering employment mark carney was regarded as such a star for guiding canada through the financial crisis of 2007 09 without serious hiccup that an impressionable british chancellor george osborne persuaded him to take over the bank of england when mario draghi s term at the ecb expired he was drafted in to save italy from economic and political disaster and the french managing director of the international monetary fund imf christine lagarde could not resist a power base at the ecb so how did it all go wrong during and after the financial crisis central bankers discovered all kinds of new tools and were given ever more responsibilities by their political masters at the ecb draghi s determination to do whatever it takes to save the euro meant that the bundesbank s restraining influence was overridden in the us the historical responsibility of the fed for lowering unemployment led to interest rates being cut to the quick the us central bank pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system through a bond buying programme power grab french managing director of the international monetary fund christine lagarde pictured could not resist a power base at the ecb here in the uk financial stability one of the bank of england s primary roles edged inflation concerns as the main worry when covid changed the world in march 2020 the new governor bailey found himself slashing interest rates to 0 1 per cent the lowest levels in the bank s history the volume of quantitative easing qe was eventually pumped up to 875billion causing a monetary explosion instead of all the cash going into the real economy of goods and jobs much of it on both sides of the atlantic ended up in financial assets the tech boom over inflated floats of firms such as the hut group and the surge in the price of bitcoin phenomena such as free stockbroking at robin hood were consequences of over exuberance so focused were central bankers on saving people firms and economies from covid that inflation becalmed for so long became a secondary consideration when the former bank of england chief economist andrew haldane shared with this paper the view that the inflation genie was out of the jar in may 2021 bailey chose to ignore his caution instead as price pressures built over the summer and autumn last year the cry went up that the surges were transitory there appeared to be no grasp of the fact that supply chains had been permanently disrupted that recovery would place huge pressure on limited energy markets and that the unprecedented long period of low interest rates and a monetary splurge would spark persistent inflation central banks are now playing catch up this might not have mattered so much had the russian war on ukraine not come along but the crisis on crisis as the imf called it last month has turned something temporary into a persistent condition the pressure on energy prices has been exacerbated and food costs are soaring across the globe as grain and fertiliser shortages emerge the bank of england is desperately catching up with events and is forecast to take the first steps this week towards selling back to the market the 875billion of bonds it bought through its qe programme this will empty cash from the financial system a further hefty rise in its official bank rate from 0 75 per cent to perhaps 1 25 per cent is anticipated across the water the federal reserve is engaged in a rearguard action which could eventually see american rates rise from the current 0 25 per cent to 0 5 per cent range to 2 75 per cent or even higher the die has been cast and the central bankers have been made to look like chumps by becoming more political and obsessed with growth climate change and much else they have endangered treasured independence

acquisition and private placement of 3 8 million net of share issuance costs our sales team completed the transition to a saas like subscription based recurring revenue model which led to lower

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video frontier s bid was more than half a billion dollars lower than jetblue s but spirit said it was more likely to get regulatory approval new york spirit airlines said monday that it still supports frontier airlines 2 9 billion takeover bid for the airline saying it was more likely to win regulatory approval than jetblue s competing 3 6 billion offer spirit said antitrust regulators are unlikely to approve jetblue s offer because of jetblue s alliance with american airlines in the northeast a deal that the justice department is suing to block we struggle to understand how jetblue can believe that the justice department or a court would let jetblue strike a deal with american then buy spirit eliminating the nation s largest low cost airline the spirit board said in a letter to jetblue directors jetblue rejected spirit s view especially after promising last week to make concessions designed to assure regulatory approval of its offer jetblue s ceo seemed to raise the possibility of a hostile takeover bid shares of miramar florida based spirit sank more than 8 in afternoon trading new york based jetblue s stock gained 1 while shares of denver based frontier fell 4 the development was a reversal from last month when spirit said that after speaking with financial and legal advisers its directors believed jetblue s offer could reasonably turn out to be the better of the two deals spirit said its board continues to back the bid made by frontier in february and views it as the best way to maximize value the airline anticipates a deal with frontier closing in the second half of the year the jetblue american cooperative venture in boston and new york called the northeast alliance or nea was opposed by spirit and other competitors long before frontier s february bid to buy spirit jetblue tried to satisfy regulatory concerns by offering to divest spirit s airport gates and takeoff and landing slots in new york and boston and maybe in fort lauderdale florida however spirit s board said monday that the revised offer is unlikely to appease regulators because the revised offer still makes clear that jetblue is unwilling to terminate the partnership with american a spirit frontier merger would combine the nation s two largest budget airlines and create the no 5 u s carrier while spirit and frontier are similar ultra low cost carriers jetblue operates on a business model that is more like the big four american delta united and southwest jetblue would absorb spirit and eliminate a budget airline that regulators believe helps keep ticket prices lower jetblue on monday repeated the argument that its offer is better for spirit shareholders it would pay them 33 per share in cash compared with frontier s cash and stock offer worth 22 42 per share and jetblue s offer was sweetened to include a 200 million break up fee if the deal falters we hope the spirit board will now recognize that ours is clearly a superior proposal and engage with us more constructively than they have to date said jetblue ceo robin hayes hayes was far more blunt even threatening throughout a five page letter last week to spirit chairman mac gardner and ceo ted christie hayes wrote that his airline s divestment promises should comfort spirit leadership about jetblue s ability to win antitrust approval while we would unquestionably prefer to negotiate a transaction with you if you continue to refuse to constructively engage with us so that we can deliver this value to your stockholders we are actively considering all other options available to us hayes wrote frontier ceo barry biffle said last week that regulatory review of a frontier spirit combination is already well underway and many months ahead of any alternative
rogue baron otcmkts shnjf is on a mission with a clear destination to use the success of its shinju japanese whisky brand to reach a mid eight figure valuation in a recent interview rogue baron ceo ryan dolder said based on our market strategy and our current brands once we reach 10 000 cases sold per year we believe the brand could be worth upwards of 50 million rogue baron has its sights set on growing its already well established premium spirits business to at least 50 million valuations of this size are certainly not unheard of even in a niche category like that of japanese whisky with the proper investment rogue baron has laid out a path to this valuation and is making the pitch to investors for getting in now before they hope to skyrocket how rogue baron plans to reach 50 million two words marketing and inventory marketing currently selling roughly 3 000 cases per year rogue baron has tested its brand and has been rewarded with a growing market presence rogue baron has created a well oiled sales and marketing machine and continues to add to it in order to grow the brand to the yearly 10 000 cases goal the firm needs to up its marketing and sales staff and resources this growth in sales and marketing operations includes additional sales representatives and brand ambassadors as well as the necessary support staff they are ready to create new jobs inventory additional resources in marketing and sales are key but only the first half of the equation sales reps and ambassadors are going to need more bottles to sell investing in inventory is the second half of rogue baron s growth strategy producing whisky is a little more complicated than most other spirits because of the required aging process unfortunately firms that see an increase in demand are unable to simply ramp up production they must have access to the aged whisky fortunately for rogue baron they ve thought this through and have secured relationships to help them meet 10 000 cases per year demand in addition rogue baron has planned for its future by producing not only its 2 and 4 year expressions but also 8 10 12 15 and even 20 year expressions rogue baron has enough shinju japanese whisky for years to come rogue baron otcmkts shnjf is ready to meet demand once it is driven by the larger sales and marketing operation how shnjf prepared to execute the 10 000 case strategy let s take a look at three milestones shnjf has reached to move closer to its 10 000 cases goal established a brand shinju japanese whisky with growing demand in a niche category reached 3 000 cases sold per year signed distribution deals in the uk spain and a national distribution deal in the us investors looking to join rogue baron s quest to a 50 million valuation would be buying in at 0 10 per share today rogue baron certainly has plans for that stock price to rise as it meets its strategic objectives and pushes toward that magic 10 000 cases will you be adding shnjf to your watchlist

elon musk a self described free speech absolutist recently sealed an agreement to acquire twitter for 44 billion the deal which will be one of the largest takeovers in recent years has inspired some to say that the world s richest man is spending billions of dollars to buy free speech the ceo of tesla and spacex has repeatedly criticized the social media site for restricting free speech according to musk free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter serves as the digital town square where important issues are discussed the media research center has identified about 3 600 instances of censorship on big tech platforms with conservative content being the primary target twitter was involved in more than half of the censorship cases the right leaning media watchdog group found the list includes suspending the accounts of sitting president donald trump in january 2021 and censoring the new york post s hunter biden laptop stories the babylon bee a conservative satire news site parodied musk s twitter offer in a story due to inflation the cost of free speech has increased sharply to 43 billion the site had been suspended from twitter after naming a transgender white house official man of the year in a post in march the washington times reported that musk had reached out to seth dillon ceo of the babylon bee to confirm the suspension it was during this chat that musk mused that he might need to buy twitter in december last year the world s wealthiest man gave a lengthy interview to the satirical news site i wouldn t suggest that the babylon bee is the sole reason musk decided to take action dillon told the washington times adding that the suspension of the site by twitter may have factored into his decision perhaps it was the last straw on april 25 twitter accepted the billionaire entrepreneur s proposal of 54 20 per share in cash which put the firm s value at about 44 billion musk has secured 25 5 billion in loans backed in part by a portion of his stake in tesla according to the announcement he has also promised to provide nearly 21 billion in cash but it s unclear how he ll raise that amount if the deal is finalized it would be the largest take private deal since dell acquired data storage giant emc for 67 billion in 2016 according to pitchbook the price offered by musk represents a 38 percent premium to twitter s closing stock price on april 1 which was the last trading day before musk revealed his nearly 9 percent stake in twitter because of the high price some have questioned whether musk can turn the company around and generate value from this mega deal i don t care about the economics at all the billionaire said at a ted conference in vancouver canada a day after he offered to acquire 100 percent of the company going private is mostly promoted by private equity investors as a way for businesses to conduct a turnaround away from the public eye this strategy can provide a chance for struggling public firms to restructure and make operational adjustments with the prospect of going public again in the future after issues are resolved take private activity peaked in 2007 and has failed to recover to pre global financial crisis levels musk considered taking tesla private for 420 a share in 2018 valuing it at 72 billion however musk was later accused by the securities and exchange commission of deceiving investors by falsely stating on twitter that he had secured funding to take the company private as a result musk paid the regulator 20 million and resigned from tesla s board of directors with the automaker s market value now hovering near 1 trillion taking the firm private would have been a profitable move for musk according to pitchbook the twitter deal is expected to be finalized before oct 24 according to the merger agreement between musk and the company some shareholders are calling on musk to accept them as investors in the private corporation musk said during the ted conference that he intends to keep as many stockholders as the law allows in the private company we ll try to bring along as many shareholders as we re allowed to he said

investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips though a risky market subject to sharp volatility steel stocks are intriguing since a rising global population will likely spark long term demand u s steel x cleveland cliffs clf thyssenkrupp tkamy although macroeconomic headwinds have been unpleasant for myriad investment sectors one surprising category steel stocks managed to help keep speculators portfolio in the black normally you wouldn t expect it with an ongoing military conflict in eastern europe and china s zero coronavirus policy weighing on the stability and forward vitality of the global economy yet several steel stocks to buy now have soared amid the chaos of 2022 with core catalysts stemming from former president donald trump s administration because of tariffs imposed on imported steel this dynamic accelerated demand for the critical commodity in 2021 this source of friction became incredibly elevated as the international community was desperate to kickstart economic activity however reduced supply and rising demand usually only means one thing much higher prices even with russia s unsettling decision to invade ukraine steel stocks continued their upward trajectory however one major risk factor is china s insistence on fully containing its covid 19 cases the lockdowns in the second largest economy have dimmed steel prices posing concerns that a bubble may pop while not sugarcoating this significant risk factor the global population continues to rise typically this circumstance translates to higher demand for products and infrastructure not less thus for the risk tolerant speculator there may still be some time to advantage from these steel stocks u s steel 29 50cleveland cliffs 25 19thyssenkrupp 7 62 u s steel x source shutterstock one of the largest companies in the target industry u s steel nyse x is an american integrated steel producer headquartered in pittsburgh pennsylvania it features production operations in the u s and central europe not surprisingly given the broader context of the new normal x has been one of the top beneficiaries moving up nearly 24 on a year to date basis but it s not just outside dynamics that have helped u s steel command an enviable performance in the market rather the company delivers on the fundamentals recently it posted quarterly earnings of 3 05 per share beating out the consensus estimate of 3 per share further according to information by zacks equity research u s steel has surpassed consensus estimates for earnings per share three times over the last four quarters despite the positives i d be remiss not to point out that over the trailing month x is down 22 not an unusual performance for steel stocks therefore buying the dips gradually may be warranted rather than an all in one shot wager cleveland cliffs clf while pittsburgh may be the steel city it s not the only city that knows how to flex its industrial muscles cleveland cliffs nyse clf located in its namesake city specializes in the mining beneficiation and pelletizing of iron ore as well as steelmaking including stamping and tooling it s also the largest flat rolled steel producer in north america per the company s website giving clf some serious street cred among steel stocks to buy now and just like u s steel cleveland cliffs isn t just a strong performer in the charts though it is that with its 16 ytd gain rather to borrow barron s contributor al root s words clf crushed earnings estimates cleveland cliffs reported adjusted earnings per share of 1 71 from 6 billion in sales wall street was looking for eps of 1 46 from 5 4 billion in sales one of the most notable takeaways from the company s earnings report was that investors believe steel prices won t stay elevated however cliffs results exposed the difference between spot and contract commodity prices with cliffs pricing stayed strong even as spot prices weakened thyssenkrupp tkamy source shutterstock since the start of the new normal new investors have gravitated toward speculative investments indeed the meme trade phenomenon was born out of a desire to spark a short squeeze a phenomenon where a heavily shorted stock jumps higher due to panicky bears covering their positions against an unexpected surge of bullishness it s possible though hardly guaranteed that thyssenkrupp otcmkts tkamy could benefit from such a setup as mentioned near the top steel stocks face significant risks particularly because of china s zero covid 19 policy however oilprice com noted that steel prices for hot rolled coil in europe have started to decline as end users push back from earlier offers thyssenkrupp is based in europe and is specifically a german multinational conglomerate focused on industrial engineering and steel production it s also one of the steel stocks that have not benefitted from the upswing in the broader market segment with thyssenkrupp shares down nearly 31 ytd however that might also draw attention for those looking to speculate on heavily shorted securities like tkamy as i said it s no guarantee however it could be interesting for gamblers looking for

fed to fight inflation with fastest rate hikes in decades washington the federal reserve is poised this week to accelerate its most drastic steps in three decades to attack inflation by making it costlier to borrow for a car a home a business deal a credit card purchase all of which will compound americans financial strains and likely weaken the economy yet with inflation having surged to a 40 year high the fed has come under extraordinary pressure to act aggressively to slow spending and curb the price spikes that are bedeviling households and companies after its latest rate setting meeting ends wednesday the fed will almost certainly announce that it s raising its benchmark short term interest rate by a half percentage point the sharpest rate hike since 2000 the fed will likely carry out another half point rate hike at its next meeting in june and possibly at the next one after that in july economists foresee still further rate hikes in the months to follow what s more the fed is also expected to announce wednesday that it will begin quickly shrinking its vast stockpile of treasury and mortgage bonds beginning in june a move that will have the effect of further tightening credit chair jerome powell and the fed will take these steps largely in the dark no one knows just how high the central bank s short term rate must go to slow the economy and restrain inflation nor do the officials know how much they can reduce the fed s unprecedented 9 trillion balance sheet before they risk destabilizing financial markets i liken it to driving in reverse while using the rear view mirror said diane swonk chief economist at the consulting firm grant thornton they just don t know what obstacles they re going to hit yet many economists think the fed is already acting too late even as inflation has soared the fed s benchmark rate is in a range of just 0 25 to 0 5 a level low enough to stimulate growth adjusted for inflation the fed s key rate which influences many consumer and business loans is deep in negative territory that s why powell and other fed officials have said in recent weeks that they want to raise rates expeditiously to a level that neither boosts nor restrains the economy what economists refer to as the neutral rate policymakers consider a neutral rate to be roughly 2 4 but no one is certain what the neutral rate is at any particular time especially in an economy that is evolving quickly if as most economists expect the fed this year carries out three half point rate hikes and then follows with three quarter point hikes its rate would reach roughly neutral by year s end those increases would amount to the fastest pace of rate hikes since 1989 noted roberto perli an economist at piper sandler even dovish fed officials such as charles evans president of the federal reserve bank of chicago have endorsed that path fed doves typically prefer keeping rates low to support hiring while hawks often support higher rates to curb inflation powell said last week that once the fed reaches its neutral rate it may then tighten credit even further to a level that would restrain growth if that turns out to be appropriate financial markets are pricing in a rate as high as 3 6 by mid 2023 which would be the highest in 15 years expectations for the fed s path have become clearer over just the past few months as inflation has intensified that s a sharp shift from just a few month ago after the fed met in january powell said it is not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to prove appropriate jon steinsson an economics professor at the university of california berkeley thinks the fed should provide more formal guidance given how fast the economy is changing in the aftermath of the pandemic recession and russia s war against ukraine which has exacerbated supply shortages across the world the fed s most recent formal forecast in march had projected seven quarter point rate hikes this year a pace that is already hopelessly out of date steinsson who in early january had called for a quarter point increase at every meeting this year said last week it is appropriate to do things fast to send the signal that a pretty significant amount of tightening is needed one challenge the fed faces is that the neutral rate is even more uncertain now than usual when the fed s key rate reached 2 25 to 2 5 in 2018 it triggered a drop off in home sales and financial markets fell the powell fed responded by doing a u turn it cut rates three times in 2019 that experience suggested that the neutral rate might be lower than the fed thinks but given how much prices have since spiked thereby reducing inflation adjusted interest rates whatever fed rate would actually slow growth might be far above 2 4 shrinking the fed s balance sheet adds another uncertainty that is particularly true given that the fed is expected to let 95 billion of securities roll off each month as they mature that s nearly double the 50 billion pace it maintained before the pandemic the last time it reduced its bond holdings turning two knobs at the same time does make it a bit more complicated said ellen gaske lead economist at pgim fixed income brett ryan an economist at deutsche bank said the balance sheet reduction will be roughly equivalent to three quarter point increases through next year when added to the expected rate hikes that would translate into about 4 percentage points of tightening through 2023 such a dramatic step up in borrowing costs would send the economy into recession by late next year deutsche bank forecasts yet powell is counting on the robust job market and solid consumer spending to spare the u s such a fate though the economy shrank in the january march quarter by a 1 4 annual rate businesses and consumers increased their spending at a solid pace if sustained that spending could keep the economy expanding in the coming months and perhaps beyond

commentary last friday japanese broadcaster tbs reported japan s finance minister shunichi suzuki had discussed intervention in foreign currency markets on behalf of a beleaguered yen with u s treasury secretary janet yellen in recent weeks the asian currency has plummeted against the u s dollar falling to lows not seen in two decades according to mainstream media explanations derived from the conventional textbook approach to economics the problem is the federal reserve raising rates aggressively in the united states while the bank of japan is taking a far more judicious approach the growing difference in potential bond market returns therefore in favor of dollar denominated assets purportedly explains the sudden global investor distaste for yen and appetite for dollars is that really the case it is absolutely the case that the yen has tanked why it has done so that s another story altogether and a profoundly different one with far reaching implications to begin with the u s dollar s behavior against any major currency has been consistently at odds with conventional belief whether that meant interest rate differentials as claimed currently for the yen s weakness or the opposite when many continuously predicted the dollar s imminent collapse due to the federal reserve s constant stimulus exchange values rarely work out the way they re supposed to back in the autumn of 2010 just prior to when ben bernanke s struggling fed was about to unleash its second massive round of quantitative easing or qe critics loudly proclaimed it reckless and dangerous because they said so much alleged money printing would devalue the currency and unleash monstrous inflation brazil s finance minister guido mantega among them had famously declared we re in the midst of an international currency war a general weakening of currency referring specifically to u s qe and the dollar whenever a country finds itself in the midst of economic deficit the idea is to print currency in order to lower its exchange value against those of its neighbors called beggar thy neighbor since the intent is to take away from them by means of manipulation a lower currency exchange rate notionally cheapens a country s exports by comparison mantega was apoplectic believing that the u s federal reserve s second qe was intended for that very purpose stimulating u s trade exports at the expense of the rest of the world and he was far from alone in taking that position in fact officials at the federal reserve at the same time had expected that very outcome kevin warsh of the federal open market committee fomc the federal reserve s policymaking body noted his discomfort in november 2010 with the plan and its theft like approach below from the fomc transcript for that policy meeting mr warsh i think it is risky pool playing in the foreign exchange markets asking them to do so much of our work when the world s recovery is resting on this yet the fomc s members including warsh were of the opinion this was necessary and globally beneficial rather than provocative since the us and much of the rest of the world economy was showing signs of weakness so soon after the great recession had ended american officials deemed another qe necessary especially if it ended up weakening the dollar and stimulating u s export expansion as everyone expected the whole scheme was justified as matter of sequence and timing once america s economy got back on track with higher exports this would then as mr warsh was saying eventually bring the rest of the global economy along with it afterward there were any number of complications with the plan of course many expressed by those like mantega who weren t keen on the order of intended output and the risks they might ignite the biggest problem by far is that it didn t work that way at all as the world economy weakened further in 2011 right on into 2012 the dollar began to reverse and go higher not lower to find some real answers first ditch the conventional approach which obviously wrongly centers on central banks recent history has established that whenever the dollar goes up bad things happen to everyone this begins with the global monetary system itself which doesn t have much use or incorporate what the fed actually prints bank reserves not money for example in 2017 the u s dollar declined against most major currencies even though the federal reserve at that time was raising its benchmark interest rates at the same time later in that same year reducing the level of its balance sheet known as quantitative tightening qt this falling dollar had nothing to do with those policies except that they all were consistent with temporarily reflationary conditions marked as reflation 3 on the charts below behind what was called globally synchronized growth that abruptly changed very early in 2018 however even though the federal reserve s policies did not by april 2018 suddenly the dollar was rising again unexpectedly coincident to all sorts of financial and monetary incongruities the u s treasury yield curve flattened and very nearly inverted around may 2018 while the eurodollar futures curve would upturn beginning in june during that time serious collateral shortages were indicated including u s treasuries being taken out from the federal reserve s custody on behalf of foreign owners to get used elsewhere in the world s monetary system to try to plug growing illiquidity and reserve deficits above and it was also in june when india s top central banker at the time dr urjit patel took to the pages of london s financial times trying to draw attention to what the rising u s dollar truly signified globally quite simply patel said dollar funding has evaporated increasingly scarce collateral a key reason why this brings us back to japan s current yen plight to begin with it s not just been weakness in 2022 last year had forewarned of these same monetary types long before there were any fed rate hikes all the while its last qe was still ongoing rarely do you find a set of what should be totally unrelated indications fit together so closely above what rising u s dollar repo fails represent is collateral scarcity becoming collateral shortage meaning tightening effective monetary conditions in the world s global reserve currency eurodollar not dollar consistent again with the dollar s exchange value going up rather than down as consumer price indices would have you expect things went from bad to worse in collateral and curves beginning at the end of february japan s yen has fallen hardest and fastest going back to the end of february it s not just the yen either as any broad survey of currency crosses shows those dollar indices above a broadly rising dollar proves time and again a global wrecking ball a surefire sign of monetary tightening unrelated to the federal reserve left unilluminated by the mainstream textbook and if the upsurging dollar in 2011 destroyed those prior notions of currency war and dollar devaluation led inflation as it would again in 2018 or 2014 what does that portend for consumer prices financial conditions and the likely global economic situation from here on if you re looking for the smallest sliver of a silver lining it won t be inflation

plants are pictured at murray s garden centre in portugal cove st philip s which has seen an increase in business since the pandemic hit newfoundland and labrador henrike wilhelm cbc owners of garden centres on the avalon peninsula say they are seeing unprecedented demand two years into the covid 19 pandemic even as supply chain woes continue to cause headaches evan murray an owner operator of murray s garden centre in portugal cove st philip s told cbc news the last two years are among the most successful ones the business has ever had it s been wonderful said murray but the future didn t always seem this bright when the pandemic hit in march 2020 murray said he didn t understand how the store would be able to sell its products and the business scaled back its orders but after they opened for curbside pickup there was more demand for plants and flowers than they expected we quickly realized we would have one of the busiest years we had ever seen he said while it s unclear how much of the pandemic prompted business they will retain murray said he s heard from many first time gardeners that they ve found it rewarding people who had their first experience in growing vegetables annuals or perennials or even trees and shrubs got the gardening bug so to speak and they re continuing to be lifelong gardeners murray said evan murray an owner operator of murray s garden centre says his gardening business has seen unprecedented sales since the beginning of the pandemic henrike wilhelm cbc but increased demand both in newfoundland and labrador and abroad has come with a downside with supply becoming scarcer said murray the business has been forced to order supplies several months or even up to a year in advance for the upcoming season that included everything from our plugs to our hardware to our seeds you had to secure that supply as soon as possible and still those supply lines are challenged supply chain problems prompted murray to begin a pre ordering program for customers as items have been selling out quickly we are accepting pre orders which is something we began during the pandemic to make sure people could secure the plants that we knew were coming murray said the most popular pre ordered items are herbs and vegetables with increased demand from customers who want to grow their own food people have a lot of interest in growing beautiful but also functional gardens and edible gardens he said holland nurseries owner john frecker says the pandemic years have been an unexpected success for his garden centre with house plants being big sellers jeremy eaton cbc john frecker owner of holland nurseries in st john s had much the same experience when we first went into the lockdown it was very very disconcerting we didn t know what was going to happen while frecker initially thought pandemic safety measures would cause a downturn in sales the opposite proved true to our surprise it was a very strong year but frecker said supply chain shortages have been horrific amid the increased popularity of gardening goods it s been a real challenge frecker said a lot of our suppliers simply don t have the products that we would ordinarily have in stock he said the products will eventually arrive but in some cases he s been forced to find new suppliers to make up for the shortages floral bouquets have been particularly hurt by the supply chain woes stuff coming up from south america is proving very difficult a lot of the farms have had to close because they ve had health issues with their staff people unable to get to work it s a very labour intensive field and they just haven t had the workers to deal with it holland nurseries floral arrangements are pictured in february 2017 since the onset of the pandemic frecker says his stock of cut flowers has been impacted by supply chain issues jeremy eaton cbc frecker said while they re seeing more first time gardeners there has also been a spike in demand for house plants it s a relatively low maintenance thing that you can do to beautify your home he said with succulents and tropical plants proving particularly popular frecker said he thinks gardening gained popularity due to travel restrictions forcing people to stay home and take in their surroundings with travel restrictions largely lifted he s not sure where that will leave the business now that people have gotten a taste for the pleasure that they can get from doing their own gardening it may shape up to be another strong year but with the high price increases on gas and everything else god knows what people s disposable income is and how much amount they ll have available to do that sort of thing both garden centre owners have tips for first time gardeners this time of the year is the right time to be planning and thinking ahead to when we get to those warmer weeks murray said so in some cases you are starting seed now good planning is required to make sure you have transplants ready to roll out as soon as warmer weather arrives he suggests considering the layout of the garden and having the material and supplies on hand to strike when the time is right if you re doing leafy greens you can get multiple harvests per year if you plan properly murray cautioned new gardeners to not get too excited he said eager people will often start seeds too early there are some things you can start now and some things you can put out even during months where you have frost he said listing kale pansies and violas as examples but you don t want to be starting your squash or pumpkin plants indoors and then ending up with a plant that s five feet long and nowhere to put it because there s still frost outside to avoid frustration frecker said new gardeners should read up on what they want to grow it helps for people to get as much information as possible about what s required to make that succeed he said it s not that it s a huge amount of work but you do have to pay attention read more from cbc newfoundland and labrador

rogue baron otcmkts shnjf is on a mission with a clear destination to use the success of its shinju japanese whisky brand to reach a mid eight figure valuation in a recent interview rogue baron ceo ryan dolder said based on our market strategy and our current brands once we reach 10 000 cases sold per year we believe the brand could be worth upwards of 50 million rogue baron has its sights set on growing its already well established premium spirits business to at least 50 million valuations of this size are certainly not unheard of even in a niche category like that of japanese whisky with the proper investment rogue baron has laid out a path to this valuation and is making the pitch to investors for getting in now before they hope to skyrocket how rogue baron plans to reach 50 million two words marketing and inventory marketing currently selling roughly 3 000 cases per year rogue baron has tested its brand and has been rewarded with a growing market presence rogue baron has created a well oiled sales and marketing machine and continues to add to it in order to grow the brand to the yearly 10 000 cases goal the firm needs to up its marketing and sales staff and resources this growth in sales and marketing operations includes additional sales representatives and brand ambassadors as well as the necessary support staff they are ready to create new jobs inventory additional resources in marketing and sales are key but only the first half of the equation sales reps and ambassadors are going to need more bottles to sell investing in inventory is the second half of rogue baron s growth strategy producing whisky is a little more complicated than most other spirits because of the required aging process unfortunately firms that see an increase in demand are unable to simply ramp up production they must have access to the aged whisky fortunately for rogue baron they ve thought this through and have secured relationships to help them meet 10 000 cases per year demand in addition rogue baron has planned for its future by producing not only its 2 and 4 year expressions but also 8 10 12 15 and even 20 year expressions rogue baron has enough shinju japanese whisky for years to come rogue baron otcmkts shnjf is ready to meet demand once it is driven by the larger sales and marketing operation how shnjf prepared to execute the 10 000 case strategy let s take a look at three milestones shnjf has reached to move closer to its 10 000 cases goal established a brand shinju japanese whisky with growing demand in a niche category reached 3 000 cases sold per year signed distribution deals in the uk spain and a national distribution deal in the us investors looking to join rogue baron s quest to a 50 million valuation would be buying in at 0 10 per

it s the eternal conundrum for pickup truck owners how do you organize and secure stuff in the bed some manufacturers offer their own solutions like ram with the rambox storage bins built into the bedsides or honda and hyundai with their underbed trunks many owners resort to a tonneau cover which addresses the security aspect but not the one pertaining to organization and a tonneau cover essentially turns your truck into a giant lincoln town car when you re using the tonneau the bed is a trunk so you can t carry your dirt bike or atv or grandfather clock decked a company out of defiance ohio has a solution its truck bed drawer system ezra dyer car and driver the idea is that you get the benefits of a hard tonneau lockable weatherproof out of sight storage along with slide out drawers to organize gear while retaining the ability to haul large heavy items that s because the deck isn t flush with the top of the bed like a tonneau it sits lower and is designed to support 2000 pounds so you can load gear in the drawers and still park your yamaha banshee on top that all sounded promising so we tried out a 1499 99 on a 2022 nissan frontier ezra dyer car and driver the installation process is more difficult on a frontier than it would be on a full size truck since full sizes don t require drilling on larger trucks the system is secured with the factory tie downs for the frontier we needed to relocate a couple of tie downs and drill holes at the cab side of the bed to mount the center channel that goes between the drawers but as long as you embrace the measure twice drill once credo when pointing a drill at your truck it s not daunting the extremely detailed and thorough installation instructions are 22 pages long and when you re in the thick of the process you ll appreciate the sense of humor that runs throughout extra important sections are highlighted in red such as the page concerning the weatherstripping that goes on the edge of the drawers that part reads important facing the weatherstrip the wrong way will funnel water into drawer bad there s also a helpful installation video decked recommends recruiting a buddy to assist in installations like this since relocating the tie downs is mighty tough with one set of hands the instructions warn you will need to grab a pal for this step or have incredibly long and flexible arms our frontier installer did it solo somehow but the whole process will go quicker if you have help near the end comes the fun stuff installing the bottle opener and ruler securing the ammo cans vertical bins with snap on lids that flank the drawers ezra dyer car and driver you could just throw your gear in the drawers but decked includes organizers designed for the space dividers a small fitted toolbox a bigger one called the d box there s an optional soft bag dubbed yes the d bag overlanders might opt for the decked x pathfinder campfire cooking kit or the survival kit if your truck doesn t have a locking tailgate you can order locks for the drawers too ezra dyer car and driver our frontier owner who does contracting work is smitten with the decked system now instead of schlepping his tools from his truck to the garage every day he just leaves them in the decked drawers ready to go he also pointed out that the upper cargo surface sits above the truck s wheel wells and thus makes it possible to haul sheets of plywood or drywall laid flat which wasn t the case with the stock bed the system also proved totally waterproof after going through a carwash the ammo cans which aren t billed as weatherproof barely got any water inside and everything about it from the way the drawer handles unlatch to the snug fit of the lids on the ammo cans feels extremely well made the dominant material is high density polyethylene hdpe which is both durable and in this case 100 percent recycled ezra dyer car and driver as for downsides your cargo deck gets higher so that will add a challenge if you re using ramps to load an atv you d want to back the truck up to a steep banking or use really long ramps and the system weighs 205 pounds extra mass that counts against your truck s payload rating the frontier didn t seem to notice finally if you like to put an inflatable pool in the back of your truck to make a redneck hot tub that setup will now have to be aboveground as it were we re just warning you but overall the system is a well thought out well executed solution to the trade offs imposed by pickup beds you retain the ability to carry big heavy truck stuff while gaining organized secure waterproof storage once you see it in action you wonder why truck beds aren t designed like this in the first place

another three months of negative growth in the output of goods and services after the u s economy unexpectedly contracted by 1 4 percent in the first quarter could send the world s largest economy into a technical recession while recession clouds could be forming on the horizon some market analysts dismissed the headline gross domestic product gdp reading in the january to march period citing strong domestic demand consumer spending expanded 2 7 percent residential investment increased 2 1 percent and nonresidential investment swelled by 9 2 percent the negative growth was driven primarily by a decline in exports inventory rundowns and a drop in government spending still financial experts concede that it wasn t a good quarter for the post pandemic economy with rampant price inflation in nearly every sector the data and trends have weighed on projections too we expect a more notable growth slowdown in 2023 and a rising unemployment rate with elevated risk of a mild recession nomura economist robert dent warned in a research note does this mean stagflation is more likely to unfold over the next 12 to 24 months stagflation generally refers to a span of slowing economic growth rising unemployment and increasing inflation people shop at a grocery store in monterey park calif on april 12 2022 frederic j brown afp via getty images this economic event occurred twice in the united states in the 1970s driven by sky high energy prices and government price and wage controls that restricted supply the first stint of stagflation transpired between 1974 and 1975 when the annual growth rates were minus 6 19 percent and 0 34 percent the second period of stagflation happened between 1978 and 1982 when the yearly gdp growth rates were 0 91 percent 1978 minus 2 37 percent 1979 minus 3 42 percent 1980 2 79 percent 1981 and minus 4 34 percent 1982 the jobless rate topped 10 percent in this time frame while the annual inflation rate exceeded 13 5 percent in 1980 in response to inflation spiraling out of control the federal reserve led by democrat paul volcker raised the benchmark federal funds rate to 20 percent in june 1981 from 11 2 percent in 1979 looking ahead stagflation fears are increasingly becoming more pronounced the march bank of america fund manager survey highlighted that u s stagflation expectations climbed to 66 percent the highest in 14 years speaking in an interview with bloomberg news last month bank of canada governor tiff macklem rejected that this scenario could occur a lot has changed since the 1970s he said central banks are going to be much more ahead of it than they were europe could be on the precipice of stagflation in the eurozone the gdp edged up by just 0 2 percent in the first quarter while inflation hit 7 5 percent in april in france income growth has stalled and prices for goods and services have soared the last time one of europe s largest economies witnessed a similar case was in the 1980s back home ray dalio bridgewater associates founder and co chief investment officer is confident a stagflationary environment could be transpiring what about a recession if the united states slips into stagflation what are the odds of a recession i think that most likely what we re going to have is a period of stagflation he recently told yahoo finance presents so what you have is enough tightening by the federal reserve to deal with inflation adequately and that is too much tightening for the markets and the economy so the fed is going to be in a very difficult place a year from now as inflation still remains high and it starts to pinch on both the markets and the economy if the united states slips into stagflation what are the odds of a recession economists and wall street are monitoring a wide range of flashing recession indicators in march and april the yield curve inverted this is when short term treasurys generate higher interest rates than long term bonds when that happens it typically suggests investors are losing faith in the economy but not everyone is convinced that the yield curve is a reliable indicator in this type of environment however the problem today is that the yield curve has been distorted by the effects of large scale central bank asset purchases over the past decade neil shearing group chief economist at capital economics said in a note these have compressed term premia and pulled down yields at the long end of the curve thus making it more prone to inverting we therefore suspect that the yield curve may have lost some of its predictive power some observers warn that quantitative tightening could have an effect on the post crisis economy the u s economy is quite strong at the moment but there is indeed some risk of slipping into a recession nikolai roussanov a finance professor at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania said in a paper its length and severity would depend in large part on the fed s response and i expect it to do all it can to minimize the damage traders work as federal reserve chair jerome powell is seen on a screen delivering remarks at the new york stock exchange in new york city on march 16 2022 brendan mcdermid reuters fed chairman jerome powell has stated that his objective is to achieve a soft landing curb price inflation support economic growth and ensure that the labor market remains strong even with waning fiscal and monetary support and elevated inflation ing anticipates a rebound in the second quarter while inflation is hurting spending power nominal incomes are rising strongly and there are decent employment gains that in combination can keep spending firm james knightley ing s chief international economist said in a note on top of that there is the legacy of higher savings accrued through the pandemic and large wealth gains caused by rising asset values that can additionally be used to keep consumer spending growing nicely ing forecasts annualized growth in the range of 2 percent to 2 5 percent in the april to july period goldman sachs echoed that sentiment expecting that the united states could avert a recession because of a strong labor market and households are in better shape financially than they have been at the onset of most recessions the ratio of household net worth to disposable income is at a record high the personal savings rate is elevated pent up savings are ample and americans overall have a healthy financial surplus the bank wrote this means a slowdown in labor income growth is less likely to cause households to sharply cut back on spending than in some past cycles researchers at the wall street titan recently raised the odds of a recession in the next 24 months to 35 percent
the world s biggest chain of coffee shops is dealing with a lot more than just brewing and selling great coffee right now what happened last month was lousy for most stocks but it was downright miserable for starbucks sbux 0 29 investors shares of the coffeehouse giant fell 18 in april according to data from s p global market intelligence from a combination of store closures in china and the growing threat of unionization at more of its domestic stores so what in its defense starbucks stock was facing a headwind anyway the s p 500 gspc 1 20 fell nearly 9 last month pulling most stocks in a bearish direction nevertheless the premier name in coffee houses is facing its own unique problems chief among these problems is the pun completely intended brewing concern that more of its stores in the united states will see their workers form labor unions a few dozen starbucks stores have opted to create unions just within the past few months and more are likely to be on the way though not explicitly stated as such this movement among starbucks workers is at least one of the top reasons former ceo howard schultz stepped back into the role in early april his open letter reads i am returning to the company to work with all of you to design that next starbucks an evolution of our company deep with purpose where we each have agency and where we work together to create a positive impact in the world the publicly posted letter adds my first work is to spend lots of time with partners that is baristas and other employees these early meetings have not gone particularly well though and in some regards may have made the company s relationships with workers even worse unions aren t the only factor working against starbucks stock price as part of his regrouping effort schultz has also suspended the company s stock buyback program to devote time and resources to his intended overhaul also unnerving investors is disruption linked to russia s invasion of ukraine as well as a wave of covid 19 lockdowns in china where starbucks generates between 10 and 20 of annual revenue aimed at curbing a rekindled spread of the contagion although it s difficult to estimate the impact these new measures may have on starbucks sales there china s lockdowns were a key reason the company missed last year s third quarter revenue estimates now what given everything working against the company in addition to the ceo transition the stock s poor performance is understandable and even forgivable but it s not something that s dismissible despite the currently discounted price none of the aforementioned challenges are insurmountable indeed most are bound to be temporary and even the one that isn t the potential for unions that threaten employee flexibility and higher wage requirements can be handled with some careful adaptation but with no clarity as to when or how the company can return its full focus on its core business investors might be better served by considering other opportunities
the development was a reversal from last month when spirit was said to have favoured jetblue s offer spirit airlines said monday that it still supports frontier airlines 2 9bn takeover bid for the airline saying it was more likely to win regulatory approval than jetblue s competing 3 6bn offer spirit said antitrust regulators are unlikely to approve jetblue s offer because of jetblue s alliance with american airlines in the northeast a deal that the us department of justice is suing to block we struggle to understand how jetblue can believe that the justice department or a court would let jetblue strike a deal with american then buy spirit eliminating the nation s largest low cost airline the spirit board said in a letter to jetblue directors jetblue rejected spirit s view especially after promising last week to make concessions designed to assure regulatory approval of its offer jetblue s ceo seemed to raise the possibility of a hostile takeover bid shares of spirit based in miramar florida in the united states sank more than 8 percent in afternoon trading new york based jetblue s stock gained 1 percent while shares of denver based frontier fell 4 percent the development was a reversal from last month when spirit said that after speaking with financial and legal advisers its directors believed jetblue s offer could reasonably turn out to be the better of the two deals spirit said its board continues to back the bid made by frontier in february and views it as the best way to maximize value the airline anticipates a deal with frontier closing in the second half of the year the jetblue american cooperative venture in boston and new york called the northeast alliance or nea was opposed by spirit and other competitors long before frontier s february bid to buy spirit jetblue tried to satisfy regulatory concerns by offering to divest spirit s airport gates and takeoff and landing slots in new york and boston and maybe in fort lauderdale florida however spirit s board said monday that the revised offer is unlikely to appease regulators because the revised offer still makes clear that jetblue is unwilling to terminate the partnership with american a spirit frontier merger would combine the nation s two largest budget airlines and create the number five us carrier while spirit and frontier are similar ultra low cost carriers jetblue operates on a business model that is more like the big four american delta united and southwest jetblue would absorb spirit and eliminate a budget airline that regulators believe helps keep ticket prices lower jetblue on monday repeated the argument that its offer is better for spirit shareholders it would pay them 33 per share in cash compared with frontier s cash and stock offer worth 22 42 per share and jetblue s offer was sweetened to include a 200m breakup fee if the deal falters we hope the spirit board will now recognise that ours is clearly a superior proposal and engage with us more constructively than they have to date said jetblue ceo robin hayes hayes was far more blunt even threatening throughout a five page letter last week to spirit chairman mac gardner and ceo ted christie hayes wrote that his airline s divestment promises should comfort spirit leadership about jetblue s ability to win antitrust approval while we would unquestionably prefer to negotiate a transaction with you if you continue to refuse to constructively engage with us so that we can deliver this value to your stockholders we are actively considering all other options available to us hayes wrote frontier ceo barry biffle said last week that regulatory review of a frontier spirit combination is already well under way and many months ahead of any alternative when an analyst pressed biffle on why frontier hasn t campaigned more aggressively and publicly for its bid he said we have been pretty clear about how frontier views the benefits of its offer i don t think we have to keep repeating it biffle said

management was surprised by a negative development in the most recent quarter when netflix nflx 2 52 reported 2022 first quarter financial results on april 19 what captured the market s attention was a loss of 200 000 subscribers during the period making matters worse was management s expectation of losing another 2 million customers in the current quarter unsurprisingly the stock immediately crashed 35 following the announcement for a business that was growing rapidly over the past decade adding tens of millions of new members every year and increasing revenue at a brisk rate the dramatic slowdown is raising questions about the streaming company s prospects and investors have a lot to think about topping the list of what shareholders should start to question is netflix s pricing power let s take a closer look netflix s weakening moat netflix has historically been able to raise prices in the u s with seemingly no impact on its customer growth it hiked prices in april 2014 the first of six price hikes and since then the membership count has increased from 48 million to 221 6 million today but i think it s looking like the party is over management blamed elevated churn as the reason for the first quarter subscriber miss and weak second quarter forecast furthermore it specifically said that the most recent u s price increase in january was not the reason for higher churn instead the leadership team called out the war in ukraine macro issues in latin america seasonality and heightened competition for the attrition i m skeptical of this argument the u s and canada region ucan lost 640 000 members last quarter the biggest decline it at least the past decade and this was during the three month period that netflix raised prices in the u s and in a period when bridgerton 2 its most popular english language tv show was released top notch content wasn t enough for consumers to want to pay more a key part of the company s strategy that has worked so well in the past it s only going to get harder to bring these fallen off customers back onto the platform including accounts that share passwords netflix estimates that there are 105 million households in the ucan region that watch netflix market saturation is real additionally there are an unlimited number of entertainment options today is netflix still superior enough to rival services to warrant its premium pricing i m not so sure excluding the impact of russia netflix would ve added 500 000 customers in the first quarter that still would ve substantially missed management s previous guidance of 2 5 million adds so there were an unexpected 2 million accounts that chose to cancel their subscriptions losing members is problematic because it not only affects sales in the current quarter but in future periods as well the leadership team s long term pricing strategy however hasn t changed the objective is still to continue finding ways to add greater entertainment value while asking its customers to pay more over time but the company s latest struggles call into question a key part of netflix s thesis its pricing power warren buffett once said that pricing power is the most important determinant of a company s quality is netflix now a worse business than it was before is it time to sell netflix stock with the stock down 68 since the start of the year netflix s current price to earnings ratio of 17 makes shares appear cheap right now it s still the top streaming service by number of subscribers and this scale is a huge advantage when it comes to producing content but the u s market is starting to look saturated at the same time competition for consumers attention has never been higher regardless of the seemingly attractive stock price netflix s weakening competitive position led me to sell the stock whether this is a temporary blip on the company s radar or not remains to be seen for now i m staying on the sidelines
cannabis stocks were falling after some vague commentary out of senator chuck schumer s office on friday what happened cannabis stocks were falling more than the market on monday with u s multistate operators green thumb industries gtbif 1 96 curaleaf curlf and canadian operator hexo hexo falling as much as 7 5 4 6 and 4 9 before recovering to losses of 2 4 0 5 and 3 3 respectively on the day hexo has had its spate of operating difficulties over the recent past but nothing company specific today likely each stock fell as investors gravitated away from risky assets and growth stocks a catalyst for cannabis reform remains nowhere to be found with senator chuck schumer recently pushing back the time line for the introduction of his cannabis reform bill his chief counsel reginald babin gave very vague answers as to the path forward for reform at a cannabis event late last week which likely wasn t helping matters today so what at an event held for the council for federal cannabis regulation cfcr babin told the crowd there is a bit more work to be done in terms of figuring out where the sweet spot is at least in the senate in terms of what we can do this year unfortunately this seems like more delays for legislation which cannabis reform activists and investors had hoped would have been implemented by now while the house of representatives has passed cannabis legislation several times the path to legalization remains stuck in the senate this is because majority leader schumer who is writing the cannabis administration and opportunity act caoa reform bill with senators cory booker and ron wyden has intended to bring forth a full legalization bill however that bill may be too ambitious to get a filibuster proof majority while a vast majority of americans and many republicans are on board with reform and legalization it appears many from the republican side prefer a more incremental approach such as passing the safe banking act that act would stop short of federal legalization but would allow cannabis companies to work with national banks without having those banks and payments companies worried about legal issues that would help cannabis companies take more digital payments and not have to deal in cash it would also likely lead to better financing terms babin declined to give any more details at the event and it appears the senate leadership is still uncertain as to whether it can get the full legalization bill passed as schumer desires or whether it will settle for more incremental approaches babin elaborated in an oh so unsatisfying way it s too early to tell what the outcome is going to be given all the myriad factors that are going to come into play from now until whenever that bill hopefully is reported out of conference and voted on in the senate now what cannabis investors have been frustrated with the pace of reform 14 months after democrats took control of both the house and senate without meaningful reform cannabis companies in the u s will have to pay extremely high interest and tax rates and have to deal mostly in cash this prevents the vast majority of u s operators from producing generally accepted accounting principles gaap profits and cash flow even though many u s operators generate significant adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda margins with interest rates on the rise and inflation concerns investors are likely losing patience with legislation delays and are seeking safer stocks with lower price to earnings p e ratios that pay out dividends and share repurchases meanwhile hexo s problems in canada are likely souring investors on the space even more hexo has found it difficult to make profits in canada where cannabis is actually legal due to oversupply and competition in the market hexo is growing but it still is losing money on the bottom line and recently had to restructure some debt in order to avoid a default the troubles have led to massive asset impairment charges plant closings job cuts and both its ceo and cfo stepping down last week while the u s based companies operating in limited license states appear to be in much better financial condition the problems with canadian companies up north likely aren t helping investor sentiment either overall this looks to be a challenging macroeconomic period for cannabis companies which are seeing decelerating growth coming out of the pandemic and a market that is focused on profits rather than growth potential while that growth potential for the industry is enticing especially in the u s the near term may remain challenging for these companies and stocks

atlanta ap the state of georgia and local governments will give rivian automotive 1 5 billion of incentives to build a 7 500 job 5 billion electric vehicle plant east of atlanta according to documents the company and state signed monday georgia economic development commissioner pat wilson said the size of the package reflects the size of the largest single industrial announcement in georgia history including a pledge that the company will reach the full investment and job targets by the end of 2028 with jobs paying an average of 56 000 a year plus benefits the state also hopes rivian will anchor an entire electric vehicle industry it s absolutely appropriate because they re creating more jobs wilson said it is by far the largest incentive package georgia has ever offered to a company it s also the largest incentive package any american state has ever given to an auto plant said greg leroy executive director good jobs first a group skeptical of subsidies to private companies this is very significant leroy said it s the biggest auto assembly subsidy package in us history rivian based in irvine california is a startup manufacturer of electric trucks and commercial delivery vans challenging both established automakers like ford and general motors and electric vehicle leader tesla the company is already producing vehicles in normal illinois rivian hopes to break ground as early as this summer and begin production in 2024 sprinting toward producing 400 000 vehicles a year in georgia as electric vehicle makers try to gain market share the long term economic partnership promises to deliver value to rivian the people of georgia and their kids kids kids the company said in a statement the plant has been beset by fierce local opposition from residents who say development on the 2 000 acre 800 hectare site will spoil their rural quality of life the site between social circle and rutledge is about 45 miles 70 kilometers east of downtown atlanta the state took over planning and zoning for the project after opponents overwhelmed morgan county officials residents have voiced concerns about possible well water contamination light pollution and the disruption of wildlife and farmland wilson said a site plan and other documents released monday show rivian responding to those concerns shifting the plant away from wetlands and agreeing to limit light pollution opposition has become entangled in politics former u s sen david perdue who is challenging kemp in the may 24 republican primary lines up with opponents perdue has emphasized the role of liberal billionaire george soros although soros bought 2 billion worth of shares about the same time rivian chose georgia he owns only 2 of rivian there s no evidence soros influenced the plant location think about how many small businesses in georgia could be helped for this kind of money instead of padding george soros pockets perdue said monday kemp gave away the farm to a woke corporation for something the locals don t even want and hardworking georgians are left footing the bill kemp during a debate sunday reiterated his backing for rivian i support 7 500 great paying jobs going to rural georgia to an automobile manufacturing facility kemp said i m going to always be for that local governments have agreed to 700 million in property tax breaks although rivian plans to make more than 300 million in payments in lieu of taxes over 25 years beginning in 2023 the state would spend 200 million to buy the site grade it build road improvements including a new interstate 20 interchange and extend utilities georgia would spend 62 5 million to build a dedicated training center and a projected 27 million on providing job training other major benefits include a 200 million income tax credit at 5 250 per job over five years if rivian didn t owe that much state corporate income tax georgia would give personal income taxes collected from workers instead georgia also estimates sales tax exemptions will save rivian 175 million on machinery and 105 million on construction materials kia got more than 450 million in incentives for its plant in west point southwest of atlanta georgia has promised sk innovation 300 million in incentives for a 2 6 billion 2 600 worker battery plant northeast of atlanta wilson said the state has strong protections to claw its money back if rivian falls below 80 of promised investment or employment the state touts a 420 million annual payroll as well as an analysis showing there will be 8 000 more jobs created elsewhere in the state with a total impact of more than 7 billion but leroy said incentives will cost 200 000 per job and state and local governments will never collect enough increased taxes to cover that the state can never break even leroy said there s no way that the average worker in this place is going to pay 200 000 more in state and local taxes rivian currently plans two models for consumers the r1t pickup with a base price of 67 500 and the r1s suv with a base price of 70 000 amazon which owns 18 of rivian has ordered 100 000 delivery vans launching the company into commercial vehicles rivian is

more than four months after the usual publication date of december 31 iowa s annual comprehensive financial report acfr for the fiscal year that ended on june 30 2021 is nowhere in sight it s the second straight year that the detailed report on state finances is far behind schedule the acfr must be completed before many other annual audits of state government entities can be conducted for decades iowa routinely published the report within six months of the end of the previous fiscal year that time frame earned the state a certificate of achievement for excellence in financial reporting from the leading organization for government finance officers cause of delay still unclear the report for fiscal year 2020 was delayed for about nine months mostly because of accounting problems at iowa state university but the university told bleeding heartland in january that isu submitted all year end financials responded to audit questions and completed recommended changes for the final financial statements by nov 12 2021 that s only about six weeks after the deadline for most state government entities to send fiscal year end data to the iowa department of administrative services that agency has provided no details on what is holding up the acfr a letter posted in january to the country s leading source of information on municipal bonds said the state did not issue its annual report by the usual date due to circumstances associated with the covid 19 pandemic department of administrative services communications staffer tami wiencek has not responded to several attempts to clarify how the pandemic might interfere with compiling a financial report she told bleeding heartland in early april the annual comprehensive financial report for fy2021 is in progress and due to be out in or around june speaking on behalf of the state auditor s office sonya heitsuhen confirmed in march that state auditors have not received all of the data necessary to complete the acfr in april heitsuhen described the report as a continuous process and in a may 2 email she commented we continue to review supporting information as it is made available and will issue an opinion when the department of administrative services and state auditors complete the work most state government agencies are scheduled to switch to the workday computer system for finances soon after fiscal year 2023 begins on july 1 isu s shift to workday for accounting in 2019 caused many problems compiling year end financial data the following year the university and state auditors later acknowledged report officially renamed a bill changing the name of this document from comprehensive annual financial report to annual comprehensive financial report has just become law the governmental accounting standards board has recommended that state and local governments rename such documents for all fiscal years ending after december 15 2021 on the grounds that the acronym for the previous name sounded like a profoundly offensive term directed at black south africans when spoken out loud the iowa house unanimously approved house file 2126 in february and the state senate passed the bill unanimously march 23 during the brief legislative debates floor managers did not explain why the national standards board has called for the name change like dozens of bills passed this year house file 2126 was not promptly sent to governor kim reynolds office legislative leaders enrolled and forwarded the bill on may 2 it was among 26 bills the governor signed later the same day top image screenshot of graphic from page 26 of the state s annual financial report for fiscal year 2020
analysts are worried the road gets rocky from here what happened in april united parcel service ups 0 04 reported quarterly results that came in much better than what analysts had expected but that was not enough to get investors on board shares of ups lost 16 1 during the month according to data from s p global market intelligence on fears that a slowing macro environment would eat into shipping demand in the second half of the year so what long before ups s april 26 earnings report wall street was getting nervous about the shares transportation stocks tend to be cyclical doing best when the economy is strong a combination of higher energy costs which mean higher expenses at ups and could lead to a slowdown in economic activity coupled with concerns the federal reserve would try to muzzle the economy to keep inflation tame had investors on the defensive when it comes to ups ups was the target of downgrades from wolfe research and banc of america securities early in the month with wolfe analyst scott group warning that after nearly two years as one of the best performing stocks in the transportation sector ups momentum appears to be slowing j p morgan followed with a price target cut on what analyst brian ossenbeck described as a trucking market that rapidly deteriorated in late march the company s earnings showed little sign of operational stress ups earned 3 05 per share in the first quarter on revenue of 24 4 billion surpassing analyst expectations for 2 88 per share in earnings on sales of 23 79 billion ups also backed its full year estimate for 102 billion in revenue slightly below the consensus estimate after the results were released at least a half dozen wall street banks lowered their price targets for ups shares with analysts warning of increasing macro risks in the quarters ahead because of inflation fears and high energy prices now what there s nothing wrong with ups but there is also only so much the company can do in the face of macroeconomic headwinds if soaring commodity prices and the fed s inflation battle does slow the economy in the quarters to come that is likely to translate into weaker demand for transportation and shipping regardless of what ups is able to do from an operations standpoint ups is a longtime winner and appears well positioned to continue to benefit from the shift toward e commerce and other business trends that should support shipping demand the next few quarters might be murky but for investors able to focus on the coming years and not just the next quarter any weakness from here could be an attractive buying opportunity

the cost of diesel has risen to its highest point since 2008 causing jet fuel prices to also climb to stifling heights one expert says things might stay that way long enough to affect summer travel plans that s a proposition that general and business aviation pilots and operators might not be fond of in a recent update freightwaves editor at large john kingston a prominent voice in the energy sector pointed out that according to the department of energy s energy information administration eia retail gasoline is up 26 percent from the start of the year but diesel is up 42 8 percent in fact he estimates that the price spread might stay that way the real reason diesel is so expensive during an interview with flying on monday kingston explained why there has been such a short supply of diesel fuel and why demand has skyrocketed and it s not exactly what you d expect at the beginning of 2020 the world s marine fuels were required to be much lower in sulfur the problem for the diesel market then was that fuel refiners were now going to use some of the molecules from the middle of that barrel that is used to produce diesel and move them into the marine market kingston explained in other words the international maritime organization imo 2020 mandate went into effect and the demand for the type of crude oil that makes diesel and jet fuel increased significantly to supply the maritime market while the world was able to keep up with demand for russia s contribution the recent sanctions against them are leading to a drought in the oil supply leading to scary fuel prices for pilots kingston also said that the u s inventory isn t enough to keep up with demand he explained that at the peak of the pandemic in the spring and early summer of 2020 there was enough oil inventory to last 50 days and as much as 70 days that s because travel came to a halt most recently they re down to 29 days they ve been as low as 26 7 days kingston explained adding that normally pre pandemic it was normal to have enough for as much as 39 days so you can see we re pretty tight this along with inflation explains why seats on all types of aircraft are more expensive but even as operators would love to capture higher ticket price margins the fact that jet fuel is 30 percent of an airline s bill means that covering that cost is still difficult the pinch on general and business aviation since the march peak the market has barely cooled as of monday according to airnav which regularly collects fuel data across 3 642 fixed based operators fbos nationwide on average operators will have to pay 6 32 for jet a on the high end they might have to fork out 12 88 that s a 140 percent price premium year over year fbos 100 ll avgas fbos 100 ll avgas avg 100 ll avgas min 100 ll avgas max jet

business aviation operators kingston paints a starker reality if you hear that the price of crude oil or gasoline dropped by a certain amount you can operate on the assumption that the price of diesel didn t drop as much likewise if you hear that the price of crude oil and gasoline went up by a certain amount you can assume that the price of diesel went up even higher looking ahead the u s energy information administration in its summer fuel outlook predicted that retail diesel prices for the summer would average 4 57 per gallon that would be the highest inflation adjusted price for a summer since 2014 we expect higher fuel prices this summer due to higher crude oil prices crude oil prices have generally risen since the start of the year partly due to geopolitical developments particularly russia s war against ukraine the administration said we expect u s economic activity to increase through the summer resulting in more demand for petroleum fuels greater demand will contribute to higher crude oil prices and we expect brent crude oil will average 106 per barrel this summer which would be 35 per barrel higher than last summer even if travelers can avoid the higher prices the air cargo market and customers who shop online might experience higher shipping costs as those carriers also look to offset expenses for instance for the first time in history amazon added a 5 percent fuel and inflation surcharge to partners that use its fulfillment centers how the airlines are affected alaska airlines nyse alk is one of those airlines having to take measures to deal with the changing landscape in march the airline trimmed 5 percent of its flying schedule citing the sharp rise in fuel costs in an sec filing given the sharp rise in fuel costs we have slightly moderated our capacity outlook for the year and now expect capacity to be down three percent to five percent in the first half of the year we continue to plan for a return to 100 of pre covid capacity by summer followed by growth in the second half of the year and will continue to prudently adjust capacity as necessary in response to the evolving fuel environment the airline said in the same breath low cost carrier allegiant airlines nasdaq algt also said it planned to shrink its capacity by as much as 10 percent in the second quarter for similar reasons at that time spot jet fuel prices in new york harbor were 4 06 a gallon a far cry from the 2 50 just two months prior in january in a later update allegiant said the 3 46 per gallon it paid for fuel in march cost an additional 22 million to its operation however it would still fulfill its profit sharing reward to employees despite the squeeze some airlines like delta air lines nyse dal united nasdaq ual and american nasdaq aal have decided not to hedge their fuel prices after the market bottomed out in 2020 but instead follow market prices the only major airline sticking to its hedging ways is southwest airlines which reported that its contract a 61 cent per gallon saving or a 26 million discount would protect it against surging prices in the second quarter

driven by strong performance from our leading electricity segment and strategic capacity additions said doron blachar ormat s chief executive officer we are encouraged by the company s ability to continue driving solid operating performance as we delivered strong quarterly net income and adjusted ebitda1 along with meaningful year over year growth in revenues overall growth in the first quarter was driven by the mcginness hills enhancement the increased capacity at puna and the addition of the dixie valley and beowawe power plants to our asset portfolio blachar added this quarter we demonstrated marked advancement towards many of our stated targets laid out in ormat s recent investor day we continue to make progress executing effectively against our growth plans in both our

and recent business highlights net income attributable to the company s stockholders and diluted eps for the first quarter of 2022 increased 20 8 and 22 2 respectively versus the prior year period the increase was mainly due to the increased contribution of our electricity segment in addition in the first quarter of 2021 the company was negatively impacted by the february power crisis in texas that

eps for the first quarter of 2022 decreased 17 5 and 17 0 respectively versus the prior year period the decrease was mainly due to higher interest expenses related to the terragen acquisition and a higher tax rate adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2022 was 107 9 million an increase of 8 7 compared to 99 2 million in 2021 supported by growth in the electricity segment electricity segment revenues increased 12 1 for the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021 supported by contributions from the acquired terragen geothermal assets in q3 2021 the mcginness hills expansion and the recovery of the puna power plant partially offset by the shutdown of the heber 1 power plant following a fire that caused damage to the steam turbine in late february product segment revenues increased 69 2 to 14 6 million the sales growth attributed to a higher backlog compared to the same period last year product segment backlog stands at 45 7 million as of may 2 2022 energy storage segment revenues decreased 48 5 to 6 6 million primarily due to the absence of a one time revenue of 5 4 million in the first quarter of 2021 related to the february power crisis in texas generation in the first quarter of 2022 was 1 82 million mwh an increase of 8 6 compared to 1 68 million mwh in the first quarter of 2021 in addition the company successfully began commercial operation of the tungsten 2

board unanimously determined jetblue proposal does not constitute a superior proposal company intends to continue advancing toward completion of transaction with frontier airlines spirit airlines inc spirit or the company nyse save today announced that its board of directors the board in consultation with outside financial and legal advisors has unanimously determined that the unsolicited proposal received from jetblue airways jetblue nasdaq jblu does not constitute a superior proposal as defined in spirit s merger agreement with frontier group holdings inc frontier nasdaq ulcc parent company of frontier airlines inc because it has determined that the proposed transaction is not reasonably capable of being consummated the board continues to believe that the pending transaction with frontier represents the best opportunity to maximize value and recommends that spirit shareholders adopt the merger agreement with frontier spirit s board of directors also issued the following letter to jetblue spirit continues to believe in the strategic rationale of the proposed merger with frontier and is confident that it represents the best opportunity to maximize long term shareholder value said mac gardner chairman of board of directors for spirit airlines after a thorough review and extensive dialogue with jetblue the board determined that the jetblue proposal involves an unacceptable level of closing risk that would be assumed by spirit stockholders we believe that our pending merger with frontier will start an exciting new chapter for spirit and will deliver many benefits to spirit shareholders team members and guests as previously announced on february 7 2022 spirit entered into a merger agreement with frontier under which spirit and frontier would combine in a stock and cash transaction under the terms of the merger agreement spirit equity holders would receive 1 9126 shares of frontier plus 2 13 in cash for each existing spirit share they own the company will continue to advance toward completing the transaction with frontier which is expected to close in the second half of 2022 the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including completion of the ongoing regulatory review process and approval by spirit stockholders the full text of the letter follows may 2 2022 robin hayes chief executive officer jetblue airways corporation 27 01 queens plaza north long island city ny 11101 dear mr hayes we have reviewed jetblue s updated proposal dated april 29 2022 with spirit s board of directors and its legal and financial advisors our board has unanimously determined that jetblue s proposal does not constitute a superior proposal under spirit s existing merger agreement with frontier as you know a superior proposal under the frontier agreement must among other requirements be reasonably capable of being consummated spirit s board believes jetblue s proposal falls short of that standard our conclusion is based on careful analysis of the competitive implications of a combination of jetblue which analysis has been informed by extensive discussions between our respective antitrust advisors and economic consultants over the past four weeks during that period spirit has also discussed projections with your financial advisers and provided voluminous documentary due diligence material through a secure virtual data room we believe a combination of jetblue and spirit has a low probability of receiving antitrust clearance so long as jetblue s northeast alliance nea with american airlines remains in existence the u s department of justice doj along with attorneys general in six states and the district of columbia have sued to block the nea alleging that the alliance will not only eliminate important competition in but will also harm air travelers across the country by significantly diminishing jetblue s incentive to compete with american elsewhere further consolidating an already highly concentrated industry 1 as you know spirit and many other airline and air travel constituencies have publicly opposed the nea on grounds that it is anticompetitive we struggle to understand how jetblue can believe doj or a court will be persuaded that jetblue should be allowed to form an anticompetitive alliance that aligns its interests with a legacy carrier and then undertake an acquisition that will eliminate the largest ulcc carrier we further believe that your divestiture proposal is unlikely to resolve doj s concerns about a combination of spirit and jetblue if the nea continues in existence doj clearly views the nea as having a broader national effect and spirit believes doj will not place great weight on your proposed remedy especially because there are reasons to doubt the efficacy of similar divestitures as a remedy in past airline mergers moreover in evaluating a jetblue spirit combination spirit believes doj and a court will be very concerned that a higher cost higher fare airline would be eliminating a lower cost lower fare airline in a combination that would remove about half of the ulcc capacity in the united states in addition the conversion of spirit aircraft to jetblue configuration will result in significantly diminished capacity on former spirit routes also resulting in higher prices for consumers finally we are skeptical about your claims regarding the so called jetblue effect after receiving the summary output of your economic model from your advisers spirit s economic consultants identified reasons to doubt that such an effect would significantly exceed any similar ulcc effect in contrast spirit believes that merging with frontier will enable the combined ulcc business to achieve scale improve operational reliability have increased relevance to consumers and do an even better job of delivering ultra low fares to more consumers and competing more effectively against the big 4 carriers as well as against jetblue we believe that is a clear pro consumer narrative that will resonate more successfully with doj than a combination with jetblue which would eliminate the largest ulcc and remove significant low cost low fare capacity spirit took note of the fact that the jetblue proposal allocates most of the very substantial deal completion risk to spirit stockholders to reduce that risk and achieve a more appropriate balance of the risk between our companies in our april 25 response spirit proposed a strong covenant requiring jetblue to take any action required to obtain regulatory clearance which specifically included abandoning the nea at closing we also proposed a substantial reverse termination fee intended to partially compensate spirit if the transaction failed to win antitrust clearance on that score in the event of a failure or abandonment of a jetblue spirit combination even a high reverse termination fee will not fully compensate spirit stockholders for the likely significant business erosion spirit will face during what will be a protracted approval process spirit does not consider jetblue s april 29 response to be appropriately responsive to spirit s concerns indeed that response makes clear that jetblue is unwilling to terminate the nea or to agree to any other remedies that might materially decrease the expected benefits to jetblue from the nea to obtain clearance for an acquisition of spirit the transaction you describe in your april 29 response not only fails to meet the required standard under the frontier merger agreement but by prioritizing the nea over the steps we believe would be necessary to have any realistic likelihood of obtaining antitrust clearance it imposes on our stockholders a degree of risk that no responsible board would accept given this substantial completion risk we believe jetblue s economic offer is illusory and spirit s board has not found it necessary to consider it very truly yours h mcintyre gardner chairman of the board edward m christie iii chief

listen to this article listen to this article kim shanahan has seen an increase in prices nearly across the board at gifts fulfilled her berlin gift basket business fuel packaging cardboard and shipping all on the rise to keep up shanahan has had to raise her prices it is like when you buy a house and you have to sink 15 000 into wiring she said you don t get to see anything pretty out of that that is our situation the costs are all up on this back end and there is nothing the customer sees that is different other than a rise in price shanahan who said her sales were down in the first quarter has noticed certain spending trends among customers the customer that maybe would have bought the 25 product which is now 27 50 they are just not even buying shanahan said they are squeezed they are like i don t have discretionary income right now so they are not buying and then the customer that maybe would have bought the 35 to 50 gift they are like well i will buy the 27 gift for months small businesses like shanahan s in maryland and across the country have had to grapple with pandemic induced supply chain problems or worker shortages now they are confronting a new nemesis inflation recently 10 000 small businesses voices a goldman sachs initiative to help small business owners advocate for policy changes released the results of a member survey just over 90 of small business owners said broad economic trends such as supply chain issues inflation and workforce shortages were hurting their companies nearly 75 reported a negative impact on their bottom line due to increased energy costs the survey report noted that 56 of small business owners believe the economy has worsened since january with 88 stating that inflationary pressures have increased eighty percent said supply chain challenges have worsened or remained the same while 88 said hiring challenges stayed the same or worsened eighty percent of small business owners surveyed saw their business financial health negatively affected by inflation over the last six months with 67 of that group reporting that they increased wages to retain employees and 61 saying they raised wages to attract new employees to pay for these increases 60 of the businesses raised the price of their goods and services many of the actual baskets gifts fulfilled uses are made in china shanahan said adding that suppliers are tacking on a fuel surcharge and a new import fee i feel like i spend all of my time lately just readjusting products shanahan said i am trying to figure out how do i still make this work and stay in the same price point for the customers her inflation concerns come on the heels of supply chain problems one of the bestselling products at gifts fulfilled is the one tough cookie get well gift package a cornucopia of sweet snacks plus a balloon that looks like a chocolate chip cookie wearing a band aid due to supply chain issues the cookie balloon was out of stock for nearly a year so gifts fulfilled had to use a smiley face balloon instead the message isn t quite as strong with a different balloon and we saw sales of that go down like 30 just because we had to substitute the one item owner kim shanahan said the cookie balloon recently came back in stock so shanahan and her staff have been making more get well packages but the episode left shanahan wondering if she should stockpile the cookie balloons against another shortage she recently received a covid 19 economic injury disaster loan from the u s small business administration that has provided a cushion and allowed her to make decisions about inventory and cash flow shanahan also had supply chain problems involving holiday inventory many of the items she ordered for the 2021 season did not come in until january you have a cash outlay for products that now you are going to have to carry until next season shanahan said as a small business i don t have the cash flow to carry inventory for a full year but you had no choice then you also had to buy packaging for 2021 christmas to make up for the packaging you didn t get in so you had a double outlay of cash and for small businesses that is really hard to handle shanahan said she refused to go into credit card debt to pay the bills and here s where inflation kicks in to provide a double whammy i don t want to go down that road especially since interest rates are rising she said i can imagine credit card interest rates are going to be hitting 25 30 and that is not a debt load small businesses can afford to carry on the bright side shanahan said she has had no trouble finding employees and even has a waitlist of potential workers gifts fulfilled employs people with disabilities shanahan said her biggest cause of worry is uncertainty will inflation or fuel costs rise even more will supply chain issues improve is the country headed for a recession similar to the one in 2008 it s like it can t get worse and you are like yes it can shanahan said we are just surviving right now just trying to get through all this

by adding clear divestiture commitments and a reverse break up fee to its previous all cash offer jetblue offers more value and certainty to spirit shareholders than the frontier transaction travelers shouldn t have to choose between a low fare and a great experience jetblue effect is more effective than ultra low cost carriers in bringing down legacy carrier fares jetblue nasdaq jblu today announced it has enhanced its proposal to the board of directors of spirit nyse save to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of spirit for 33 cash per share the enhanced proposal offers spirit shareholders both superior financial value and greater certainty than the frontier transaction divestiture commitment if necessary jetblue would agree to divest assets of jetblue and spirit up to a material adverse effect on spirit with a limited carve out for actions that would adversely impact jetblue s northeast alliance nea with american airlines remedy package to address nea and regulatory concerns jetblue would offer a remedy package that includes the divestiture of all spirit assets in new york and boston so that jetblue does not increase its presence in the airports covered by the nea the package would also include gates and assets at other airports including fort lauderdale reverse break up fee jetblue would provide for a 200 million reverse break up fee representing approximately 1 80 per spirit share that would become payable to spirit in the unlikely event the jetblue transaction is not consummated for antitrust reasons superior all cash premium jetblue s proposal continues to offer spirit shareholders 33 in cash per common share a 47 premium to the value of the frontier transaction as of april 29 2022 a and a 52 premium to spirit s share price as of february 4 2022 b the last trading day prior to the spirit frontier announcement by creating a national competitor to the big four airlines this transaction would deliver meaningful benefits for customers superior value for shareholders of both airlines and new opportunities for our combined crewmembers said robin hayes chief executive officer jetblue we have confidence that we can complete this transaction to bring more low fares and great service to more customers a jetblue spirit combination will deliver enhanced financial strength and accelerate revenue growth and profitability for jetblue shareholders the regulatory commitments in jetblue s enhanced offer represent a significant improvement compared to those offered by frontier the revised offer comes after spirit limited jetblue s access to important due diligence data yet requested unprecedented commitments from jetblue that far exceed those in prior airline transactions spirit shareholders would be better off with the certainty of our substantial cash premium regulatory commitments and reverse break up fee protection hayes said the frontier transaction has a similar regulatory profile to ours but offers no divestiture commitment and no reverse break up fee while the uncertain value of frontier s stock exposes spirit shareholders to significant risk we hope the spirit board will now recognize that ours is clearly a superior proposal and engage with us more constructively than they have to date we are making our offer public so their shareholders are aware this attractive value creating opportunity is available to them spirit shareholders will assume a number of risks if the frontier transaction moves forward frontier is not required to undertake any divestitures to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to close its transaction despite having greater overlap with spirit on nonstop routes than jetblue does among other regulatory hurdles frontier is not required to pay a reverse break up fee if the transaction is not consummated for antitrust reasons even though the frontier transaction has a similar regulatory profile as the proposed transaction with jetblue the value of frontier s stock the basis for the transaction s value to spirit shareholders is subject to significant risks and has already declined approximately 14 since frontier s offer was announced specifically the value of frontier s stock declined from 12 39 on february 4 2022 to 10 61on april 29 2022 which translated into a deterioration of the value of the frontier transaction of 3 41 per spirit share or approximately 370 million the financial projections underpinning the transaction with frontier are based on unrealistically optimistic assumptions especially with respect to costs associated with personnel attrition and wage inflation their model does not consider any wage increases for team members including pilots at a time of high attrition and an anticipated shortage of pilots jetblue effect 3x greater than ulccs similar regulatory profile to frontier a combined jetblue spirit will create a more compelling national low fare competitor to challenge the big four airlines that control more than 80 of the u s market when jetblue introduces its unique combination of low fares and award winning service onto new routes legacy carriers lower their fares and customers win with more choice with its positive effect on competition and backed by its regulatory commitments jetblue has a high degree of confidence in its ability to achieve regulatory approval of its acquisition of spirit jetblue s entry into new nonstop routes triggers fare decreases from legacy airlines that are more significant than those resulting from ultra low cost carriers ulccs approximately 16 or three times the result of ulccs on legacy nonstop routes known as the jetblue effect the faster expansion of jetblue and the jetblue effect coupled with a proposed remedy package and the continued expansion of other ulccs will address regulatory concerns that spirit the regulators or the courts may have both transactions would result in companies of similar size creating the no 5 u s airline jetblue spirit would have a 9 market share based on full year 2022 seats compared to 8 for a combined frontier spirit contrary to common misperceptions jetblue has significantly less overlap with spirit in terms of flights seats and asms than frontier in the metropolitan areas served by both c jetblue overlaps with spirit only on 48 nonstop routes compared to spirit and frontier s overlap on 76 nonstop routes d the nea which jetblue strongly believes will be allowed to continue because the alliance is delivering the customer benefits promised is not a factor in this transaction given the remedy package jetblue s analysis finds that the presence of the nea would have no meaningful economic effect in a jetblue spirit transaction customers shouldn t have to choose between a low fare and a great experience and with jetblue it s possible for customers to have both hayes said both the nea and the proposed spirit transaction are strategic actions that accelerate our existing growth plan and bring the jetblue effect to more customers in the northeast florida and around the country by bringing together the power of the jetblue and spirit teams this combination would strengthen jetblue s ability to grow deliver outstanding service and compete in a domestic market dominated by the four largest airlines we look forward to delivering these benefits to all stakeholders once spirit determines our proposal to be superior and we close the transaction supporting information jetblue has posted updated slides for investors on its investor relations website at the following web address advisors goldman sachs co llc is serving as jetblue s financial advisor and shearman sterling llp is serving as jetblue s legal advisor a represents premium over the value of

mr hacker sent directly to jonathan duskin ceo of macellum on april 29 2022 from douglas hacker sent friday april 29 2022 4 46 pm to jonathan duskin cc tony sarsam aaron goldstein subject macellum update call hi jonathan thank you for your note the spartannash board takes its fiduciary responsibilities very seriously as we have stated publicly we are open to hearing any ideas from any source that would be beneficial to our shareholders if you have had conversations with credible parties that would be interested in a transaction we encourage you to have them reach out to us directly as would be typical for the situation i can assure you that the board will act promptly and appropriately to assess the attractiveness and credibility of any such outreach if you have other pertinent details regarding these conversations please let us know best regards doug although it is our policy not to comment on market rumors or speculation we feel it is important to set the record straight to be clear since we began engaging with macellum in 2021 spartannash has not received any offers to buy the company nor has it been approached directly by any strategic or financial buyer to acquire the company the spartannash board remains open minded and receptive to constructive ideas from any source that will drive shareholder value and the board is not opposed to any credible value enhancing idea in fact the experience of the board in past roles shows how we have overseen value creation at other companies through transactions when they were credible and appropriate today s press release from the investor group referencing leaks to the media and their previous claims to have received unsolicited communications from strategic buyers interested in a transaction is just another part of their recycled playbook that they have attempted to use at apparel discount and department store retailers furthermore the investor group s sudden interest in aligning on a settlement appears to be more tactical than it is genuine given they did not respond to the email from our chair of the board before they issued their press release this morning as we have previously noted spartannash has attempted to reach a constructive resolution with macellum on multiple occasions and our offers were rejected outright the spartannash board is committed to acting in the best interests of all

frontier s bid was more than half a billion dollars lower than jetblue s but spirit said it was more likely to get regulatory approval example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video new york spirit airlines said monday that it still supports frontier airlines 2 9 billion takeover bid for the airline saying it was more likely to win regulatory approval than jetblue s competing 3 6 billion offer spirit said antitrust regulators are unlikely to approve jetblue s offer because of jetblue s alliance with american airlines in the northeast a deal that the justice department is suing to block we struggle to understand how jetblue can believe that the justice department or a court would let jetblue strike a deal with american then buy spirit eliminating the nation s largest low cost airline the spirit board said in a letter to jetblue directors jetblue rejected spirit s view especially after promising last week to make concessions designed to assure regulatory approval of its offer jetblue s ceo seemed to raise the possibility of a hostile takeover bid shares of miramar florida based spirit sank more than 8 in afternoon trading new york based jetblue s stock gained 1 while shares of denver based frontier fell 4 the development was a reversal from last month when spirit said that after speaking with financial and legal advisers its directors believed jetblue s offer could reasonably turn out to be the better of the two deals spirit said its board continues to back the bid made by frontier in february and views it as the best way to maximize value the airline anticipates a deal with frontier closing in the second half of the year the jetblue american cooperative venture in boston and new york called the northeast alliance or nea was opposed by spirit and other competitors long before frontier s february bid to buy spirit jetblue tried to satisfy regulatory concerns by offering to divest spirit s airport gates and takeoff and landing slots in new york and boston and maybe in fort lauderdale florida however spirit s board said monday that the revised offer is unlikely to appease regulators because the revised offer still makes clear that jetblue is unwilling to terminate the partnership with american a spirit frontier merger would combine the nation s two largest budget airlines and create the no 5 u s carrier while spirit and frontier are similar ultra low cost carriers jetblue operates on a business model that is more like the big four american delta united and southwest jetblue would absorb spirit and eliminate a budget airline that regulators believe helps keep ticket prices lower jetblue on monday repeated the argument that its offer is better for spirit shareholders it would pay them 33 per share in cash compared with frontier s cash and stock offer worth 22 42 per share and jetblue s offer was sweetened to include a 200 million break up fee if the deal falters we hope the spirit board will now recognize that ours is clearly a superior proposal and engage with us more constructively than they have to date said jetblue ceo robin hayes hayes was far more blunt even threatening throughout a five page letter last week to spirit chairman mac gardner and ceo ted christie hayes wrote that his airline s divestment promises should comfort spirit leadership about jetblue s ability to win antitrust approval while we would unquestionably prefer to negotiate a transaction with you if you continue to refuse to constructively engage with us so that we can deliver this value to your stockholders we are actively considering all other options available to us hayes wrote frontier ceo barry biffle said last week that regulatory review of a frontier spirit combination is already well underway and many months ahead of any alternative

cd reviews craftsmanship bob dubery johannesburg south africa 03 10 2004 4 out of 5 stars that s what s missing in so much mass market pop music these days well here s an antidote this album is rich with superb craftsmanship elegant harmonies real instruments acoustic guitars fiddles accordions lovely songs that whilst recently written have a timeless quality oh and let s not forget the return of a great voice after a long silence literally linda thompson has returned and she has lost nothing as a singer and reveals herself here as a fine composer call it fashionably timeless james carragher new york 05 24 2005 4 out of 5 stars seventeen years of recorded silence but when it was broken in fashionably late time linda thompson s return could just as well have come one year after one clear moment and timeless is a good thing her voice whatever it went through in the interim rings rich and unscathed although she wrote or co wrote nine of the ten songs they sound decades or centuries old recalling fairport convention and steeleye span in their primes or reaching even further back the childe ballads that joan baez sang in her very early albums count on mayhem and dissolution aplenty a lover gorily murdered nine stone rig a worn out whore on the banks of the clyde and gothic secrets miss murray a fairly stock i never should have married lament surprises with a couple of humorous twists weary life a little less general bleakness would have been welcome as in my favorite cut no telling where two people unexpectedly revive each other s glow for life evona darling is another highlight as linda trades verses with her son teddy dear mary gets ex husband richard in the mix with some great guitar and an irresistible chorus it s the second best song on the album the weakest is paint and powder beauty a dragging six minute dirge of a prostitute way past her prime but then to close comes the intriguing dear old man of mine a weary all scores settled valentine to a past love can there be any doubt who it s about no fairport neil bostock middletown ny united states 02 12 2004 5 out of 5 stars just as a correction to the previous posting linda thompson never sang with fairport convention but started her career with husband richard doesn t diminish her brilliance but for the sake of accuracy a true love comes lee armstrong winterville nc united states 04 07 2007 4 out of 5 stars keeping in the spirit of the title of this cd i picked it up 5 years after its release wow what a wonderful gem this is teddy thompson s excellent separate ways cd that has a quite a different sound from this traditional folk reminded me of this disc in fact teddy s lovely voice duets exquisitely with his mother the opener dear mary is a charmer with richard teddy kamila thompson creating a joyful sonic background oh mary you may have to run you may have to be on your way consider the things that you ve done you may have to run kate rusby s harmony vocals richard greene s fiddle van dyke parks accordion sparkle on miss murray a sad folk ballad she loved one man one man alone a true love comes once it s gone nine stone rig recorded in asheville north carolina is a bloody traditional ballad that was given to sir walter scott that linda s mournful vocal suits wonderfully they shot him dead at the nine stone rig beside the headless cross left him lying in his blood upon the morning moss no telling has a lovely melody that with kate rusby s beautiful supporting vocal makes this a slow charmer lal waterson s evona darling with son teddy s vocals is a lovely blend time has come for him to belong to someone time will come when you will too when we were courting you swooned down at my feet but now that we re wed i can t get you up off your feet mary sings in the humorous weary life linda wrote paint powder beauty with rufus wainwright that has his orchestral flourishes you re drowning in kisses feeding on danger not forever it s just for a while the set concludes with the somber dear old man of mine linda s voice is expressive emotionally laden on this fine disc enjoy my best guess on the lyric like mum like son john buckingham worcester ma usa 07 06 2007 4 out of 5 stars i first discovered teddy thompson s music via his terrific separate ways ablum which remains one of my all time favorites along with jeffrey foucault s miles from the lightning and stripping cane the younger thompson s songwriting with his biting lyrics got extra punch because of his truly remarkable voice alternately heartbreakingly and mournfully lovely as on the title track or rocked out as on you made it backpedaling i bought his mum s fashionably late largely because of the teddy s considerable participation at first listen i was somewhat disappointed linda s voice though rich and mature lacked the range of her son s plaintive tenor repeated playings though showed that ms thompson had strengths of her own that serve her well especially on such melancholy songs as paint powder beauty the ablum s standout and dear old man of mine her rendition of teddy s all i see however comes up far short compared to his own recording of it from his self titled 2000 debut cd other strongpoints on fashionably late dear mary the bouncy thompson family reunion of sorts and the sweet evona darling feature harmonious vocal intertwinings of ms thompson and her gifted son considering ms thompson s long bout of hysterical dysphonia a form of stagefright which made singing all but impossible for her fashionably late marks an impressive return to performing not to mention a wonderful chance to hear genetics in action
commuting is literally the worst a recent study by economist daniel kahneman revealed that driving to work is the activity we rate as the least enjoyable it s worse than housework answering emails and actually working long commutes destroy marriages wreck minds and shorten lives commuting can even make you fat because your rotten parents didn t earn enough money for you to be independently wealthy you may have to accept the grinding nightmare of commuting but you can make this terrible thing slightly better if you avoid the worse mistakes commuters make advertisement taking the wrong form of transportation photo connel shutterstock around 86 of americans workers commute to and from work via their own car but research shows that people tend to be happier with their daily trip to the office if they walk take a bicycle or ride a train the bottom line changing the way you get to work could alter your entire outlook if you have different options and i realise a lot of people don t in our car crazy nation you should give each one a try maybe you ll find you love starting the day off with a bracing mid winter bike ride instead of an hour of gridlocked traffic trying to be productive photo peeradontax shutterstock almost half of workers worldwide report having used their commute to do work junk like answering emails or returning phone calls while a lot of people encourage employees to use their commute to do high level strategy work and other free labour it s probably a better idea to listen to music or read a comic book commutes stress people out and work done under stress tends to be shoddy any small benefit that a company could gain from a grey collar worker responding to emails on the bus is likely to be overshadowed by the overall drop in productivity correlated with commuting plus watching someone clack away on a laptop on a rush hour subway car is annoying to the rest of us and it s not like you re being paid for this time anyway being too isolated and antisocial photo andrey_popov shutterstock the stock photo above is entitled happy portrait of smiling multi racial friends sitting inside car but it could be called a freeze frame of stephen johnson s worst nightmare look at their dead eyes and their shiny white teeth but i m going to put my overwhelming disdain for others aside and point out that research shows that people who carpool to work enjoy it more than people who drive alone advertisement another research supported conclusion that is contrary to everything i have ever known or experienced talking to strangers on public transportation tend to make people enjoy their commute more most participants in this study went into it believing that they would have happier commutes if they kept to themselves but ultimately reported better commutes if they spoke to other people on the way not taking traffic into account photo aerovista luchtfotografie shutterstock a long commute is a nightmare in the best of circumstances but it s worse when you re stuck in traffic anyone who has ever driven in a big city can attest to this fact but it s also backed up by science research indicates that a traffic filled commute is more likely to raise people s stress levels and blood pressure than a commute of the same length of time with less traffic so it makes sense to do everything you can to miss the rush even if you re waking up earlier leaving work later or taking longer but less congested routes dangerous driving photo pilotsevas shutterstock maybe it the familiarity of the route the early hour of the drive or the sheer maddening monotony of the entire endeavour but driving to work is dangerous people who drive for work have around 50 more crashes than people who don t texting emailing shaving while driving is obviously dangerous but so is aggressive road rage style driving if you re a behind the wheel hothead experts recommend not engaging with other drivers don t tailgate or flip anyone off no matter how much you want to giving yourself extra time to get to your destination and trying to remember that the other drivers are people like you having a bad attitude photo chinnapong shutterstock commuting is a nightmare but consciously dreading it and hating every second of it will only make it worse experts recommend trying to not think of your commute as a challenge or obstacle but rather consider it a transition period between your personal and professional lives rather than bleakly staring ahead at the endless brake lights project yourself forward by mentally planning your day or planning further ahead into your career you could try car yoga try to practice car mindfulness or listen to podcasts about true crime anything that keeps you from ruminating about the banal horror of this aspect of modern life is good advertisement not trying to get out of commuting photo sharomka shutterstock you don t necessarily have to commute to work in the u s 45 of full time employees worked from home all 25 or part of the time 20 last summer and fall if it s possible to do your job remotely talk to the powers that be at your job and make a case for why you shouldn t have to come in as in all employment discussions don t make the benefits you will receive the main thrust of the conversation instead point out that telecommuting increases productivity reduces costs for employers and encourages employee retention bosses like that kind of talk present a thought out plan and try to anticipate and answer any objections before they re made if not coming into the office full time is a no go suggest partial work from home or working non traditional hours to avoid the worst commuting nightmares

the market may be in the early innings of a dramatic decline despite monday s tech comeback money manager dan suzuki of richard bernstein advisors warns the group is in a bubble go back and look at the history of bubbles they don t softly correct and then are off to the races six months later you typically see a major correction you know 50 or more and typically it comes with an overshoot the firm s deputy chief investment officer told cnbc s fast money feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here suzuki suggests the stakes are high this week with the federal reserve set for a two day policy meeting wall street consensus expects a half point hike on wednesday the biggest wildcard according to suzuki will be guidance there s probably a lot more downside to go said suzuki who s also a former bank of america merrill lynch market strategist information technology communication services and consumer discretionary alone make up about half of the market cap of the s p 500 suzuki and his firm made the tech bubble call late last june the forecast is built on the notion a rising interest environment will hurt growth stocks particularly technology meanwhile the nasdaq is coming off its worst month since 2008 the tech heavy index jumped 1 6 on monday but it s still off almost 23 from its all time high hit on nov 22 2021 yet suzuki is staying invested in stocks to weather a potential crash suzuki is taking a barbell approach on one end he likes stocks which typically benefit in an inflationary environment particularly energy materials and financials he lists defensive stocks which include consumer staples on the other side most of the inflation beneficiaries tend to come with a lot of cyclicality he said the further that the economy continues to slow you probably want to switch the concentration of that barbell away from the inflation beneficiaries and toward more of the defensive names suzuki acknowledges investors are paying a premium for safer trades however he believes it s worth it if you go back and look at all of the bear markets over the last 20 to 30 years look at the starting point valuations for defensive stocks they are never cheap going into a bear market suzuki said they are expensive relative to the rest of the market where earnings estimates are probably too high disclaimer

zelda bronstein in her article supply sophistry is completely correct in her examination of the many flaws in the supply and demand argument as it pertains to housing it is worth noting that supply and demand doesn t really apply to anything the supply and demand mantra has infiltrated all our economic debates and permeates our housing discussions even as it leads further and further away from economic justice this myth is propagated by those who profit from entrenching it into our assumptions nothing has ever been a direct supply and demand relationship because a host of conditions slavery labor devaluation tariffs taxes global corporate conglomeration make consumerism an indirect relationship apple still gets huge tax breaks that promote the economic inequality behind the housing crisis wikimedia commons image by andrew hitchcock supply side economics was ronald reagan s simplistic explanation of capitalism the discredited trickle down theory the idea is that perpetual growth sponsored and spurred by tax benefits and subsidies for wealthy individuals and corporations will inevitably dribble downward to the lower classes as comedian will durst put it trickle down means the rich can pee on us from greater and greater heights according to the department of treasury s investigative and research unit fincen the main drivers of housing prices are luxury housing real estate speculation and investment packaging by financial institutions conclusions of multi year studies by dr john rose as well as a 2018 paper from the international monetary fund show that housing prices are disconnected from supply and demand for multiple reasons not the least of which is that it never applied in the first place from 2012 to 2019 sf bay area housing prices rose by 110 percent the population decreased by 12 percent what did increase was the wealth gap during that same period the average wage worker earned 45 000 a year while those who received compensation rather than paychecks earned 160 000 a year according to forbes nearly one third of san francisco residents are multi millionaires that is people who have received more than 2 3 million per year in liquid assets stocks investments trusts financial instruments that translate into cash for at least three years those who live on paychecks cannot compete against those who can borrow against and get a tax write off for loans against investments teachers do not get stock options in a block of 1 million houses when someone comes in and offers 2 million then all the houses are worth 2 million when a real estate speculator turns a 1 million single family home into three units they don t build three 500 000 units but three 2 million units this has nothing to do with demand and everything to do with wealth distribution even if supply and demand were a real process emphasizing supply intentionally ignores what drives demand tax subsidies for multi billion dollar corporations to continually enlarge corporations don t set up in places that do not cannot provide the deep level of financial support that comes from wealthier states like california and texas with strong supplemental industries like agriculture oil and manufacturing when kansas tried it went bankrupt tech finance and real estate development companies would not have imbedded themselves so deeply in the heart of san francisco were it not for the billions of dollars in department of defense funding tax breaks to stay in california billions more in federal funds to keep expanding and taxation policies that treat a paycheck with derision but a dividend with reverence good jobs first reports that megadeals for datacenters supported by state and local subsidies to google apple microsoft facebook and amazon web services cost taxpayers 1 9 million per job apple has an ongoing agreement with santa clara to collect sales taxes that residents presume are going to public works fresno gave amazon 30 million part of sales tax revenue and control of the city budget now that some non white people have the economic ability to afford the satisfaction generational wealth and financial security of single family homes those in power have cast them as the cause of high housing prices legislators funded by real estate and finance companies have upzoned and subsidized massive developments that target communities of low and middle income homeowners in san francisco los angeles atlanta miami and seattle politicians have laden residents with density and land use requirements that place a financial burden on those least able to bear it those laws also come with an exorbitant environmental cost it is physically and financially impossible to build forever a skyscraper does more harm to the climate than a flat home because a single family home can have a radiant roof and dirt and trees while a tower has more heat radiating area and requires a host of ecologically detrimental support systems the loss of cities largest open space backyards has shifted everything from wind patterns to water retention has changed the behavior of birds and bears san francisco once a moderate temperature town is now the fifth hottest heat island in the us density is doing damage and it s pushing people further and further into rural areas the washington post reports that 30 percent of homes are being sold to investment companies rather than to homeowners that s a really different demand than family home ownership to secure a place on the economic ladder housing is at once a need an investment and a commodity it involves multiple layers of creation accessibility availability and safety housing is not simply a product universally available and analogous in quality like soap yet public discussion continues to rely upon a dangerous economic mythology and ignore the immoral underpinnings of public policies
santa clara california the worldwide semiconductor chip shortage is expected to last into 2024 according to intel ceo pat gelsinger gelsinger said he expects the shortage to continue due to the inability of chip manufacturing plants to obtain the equipment required in creating chips that s part of the reason that we believe the overall semiconductor shortage will now drift into 2024 from our earlier estimates in 2023 just because the shortages have now hit equipment and some of those factory ramps will be more challenged gelsinger said as quote by cnbc gelsinger s statement came one day after intel reported a fiscal second quarter forecast that was less profitable than wall street expected as its stock fell six percent during the covid pandemic chip factories temporarily halted operations while the demand for consumer electronics jumped economists claim the chip shortage has impacted economies worldwide and contributed to the u s economy experiencing its highest inflation since the 1980s meanwhile intel has announced that it will build chip manufacturing facilities in a variety of sites worldwide including in the united states and europe currently the world s chip manufacturing is centered in asia we ve really invested in those equipment relationships but that will be tempering the build out of capacity for us and everybody else but we believe we re positioned better than the rest of the industry gelsinger told cnbc

private employment expected to expand 395 000 in april after 455 000 prior april nonfarm payrolls forecast to increase 380 000 unemployment drop to 3 5 federal reserve rate program depends on continued employment and economic growth treasury yields and the dollar are sensitive to adp and nfp results when you re worried about a recession all data is suspicious americans are unhappy month by month inflation is eroding household income producer prices are even higher than retail in the us where nearly all goods move by truck diesel fuel just hit an all time record ensuring inflation will be higher in april and may than it was in march the one bright spot is somewhat surprisingly americans themselves consumption is the lifeblood of the us economy and so far american families have not stopped spending the biggest reason for that resilience is the red hot job market unemployment is 3 6 payrolls have averaged 599 000 for six months and 566 000 for a year there were more than 11 million unfilled positions in february anyone who wants a job can find one with the federal reserve beginning one of its most aggressive rate cycles in history and inflation running at a four decade high how long can american businesses and consumers continue to fund the economic expansion which brings markets to the employment report from automatic data processing adp due on wednesday the morning of the federal reserve meeting adp nfp and ism the american clients of adp are expected to hire 395 000 workers in april which would be about a quarter less than the six month average two days later nonfarm payrolls are projected to add 380 000 employees the lowest monthly total since last april the correlation between the private adp report and the national payroll report is not high over the last year the two reports have moved in the same direction seven times and in opposition the remaining five nonetheless any indication of weakness in adp will be considered a warning for nfp the manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi for employment from the institute for supply management ism displayed unexpected softness in april the employment index plunged 5 4 points to 50 9 its largest single drop since the lockdown month of april 2020 the consensus forecast had been for a smaller decline to 54 7 it was the weakest employment reading in seven months and the closest to the 50 contraction limit since manufactuing employment pmi fxstreet employment in the much larger service sector will be reported on wednesday and is expected to drop to 51 2 in april from 54 0 this would be the second decline in four months february s index dropped to 48 5 from 52 3 in january factory employment has long been considered the telltale for coming conditions in the overall market the steep fall in the employment index along with an equally unexpected drop in new orders are warnings that all is not well in the economy conclusion federal reserve and the us economy the federal reserve is very late to the inflation fight consumer prices jumped 8 5 in march the highest in over four decades price increases have accelerated 70 in 11 months from 5 last may even if the fed hikes 50 basis points on wednesday the fed funds rate will still only be 1 0 not remotely high enough to tamp down inflation the last time the us consumer price index cpi was 8 5 the base rate was 12 5 cpi fxstreet can the fed raise the fed funds rate to 2 75 or higher by the end of the year without causing a recession the equity markets don t think so at monday s close the dow was down 9 02 on the year the s p 500 12 82 and the nasdaq was off 19 9 have the prospective rate hikes already begun to restrain hiring is that the import of april s sharp decline in the manufacturing employment index many analysts blamed the 1 4 contraction in first quarter gdp on the surge in imports but preliminary gdp estimates for the second quartet are below 2 and falling treasury yields and the dollar reflect the belief that the fed will raise rates until economic conditions force it to stop nothing would bring the fed program to a halt faster than a collapse in hiring even if that does not seem imminent the threat is so dire that even a hint might be enough to reverse recent gains in both markets if adp is as expected or better the relief will be temporary given the fed s intentions and the dangerous economic currents around the globe from china to ukraine it will be many months before markets can rest easy

the market may be in the early innings of a dramatic decline despite monday s tech comeback money manager dan suzuki of richard bernstein advisors warns the group is in a bubble go back and look at the history of bubbles they don t softly correct and then are off to the races six months later you typically see a major correction you know 50 or more and typically it comes with an overshoot the firm s deputy chief investment officer told cnbc s fast money get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters suzuki suggests the stakes are high this week with the federal reserve set for a two day policy meeting wall street consensus expects a half point hike on wednesday the biggest wildcard according to suzuki will be guidance there s probably a lot more downside to go said suzuki who s also a former bank of america merrill lynch market strategist information technology communication services and consumer discretionary alone make up about half of the market cap of the s p 500 suzuki and his firm made the tech bubble call late last june the forecast is built on the notion a rising interest environment will hurt growth stocks particularly technology meanwhile the nasdaq is coming off its worst month since 2008 the tech heavy index jumped 1 6 on monday but it s still off almost 23 from its all time high hit on nov 22 2021 yet suzuki is staying invested in stocks to weather a potential crash suzuki is taking a barbell approach on one end he likes stocks which typically benefit in an inflationary environment particularly energy materials and financials he lists defensive stocks which include consumer staples on the other side most of the inflation beneficiaries tend to come with a lot of cyclicality he said the further that the economy continues to slow you probably want to switch the concentration of that barbell away from the inflation beneficiaries and toward more of the defensive names suzuki acknowledges investors are paying a premium for safer trades however he believes it s worth it if you go back and look at all of the bear markets over the last 20 to 30 years look at the starting point valuations for defensive stocks they are never cheap going into a bear market suzuki said they are expensive relative to the rest of the market where earnings estimates are probably too high disclaimer

occur through the date of filing our annual report on form 10 k a non gaap financial measures to supplement our condensed consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with gaap we use a number of financial measures both gaap and non gaap in analyzing and assessing our overall business performance for making operating decisions and for forecasting and planning future periods we consider the use of non gaap financial measures helpful in assessing our current financial performance ongoing operations and prospects for the future as well as understanding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations while we use non gaap financial measures as a tool to enhance our understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance and to provide incremental insight into the underlying factors and trends affecting both our performance and our cash generating potential we do not consider these measures to be a substitute for or superior to the information provided by gaap financial measures consistent with this approach we believe that disclosing non gaap financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides useful supplemental data that while not a substitute for gaap financial measures can offer insight in the review of our financial and operational performance and enables investors to more fully understand trends in our current and future performance in assessing our business during the quarter and fiscal year ended march 31 2022 and previous periods we excluded items in the following general categories each of which are described below share based compensation expense we believe that providing non gaap measures excluding share based compensation expense in addition to the gaap measures allows for a more transparent comparison of our financial results from period to period we prepare and maintain our budgets and forecasts for future periods on a basis consistent with this non gaap financial measure further companies use a variety of types of equity awards as well as a variety of methodologies assumptions and estimates to determine share based compensation expense we believe that excluding share based compensation expense enhances our ability and the ability of investors to understand the impact of non cash share based compensation on our operating results and to compare our results against the results of other companies amortization of intangible assets we incur intangible asset amortization expense primarily in connection with our acquisitions of various businesses and technologies the amortization of purchased intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity we exclude these various charges in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods and we believe that providing the non gaap measures excluding these various non cash charges as well as the gaap measures provides additional insight when comparing our gross profit operating expenses and financial results from period to period impairment of intangible assets we may incur impairment of intangible assets expense primarily in connection with our past business or asset acquisitions we believe that providing the non gaap measures excluding these items as well as the gaap measures assists our investors because such expenses are not reflective of our ongoing operating results acquisition related costs and change in fair value of contingent consideration for business acquisition we incurred expenses and credits in connection with our acquisitions which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations acquisition related costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination fair value of contingent consideration is associated with our estimates of the value of earn outs in connection with certain acquisitions we believe that providing the non gaap measures excluding these costs and credits as well as the gaap measures assists our investors because such costs are not reflective of our ongoing operating results restructuring charges credits these expenses are associated with re aligning our business strategies based on current economic conditions we have undertaken several restructuring plans in recent years in connection with our restructuring initiatives we incurred restructuring charges related to employee terminations facility closures and early cancellation of certain contracts we believe that providing the non gaap measures excluding these items as well as the gaap measures assists our investors because such charges credits are not reflective of our ongoing operating results in the current period loss gain on investments we recognize losses gains related to our investments in various companies which vary depending on the operational and financial performance of the companies in which we invest these amounts include our losses earnings on equity method investments investment impairments and losses gains resulting from sales or other events related to our investments we believe that providing the non gaap measures excluding these items as well as the gaap measures assists our investors because such losses gains are not reflective of our ongoing operations non gaap income tax adjustment non gaap income tax adjustment primarily measures the income tax effect of non gaap adjustments excluded above and other events the determination of which is based upon the nature of the underlying items the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions and the relevant tax rates in which we operate each of the non gaap financial measures described above and used in this press release should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for a measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap further investors are cautioned that there are inherent limitations associated with the use of each of these non gaap financial measures as an analytical tool in particular these non gaap financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and many of the adjustments to the gaap financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and may be reflected in the company s financial results for the foreseeable future we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information in the reconciliation included in this press release regarding the gaap amounts excluded from the non gaap financial measures in addition as noted above we evaluate the non gaap financial measures together with the most directly comparable gaap financial information additional supplemental financial information constant currency in addition logitech presents percentage sales
