goldrunner gold could jump to 1 900 2 100â in next 30 days â hereâ s why for the past two years at this juncture the precious metals sector has risen sharply in a month long up cycle for silver and with the high inflation expectations going forward a similar ramp up for the precious metals sector is a real possibility inflation expectations according to the new york fed s survey of consumer expectations the under 40 crowd expects inflation to hit 3 8 a year from now the 40 60 year olds expect inflation of 4 7 and the over 60 crowd expects inflation to hit 5 7 for an average inflation expectations for one year from now of 4 8 these inflation expectations tracked by the new york fed roughly match the inflation expectations tracked by the university of michigan s survey of consumers whose latest reading jumped to 4 6 the fed and the government claims echoed by the major news outlets that this bout of inflation is just temporary or transitory are resonating with consumers to some extent as inflation expectations for three years from now have jumped but not as high reaching nearly 3 57 in may and 3 55 in june silver expectations with such high inflation expectations in combination with the 30 day up cycle july 12th to august 11th for silver goldrunner s fractal work suggests that silver might start a run up to 34 per troy ounce and perhaps as high as 37 ozt over the next 30 days gold s expectations gold has more overhead resistance but there is little resistance up to the 1 900 area on gold s chart so such high inflation expectations could very well see gold bust up through that red downtrend line pretty easily to perhaps as high as 2 100 ozt gold silver explorers a major move higher in the price of physical silver and gold would also turn on the engines for the little gold and silver explorer class stocks as a whole and cause them to bust to the upside for some time to come and show the kinds of returns that they are capable of without the need for any artificial leverage summary there are no guarantees in life but cycles like the one mentioned above and the above charts are simply manifestations of prior price movements that have been illustrated via past price relationships that being said this time around things are somewhat different due to the vast number of u s dollars that have been printed and provided to the people those dollars cannot realistically be removed from system without creating a deflationary collapse so they will just keep on coming and building up pm pricing rises that will fuel silver and gold prices higher and higher conclusion there is only one way to really protect yourself from all of that dollar printing is to buy physical gold and silver and the companies that produce both or that own gold and silver in the ground lorimer wilson is editor of www munknee com your key to making money publisher of a daily free financial intelligence report which can be subscribed to here and a frequent guest contributor to www preciousmetalswarrants com which also offers a free newsletter sign up here and a subscription service see details here disclaimer please understand that the above is just the opinion of a small fish in a large sea none of the above is intended as investment advice but merely an opinion of the potential of what might be simply put the above is a matter of opinion and is not intended as investment advice information and analysis above are derived from sources and utilizing methods believed reliable but we cannot accept responsibility for any trading losses you may incur as a result of this analysis comments within the text should not be construed as specific recommendations to buy or sell securities individuals should consult with their broker and personal financial advisors before engaging in any trading activities do your own due diligence regarding personal investment decisions 2005 2022 the market oracle is a free daily financial markets analysis forecasting online publication

market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost there can be no assurance that the fund s investment objectives will be achieved the fund may not be appropriate for all investors principal risk factors the fund is subject to risks including the fact that it is a diversified closed end management investment company securities held by a fund as well as shares of a fund itself are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions political events regulatory or market developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations in addition local regional or global events such as war acts of terrorism spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues recessions or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments such events may affect certain geographic regions countries sectors and industries more significantly than others the outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as covid 19 in december 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets which have caused losses for investors while the development of vaccines has slowed the spread of the virus and allowed for the resumption of reasonably normal business activity in the united states many countries continue to impose lockdown measures in an attempt to slow the spread additionally there is no guarantee that vaccines will be effective against emerging variants of the disease net investment income paid by the fund to its shareholders is derived from the premiums it receives from writing selling call options and from the dividends and interest it receives from the equity securities and other investments held in the fund s portfolio and short term gains thereon premiums from writing selling call options and dividends and interest payments made by the securities in the fund s portfolio can vary widely over time dividends on equity securities are not fixed but are declared at the discretion of an issuer s board of directors there is no guarantee that the issuers of the equity securities in which the fund invests will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will remain at current levels the fund cannot assure as to what percentage of the distributions paid on the common shares if any will consist of qualified dividend income or long term capital gains both of which are taxed at lower rates for individuals than are ordinary income and short term capital gains because the fund will invest primarily in securities of non u s issuers which are generally denominated in non u s currencies there are risks not typically associated with investing in securities of u s issuers non u s issuers are subject to higher volatility than securities of u s issuers an investor may lose money if the local currency of a non u s market depreciates against the u s dollar the fund may invest from time to time a substantial amount of its assets in issuers located in a single country or region investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative and there is a heightened risk of investing in emerging markets securities financial and other reporting by companies and government entities also may be less reliable in emerging market countries shareholder claims that are available in the u s as well as regulatory oversight and authority that is common in the u s including for claims based on fraud may be difficult or impossible for shareholders of securities in emerging market countries or for u s authorities to pursue on june 23 2016 the united kingdom voted via referendum to leave the european union an event commonly referred to as brexit brexit immediately led to significant market volatility around the world as well as political economic and legal uncertainty approximately one year after the united kingdom officially departed the european union the united kingdom and the european union reached a trade agreement that became effective on december 31 2020 under the terms of the trade deal there will be no tariffs or quotas on the movement of goods between the united kingdom and europe there can be no assurance that the new trade agreement will improve the instability in global financial markets caused by brexit at this time it is difficult to predict what the longer term ramifications and political economic and legal implications will be as a result of brexit including the impact on the fund s portfolio holdings the negative impact on not only the united kingdom and european economies but the broader global economy could be significant potentially resulting in increased volatility and illiquidity and lower economic growth for companies that rely significantly on europe for their business activities and revenues the fund will engage in practices and strategies that will result in exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates thus subjecting it to foreign currency risk the market value of reit shares and the ability of the reits to distribute income may be adversely affected by several factors the fund s use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not been used may require the fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on an investment or may cause the fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses in the event of conversion to an open end management investment company the common shares would cease to be listed on the nyse or other national securities exchange and such common shares would thereafter be redeemable at nav at the option of the common shareholder rather than traded in the secondary market at market price which for closed end fund shares may at times be at a premium to nav any borrowings or preferred shares of the fund would need to be repaid or redeemed upon conversion and accordingly a portion of the fund s portfolio may need to be liquidated potentially resulting in among other things lower current income the risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports and other regulatory filings the information presented is not intended to

the reserve bank of india rbi revealed on wednesday july 14 2021 that it has decided to indefinitely ban mastercard inc nyse ma from providing any new debit or credit cards to local clients for allegedly violating data storage guidelines this move appears to be significant setback to the payments giant as india is a major market in a statement the rbi noted that mastercard failed to adhere to relevant data storage guidelines from 2018 which require foreign card networks to store indian payments data strictly in india so that regulatory authorities are able to maintain unfettered supervisory access the rbi stated notwithstanding lapse of considerable time and adequate opportunities being given the entity mastercard has been found to be non compliant with the directions mastercard noted that it s disappointed with the central bank s decision and claims it had been offering timely updates on its compliance processes since 2018 the payments giant confirmed that it would keep working with authorities to offer any further details needed to address concerns as reported by reuters the ban should become effective on july 22 2021 this decision by the rbi has been announced around 3 months after india s central bank banned american express and diners club international owned by discover financial services dfs n from providing new cards because of similar types of violations however unlike american express which is a fairly small service provider in indian markets firms like mastercard and visa have teamed up with numerous local banks that issue cards using the us companies global payments network mastercard s management had noted in 2019 that it was quite bullish on india it announced plans to invest 1 billion in the coming years along with its previous investment of 1 billion from 2014 2019 ashvin parekh a financial services consultant stated it does leave a big vacuum in credit cards and can come as a good opportunity for visa banks will have to start re negotiating the deals and this will be a blow for mastercard the reserve bank s move won t affect existing mastercard clients and the company should inform all card issuing banking platforms operating in india to adhere to the requirements outlined by the rbi the rbi directive from 2018 had led to a lobbying effort from us firms which argued that the guidelines would result in higher infrastructure expenses and impact their fraud detection platforms however the reserve bank continued to maintain its stance the rbi order has been announced at a time when firms like mastercard and visa are dealing with rising competition from local payments platforms such as rupay

photo credit alamy stock photo the pandemic transformed american life in many ways but arguably none quite as severely as education in spring 2020 many schools across the country closed their doors to in person learning as scientists and politicians grappled with the dangers of covid 19 globally more than 1 billion students were affected by school closures the effects of those closures were felt not just by students but by parents and educators too parents were forced to deal with tough choices send their children to school or start an at home learning program educators had to manage the transition from teaching in a classroom to teaching on a computer many students transitioned from a pre pandemic routine of going to class seeing friends and talking with teachers to a new reality of learning exclusively through a computer or mobile device before the upheaval started school districts already faced scrutiny over the quality of education they provided data from the nation s report card showed that math and reading proficiencies were stagnant leading up to the pandemic many locations with less funding per student struggled to stay above national testing averages with more than 90 of school funding coming from state and local sources the pandemic highlighted disparities in the nation s education system and jeopardized the performance of students in communities that were already falling behind even before the pandemic struck national trends indicated that students math and reading proficiencies were at concerning levels data from the national assessment of education progress neap show that math proficiencies leveled off for eighth graders at around 33 and increased slightly to 41 among fourth graders in 2019 reading proficiency peaked in 2017 but declined in the

from glenn greenwald s substack house speaker nancy pelosi d ca is the sixth richest member of congress according to the most recent financial disclosure statements filed in 2019 as the california democrat has risen through party ranks and obtained more and more political power her personal wealth has risen right along with it pelosi has seen her wealth increase to nearly 115 million from 41 million in 2004 reports the transparency non profit group open secrets even by the standards of wealth that define that legislative body more than half of those in congress are millionaires the wealth and lifestyle of the long time liberal politician and most powerful lawmaker in washington are lavish and ever since ascending to the top spot in the house pelosi and her husband paul keep getting richer and richer much of their added wealth is due to extremely lucrative and lucky decisions about when to buy and sell stocks and options in the very industries and companies over which pelosi as house speaker exercises enormous and direct influence the sector in which the pelosis most frequently buy and sell stocks is by far the silicon valley tech industry close to 75 of the pelosis stock trading over the last two years has been in big tech more than 33 million worth of trading that has happened as major legislation is pending before the house controlled by the committees pelosi oversees which could radically reshape the industry and laws that govern the very companies in which she and her husband most aggressively trade to underscore the towering conflict of interest at the heart of speaker pelosi s self enrichment consider the company in which the pelosis traded most often apple buying and selling in that one company accounted for 17 7 of the pelosis overall trading volume and yet during this same period pelosi held at least one private conversation with apple ceo tim cook about the state of apple and possible effects on the company from various pending bills to reform silicon valley on june 22 the new york times reported on a forceful and wide ranging pushback by the tech industry since the proposals were announced this month in particular executives lobbyists and more than a dozen think tanks and advocacy groups paid by tech companies have swarmed capitol offices called and emailed lawmakers and their staff members and written letters arguing there will be dire consequences for the industry and the country if the ideas become law but one of the most important steps taken against these bills was a personal call placed by apple s ceo directly to pelosi we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us in the days after lawmakers introduced legislation that could break the dominance of tech companies apple s chief executive tim cook called speaker nancy pelosi and other members of congress to deliver a warning when mr cook asked for a delay in the judiciary committee s process of considering the bills ms pelosi pushed him to identify specific policy objections to the measures said one of the people sources who refused to be identified tried to convince the times reporters that ms pelosi pushed back on mr cook s concerns about the bills but in doing so they confirmed the rather crucial fact that pelosi was having personal private conversations with the ceo of a company in which she and her husband were heavily invested and off of which they were making millions of dollars in personal wealth and pelosi according to the report asked cook what changes were needed to avoid harming apple and other silicon valley giants can even the hardest core democratic partisan loyalist justify this blatant conflict of interest and self dealing indeed all five of the pelosis most traded stocks over the last two years just so happen to be the five silicon valley giants that would be most affected by pending legislation four of them apple amazon facebook and google were all of the companies identified by the house antitrust subcommittee as being classic monopolies while the fifth microsoft has sent executives to repeatedly testify before democratic led house committees to defend democrats pending bills in other words the pelosis are trading stock most heavily in the exact companies whose future can be most shaped by the bills pelosi and her lieutenants are negotiating and shepherding through congress beyond that google one of the companies in which the pelosis stock trades have made millions is one of the top five donors to the house speaker the wealthy couple buys and sells in google stock making millions she works on bills that directly affect the future trajectory of google and they lavish her campaign coffers with cash a key source of her entrenched power for the rest of this article click here and subscribe to glenn greenwald s substack feed

york county as a whole is unaffordable for working class families according to a new report the report issued thursday by the southern maine planning and development commission relies on homeownership and affordability data from the maine housing authority also known as mainehousing it found that while the median home price increased by about 35 percent from 2015 to 2019 the median income increased by only 13 5 percent the median indicates that half of all findings were lower and half were higher the report was conducted in response to concerns voiced by towns in the area according to raegan young community planner and outreach specialist at the development commission it relies entirely on housing data predating the coronavirus pandemic which has seen area home prices skyrocket even further we hold regular meetings with municipal staff town managers planners said young we were hearing over and over again that there were concerns about affordable housing in the region and they were looking to us to try and clarify the issue a little bit and so we know that housing is a really complex issue and our first sort of thought was to do a really basic objective report of the existing data that mainehousing produces young pointed out that while rising home prices have been a hallmark of the pandemic market the report indicates a much more deeply rooted affordability problem the only surprising thing about the report was that affordability did seem to be a pretty significant issue as of 2019 based on mainehousing s data so pre pandemic said young we definitely know and have heard that housing prices have skyrocketed through the pandemic but to see the pre pandemic numbers showing that it was already an increasing issue i think was validating for a lot of the towns advertisement according to greg gosselin of the gosselin realty group who sells homes in york county more affordable homes in the area sell very quickly when you re out there and you re working especially in what we would consider the affordable market in york county which would be something under 500 000 these days anything under that price range you could have anywhere from 10 to 20 30 people literally in line at an open house when the home hits the market gosselin said despite the skyrocketing home prices reflected in the report gosselin believes that the increasing unaffordability of housing options in the area will cause prices to level there is starting to be a plateau in the market said gosselin that could be the beginning of a shift if that were the case i don t think you re going to see anything like what we saw in 2008 with the market and the financial market crash and the real estate market crash just prior to that i think you re going to just see a natural correction in the market because of the unaffordability of homes today the report is just the first part of a thorough state of the region analysis of housing affordability in york county going forward the development commission plans to conduct further studies examining the causes of this disparity by looking into confounding factors such as commuting and land use patterns send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

york county as a whole is unaffordable for working class families according to a new report the report issued thursday by the southern maine planning and development commission relies on homeownership and affordability data from the maine housing authority also known as mainehousing it found that while the median home price increased by about 35 percent from 2015 to 2019 the median income increased by only 13 5 percent the median indicates that half of all findings were lower and half were higher the report was conducted in response to concerns voiced by towns in the area according to raegan young community planner and outreach specialist at the development commission it relies entirely on housing data predating the coronavirus pandemic which has seen area home prices skyrocket even further we hold regular meetings with municipal staff town managers planners said young we were hearing over and over again that there were concerns about affordable housing in the region and they were looking to us to try and clarify the issue a little bit and so we know that housing is a really complex issue and our first sort of thought was to do a really basic objective report of the existing data that mainehousing produces young pointed out that while rising home prices have been a hallmark of the pandemic market the report indicates a much more deeply rooted affordability problem the only surprising thing about the report was that affordability did seem to be a pretty significant issue as of 2019 based on mainehousing s data so pre pandemic said young we definitely know and have heard that housing prices have skyrocketed through the pandemic but to see the pre pandemic numbers showing that it was already an increasing issue i think was validating for a lot of the towns advertisement according to greg gosselin of the gosselin realty group who sells homes in york county more affordable homes in the area sell very quickly when you re out there and you re working especially in what we would consider the affordable market in york county which would be something under 500 000 these days anything under that price range you could have anywhere from 10 to 20 30 people literally in line at an open house when the home hits the market gosselin said despite the skyrocketing home prices reflected in the report gosselin believes that the increasing unaffordability of housing options in the area will cause prices to level there is starting to be a plateau in the market said gosselin that could be the beginning of a shift if that were the case i don t think you re going to see anything like what we saw in 2008 with the market and the financial market crash and the real estate market crash just prior to that i think you re going to just see a natural correction in the market because of the unaffordability of homes today the report is just the first part of a thorough state of the region analysis of housing affordability in york county going forward the development commission plans to conduct further studies examining the causes of this disparity by looking into confounding factors such as commuting and land use patterns send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

thailand s jab fiasco needs an inquiry virologist dr yong poovorawan front right administers a covid jab to public health minister anutin charnvirakul front left on feb 28 dr yong also advised the government to pioneer the mixing of sinovac and astrazeneca vaccines government house photo thailand s vaccine rollout is evidently a complete shambles due to questionable procurement supply shortage and misallocation amid a deadly surge of the covid 19 delta variant the situation has been going from bad to worse with no end in sight as a poorly conceived strategy unfolds into a national calamity as public anger mounts with fast spreading calls for prime minister prayut chan o cha s ouster the covid 19 pandemic is becoming thailand s political game changer more than anyone could have anticipated instead of the youth led political movement or the parliamentary opposition s demands for reform fundamental political change in this country will likely cascade from the prayut government s gross mishandling that is claiming lives inflicting daily hardships and causing unhappiness nationwide when the time comes to pick up the pieces with more abundant and efficacious vaccines with virus control under way a national inquiry for public accountability will be imperative to be sure it is worth acknowledging that thailand is not alone in suffering from the coronavirus variants as well as problematic vaccine procurement quantity and rollout for countries with previously stellar performances during the virus stage last year such as vietnam or with far sighted vaccine management such as singapore challenges abound vietnam is also slow with its vaccine plan while infections have risen singapore has been exemplary in its diversified vaccine strategy but a virus spike has been unavoidable others from south korea and japan to australia and the whole of asean are behind on vaccinations while the virus and variants keep coming at them it can be said that indonesia s situation is worse than thailand s what sets thailand apart are what appears to be inherent nepotism and vested interests where people suspect there is more than meets the eye behind the country s vaccination procurement for inhabitants of this country it matters less that other countries are suffering the same conditions but that the country they live in can and should be doing much better what s worse the prayut government keeps repeating the same mistakes and making matters worse by the day let s start with the incoming donation of 1 5 million doses of the pfizer vaccine from the united states government pfizer has become the gold standard vaccine choice in thailand and many countries pfizer and its us made moderna peer are preferred over other vaccines particularly the china made sinovac and sinopharm and even the british swedish astrazeneca but thailand has had to stick with two vaccine choices thanks to the prayut government thailand is one of just 11 countries in the world that chose not to join the international vaccine cooperation called covax which represents 184 members for this reason the us s pfizer donation had to go to extra lengths to take place outside the covax framework pfizer vaccine donations are a new kind of vaccine diplomacy from washington offering bilateral goodwill with a better and superior vaccine which could offset latent resentment from the 1997 98 economic crisis when thailand felt abandoned by its treaty ally as the pfizer donation comes with no strings attached vested interests are already circling and manoeuvring for a take the current policy discussion of a necessary booster shot is not about jacking up antibodies with a third jab but all about getting an arm underneath a pfizer injection since the state apparatus and government leaders are no longer trustworthy it will be up to civil society and the public to demand and scrutinise to ensure transparency and fair access and distribution frontline medical professionals who merit a third shot and people who have not had a first jab should be given priority people should not be prevented from receiving their first jab for increased immunity if that first jab is pfizer then so be it it can almost be guaranteed that the pfizer supply will be leaked and misallocated to the benefit of those in or with access to power the donation of the superior and highly coveted pfizer also makes people in thailand wonder why they are stuck with more than 10 5 million doses and growing deliveries of the china made sinovac as a supply shortage continues to hinder the more preferred and internationally recognised astrazeneca that the integrity of thailand s sinovac purchases has been questioned is because sino biopharmaceutical listed on the hong kong stock exchange and having cp as a small shareholder also invested in sinovac biotech which produces the vaccine moreover sinovac s efficacy has been questioned singapore early this month was reported to have excluded sinovac from its national covid 19 vaccinations citing inadequate efficacy data for the chinese made vaccine especially against the contagious delta variant meanwhile there have been reports of covid infections in indonesia and other countries among those who had been fully vaccinated with sinovac yet the prayut government has got nothing else to inoculate its people sinopharm made in china and imported by the chulabhorn royal academy cra has become the third available vaccine but there is a limited supply and people need to fork out money to pay for it the government s latest move with its vaccination plan is worrying as it might make matters worse the government is to approve the mixing and matching of a first sinovac jab with an astrazeneca second shot without sound medical science to back it up this egregious move could be indictable if it ends up in consequent fatalities being stuck with ample sinovac and some astrazeneca with none of the superior us made vaccines the prayut government is betting on public safety just to muddle itself out of a poor and dangerous vaccine short sightedness from the outset as the thailand development research institute tdri pointed out in its recent virus and vaccine assessment there needs to be a national inquiry to hold those who are responsible for the vaccine mismanagement to account it needs to probe further the apparent conspiracy among top policymakers and perhaps healthcare experts including the government pharmaceutical organisation gpo there must be an investigation into the allegation that whether there is systematic manoeuvring and intention behind keeping up the steady sinovac orders and demurring on other vaccine choices as the pandemic continues to run its course political rumblings and combustibility in thailand will not be far behind

thousands of fishes were dumped from a plane into lakes across the state of utah just last week wildlife officials say the goal was to restock the states lakes with fishes which is only possible if done aerially while some people who had watched the viral video of the fishes tumbling down the planes in utah described the restocking as a bombardment officials assure that the fishes survival was incredibly high according to utah division of wildlife resources dwr 200 high elevation lakes across the state were restocked with fishes by use of airplanes and that they had proven this as an efficient method since 1956 for these fish the fastest way to the water is down restocking remote mountain lakes by dropping fish from planes which may look like a violent fatal end for them is actually the fastest and most logical method when it comes to restocking for small fishes fun fact we stock many of utah s high mountain lakes from the air the fish are tiny anywhere from 1 3 inches long which allows more than 95 of them to survive the fall explained the utah dwr in a twitter post due to the fishes very small size they fall to the water like leaves said phil tuttle the outreach manager for the southern region office of the utah dwr these tiny shiny animals that burst its way down the lakes are the most common species of hybrid trout known as splake salvelinus fontinalis and arctic grayling thymallus arcticus the pilot which carries hundreds of pounds of water drops up to 35 000 fish in a single flight dropping them just above tree line or as low as they possibly can while also looking for possible barriers like cliffs or mountains every year more than 200 of utah s remote mountain lakes are stocked using the aerial fish drop method before this utah wildlife took a more stressful journey in restocking lakes by carrying the fish up to the remote mountain on foot with horses if they got lucky also read male seahorses are the only animals to get pregnant and give birth fishless lakes these remote high elevated lakes are basically inaccessible often too far from roads and require much longer time to reach by land than aerial transports through years of netting surveys which includes collecting fish in a net and counting them plus decades of successful recreational fishing utah s wildlife experts can confirm that the fishes do all right after their aerial plunge staff members of the organization did enough netting surveys within minutes of the recent fish drop to verify initial survival rates as well without the effort and initiative of restocking high elevation lakes each year fish population in common fishing spots would eventually decline and most of these lakes would be fishless the dwr generally stocks the lakes with sterile fishes raised in hatcheries also as a measure of population control in case it booms this ensures minimal impact on native wildlife species and promoting balance in the ecology also read scientists discover 400 year old greenland shark likely born around 1620
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video garlic is one of the easiest things you grow in your garden jim duthie shows you how to grow it and harvest it boise idaho most of us grow typical produce in our vegetable gardens tomatoes beans cucumbers and squash but have you ever grown garlic it is easy to grow and if you aren t already growing it you ll probably want to i ve been growing gardens for many years but this is only the second time i ve grown garlic and i have to say that it s one of the easiest things to grow in your garden you just plant it in the fall and then pretty much forget it until you harvest it in the summer let me tell you a few things about garlic that you might not already know and show you how easy it is to grow it there are two types of garlic the hard neck variety has a stiff stem and typically has larger bulbs it s the kind most chefs and professional cooks use because of its intense flavor but it has a shorter shelf life the soft neck variety of garlic has a softer more pliable stem it s what you usually find in the grocery store and it lasts longer in storage it s illegal to plant grocery store garlic here in idaho because of the risk of a fungal disease called white rot that could be devastating to idaho s garlic and onion industry so make sure you buy only certified garlic seed stock locally or online i planted this soft neck garlic last fall using cloves from the garlic that i grew the previous year and then i just left it for the winter in the spring as the green leaves shot up i just weeded and watered it now the leaves are starting to turn yellow now and drying out a bit so we re getting close to harvest time right around the 4th of july when the leaves turned brown and were drying out and wilting i lifted one of the garlics to make sure it was ready it was good sized with lots of cloves and it was covered with a papery skin so i knew the rest were ready to dig up as well never pull up the garlic by the stem it could detach from the bulb instead loosen the soil being careful not to damage any of the bulbs then gently lift them from the soil once you ve dug them all up it s time to let them cure curing allows the energy from the leaves go into the bulbs as they dry properly cured garlic can last several months in storage gently clean off some of the dirt keeping the bulbs dry and be careful not to bruise or damage the bulbs some gardeners like to braid the leaves together into a garlic string to hang while it cures but if you don t have very much you can spread them out where there s good air circulation and they re protected from the sun and moisture i m just going to tie my garlic together in small clusters to hang up to dry take 4 to 8 of the garlic plants and carefully tie the stems together with some twine leaving a little extra to hang it up with put them in a shaded dry well ventilated shed or garage for about 2 to 4 weeks the outer covering of the bulbs will dry out making a protective cover for the soft cloves inside once the papery skins are dry you can trim off the roots and the stalks after they ve dried you can bring them inside if you have some mesh bags will allow good air circulation when october arrived it was time to plant more garlic i had saved two of the biggest and best bulbs from my summer harvest and i carefully separated the cloves then i planted each clove in a hole about three inches deep root side down about six inches apart and carefully covered them back over with loose soil followed by a little layer of mulch and dead leaves once i harvest this year s crop of garlic i ll save a couple of the best bulbs to plant again in the fall so i can look forward to another great crop of garlic next summer if you haven t grown garlic before give it a try i think you ll find that it will become a permanent addition to your garden from now on you can find certified disease free garlic seed stock at many local nurseries and garden stores as well as from certified seed companies in catalogs and online watch more you can grow it

a report on first secretary of the communist party of cuba and president of the republic miguel díaz canel bermúdez s special message explaining recent events to the people written by authors gladys leydis ramos lópez and juan diego nusa peñalver and published in english at en granma cu on july 12 for 60 years the example of the cuban revolution has bothered the united states stated first secretary of the communist party of cuba and president of the republic miguel díaz canel bermúdez yesterday during a special message from the palace of the revolution explaining to the people the most recent provocation orchestrated by small groups of counterrevolutionaries the president began his remarks with a revolutionary greeting to the entire people and said unfortunately we have been obliged to interrupt our sunday that all our families take to rest and spend time together to inform you and share with you a series of elements related to the events that have been taking place today which are part of a high level systematic escalating provocation which has been promoted by the counterrevolution over these days what is the background to this situation we are experiencing he asked we have been honest we have been open we have been clear and at all times we have explained the complexities of the current situation to our people i remember that more than a year and a half ago when the second half of 2019 was just starting we had to explain that we were heading toward a difficult conjuncture and we used that term which was later taken up as part of popular humor since we have remained in this conjuncture for a long time beginning with all the signs that the u s government headed by the trump administration was giving in relation to cuba diaz canel recalled that the adoption of an extensive series of restrictive measures to tighten the blockade began financial persecution energy persecution with the goal of asphyxiating the country s economy he denounced ongoing efforts to provoke a massive social explosion in cuba including all sorts of propaganda and ideological constructions they fabricate to call for misnamed humanitarian interventions which end up as military interventions and interference trampling the rights and violating the sovereignty the independence of peoples this succession of hostile acts continued he noted then came the 243 measures we all know about and in the last days of that administration the decision was made to include cuba on the list of countries sponsoring terrorism he reiterated that this list is a totally spurious list an illegitimate list and a unilateral list fabricated by the u s in the belief that they are the power that dominates the world that they are the emperors of this world he noted that unfortunately due to the lack of principles within more than a few international institutions and national governments many cave in and go along with these hostile measures and actions it must be recognized that others do not submit to the imposition of these measures but they are limited by the extraterritorial nature that these measures imply and that further increased the impact of the restrictions which above all implied that the country was immediately cut off from its main sources of foreign currency income i am talking about tourism i am talking about the trips of cubans and u s citizens to our country about the much awaited remittances to cuban families from their relatives in the united states the president also denounced u s efforts to discredit cuban medical brigades since this medical collaboration beyond the many instances of solidarity provided also generates foreign currency income u s restrictions cause shortages all this he said is causing shortages in the country shortages of food of medicines raw materials and inputs needed by our economic and productive processes which contribute both exports and supplies for the people therefore here two important elements are cut off the capacity to export and to acquire foreign currency to import and invest and the capacity of the productive processes to produce a full range of goods and services for our population he pointed out that the country has seen its fuel supply limited access to spare parts limited and all this has caused dissatisfaction has exacerbated accumulated problems which we have not been able to resolve which have been around since the special period and to all this has been added a ferocious media campaign to discredit us as part of a so called nonconventional war which attempts on the one hand to break the unity of the party the government the state and the people attempting to portray the government as inept incapable of providing well being to the cuban people attempting to portray the u s government as very concerned about the welfare of the cuban people whom it has unjustly blockaded telling them how they can aspire to development and progress in a country such as ours these are the usual hypocritical prescriptions and speeches of double standards which we know very well throughout the history of united states behavior toward cuba we know how they intervened in our country how they appropriated our island how they maintained domination of our island during the pseudo republic and how their interests were hit hard by the triumph of the cuban revolution for 60 years the example of the cuban revolution has bothered them and they have constantly tightened applied an unjust criminal cruel blockade reinforced worse than ever under pandemic conditions therein lies the manifest perversity the maliciousness of all these intentions blockade and restrictive measures which they have never taken against any other country or against those they consider their main enemies this has been a work and a policy of viciousness against a small island which only aspires to defend its independence its sovereignty and build with self determination its society in accordance with the principles that more than 86 of the population has approved has supported in the broad and democratic exercise we held to approve the current constitution of the republic of cub the pandemic and in the midst of these conditions comes the pandemic a pandemic that has not only affected cuba a pandemic that has affected the whole world a pandemic that has also affected the united states that has affected rich countries it must be said that the united states and other rich countries did not have the capacity to confront the effects of this pandemic at the beginning and in many of those first world countries with much more wealth health systems collapsed intensive care units were overwhelmed the poor have been disadvantaged because there are no public policies directed toward saving the people and these rich countries in many cases have worse results than cuba in terms of responding to the pandemic díaz canel said and we were impacted by the pandemic and in the midst of all these other restrictions with the reserves that the country has created with the little we had in the country with the little we have been able to acquire this difficult year and a half is that we have been able to meet these challenges these tests cuba develops vaccines shares with world and we have done it with courage we have done it without giving in and above all we have done it by sharing among all the little we have and we have not only shared within cuba we have shared with the world there is the example of the henry reeve international cuban medical brigade which has sent teams gone to places brutally affected by the pandemic and this is how we have moved forward controlling one wave after another with a tremendous capacity for sacrifice on the part of our people of our scientists of our health personnel of almost the entire country involved in this díaz canel recalled that five candidate vaccines have been developed one already recognized as a vaccine the first in latin america against covid 19 cuba is already vaccinating our population and this is a process that takes time vaccines must be produced but we currently have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world and in a few weeks we will have reached more than 20 of the total population however he noted in the last few months more aggressive strains have appeared and in the midst of this already serious situation another group of complications began to appear first of all new cases are emerging at a speed and accumulation that exceed the capacities we have been able to create to treat these patients in state institutions on the other hand we have been obliged to expand capacity in other centers he explained priority to treatment centers in this sense by opening more centers to which energy priority must be given in the midst of the accumulation of problems in the generation of electricity the number of circuits that we must protect to attend to these patients has increased with more patients he continued the stock of medicines is also running low and acquiring them is very difficult and in the midst of all this we continue to work for everyone now we have been obliged to resort to home isolation due to the lack of capacity in a number of provinces and call on families to participate more directly more responsibly one never tires of admiring the capacity for creative resistance of our people with these values he insisted with vaccination advancing complying with the necessary sanitary measures we will emerge sooner rather than later from this peak in the pandemic which is not only hitting cuba cuba managed to postpone this high point with everything we did and we will overcome it role of hypocritical mercenaries but now he noted in a very cowardly subtle opportunistic and perverse manner exploiting the most difficult situations we have in provinces like matanzas and ciego de ávila those who have always supported the blockade those who have served as mercenaries lackeys of the yankee empire begin to appear with calls for a humanitarian intervention a humanitarian corridor to strengthen the idea that the cuban government is not capable of handling this situation as if they were really interested in the welfare and health of our people if they want to make a gesture toward cuba if they really are concerned about the people if they want to solve cuba s problems lift the blockade and let s see how we do why don t they do that why don t they have the courage to lift the blockade what legal and moral basis allows a foreign government to implement such a policy against a small country and in the midst of such adverse conditions isn t this genocide he denounced the assertion that a dictatorship exists in cuba a dictatorship that is concerned about providing health care for its entire population that seeks welfare for all that in the midst of this situation is capable of conducting public policies aspiring to vaccination with a cuban vaccine because we knew that no one was going to sell us any since we don t have the money to buy them he said no murder victims in cuba what a strange dictatorship he exclaimed now they are shouting that we are murderers where are the murder victims in cuba where are the missing persons in cuba other countries that have suffered these pandemic peaks were not attacked in the press and they were not offered humanitarian intervention as a solution nor were they subjected to these slander campaigns as we are díaz canel emphasized i believe that life history and the facts show what is behind all this which is the effort to asphyxiate us and put an end to the revolution and for that they are trying to discourage our people to confuse our people and when the people are facing severe conditions then events like the ones we experienced in san antonio de los baños take place about the events in this area he detailed who was part of the group it included members of the population who have needs who are experiencing some of these shortages it included revolutionaries who are confused do not have all the arguments or were expressing these dissatisfactions but they were doing it differently because they were seeking to understand seeking explanations but this was led by a core group of manipulators who are indeed lending themselves to the designs of the sos matanzas or sos cuba campaigns several days ago they were preparing demonstrations or social disturbances of this type in several cuban cities this is criminal at a time when people should be at home protecting themselves cubans confront counterrevolutionaries diaz canel reported that revolutionaries in san antonio de los baños provincial authorities a group from the country s leadership showed up there we confronted the counterrevolutionaries and we talked to the revolutionaries and to those asking for explanations to show that cuba s streets belong to revolutionaries he pointed out that we know there are other groups of people gathering in streets and plazas in other cities of the country also moved by unhealthy purposes i am also giving this information to reaffirm that in cuba the streets belong to revolutionaries that the state the revolutionary government guided by the party are more than willing to discuss to argue and to participate with the people in the solution of problems but recognizing the real cause of our problems without allowing ourselves to be confused those who are encouraging demonstrations are not interested in good health care for cuba he emphasized remember that their model is neoliberal the privatization of health of medical services of education that everyone should save themselves as best they can that those who have the money can access health care he warned we are not going to surrender sovereignty the independence of our people or the freedom of this nation there are many of us revolutionaries in this town who are willing to give our lives and this is not a slogan it is a conviction they will have to step over our corpses if they want to confront the revolution and we are ready for anything and we will be in the streets fighting we know that incidents of this type are being orchestrated in the streets of havana and that there are large groups of revolutionaries confronting counterrevolutionary elements we are separating the confused revolutionaries the inhabitants of cuba who have specific concerns but we are not going to allow any counterrevolutionary any mercenary to provoke destabilization among our people this is why we are calling on all revolutionaries in our country all communists to take to the streets in any of the places where these provocations may take place today from now on throughout these days he insisted as i said in my closing speech at the party congress we revolutionaries defend the revolution above all else we communists on the front lines and with that conviction we are now in the streets we are not going to allow anyone to manipulate our situation or defend a plan that is not cuban that is not for the welfare of cubans and that is annexationist this is the task to which we call revolutionaries and communists of this country he concluded

utilities 0 7 as spark infrastructure came out of its trading halt and rose another 6 1 spark is prepared to chat to the consortium on the hunt but not to allow due diligence given the market was not fazed about the extended sydney lockdown on wednesday probably focusing on federal state government assistance the new melbourne lockdown was likely not the trigger for the sell off china reported 7 9 year on year gdp growth in the june quarter below 8 1 forecasts and down from 18 3 in the march quarter bearing in mind china went into and came out of covid ahead of everyone else month of june industrial production rose 8 3 year on year ahead of a 7 8 forecast but down on may s 8 8 retail sales rose 12 1 ahead of an 11 0 forecast but down on may s 12 4 fixed asset investment rose 12 6 year to date ahead of a 12 1 forecast but down on 15 4 we may conclude that china s economic growth is slowing not so much of a surprise as the initial snap rebound subsides but not slowing as rapidly as more recent forecasts the other news late morning was australia s unemployment rate falling to a decade low of 4 9 from 5 1 in may old news unfortunately the telling numbers within the report were a 1 8 fall in hours worked and a 0 5 percentage point increase in the underemployment rate in victoria due to the previous lockdown otherwise the impacts of july lockdowns await the next data drop the biggest sector fall was that of healthcare 1 4 with csl csl bouncing around almost daily sometimes in line with and sometimes not the aussie dollar property fell 1 2 which does make sense as lockdowns increase ditto the banks 0 7 but why the mostly defensive sectors that went up on wednesday went down yesterday makes little sense other than really nobody knows what s going on the recent fall in us bond yields may be adding to uncertainty and yesterday the aussie ten year fell 5 basis points to 1 29 which as of last night is bang in line with the us equivalent falling yields only exacerbate bank

fall in consumer discretionary 0 04 last night the s p500 fell 0 3 led down by big tech but our futures are down a mere 6 points this morning probably because we don t have big tech or we just have no idea enough s enough recently the mega cap faamg stocks have seen a revival and pushed to new highs after wall street came to decide these solid earners do not really belong in the growth basket rather they are as defensive as a consumer staple but they can t keep hitting new highs every day next week they start to report earnings so best to lock in some profits now ahead of any sell the fact response which in the early days of the season has already been the trend that s the most likely explanation given the us ten year bond yield fell another 6 basis points to 1 30 last night growth stocks are the ones who benefit most in valuation terms from falling yields but why do yields keep falling us industrial production rose 0 4 in june but take out the impact of constrained auto production due to the chip shortage and that becomes a solid 0 8 weekly new jobless claims fell to a new covid low of 360 000 down 26 000 from the week before the philadelphia fed activity index slipped to 21 9 from 30 7 a month ago but as a zero neutral measure these are still runaway numbers the empire new york fed index hit a record high of 43 0 up from 17 4 it s thus a bit hard to argue that lower us yields are the result of slowing us growth in a second day of testimony to congress jerome powell reiterated the fed s stance on monetary policy but this can hardly be a driver for further yield weakness given he s been reiterating till he s blue in the face for the last three months while the fomc is indeed actively talking about taper timing the suggestion is only if the high inflation numbers seen in may june persist to the end of the year will the fed actually respond the truth may lie with delta while delta is a randomly chosen greek letter it is also used to denote

by c b hall vermont business magazine amtrak trains will begin serving vermont again on monday july 19 nearly 16 months after the covid virus led to a collapse in ridership on public transportation with amtrak s patronage plummeting by about 95 the national passenger rail provider canceled scores of regularly scheduled trains including both the vermonter and the ethan allen express the state supported services that ply the tracks in the green mountain state toni hamburg clithero amtrak grants program manager at the vermont agency of transportation vtrans told vbm that the return of the silver blue and red trains to the state s 11 stations will be greeted by celebrations at all of those stations and even at the claremont junction n h station where the vermonter s route hooks briefly into the granite state chief among the festivities will be the gathering at st albans from which the vermonter will begin its southward itinerary to washington d c at 9 15 am the send off celebration which will commence at 8 30 will feature remarks from among others congressman peter welch d vermont rep diane lanpher d vergennes who chairs the house transportation committee ray lang amtrak s vice president for state supported services vtrans secretary joe flynn st albans mayor tim smith and andrew brown president of the village of essex junction s board of trustees in rutland from which the restored ethan allen express will begin its journey to new york city at 8 15 am a 7 30 commemoration will include speeches by rep charles butch shaw r pittsford vice chair of the house transportation committee and rutland mayor david allaire who is also a long time member of the state s statutory rail advisory council from our perspective and from mine personally it s a really exciting day a long time coming and with the eventuality of the ethan allen going to burlington it s an exciting time for passenger rail in vermont allaire told vbm he referred to the long planned extension of the train s itinerary north to the queen city which will likely take place next spring promoting both the long awaited service resumption and the value of the train service generally vtrans is offering a 1 00 fare between any two vermont points on the 19th so attendees may participate in the celebration with an amtrak train ride in the words of a july 6 release from the agency vtrans will also provide bus shuttles to allow for a convenient round trip for people taking a celebratory excursion on either train the agency s promotional effort has gotten an enthusiastic response as of press time the amtrak website indicated for example that seats on the initial southbound vermonter were sold out between several station pairs i don t think i ve seen anything quite like this said chris parker executive director of the vermont rail action network advocacy group i have been very impressed with how vtrans has been organizing all of these festivities trespassers vandalism a washout and optimism the service itself will be little different from what amtrak provided when the virus forced the service suspension the only relic of the pandemic restrictions will be a requirement to wear masks while onboard schedules will be the same as before the pandemic the resumption will follow numerous qualifying runs trial runs in which amtrak engine crews familiarized or refamiliarized themselves with a route to ensure an adequate knowledge of its curves road crossings and other potential hazards some engineers on the vermont runs were chagrined to notice that trespassers on the tracks which are for the most part private property had become more common over the duration of the pandemic which reduced regular rail traffic to just the occasional freight train the engineers reports led to a june 21 press release from vtrans pleading with the public to avoid walking on the tracks which is as dangerous as it is illegal in essex junction vandals took advantage of the inactivity at the amtrak station by breaking a glass panel on the facade of the structure vermont s busiest station and one of its most dilapidated the host railroad and property owner the new england central railroad put plywood over the damage but vandals retaliated by tagging the wood with graffiti so necr covered that over with washable vinyl siding essex junction s brown told vbm the temporary fix he said will make look at least more presentable for july 19 while it made no mention of the vandalism a july 12 release from the village of essex junction reported that the station is badly in need of renovation and repair a postage stamp sized waiting room no public bathroom a platform that is out of compliance with ada regulations boarded up windows and peeling paint the village circulated the release to publicize its proposal yet to be funded to build a large open trussed roof canopy sized to cover the flat roofed station building and the train and bus loading areas at the multimodal station essex junction s commemoration of the service resumption will for the most part take place after the train arrives and several local leaders who have taken part in the st albans event get off it remarks from officials including brown and rep karen dolan d essex a question and answer opportunity and a brief walking tour will highlight both the planned upgrades at the station and ongoing development in its immediate environs vtrans s plans also got a scare on wednesday when a thunderstorm washed out a culvert under the necr tracks in dummerston on the vermonter s route just north of brattleboro but in a statement on thursday tom ciuba communications director at necr s parent company genesee wyoming told vbm that crews were on the site and would complete their repairs in time to ensure the train s return to the rails on monday the service resumption will thus take place with eyes turned towards the future my optimism comes from the current federal proposals for freight and passenger rail appropriations clithero said she cited plans for infrastructure funding that if approved would provide tens of billions of dollars over the next few years for passenger and freight rail enhancements against that backdrop amtrak recently announced it had concluded a 3 4 billion agreement with rail equipment giant siemens mobility to supply 73 trainsets to the national passenger rail company the new rolling stock would serve amtrak s boston to washington northeast corridor as well as state supported routes such as vermont s

geneva july 15 2021 prnewswire the pew charitable trusts expressed cautious optimism today that world trade organization members could soon reach an agreement to reduce harmful fisheries subsidies noting that although negotiators failed to strike a deal at today s ministerial meeting they made significant progress and paved the way for an agreement later this year wto director general ngozi okonjo iweala and the chair of the negotiations ambassador santiago wills of colombia announced that wto members will continue negotiating with an eye toward reaching an agreement before the wto s 12th ministerial conference scheduled for the week of nov 30 although wto member countries failed to strike a deal today they paved the way for an agreement later this year post this governments spend 22 billion a year on damaging subsidies paid to primarily industrial fishing fleets to artificially lower the cost of fuel and vessel construction enabling these large vessels to catch more fish than is sustainable by fishing farther out to sea and for longer periods in 2015 193 countries adopted the united nations sustainable development goals of those goal 14 called for conserving and responsibly using the ocean and marine resources with nations committing to effectively regulate fisheries eliminate illegal fishing and by 2020 reach an agreement to halt the subsidies that fund destructive fishing practices however wto members missed that deadline despite calls by more than 180 organizations working on marine and environmental protection animal welfare sustainable seafood supply chains and international development to support goal 14 after okonjo iweala took the helm in march she set a goal for wto members to reach a deal at today s ministerial meeting isabel jarrett manager of the pew charitable trusts project to end harmful fisheries subsidies issued the following statement world trade organization members are closer than ever to reaching an agreement two decades in the making that would reduce harmful fisheries subsidies despite the urging of the director general negotiations chair and more than 180 organizations from around the world wto members fell short of striking a deal at today s ministerial meeting however countries demonstrated their commitment to reaching an agreement this year that prioritizes sustainability and increases transparency an agreement with too many loopholes would undermine the wto s sustainability goals new research found that a wto deal that eliminates all harmful fisheries subsidies could restore 12 5 of fish biomass to the ocean by 2050 however the most recent draft of the wto agreement text probably would yield an increase of only 1 59 over that same period according to scientists from the university of california santa barbara the final text of the agreement must ensure that governments are not allowed to subsidize irresponsible practices that will hurt those fish populations that have not truly reached biologically sustainable levels harmful subsidies applied to the fishing of those vulnerable populations could jeopardize their chances of rebounding although the final wto fisheries subsidies deal should include a transition period that allows developing countries extra time to implement the agreement there should be no permanent exceptions to any rule and developed nations should never be permitted to provide harmful subsidies unless they can prove that those subsidies do not negatively affect fish stock levels wto members must seal the deal as soon as possible on a strong fisheries subsidies agreement that delivers on ambitious sustainability goals ultimately improving the health of fisheries and fishing communities around the world the pew charitable trusts is driven by the power of knowledge to solve today s most challenging problems learn more at www pewtrusts org contact kathryn bomey 202 573 2120 source the pew charitable trusts related links www pewtrusts org

wind turbine components are ready to be shipped from a dock in lianyungang jiangsu province on thursday measures needed to support recovery contain downside risks say experts china is likely to fine tune its economic policies by injecting sufficient liquidity and accelerating fiscal spending to support economic recovery and contain downside risks amid surging commodity prices as growth slowed in the second quarter economists said china s gross domestic product expanded 12 7 percent year on year in the first half of 2021 and the country s gdp rose 7 9 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier the national bureau of statistics said on thursday the 7 9 percent economic growth rate was slightly below market expectations and it decelerated from the 18 3 percent growth recorded in the first quarter economists said the growth deceleration was due to the higher base in the second quarter of last year as the chinese economy rebounded strongly from a historic contraction of 6 8 percent in the first quarter of 2020 when business activities were disrupted by the covid 19 pandemic they said the slower growth does not mean that the prospects for the chinese economy have worsened as the latest economic data still points to stable and steady growth momentum for the world s second largest economy on a quarterly basis china s gdp grew 1 3 percent in the second quarter compared with the 0 6 percent first quarter increase according to the nbs retail sales grew faster than expected rising 12 1 percent year on year in june while industrial production increased 8 3 percent from a year ago china has managed to maintain a relatively high growth rate in the first half of the year if we look at the gdp data on a quarterly basis the notable growth in the second quarter means that the trend of steady economic growth has not changed said yu miaojie deputy dean of peking university s national school of development but economists see rising pressure on the recovery of the chinese economy amid soaring raw material prices and the possible policy shift of the federal reserve of the united states against the backdrop of rising inflation and the improved employment outlook in the us such a trend may prompt china s policymakers to pay more attention to the downside risks and roll out more supportive measures to boost domestic demand and private consumption and to further unleash the country s growth potential they said one potential risk is the rising commodity prices in the international market which will lead to higher costs for companies and squeeze their profit margins yu said china s monetary policy will continue to be prudent while policymakers will work to ensure a reasonable increase of social financing and money supply to drive economic growth in the second half of the year most economists saw the recent move by china s central bank to cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks as a forerunner of beijing s policy adjustment in the second half of the year but they do not view the rrr cut as the start of a new round of massive policy easing china s monetary policy will likely be more flexible with appropriate fine tuning in the second half of the year it will focus on increasing liquidity while maintaining the prudent stance and overall stability said robin xing chief china economist at morgan stanley china still has greater policy room than some developed economies which have almost exhausted their policy tools he said wen bin chief researcher at china minsheng bank said that china s policymakers will step up monetary support to help smaller businesses offset the impact of rising commodity prices while expanding fiscal spending and increasing the issuance of local government bonds to boost the role of investment as a key growth driver

while the department is evaluating marketing efforts for parents information and access about all vaccines will continue tennessee usa the tennessee department of health said it is working to clarify misinformation that it is stopping childhood immunization and vaccine efforts in the state after it ended vaccine messaging programs in tennessee schools after the high profile firing of tennessee s top vaccine official internal documents and emails first reported by the tennessean showed that the tdh would end all vaccine outreach for adolescents and stop all vaccine events on school property that would apply not only to covid 19 vaccines but also to common childhood immunizations for things like chicken pox measles mumps polio and even hepatitis in the wake of criticism from doctors and others the tdh issued a press release thursday to clarify that information and access to vaccinations for children through state health departments will continue and there has been no disruption to these services there has been no disruption to the childhood immunization program or access to the covid 19 vaccine while the department has evaluated annual marketing efforts intended for parents said tennessee department of health commissioner lisa piercey md mba faap the tennessee department of health not only supports immunizations but continues to provide valuable information and access to parents who are seeking vaccinations for their children we are proud of the efforts of our staff across the state and will continue to promote vaccination and the vaccination work of our partners the tdh has information regarding routine childhood immunizations can find resources here parents seeking the covid 19 vaccine for children 12 can find additional information here according to the press release tennessee has a long history of being one of the top performing programs in the country when it comes to childhood immunizations the tdh credits the efforts of rural and metro health departments across the state for the success while we were concerned when childhood immunization rates temporarily dropped during the covid 19 pandemic we are glad that we are seeing vaccination rates begin to rebound we will continue supporting parents who are working to get their families immunization schedules back on track piercey said the shelby county health department is not subject to the new tdh policy as state law requires regional departments in the largest metropolitan areas to operate largely independent from the state the top six counties including shelby county oversee their own health departments however the health departments of the other 89 rural counties in tennessee operate under the direct supervision of the tennessee department of health
after a big run for energy stock this year a slide in oil prices following news that opec agreed to boost production has helped take the steam out of the sector s rally despite the pullback most energy names are still trading either in overvalued territory or at prices that are in line with morningstar s estimates of fair value meaning that prospects for additional long term gains could be hard to come by but we screened the energy sector in search of any stocks that may have fallen back to levels that morningstar analysts peg as cheap we found four pioneer natural resources pxd plains all american pipeline paa eni e and holly frontier hfc the sector was unloved before the recent runup in prices inflated stocks temporarily says david meats morningstar energy equity research director so stocks like pioneer natural resources were fairly valued but only because the market was simultaneously 1 overweighting high near term prices and 2 unfairly discounting the long term value generation the opec deal has eliminated the first of these issues but not the latter hence certain stocks are now looking cheap this landscape reflects a significant change of fortune for the sector as most energy stocks were trading at bargain level prices at the start of 2021 after years of low and falling oil prices here s a look at the morningstar ratings for the 58 energy stocks covered by morningstar analysts stocks with 4 or 5 stars are undervalued and 1 or 2 star stocks are overvalued stocks with a 3 star rating are considered fairly valued in july 2020 43 of energy stocks covered by morningstar were in 5 star territory that percentage now stands 3 the 4 star stock bucket also shrank significantly falling to 26 from 47 meanwhile 3 star stocks now make up 54 of our energy coverage list the backdrop for the sector is the recent slide in oil prices heading into july oil prices had rallied 82 4 over the past year with a 55 1 increase through july 13 as a pickup in demand collided with the depressed levels of production that resulted from the pandemic oil prices have been volatile after topping 75 per barrel on july 1 for the first time since 2014 just this week the wti benchmark has fallen 4 3 to nearly 72 as oil has fallen the sector has broadly traded lower as can be seen with energy select sector spdr etf xle the 23 7 billion exchange traded fund is down 8 7 from its peak on june 15 2021 but despite that decline xle is still up 50 4 from a year ago and 89 9 from its pandemic low set on oct 28 2020 and it has outpaced the overall market as measured by the morningstar us market index despite the retreat in oil prices many stocks are still trading at rich levels after big rallies take laredo petroleum lpi the stock was trading at roughly 3 times its fair value estimate on july 1 2021 hitting a 52 week high of 99 25 its stock price has since fallen back to below 70 but that remains well above our fair value estimate of 33 per share but with the pullback in the sector the roster of 4 star energy stocks has grown slightly as of the close of trading on july 14 18 of the 58 energy stocks fell into that undervalued category here are the four new entrants to that group
agreement could boost fish populations improve ocean health and help coastal communities geneva july 16 2021 prnewswire the pew charitable trusts expressed cautious optimism today that world trade organization members could soon reach an agreement to reduce harmful fisheries subsidies noting that although negotiators failed to strike a deal at today s ministerial meeting they made significant progress and paved the way for an agreement later this year wto director general ngozi okonjo iweala and the chair of the negotiations ambassador santiago wills of colombia announced that wto members will continue negotiating with an eye toward reaching an agreement before the wto s 12th ministerial conference scheduled for the week of nov 30 governments spend 22 billion a year on damaging subsidies paid to primarily industrial fishing fleets to artificially lower the cost of fuel and vessel construction enabling these large vessels to catch more fish than is sustainable by fishing farther out to sea and for longer periods in 2015 193 countries adopted the united nations sustainable development goals of those goal 14 called for conserving and responsibly using the ocean and marine resources with nations committing to effectively regulate fisheries eliminate illegal fishing and by 2020 reach an agreement to halt the subsidies that fund destructive fishing practices however wto members missed that deadline despite calls by more than 180 organizations working on marine and environmental protection animal welfare sustainable seafood supply chains and international development to support goal 14 after okonjo iweala took the helm in march she set a goal for wto members to reach a deal at today s ministerial meeting isabel jarrett manager of the pew charitable trusts project to end harmful fisheries subsidies issued the following statement world trade organization members are closer than ever to reaching an agreement two decades in the making that would reduce harmful fisheries subsidies despite the urging of the director general negotiations chair and more than 180 organizations from around the world wto members fell short of striking a deal at today s ministerial meeting however countries demonstrated their commitment to reaching an agreement this year that prioritizes sustainability and increases transparency an agreement with too many loopholes would undermine the wto s sustainability goals new research found that a wto deal that eliminates all harmful fisheries subsidies could restore 12 5 of fish biomass to the ocean by 2050 however the most recent draft of the wto agreement text probably would yield an increase of only 1 59 over that same period according to scientists from the university of california santa barbara the final text of the agreement must ensure that governments are not allowed to subsidize irresponsible practices that will hurt those fish populations that have not truly reached biologically sustainable levels harmful subsidies applied to the fishing of those vulnerable populations could jeopardize their chances of rebounding although the final wto fisheries subsidies deal should include a transition period that allows developing countries extra time to implement the agreement there should be no permanent exceptions to any rule and developed nations should never be permitted to provide harmful subsidies unless they can prove that those subsidies do not negatively affect fish stock levels wto members must seal the deal as soon as possible on a strong fisheries subsidies agreement that delivers on ambitious sustainability goals ultimately improving the health of fisheries and fishing communities around the world the pew charitable trusts is driven by the power of knowledge to solve today s most challenging problems learn more at www pewtrusts org contact kathryn bomey 202 573 2120 related links www pewtrusts org

gaap financial measures and reconciliation to gaap we are pleased with the overwhelming shareholder approval received during the quarter for the announced merger with m t said jack barnes chairman and chief executive officer the vote reflects investor confidence in the value of merging two market leading financial institutions and in the ability of the combined company to better serve clients across some of the most populated and attractive banking markets in the nation while preparations for the transaction s close and integration move forward our most important objective remains servicing the needs of customers communities and colleagues looking to the future we are excited about executing on the growth opportunities ahead and building upon the extraordinary legacy of people s united we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance stated david rosato senior executive vice president and chief financial officer record quarterly operating income of 176 1 million increased 12 5 percent linked quarter and generated an operating return on average tangible equity of 15 4 percent these results which further highlight the strengths of the franchise included higher fee revenues well controlled expenses and a negative provision for credit losses primarily driven by further improvements in the economic outlook the growth in fee revenues was broad based with notable increases in swap income and our wealth and cash management businesses we are pleased with our ability to hold net interest margin relatively steady for the quarter considering the current economic environment the margin of 2 70 percent was only four basis points below the first quarter as the unfavorable impact of lower yields in the securities portfolio and increased excess liquidity was largely offset by a reduction in deposit costs for the eighth consecutive quarter an additional calendar day and continued stable loan yields rosato continued period end loans and deposits decreased three percent and two percent respectively from the close of the first quarter the 1 4 billion decline in period end loans was driven by the forgiveness of 970 million in ppp balances 530 million in lower retail balances and a 130 million reduction in mortgage warehouse conversely the loan portfolio benefited from strong results in our specialized industry verticals within c i and leaf the 894 million decline in period end deposits was equally attributable to lower brokered deposit balances and seasonal outflows in our municipal business importantly non interest bearing deposits continued to grow up three percent linked quarter and now account for 32 percent of total period end balances finally capital ratios remain strong and improved linked quarter for both the bank and

accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap management routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non gaap financial measures such as the efficiency and tangible common equity ratios tangible book value per common share and operating earnings metrics management believes these non gaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding people s united s underlying operating performance and trends and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions further the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance including non interest expense control while the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are used to analyze the relative strength of people s united s capital position the efficiency ratio which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by people s united to generate a dollar of revenue is the ratio of i total non interest expense excluding operating lease expense goodwill impairment charges amortization of other acquisition related intangible assets losses on real estate assets and non recurring expenses the numerator to ii net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis plus total non interest income including the fte adjustment on bank owned life insurance boli income the netting of operating lease expense and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans and acquired loans and non recurring income the denominator people s united generally considers an item of income or expense to be non recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years operating earnings exclude from net income available to common shareholders those items that management considers to be of such a non recurring or infrequent nature that by excluding such items net of income taxes people s united s results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period items excluded from operating earnings which include but are not limited to i non recurring gains losses ii merger related expenses including acquisition integration and other costs iii writedowns of banking house assets and related lease termination costs iv severance related costs and v charges related to executive level management separation costs are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio operating earnings per common share eps is derived by determining the per common share impact of the respective adjustments to arrive at operating earnings and adding subtracting such amounts to from diluted eps as reported operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings annualized by average total assets operating return on average tangible common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings annualized by average tangible common equity the operating common dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing common dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period pre provision net revenue is a useful financial measure as it enables an assessment of the company s ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle as well as providing an additional basis for comparing the company s results of operation between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses which can vary significantly between periods the tangible common equity ratio is the ratio of i tangible common equity total stockholders equity less preferred stock goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets the numerator to ii tangible assets total assets less goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets the denominator tangible book value per common share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by common shares total common shares issued less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated

wind turbine components are ready to be shipped from a dock in lianyungang jiangsu province on thursday measures needed to support recovery contain downside risks say experts china is likely to fine tune its economic policies by injecting sufficient liquidity and accelerating fiscal spending to support economic recovery and contain downside risks amid surging commodity prices as growth slowed in the second quarter economists said china s gross domestic product expanded 12 7 percent year on year in the first half of 2021 and the country s gdp rose 7 9 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier the national bureau of statistics said on thursday the 7 9 percent economic growth rate was slightly below market expectations and it decelerated from the 18 3 percent growth recorded in the first quarter economists said the growth deceleration was due to the higher base in the second quarter of last year as the chinese economy rebounded strongly from a historic contraction of 6 8 percent in the first quarter of 2020 when business activities were disrupted by the covid 19 pandemic they said the slower growth does not mean that the prospects for the chinese economy have worsened as the latest economic data still points to stable and steady growth momentum for the world s second largest economy on a quarterly basis china s gdp grew 1 3 percent in the second quarter compared with the 0 6 percent first quarter increase according to the nbs retail sales grew faster than expected rising 12 1 percent year on year in june while industrial production increased 8 3 percent from a year ago china has managed to maintain a relatively high growth rate in the first half of the year if we look at the gdp data on a quarterly basis the notable growth in the second quarter means that the trend of steady economic growth has not changed said yu miaojie deputy dean of peking university s national school of development but economists see rising pressure on the recovery of the chinese economy amid soaring raw material prices and the possible policy shift of the federal reserve of the united states against the backdrop of rising inflation and the improved employment outlook in the us such a trend may prompt china s policymakers to pay more attention to the downside risks and roll out more supportive measures to boost domestic demand and private consumption and to further unleash the country s growth potential they said one potential risk is the rising commodity prices in the international market which will lead to higher costs for companies and squeeze their profit margins yu said china s monetary policy will continue to be prudent while policymakers will work to ensure a reasonable increase of social financing and money supply to drive economic growth in the second half of the year most economists saw the recent move by china s central bank to cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks as a forerunner of beijing s policy adjustment in the second half of the year but they do not view the rrr cut as the start of a new round of massive policy easing china s monetary policy will likely be more flexible with appropriate fine tuning in the second half of the year it will focus on increasing liquidity while maintaining the prudent stance and overall stability said robin xing chief china economist at morgan stanley china still has greater policy room than some developed economies which have almost exhausted their policy tools he said wen bin chief researcher at china minsheng bank said that china s policymakers will step up monetary support to help smaller businesses offset the impact of rising commodity prices while expanding fiscal spending and increasing the issuance of local government bonds to boost the role of investment as a key growth driver

on wednesday the federal reserve unveiled plans to begin selling its corporate debt in the secondary market corporate credit facility smccf an emergency lending facility that helped support credit markets during the pandemic crisis the move completes the central bank s move away from market support programs it launched last year as part of a covid 19 relief program five of those emergency facilities expired in late 2020 the fed says that as corporate bond spreads widen the smccf portfolio sales will occur gradually and orderly and will aim to minimize the potential for any adverse impact on the bond markets including daily liquidity and trading conditions for etfs and corporate bonds corporate bonds appear to have taken the news in stride with the largest credit etf ishares iboxx investment grade corporate bond etf nysearca lqd slightly down the u s weekly fund flows insight report by refinitiv lipper ending june 2nd 2021 shows that lqd saw outflows of 605 million during the week lqd has 40 4b in assets under management aum which is perhaps to be expected considering that the fed s move to unwind its corporate bond portfolio is relatively minor compared to any future quantitative easing qe measures it might unveil in the future as per the central bank s latest report the fed owned 13 8 billion in bonds and bond etfs a minuscule percentage of the overall corporate bond market of more than 10 trillion according to the securities industry and financial markets association fed s holdings make up between 0 5 and 7 2 of each fund s market capitalization surprise move wall street has taken divergent views of the fed s latest mini qe bank of america strategists have raised concerns about the move pointing at the fed s checkered track record when it comes to qe programs clearly the fed has little in terms of a successful track record in selling assets and also by far most of the time merely adjusts policy to market expectations this is why the fed s announcement today which was 100 surprising to begin gradually selling their portfolio of corporate debt acquired during the liquidity crisis last year is very negative for risk assets clearly the fed feels sufficiently emboldened by the scarcity of credit assets in the front end of the curve and high valuations to be comfortable testing markets in this way the bank has said citigroup etf strategists have adopted a more positive stance labeling the fed s timing a bit surprising but not unreasonable citigroup had originally estimated that it would take years to fully unwind the emergency portfolio however the bank says that a more speedy unwind of etfs does help ensure a profit is returned to the treasury which is definitely a bonus from the facility citigroup does note that messaging and concerns of further monetary policy tightening could make investors somewhat nervous hence some modest softness in credit etfs today although the fed has in the past been clear that its qe policy will only change when the data on unemployment and inflation changes pressure from this policy is gradually building in the banking sector as well as the treasury and repo markets goldman sachs jpmorgan citi and morgan stanley have talked about the stress being put upon their institutions by the more than 3 trillion of bank reserves created by the fed in 2020 the fed has continued buying bonds at a tepid pace of 120 billion a month with fed chairman jerome powell maintaining it is still too early to even talk about tapering unfortunately this wall of deposited liquidity means that the wall street banks must issue billions in bonds and preferred equity in a bid to try and stay within their supplementary leverage ratios slrs the march 2021 expiration of the exemption on u s securities and deposits held at fed banks in banks total leverage exposure has only made that exercise harder by alex kimani for safehaven com

wind turbine components are ready to be shipped from a dock in lianyungang jiangsu province on thursday measures needed to support recovery contain downside risks say experts china is likely to fine tune its economic policies by injecting sufficient liquidity and accelerating fiscal spending to support economic recovery and contain downside risks amid surging commodity prices as growth slowed in the second quarter economists said china s gross domestic product expanded 12 7 percent year on year in the first half of 2021 and the country s gdp rose 7 9 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier the national bureau of statistics said on thursday the 7 9 percent economic growth rate was slightly below market expectations and it decelerated from the 18 3 percent growth recorded in the first quarter economists said the growth deceleration was due to the higher base in the second quarter of last year as the chinese economy rebounded strongly from a historic contraction of 6 8 percent in the first quarter of 2020 when business activities were disrupted by the covid 19 pandemic they said the slower growth does not mean that the prospects for the chinese economy have worsened as the latest economic data still points to stable and steady growth momentum for the world s second largest economy on a quarterly basis china s gdp grew 1 3 percent in the second quarter compared with the 0 6 percent first quarter increase according to the nbs retail sales grew faster than expected rising 12 1 percent year on year in june while industrial production increased 8 3 percent from a year ago china has managed to maintain a relatively high growth rate in the first half of the year if we look at the gdp data on a quarterly basis the notable growth in the second quarter means that the trend of steady economic growth has not changed said yu miaojie deputy dean of peking university s national school of development but economists see rising pressure on the recovery of the chinese economy amid soaring raw material prices and the possible policy shift of the federal reserve of the united states against the backdrop of rising inflation and the improved employment outlook in the us such a trend may prompt china s policymakers to pay more attention to the downside risks and roll out more supportive measures to boost domestic demand and private consumption and to further unleash the country s growth potential they said one potential risk is the rising commodity prices in the international market which will lead to higher costs for companies and squeeze their profit margins yu said china s monetary policy will continue to be prudent while policymakers will work to ensure a reasonable increase of social financing and money supply to drive economic growth in the second half of the year most economists saw the recent move by china s central bank to cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks as a forerunner of beijing s policy adjustment in the second half of the year but they do not view the rrr cut as the start of a new round of massive policy easing china s monetary policy will likely be more flexible with appropriate fine tuning in the second half of the year it will focus on increasing liquidity while maintaining the prudent stance and overall stability said robin xing chief china economist at morgan stanley china still has greater policy room than some developed economies which have almost exhausted their policy tools he said wen bin chief researcher at china minsheng bank said that china s policymakers will step up monetary support to help smaller businesses offset the impact of rising commodity prices while expanding fiscal spending and increasing the issuance of local government bonds to boost the role of investment as a key growth driver

by indradip ghosh and shrutee sarkar bengaluru reuters the federal reserve will shutter its asset purchases programme by end 2022 according to a reuters poll with a few more economists now predicting a rate hike as early as next year but they pegged new covid 19 variants as the biggest economic risk however fed chair jerome powell said on wednesday withdrawing monetary policy support was a long way off with 7 5 million jobs still missing from before the pandemic following his testimony where he also concluded that high inflation would be transitory the u s 10 year yield and the greenback declined while stocks rose the july 12 15 poll of over 100 economists showed the u s economy would grow at a healthy pace and also that elevated inflation would prevail longer than previously expected last month a majority of economists had predicted the fed would announce a taper plan to its 120 billion monthly asset purchases sometime this year with the withdrawal to start early next year all but two of 41 economists who answered an additional question said the fed will have completely stopped its pandemic support bond buys by end 2022 that included three economists who expected a complete withdrawal by the end of this year we continue to doubt the fed s narrative that inflation is transitory and instead see the risks it stays elevated for many more months said james knightley chief international economist at ing in new york consequently there appears little reason to continue with the fed s qe asset purchases only two respondents expected the fed s quantitative easing qe programme to end later in early 2023 reuters poll graphic on the u s economic and monetary policy outlook the core personal consumption expenditures price index the fed s preferred inflation gauge which recorded its biggest surge since april 1992 in may was expected to remain on average above 3 in each quarter in 2021 and early next year higher than last month s prediction across 2021 that measure of inflation was forecast to average 2 9 while inflation was then predicted to ease to average 2 3 and 2 1 in 2022 and 2023 respectively it would be above the fed s target rate of 2 0 on benchmark interest rates the poll consensus pointed to no change through to the end of next year but a larger number of economists polled predicted at least one 25 basis point rise in the federal funds rate by end 2022 compared to last month the median of a smaller sample showed two rate hikes in 2023 lining up with the fed s own dot plots compared to just one 25 basis points increase predicted in june u s policymakers have shifted their viewpoint to a 2023 start point for interest rate increases but we think that is too late added ing s knightley who predicts two rate hikes in the second half of 2022 reuters poll graphic on the u s inflation economic growth and unemployment outlook despite expectations for a robust economic recovery and about an average 400 000 jobs to be added monthly through to q4 2022 the u s unemployment rate was predicted to remain above its pre pandemic level of 3 5 until 2024 at least the u s economy after having likely expanded at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 9 5 last quarter was forecast to grow 7 1 and 5 0 in the current quarter and next respectively asked about the biggest risk to the u s economy this year 60 of economists or 30 of 50 said the spread of new variants of covid 19 over one fourth or 13 economists said high inflation while five said either the fed s taper or a slower rate of economic growth for other stories from the reuters global economic poll reporting by indradip ghosh and shrutee sarkar polling by manjul paul and hari kishan editing by rahul karunakar and chizu nomiyama
tortolita and casas adobes have a lot of similarities and differences by emil franzi arizona s two latest incorporated communities casas adobes and tortolita have a lot in common both were incorporated under the 1997 state law eliminating the need to apply for permission from other cities within six miles exist under a cloud while the question of the constitutionality of that law and the 1961 law setting up those disenfranchisement zones wind through the courts are hobbled by an inability to raise cash while the lawsuits continue face an immediate problem concerning the funding of a special census needed to secure full revenue sharing and have tucson marana and oro valley trying to eliminate them but that s where the similarities end tortolita has clearly defined goals a unified population that overwhelmingly supports the incorporation and a representative council chosen in open meeting by its own residents casas adobes on the other hand managed to secure the votes of a bare majority of its citizens has multiple factions on the pro incorporation side alone and has a divided council whose members barely know each other and were chosen somewhat haphazardly by the pima county board of supervisors also tortolita has about 3 000 people living on 21 square miles while casas adobe has a population of 58 000 the eighth largest in arizona and 26 square miles the purpose of the two incorporations differed vastly tortolita residents clearly wish to preserve a desert lifestyle and what s left of the environment on the northwest side and they could care less about receiving additional governmental services but casas adobes leaders had grandiose plans for more roads libraries parks and other goodies furthermore casas adobes was formed to increase services by keeping sales tax revenues away from marana and oro valley casas adobes was designed to be developer friendly tortolita was designed to restrain growth while on the surface it may appear casas adobes has all the advantages it doesn t tortolita s problems are external casas adobes faces not only external threats but internal dissension the difference here stems from the manner in which the two towns were formed no sharper contrast exists than the attitude of the two incorporation committees tortolita s was wide open the steering committee met openly and often and included anybody who wanted to participate the final membership was 37 another 56 people passed petitions and more than 100 folks gave financial donations but casas adobes ultimately had a core decision making group of five who split three to two on many issues held most of their meetings in secrecy literally chased people off and left a bad taste in the mouths of many potential supporters they dealt duplicitously with tortolita filed an unnecessary lawsuit against their neighbors in that community and then pig headedly refused to drop the suit when its issues became moot only to see a judge dismiss it as irrelevant this ill considered action simply raised the legal bills for both towns and exemplified the mentality of those self proclaimed leaders called the casas adobes gang of three jeff coleman tim brown and scott nelson the biggest difference between these two towns was the attitude of their founders tortolita with 3 000 people forged consensus casas adobes with almost 60 000 was usurped by the gang of three tortolita was a textbook case of citizen participation casas adobes was a classic case of insider dealing replete with intrigue exclusionism and a host of hidden agendas for which that city is now paying the price tortolita s unified and representative council hit the ground running within two days as soon as they could post the first meeting council members had outlined their needs and requirements and hired bill risner as their town attorney the first priority of both towns is staying alive and that requires legal assistance risner was the attorney for the incorporation committee and there was no question among tortolitans that he would be kept on in fact he s so popular in tortolita that they ll probably name their first park or government building in his honor that is if they ever get around to having a park or a government building but casas adobes has no such consensus over the attorney for their incorporation committee greg good who is seen by many as the mouthpiece for the gang of three he was appointed village attorney for the first meeting only because he was the only candidate willing to serve on the promise of being paid sometime in the future even if he secures the permanent appointment or is kept on by the council through the pending court cases he s worked for the incorporation committee he faces the problem of a lack of trust by many council members and citizens a town that doesn t feel confident in its own lawyer has real problems both incorporation committees ran up large legal bills that cannot be paid by the towns taxpayers tortolita owed risner and other lawyers more than 10 000 and casas adobes reportedly owes good 20 000 to 30 000 tortolita residents threw a party attended by more than 1 100 people and paid their legal bills by raising 12 000 meanwhile the casa adobes incorporation committee must now figure out how to pay that pre incorporation tab because the real committee who made all the real decisions such as hiring good and having him file the stupid lawsuit against tortolita consisted of five people two of whom dissented the one consensus in the rest of the community is that the exclusionist gang of three should eat the bill they incurred but with no real constituency it will be difficult for them to pull off a town fund raiser some think the deal was for the new council to appoint good as town attorney and get him to forgive the incorporation bill but none of the five power brokers are on the council and only one member of the non decision making portion of their committee chris stock was chosen as a council person other casas adobes council members include moderates mayor don burtchin vice mayor marty kramer asa bushnell and mary schuh a hard nosed opponent of incorporation in the first place add a couple of wild cards like eugene kelly and michelle phillips and you begin to see the other major internal problem in casas adobes a council with some very good people on it who barely know each other and that means it will take a while before they all start operating on the same frequency the casas adobes incorporation committee s original plan was to immediately implement a 2 percent sales tax it didn t happen although stock is still pushing the idea meanwhile the rest of the council wants to proceed slowly or in schuh s case barely proceed at all she favors the idea of a town without debt with no income and no spending which of course raises the question how do you have an incorporated town at all without the basics such as liability insurance both casas adobes and tortolita face the problem of borrowing to pay the feds for a special census necessary to get increased state revenue sharing both towns incorporation committees based future municipal budget plans on estimates of current populations far greater than those counted in the 1990 census being larger casas adobes needs to front about 150 000 by december 15 while tortolita needs 15 000 the tortolita town council has already passed a budget similar to the one drafted by its incorporation committee casas adobes however must hold hearings and go through a 30 day budget process something that will drive great holes in the grandiose plans and pre cut deals of the gang of three individual tortolita citizens are ready to underwrite their costs by co signing a bank note if necessary that would be all but impossible for casas adobes and having passed a budget tortolita may issue warrants government iou s that would be covered by the town s property owners via a special levy should a final disincorporation be ordered casas adobes can probably do the same but must adhere to a more stringent timeline because it s two months younger also tortolita was incorporated before the appellate court opinion making its actions unquestionably legal for at least two months because casas adobes was incorporated after the court ruling incorporation foes could easily challenge its official actions the two towns have one other great difference unlike casas adobes which was partially planned by land speculators and developers like don diamond who privately met with the gang of three to approve their final boundaries tortolita has the developers trying to kill them off another lawsuit actually drawn up by the attorneys for cleveland megafirm forest city has been filed by attorney general grant woods to disincorporate tortolita on the grounds that it isn t really a community and has the wrong attitude about massive development we re not making up that last one it s actually one of the arguments stated in the suit indicating just how tightly woods and his staff are in the pocket of private development interests tortolitans consider that lawsuit and its bizarre arguments to be a sick joke since anybody can tell they may be the only real community in this sprawling car culture megalopolis casas adobes while not facing a similar challenge must somehow overcome the problem of looking like a town despite its lack of consensus and common purpose with any luck however the casas adobes town council will be able to find some common ground and at least tread water until the court cases are resolved they ve hired good as town attorney on a 4 2 vote with stock absent and plunged into lengthy executive sessions on multiple issues not a good sign the casas adobes council must also supplant the gang of three as the dominant force by reworking major portions of the gang s agenda and presenting to the voters something reasonable and palatable
the new jersey department of agriculture wants new jersey residents to be on the lookout for the spotted lanternfly the invasive species is killing plants and spreading quickly through eight of new jersey s 21 counties the department of agriculture received 500 000 last month in a last minute budget add on to combat the insects some legislators mocked the move but the boost in funding will help the department fight back against an invasive pest that attacks more than 70 types of plants and could put the garden state s agriculture industry at risk it s a public menace and everybody can play a part says agriculture secretary douglas fisher the department has issued a kill on sight order against the spotted lanternfly kill the insects first and then give us a call later says division of plant industry director joseph zoltowski zoltowski says that the spotted lanternfly could destroy vineyards across new jersey if you re talking a vineyard and you have lots of feeding going on in the vineyard they could kill off your rootstock and once your root stock s gone it takes a good five years to get that rootstock back up so pretty much that vineyard s out of business he says originally from southeast asia the spotted lanternfly made its way to pennsylvania then new jersey eight of the state s 21 counties are in a quarantine zone because they exponentially are increasing each year we hear from communities around the state i got them fisher says it s almost like a forest fire it started here and it s spreading out says zoltowski the bugs can t fly until they reach adulthood in several weeks their feeding weakens plants when they excrete their sugary leavings attracts mold which smothers the tree plant or vine to death there is no predation going on so there s no predators and until somebody does something they just keep reproducing reproducing reproducing says zoltowski just squash it i don t care what you do with it just destroy it the extra dollars from the state will allow workers to spray more places to get rid of the bug the federal money they were using before could be used to spray the bugs only if they were on one plant an invasive plant species known as the tree of heaven related links
