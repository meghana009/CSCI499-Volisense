talk about a hair on fire reaction during her show on thursday msnbc host katy tur was frantic in her warning against allowing elon musk to purchase twitter her shrill declarations ranged from claiming he was going to charge for access to real and devastating plus life and globe altering consequences if musk obtained the site and allowed free speech to flourish without evidence tur began the segment by suggesting if musk gets his way he was going to make twitter a pay to access service will you soon have to pay to use twitter if elon musk gets his way maybe he s trying to buy the platform she declared and despite announcing here s what he said about it just moments ago the soundbite she played had nothing about a subscription model or anything that would indicate musk would charge to use twitter twitter has become effectually the de facto town square so it s really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they re able to speak freely within the bounds of the law and so one of the things i believe twitter should do is open source the algorithm tur spoke with new york times contributor kara swisher who claimed the richest man in the world couldn t afford to buy twitter i think he s much more serious than that but i am not sure he can afford it even though he said it onstage i don t think he can he puts his other companies at great risk she said at one point tur let it be known that one of her big concerns as a member of the media was musk allowing somebody like donald trump back on the platform swisher noted that musk had objected to trump s ban at the time but suggested musk wouldn t be able to live up to his free speech idealism once he realized what it took to run a social media company you know he sort of dabbles in this area and talks about free speech but he has never run a social media platform which is like descending into a potential cesspool so i think he would find it quite a bit harder running it to figure out what should be done and what should not it s easier to sort of make you know make a lot of observations from the sidelines and he s good the that i think running it is another story it s so tricky kara because there are real and devastating consequences for using that platform to lie tur lamented hinting that there would be more if musk took control but there are massive life and globe altering consequences for just letting people run wild on the thing ironically twitter is the site that carried out a soviet style crackdown on the totally legitimate hunter biden laptop story at the end of the segment tur noted that musk also hinted at a plan b if the board rejected his offer and swisher said he sounded like a supervillain or a hero like tony stark from marvel this hair in fire fearmongering was made possible because of lucrative sponsorships form applebee s and ups their contact information is linked the transcript is below click expand to read
in 10 days tesla ceo elon musk has gone from popular twitter contributor and critic to the company s largest individual shareholder to a would be owner of the social platform a whirlwind of activity that could change the service dramatically given the sometimes whimsical billionaire s self identification as a free speech absolutist twitter revealed in a securities filing thursday that musk has offered to buy the company outright for more than 43 billion saying the social media platform needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with its users i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy musk said in the filing i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form later in the day during an onstage interview at the ted 2022 conference he went even broader having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization since it burst onto the scene in 2006 twitter has been home to flourishing social and political commentary shared news scandal gossip cat memes and dress color arguments but it has also provided a platform for viral misinformation and lies bullying and hate speech and gangs of trolls who can shout down posters they disagree with by unleashing tidal waves of vile images threats and similar acts of online aggression twitter has devoted a substantial amount of effort to stanching the latter while preserving the former though not always in ways that satisfy most users like other platforms it has established restrictions on tweets that threaten violence incite hatred bully others and spread misinformation such rules drove twitter s decision to ban former president donald trump following the 2021 capitol insurrection twitter has also become a destination for brands and advertisers many of whom prefer stronger content restrictions and a megaphone for high profile figures like trump and musk who s used it to rally supporters and promote business ventures musk who described twitter as a de facto town square detailed some specific potential changes thursday like favoring temporary rather than permanent bans but has mostly described his aim in broad and abstract terms he said he wanted to open up the black box of artificial intelligence technology driving twitter s feed so that people would have more transparency about why some tweets might go viral and others might disappear i wouldn t personally be in there editing tweets he said but you would know if something was done to promote demote or otherwise affect a tweet the billionaire has been a vocal critic of twitter mostly over his stated belief that it falls short on free speech principles the social media platform has angered followers of trump and other right wing political figures who ve had their accounts suspended for violating its content standards on violence hate or harmful misinformation musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist but is also known for blocking other twitter users who question or disagree with him while twitter s user base remains much smaller than those of rivals such as facebook and tiktok the service is popular with celebrities world leaders journalists and intellectuals musk himself has more than 81 million followers rivaling pop stars such as lady gaga twitter shares closed at 45 08 down just under 2 well below musk s offer of 54 20 per share that s generally a sign that some investors doubt the deal will go through the stock remains down from its 52 week high of about 73 musk called that price his final offer although he provided no details on financing the offer is non binding and subject to financing and other conditions twitter said it will decide whether accepting the offer is in the best interests of shareholders it s unclear though just how twitter s board will react after evaluating the offer it likely will negotiate seeking a higher price per share or it may want provisions to ensure that the board remains independent of musk said john coffee a professor at columbia university s law school and head of its corporate governance center the board could adopt poison pill provisions to offer more shares and dilute the value of musk s holdings if musk s stake grows to 10 or 15 coffee said even then musk could still take over the company with a proxy fight by voting out the current directors at the ted conference musk said he has the money i could technically afford it he said to laughs should musk go through with his takeover attempt he likely could raise the roughly 43 billion he needs possibly by borrowing billions using his stakes in tesla and spacex as collateral most of musk s fortune estimated by forbes to be nearly 265 billion is tied up in shares of tesla the company allows executive officers to use shares as collateral for loans but limits the borrowing to 25 of the value of the pledged shares data provider factset says musk owns 172 6 million shares worth 176 47 billion just over 51 of his stake already is pledged as collateral according to a tesla proxy statement that means musk could use the remaining stake to borrow about 21 5 billion he also could borrow on his stake in privately held spacex musk revealed in regulatory filings over recent weeks that he d been buying twitter shares in almost daily batches starting jan 31 ending up with a stake of about 9 only vanguard group controls more twitter shares a lawsuit filed tuesday in new york federal court alleged musk illegally delayed disclosing his stake in the social media company so he could buy more shares at lower prices the u s securities and exchange commission could punish musk for hurting other investors by taking too long to disclose his buying up of twitter shares but it s unlikely that it will do anything to stop a takeover said chester spatt a former sec chief economist this is going to play out reasonably quickly said spatt now a finance professor at carnegie mellon university jacob frenkel a former sec enforcement attorney now with the dickinson wright law firm in washington said it is difficult to prove an investor s intent in disclosure cases the mere fact of the violation around the disclosure does not mean that there was fraud frenkel said however there is plenty of fodder for an investigation into whether anyone with knowledge of musk s share purchases traded in the stock before musk s public disclosures frenkel said after musk announced his stake twitter quickly offered him a seat on its board on the condition that he not own more than 14 9 of the company s outstanding stock but the company said five days later that he d declined the decision coincided with a barrage of now deleted and not always serious tweets from musk proposing major changes to the company such as dropping ads its chief source of revenue and transforming its san francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter the turnabout led ceo parag agrawal to warn employees earlier this week that there will be distractions ahead and to tune out the noise and stay focused on the work twitter hasn t done as well as its social media rivals and lost money last year the company reported a net loss of 221 million for 2021 largely tied to the settlement of a lawsuit by shareholders who said the company misled investors about how much its user base was growing and how much users interacted with its platform its co founder jack dorsey resigned as ceo in late november and was replaced by agrawal i m not saying i have all the answers here but i do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things and just be very cautious with permanent bans musk said it won t be perfect he said but there should be a perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible

an invasion of ukraine that has not gone according to russia s plans took another high profile hit thursday as the flagship of the kremlin s black sea fleet sank and president biden hinted that he may visit ukraine in the coming days to bolster the government of president volodymyr zelenskyy mr biden mentioned a possible trip to white house reporters just hours before the russian defense ministry confirmed that the guided missile cruiser moskva had sunk officials in southern ukraine said a homemade neptune missile had severely crippled the warship pentagon officials said they could not confirm what caused a massive fire aboard the heavily armed vessel with a crew of 500 sailors but it sank after russians unsuccessfully tried to tow it out of ukrainian waters and back to russian controlled crimea for repairs the moskva lost its stability when it was towed to the port because of the damage to the ship s hull that it received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition in stormy sea conditions the ship sank the russian defense ministry said in a statement the moskva was one of just three warships of its class in the russian navy russian forces were regrouping and redeploying for an expected offensive after the initial phase of their invasion on feb 24 stalled badly outside kyiv and other major cities of the north see also doj charges russian lawmaker staff in conspiracy to influence congress oleksiy arestovych an adviser to ukraine s president called the ship s sinking an event of colossal significance acknowledging that u s officials were still trying to determine exactly what had happened to the moskva white house national security adviser jake sullivan said certainly the way this unfolded it s a big blow to russia armed with 16 long range cruise missiles deck guns torpedoes and mortars the moskva was considered the premier vessel in the russian black sea fleet which has largely bottled up ukraine s navy since the fighting began the moskva took part in the operation when mr putin seized crimea from ukraine in 2014 and saw action as part of the russian military force backing president bashar assad in syria s brutal civil war russian president vladimir putin is said to be feeling a growing sense of urgency to show progress in the military campaign as his forces batter ukrainian towns but recent days have brought some ominous developments the pentagon confirmed thursday that it was organizing a training mission for ukrainian troops to use a package of sophisticated anti tank missiles and other weaponry mr putin s top aides reacted angrily to news that sweden and finland were seriously considering applying to join the nato alliance soon see also moscow escalates disinformation campaign in u s the biden administration has committed more than 3 2 billion in security assistance to ukraine about 2 6 billion of which was approved since the war began the list includes big ticket items such as 18 155 mm howitzers and 40 000 artillery rounds 11 russian made mi 17 helicopters originally intended for the former afghan government and 200 m 113 armored personnel carriers we re working very hard at sourcing these things and getting them on the way to ukraine as quickly as possible chief pentagon spokesman john kirby told reporters a trip by mr biden or another senior u s official to kyiv would come on the heels of visits by british prime minister boris johnson and eastern european nato leaders to the now more secure ukrainian capital mr biden who briefly crossed the ukrainian border on a visit to poland late last month hinted about the trip while talking to reporters shortly before he boarded air force one for a trip to north carolina asked whether a top u s official would be going to kyiv mr biden replied we re making that decision now asked whether he was ready to go the president answered yes threatening nato mr putin said repeatedly that one reason for the special military operation in ukraine was to prevent the onetime soviet republic from joining nato the prospect that sweden and finland which have long remained officially neutral while having some ties to the western military alliance would drop their historical reluctance to apply for nato membership clearly set off alarm bells in the kremlin former russian president dmitry medvedev now a top security adviser to mr putin vowed that russia would beef up its military forces along its western borders if sweden and finland join nato he said russia would increase the number of ground troops and air defense systems in the region and deploy substantial naval forces in the gulf of finland a longtime ally of mr putin and now deputy chairman of russia s security council mr medvedev noted that the inclusion of finland and sweden would more than double nato s land border with russia naturally it will be necessary to strengthen those borders he said according to the state owned tass news agency mr medvedev denied that russia s nearly 2 month old invasion of neighboring ukraine triggered the shift by sweden and finland which have both shown popular support for nato since february the attempts to drag them into the alliance were made before he said secondly which is the main thing we do not have territorial disputes with these countries like with ukraine this is why the value of such membership is different for us nuclear threats mr medvedev who has issued a series of incendiary comments since the fighting in ukraine began also threatened to expand russia s nuclear assets around the baltic sea if the two countries are admitted to the alliance if this is the case there can no longer be talk about the baltic s non nuclear status the balance must be restored he warned according to tass nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said last year that the alliance would welcome a bid by sweden or finland to join nato and repeated last week that the door was open despite russian opposition it is for finland and sweden to decide whether they would like to apply for membership or not and we will respect that decision mr stoltenberg told reporters in brussels last week if they decide to apply i expect that all allies will welcome them finnish prime minister sanna marin meeting with her swedish counterpart wednesday said helsinki would decide whether to apply for nato membership within weeks rather than months cia director william j burns in some of his most expansive public comments to date on the war told a forum at the georgia institute of technology that the nuclear warnings by mr medvedev and other senior russian officials had to be taken seriously because of mr putin s rising desperation over a war gone bad and because of russia s arsenal or lower yield tactical nuclear weapons he might be tempted to use mr putin put his nuclear forces on an unspecified higher alert status as western nations rushed to aid ukraine in the invasion s early days none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low yield nuclear weapons mr burns said he acknowledged that u s intelligence analysts haven t seen a lot of practical evidence of the kind of deployments or military dispositions that would reinforce those concerns according to an account of his remarks by the reuters news agency separately the pentagon revealed that u s officials in europe are setting up training programs to show ukrainian soldiers how to operate some of the military supplies being sent to them as part of the just approved 800 million security assistance package training the trainers a senior u s defense official told reporters in washington that ukrainian troops will likely require instruction to use the artillery and radar systems included on the list ukraine will receive 18 towed howitzers along with 40 000 artillery rounds 10 an tpq 36 counter artillery radars and two an mpq 64 sentinel air surveillance radars u s and allied supplies are credited with aiding the surprisingly tough resistance the ukrainians have put up to date against a larger and better armed russian invading force we do not assess that it s going to take longer than a few days max to get them trained up on those systems the senior defense official told reporters air force gen tod d wolters who wears two hats as head of u s european command and nato s supreme allied commander is in charge of the training requirements they will likely choose ukrainian soldiers who already have some level of experience with artillery and radar to receive the training on the specifics of the american systems in the package pentagon officials said it s a train the trainers approach we re not pulling out of ukraine an exorbitant number of fighters they don t think this training is going to take very long to conduct the senior defense official said at a pentagon background briefing mr zelenskyy has repeatedly pressed nato countries for more weapons to continue his nation s fight against russia mr biden and other nato leaders have ruled out contributing troops to the fight or establishing a no fly zone over the former soviet republic for fear of sparking a direct shooting war with moscow u s officials continue to locate the items on the latest list which also includes 11 soviet era mi 17 helicopters and such u s sourced weapons as 200 m113 armored personnel carriers 500 javelin missiles and thousands of other anti armor systems every single item is not going to have to come from the united states some could come from prepositioned stocks that are elsewhere the senior defense official said the first weapons and tactical equipment on the list could be in the hands of ukrainian soldiers in about a week officials said this article is based in

retailers across the country have been reporting a baby formula shortage and it s not just supply chain issues abbott nutrition voluntarily recalled some of its powdered infant formulas in february due to possible bacteria contamination the recall directly affects bad batches of similac alimentum and elecare brand formulas manufactured at abbott s sturgis michigan plant but it also increased demand for other formula brands as parents switched products the state department of health administers the federal special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children also known as wic the program is different from the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps and commonly referred to as snap while snap recipients receive a set amount of money to spend on certain foods wic offers benefits for certain types and amounts of food items such as milk bread beans cereal and baby formula lorilyn salamanca a public health nutritionist with the office said about half the infants born in hawaiʻi are on wic but the shortage issue impacts all families not just wic families the office has been helping families find alternatives it s definitely difficult to predict what s going to be on the shelves salamanca told the conversation we can talk to our vendors and we have an idea of what stock they have but it depends on the day customers are going in for their purchasing so it s hard to really know exactly how much there is only specific brands products and sizes are eligible to be purchased through wic but with the recent shortage salamanca said they have been given a list of substitutes that would not normally qualify for wic blankita_ua via pixabay when they get to the store depending on what s on the shelf they would be able to pick up anything that s on that list salamanca said there s still a challenge because not all stores source all those different brands so there s still that kind of shopping around going from store to store to see who has it there are still cases where we re really not able to find certain formulas she said and it s more often with the more specialized formulas which is scary since those infants or those children tend to have more health issues salamanca said families should talk with their provider about recommended alternative formulas you should not dilute formula to make it last longer because that puts the baby at risk of malnourishment she said more information about the baby formula recall and wic can be found at health hawaii gov wic this interview aired on the conversation on april 14 2022 the conversation airs weekdays at 11 a m on hpr 1
enjoy complimentary access to top ideas and insights selected by our editors two years ago the financial markets were flooded with billions of newly minted dollars care of the federal open market committee in response to covid banks put aside 50 billion in loan loss reserves for potential defaults on mortgages and everything else due to the pandemic but thanks to the fomc the credit crisis was delayed for a couple of years quantitative easing or qe not only lowered interest rates but also suppressed residential loan defaults temporarily because of the fed s outsized response to covid interest rates on loans and also mortgage backed securities plummeted and home prices soared for a while mortgage bankers were selling government loans into ginnie mae 2 coupon mbs there are even a few ginnie 1 5s kicking around these securities will be around for many years even decades to come as prepayments slow to a crawl and extends the maturity of the mbs the u s central bank owns about two thirds of this ultra low coupon covid vintage production of mbs of note roughly one third of total system open market account soma holdings how and when the fed sells or does not sell part of its 2 7 trillion mortgage bond trove is a topic of conversation among the chattering classes on wall street but for mortgage bankers it is a crucial question the table below shows the total soma holdings the surfeit of income in the mortgage sector cause by the growth in the soma was a gift from the fed but what the lord giveth the lord may also taketh away now the fed is worried about inflation and is slowing purchases of mbs to only reinvestment of dwindling principal repayments soon the fed s soma will be running off with no reinvestment of principal prepayments from treasury securities or mbs because the fomc is raising the target for fed funds the on the run contract in the to be available market has gone from 2 and 2 5 mbs coupons to 4 5 and 5 tba pricing has gone from 3 to 4 point premiums to a discount the 10 year treasury is nearing a 3 yield a rather dramatic reversal from the under 1 performance during 2020 and rates are moving higher meanwhile mortgage lending volumes are falling with rising interest rates the fed s portfolio of mbs has seen a dramatic extension of average life for the underlying loans from somewhere in low to mid single digit years to more than a decade as the average life climbs so too does the volatility or duration of the mbs making the fed s low coupon portfolio particularly unattractive to mbs investors the big threat to the mortgage banking community comes from any future fed sales of mbs sales of low coupon mbs from the soma will push mortgage rates higher and faster than already seen these low coupon high beta securities are more volatile than the broad market difficult to hedge and will soon be underwater in terms of net carry bank of america projects 595 billion of net issuance and 2 trillion of gross mbs issuance in 2022 according to an april 8 research note so while the secondary mortgage market is shrinking compared with last year the fed may eventually try to sell amounts of older mbs that is equal to a large fraction of current production fed sales of mbs will also hurt banks many banks that chose to retain low coupon loans and mbs will soon be deeply underwater as durations explode the prospect of large fed sales of mbs is worrisome for the mortgage industry and housing regulators but selling low coupon mortgage debt is also a problem for the central bank every time the fed receives a prepayment or insurance payment at par for a ginnie mae 2 that originally cost 104 for example the fomc is recording a four point capital loss if the fed today sells a ginnie mae 2 mbs at 92 for example it will record a 12 point capital loss another problem for the industry arising from the end of qe is what to do with loans that were modified during the period of low interest rates during the covid mortgage forbearance timeframe with mortgage interest rates headed higher helping distressed consumers who have failed on their first loan modification is a challenge specifically how do you benefit a consumer with a delinquent 3 loan now that secondary market rates are nearing 6 servicers can modify a covid forbearance loan more than once but rising interest rates are forcing some consumers into a full doc process imagine you have a borrower that was on covid forbearance for 18 months then calls and says that they are still experiencing hardship and ask for another covid modification you modify the loan and put the arrearage on the back end but keep the old coupon rate on the new loan in order to help the consumer when you try to sell that newly modified 3 loan into the current market the price is in the low 90s and the servicer is facing a 10 000 cash loss on the sale of the loan will the federal housing administration or the gses reimburse the servicer for the loss specifically will the fha allow more than one partial claim for covid loans the answer seems to be no but nobody in the industry is quite sure this is an especially amusing question given that many observers are calling for a reduction in fha mortgage insurance premiums on government loans once president biden declares an end to the covid emergency the special servicing waterfalls for pandemic affected loans also go away government loans that qualified for covid forbearance will go down the traditional waterfall for fha foreclosure creating opportunities for the consumer financial protection bureau to penalize servicers for following the fha rules regarding loss mitigation although qe provided some respite for the u s economy during 2020 and 2021 now the bill is coming due as the fomc pivots aggressively to fighting inflation rising mortgage rates will lower lending volumes but increase the value of conventional and government mortgage servicing rights whereas investors considered the option to refinance loans as part of the calculus in purchasing msrs at premium prices over the past year today that option is worthless now considerations about the cost of loss mitigation on both conventional and ginnie mae msrs are coming back into focus loss mitigation lest we forget used to be about protecting note holders and taxpayers not consumers industry insiders tell nmn that roughly a third of the government loans that were modified during covid will re default meaning that servicers which bought ginnie mae msrs at a premium valuation may soon experience rising expenses and possibly negative returns conventional msrs will likely feel this impact as well thanks to qe since many fha borrowers were able to migrate to conventional loans without mortgage insurance the moral of the story is that fed s policy of qe is a decidedly blunt and double edged instrument the fed drove down mortgage interest rates during 2020 and 2021 pushing asset prices up and making default rates negative now this process is reversing and the challenges of the next few years could be as difficult as were the benefits of qe over the past 24 months at the end of the day there is no free lunch even if the fed pretends to pick up the tab

an invasion of ukraine that has not gone according to russia s plans took another high profile hit thursday as the flagship of the kremlin s black sea fleet sank and president biden hinted that he may visit ukraine in the coming days to bolster the government of president volodymyr zelenskyy mr biden mentioned a possible trip to white house reporters just hours before the russian defense ministry confirmed that the guided missile cruiser moskva had sunk officials in southern ukraine said a homemade neptune missile had severely crippled the warship pentagon officials said they could not confirm what caused a massive fire aboard the heavily armed vessel with a crew of 500 sailors but it sank after russians unsuccessfully tried to tow it out of ukrainian waters and back to russian controlled crimea for repairs the moskva lost its stability when it was towed to the port because of the damage to the ship s hull that it received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition in stormy sea conditions the ship sank the russian defense ministry said in a statement the moskva was one of just three warships of its class in the russian navy russian forces were regrouping and redeploying for an expected offensive after the initial phase of their invasion on feb 24 stalled badly outside kyiv and other major cities of the north see also doj charges russian lawmaker staff in conspiracy to influence congress oleksiy arestovych an adviser to ukraine s president called the ship s sinking an event of colossal significance acknowledging that u s officials were still trying to determine exactly what had happened to the moskva white house national security adviser jake sullivan said certainly the way this unfolded it s a big blow to russia armed with 16 long range cruise missiles deck guns torpedoes and mortars the moskva was considered the premier vessel in the russian black sea fleet which has largely bottled up ukraine s navy since the fighting began the moskva took part in the operation when mr putin seized crimea from ukraine in 2014 and saw action as part of the russian military force backing president bashar assad in syria s brutal civil war russian president vladimir putin is said to be feeling a growing sense of urgency to show progress in the military campaign as his forces batter ukrainian towns but recent days have brought some ominous developments the pentagon confirmed thursday that it was organizing a training mission for ukrainian troops to use a package of sophisticated anti tank missiles and other weaponry mr putin s top aides reacted angrily to news that sweden and finland were seriously considering applying to join the nato alliance soon see also moscow escalates disinformation campaign in u s the biden administration has committed more than 3 2 billion in security assistance to ukraine about 2 6 billion of which was approved since the war began the list includes big ticket items such as 18 155 mm howitzers and 40 000 artillery rounds 11 russian made mi 17 helicopters originally intended for the former afghan government and 200 m 113 armored personnel carriers we re working very hard at sourcing these things and getting them on the way to ukraine as quickly as possible chief pentagon spokesman john kirby told reporters a trip by mr biden or another senior u s official to kyiv would come on the heels of visits by british prime minister boris johnson and eastern european nato leaders to the now more secure ukrainian capital mr biden who briefly crossed the ukrainian border on a visit to poland late last month hinted about the trip while talking to reporters shortly before he boarded air force one for a trip to north carolina asked whether a top u s official would be going to kyiv mr biden replied we re making that decision now asked whether he was ready to go the president answered yes threatening nato mr putin said repeatedly that one reason for the special military operation in ukraine was to prevent the onetime soviet republic from joining nato the prospect that sweden and finland which have long remained officially neutral while having some ties to the western military alliance would drop their historical reluctance to apply for nato membership clearly set off alarm bells in the kremlin former russian president dmitry medvedev now a top security adviser to mr putin vowed that russia would beef up its military forces along its western borders if sweden and finland join nato he said russia would increase the number of ground troops and air defense systems in the region and deploy substantial naval forces in the gulf of finland a longtime ally of mr putin and now deputy chairman of russia s security council mr medvedev noted that the inclusion of finland and sweden would more than double nato s land border with russia naturally it will be necessary to strengthen those borders he said according to the state owned tass news agency mr medvedev denied that russia s nearly 2 month old invasion of neighboring ukraine triggered the shift by sweden and finland which have both shown popular support for nato since february the attempts to drag them into the alliance were made before he said secondly which is the main thing we do not have territorial disputes with these countries like with ukraine this is why the value of such membership is different for us nuclear threats mr medvedev who has issued a series of incendiary comments since the fighting in ukraine began also threatened to expand russia s nuclear assets around the baltic sea if the two countries are admitted to the alliance if this is the case there can no longer be talk about the baltic s non nuclear status the balance must be restored he warned according to tass nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said last year that the alliance would welcome a bid by sweden or finland to join nato and repeated last week that the door was open despite russian opposition it is for finland and sweden to decide whether they would like to apply for membership or not and we will respect that decision mr stoltenberg told reporters in brussels last week if they decide to apply i expect that all allies will welcome them finnish prime minister sanna marin meeting with her swedish counterpart wednesday said helsinki would decide whether to apply for nato membership within weeks rather than months cia director william j burns in some of his most expansive public comments to date on the war told a forum at the georgia institute of technology that the nuclear warnings by mr medvedev and other senior russian officials had to be taken seriously because of mr putin s rising desperation over a war gone bad and because of russia s arsenal or lower yield tactical nuclear weapons he might be tempted to use mr putin put his nuclear forces on an unspecified higher alert status as western nations rushed to aid ukraine in the invasion s early days none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low yield nuclear weapons mr burns said he acknowledged that u s intelligence analysts haven t seen a lot of practical evidence of the kind of deployments or military dispositions that would reinforce those concerns according to an account of his remarks by the reuters news agency separately the pentagon revealed that u s officials in europe are setting up training programs to show ukrainian soldiers how to operate some of the military supplies being sent to them as part of the just approved 800 million security assistance package training the trainers a senior u s defense official told reporters in washington that ukrainian troops will likely require instruction to use the artillery and radar systems included on the list ukraine will receive 18 towed howitzers along with 40 000 artillery rounds 10 an tpq 36 counter artillery radars and two an mpq 64 sentinel air surveillance radars u s and allied supplies are credited with aiding the surprisingly tough resistance the ukrainians have put up to date against a larger and better armed russian invading force we do not assess that it s going to take longer than a few days max to get them trained up on those systems the senior defense official told reporters air force gen tod d wolters who wears two hats as head of u s european command and nato s supreme allied commander is in charge of the training requirements they will likely choose ukrainian soldiers who already have some level of experience with artillery and radar to receive the training on the specifics of the american systems in the package pentagon officials said it s a train the trainers approach we re not pulling out of ukraine an exorbitant number of fighters they don t think this training is going to take very long to conduct the senior defense official said at a pentagon background briefing mr zelenskyy has repeatedly pressed nato countries for more weapons to continue his nation s fight against russia mr biden and other nato leaders have ruled out contributing troops to the fight or establishing a no fly zone over the former soviet republic for fear of sparking a direct shooting war with moscow u s officials continue to locate the items on the latest list which also includes 11 soviet era mi 17 helicopters and such u s sourced weapons as 200 m113 armored personnel carriers 500 javelin missiles and thousands of other anti armor systems every single item is not going to have to come from the united states some could come from prepositioned stocks that are elsewhere the senior defense official said the first weapons and tactical equipment on the list could be in the hands of ukrainian soldiers in about a week officials said this article is based in

musk swoops on twitter with 31bn takeover bid tesla tycoon hints he might dump his 9 2 stake if best and final offer is not accepted elon musk yesterday pounced on twitter with a 31 4billion bid to take the social media giant off the stock market the tesla tycoon s offer of 54 20 a share comes just days after he rejected an invitation to join the company s board the bid represents a 38 per cent premium to twitter s closing price on april 1 the last trading day before it was revealed that the billionaire had become the social media site s biggest shareholder with a stake of more than 9 per cent the world s richest man disclosed the offer in a regulatory filing saying he is the right person to unlock the social media platform s extraordinary potential the move would transform the tech

to twitter chairman bret taylor musk set out his reason for the offer he wrote i invested in twitter as i believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech and i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy however since making my investment i now realise the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form twitter needs to be transformed as a private company but he hinted that he could walk away if the deal fell through he added my offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted i would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder in a statement twitter confirmed that it had received an unsolicited non binding proposal from 50 year old musk to acquire the company the twitter board of directors will carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all twitter stockholders shares in new york initially shot higher by more than 5 per cent when news of the offer was made public but fell back later in the session to finish down 1 7 per cent at 45 08 shares fell after analysts said the move was hostile and questioned

back at al waleed bin talal who owns kingdom holding company saying interesting just two questions if i may how much of twitter does the kingdom own directly and indirectly what are the kingdom s views on journalistic freedom of speech this tweet was followed by a separate post from musk who said it would be utterly indefensible for twitter not to put his offer to a shareholder vote he said they own the company not the board of directors if the deal was pushed through there are also question marks over whether twitter s chief executive parag agrawal would stay on agrawal 37 who took over in november has history with musk in december musk compared agrawal to joseph stalin superimposing his face on a famous photo of the soviet dictator over his approach to free speech agrawal hit back over musk s decision to decline a seat on the firm s board earlier this week he referred to musk as a distraction telling twitter s supporters to tune out the noise and focus on the social media giant s work musk also caused doubt about the deal after speaking at a ted conference in vancouver following the announcement musk said he had sufficient assets to fund the deal before quipping that i m not sure that i will actually be able to acquire it he added at the conference that he had a plan b if the bid was not successful although he did not elaborate further he also said that twitter should avoid deleting posts and advocated for time outs over permanent bans a position that could ultimately pave the way for a return of banned figures such as former us president donald trump to the platform twitter based in san francisco owns one of the world s largest social networks it was set up in 2006 and makes most of its money through advertising the group went public in november 2013 musk is the world s richest man with a personal fortune of 209billion according to forbes following the extraordinary rally of shares in tesla which is now worth nearly 1 trillion pounds musk noted that his 54 20 per share offer amounted to a 54 per cent premium on where twitter was trading in january when he started buying shares shares in twitter are up almost a fifth on where they were before musk s stake was first disclosed but they are down 40 per cent from the record high of 77 63 they scaled last march

china s state run propaganda newspaper global times on wednesday blamed american sanctions on russia due to the war in ukraine for sri lanka s increasingly dire economic disaster a disaster greatly exacerbated by the country taking out predatory loans from china the global times acknowledged the loans and sri lanka s enthusiastic participation in the belt and road initiative bri a global plan to erode the sovereignty of impoverished states by offering predatory loans to be used to pay china for infrastructure projects in sri lanka the government was forced to hand over its critical hambantota seaport to the communist party in 2017 after it defaulted on its prodigious debt to china and still struggles to make its payments to beijing nationwide protests have rocked sri lanka in the past month as the price of living soared hospitals ran out of medicine and canceled surgeries gas stations ran out of fuel and markets grew increasingly empty protesters have attempted to storm president gotabaya rajapaksa s home and have now established a permanent protest camp demanding he prime minister mahinda rajapaksa and every rajapaksa family member in government resign regarding the rajapaksa family gotabaya and mahinda are brothers and another 40 rajapaksas have enjoyed national government posts in the past decade they have dominated sri lankan politics since mahinda as president ended the 26 year war between the government and the tamil tigers organization protesters routinely condemn the rajapaksa oligarchy for overspending borrowing too much from china and now failing to have enough money to secure basic food and medicine supplies as sri lanka is a democratic socialist republic colombo and not private corporations is responsible for said purchases no protest against the government has displayed any significant opposition to the united states nor has the opposition movement cited america as a meaningful actor in the crisis in any way the rajapaksa regime announced this week that it would default on its foreign debts to use the money that would have gone to those payments to buy food and medicine the global times made the effort to tie the sri lankan socialist crisis to washington and bizarrely kyiv claiming that russian sanctions had devastated the sri lankan economy the russia ukraine conflict and the us led economic sanctions against russia may have further aggravated sri lanka s economic plight the chinese state outlet asserted this week the deteriorating economic crisis in the south asian nation is a typical example of how emerging economies especially those small and vulnerable ones are suffering from the shocks from the reckless western economic sanctions while the west claimed their sanctions are against russia they are seriously harming the interests of developing economies and may even cause a widespread humanitarian crisis the global times claimed the outlet added that the sri lankan crisis should serve as a wake up call for the global economy especially the developing world that is exposed to the growing external risks from geopolitical turbulence instigated by the us led west china certainly does not want to see sri lanka stuck in an economic crisis and would help wherever it can especially when it comes to addressing its economic challenges it continued however in a broader sense developing countries especially those in the asia pacific region should step up and work jointly to fend off risks posed by toxic policies pushed by the us and its western allies the global times admitted that most objective international observers consider the bri and china s debt traps a meaningful contributor to the sri lankan economic crisis but called such an observation shortsighted unreasonable and groundless the debt composition of the south asian nation is very complicated and its outstanding external debt is mainly owed to international markets china is only sri lanka s fourth biggest creditor behind international financial markets the asian development bank and japan the state propaganda newspaper contended so it is unreasonable and groundless for some forces to hype up chinese debt as a major cause of sri lanka s economic crisis while turning a blind eye to other major creditors the global times nonetheless acknowledged that sri lanka s belt and road efforts were massive however rather than noting them as needless expenses the chinese outlet insisted the bri was crucial for the country to integrate into the global value chain china s defense of its relationship with sri lanka follows offering it a 1 2 billion loan in 2009 that directly resulted in the seizure of the hambantota port an especially important asset given that the island nation relies on imports of key supplies the seizure grants china control of the port for at least 99 years but potentially as many as 198 it also follows reports that china is offering to help sri lanka with yet another predatory loan potentially valued at 1 5 billion according to reuters the permanent protest encampment now dubbed gota go gama for its demand that president rajapaksa and his relatives all resign refused an offer from gotabaya rajapaksa this week to meet and discuss their concerns in a letter to the president on wednesday the group notably omitted any references to america or the war in russia its main demand was for the rajapaksas to leave power n a letter sent to rajapaksa a group of protestors said they were not ready to meet him unless president gotabaya rajapaksa resigns and all rajapaksa members leave the government sri lanka s daily mirror reported in the second demand the protestors specifically ask for the prime minister and all other rajapaksa members namely chamal rajapaksa basil rajapaksa namal rajapaksa shashindra rajapaksa and nipuna ranawaka to step down from all government posts immediately and also leave parliament opposition journalists have similarly not included the russian war in their complaints regarding government expenditures their plunder has caused the country dearly columnist vishwamithra wrote in the colombo telegraph on wednesday ommissions ill earned from excessive borrowings from china for construction and improvement of infrastructure facilities in the country are not merely a catchword coined by the opposition it s an authentic expression of a defined set of expenditures undertaken for and on behalf of the land they preside over ever since mahinda came to power in 2005 the unrestrained spending they committed to has now come to eat them alive vishwamithra continued the fundamentals of balancing a budget have evaded them and instead of those who committed that mortal sin it s the country and its inhabitants who have to suffer scarcities and brutal living conditions outside of the protest movement the health worker community has condemned the government for giving so much money to china that it can now no longer afford medicine again not referencing the war in ukraine in any way they overspent on the chinese vaccine thrice more than what the chinese government spent on other countries as such all these haphazard and hasty decisions have contributed to the prevailing crisis government medical officers forum president dr rukshan bellana told the mirror this week a sum of rs 61 billion was allocated for health during the previous budget but now former state minister prof channa jayasumana reveals how much of this was spent on health another doctor all ceylon medical officers association general secretary dr jayantha bandara told the mirror now he says there s no money compared to other countries the per head expenditure for health in sri lanka is almost negligible almost all drugs devices and reagents are being imported almost all reagents are being imported even though we produce gauze and other items the raw materials are being imported another 60 drugs are being locally manufactured but here again the raw materials are being imported bandara observed as sri lanka is a democratic socialist state there is no robust private healthcare system for those who do not belong to the wealthy elite the government has denied any concerns about medical supplies there s no acute shortage of drugs and the ministry is managing the issue at the moment health minister keheliya rambukwella who abruptly resigned this month along with all other cabinet members who are not rajapaksas claimed on thursday the health ministry now under different management finally acknowledged the shortages which include both medicine and key hospital equipment follow frances martel on facebook and twitter

this story first appeared on cowboy state daily by wendy corr cowboy state daily as a retired military officer brent bien knows a thing or two about leadership and he claims there s a lack of it in the governor s office the laramie native retired to his home state of wyoming three years ago after finishing his military career as officer in charge of the u s marine corps base on guam a naval aviator since 1991 bien who retired as a colonel served in both support and leadership positions in bosnia herzegovina kosovo afghanistan and iraq now bien wants to use those leadership skills to take charge of wyoming s government as its governor i ve been voting in this state since i was 18 bien told cowboy state daily while on the road to a campaign event in buffalo i m originally from here but even when i was stationed as a marine corps officer for nearly three decades i kept my residency the whole time and just retired back in 2019 bien and his wife susan bought a house in sheridan as his retirement was looming susan works as a nurse at the veterans affairs hospital in sheridan bien a republican said while abroad he maintained a connection to his home state visiting his parents bill and virginia bien of cody frequently lack of leadership since his return to wyoming full time bien said he has become alarmed at what he called a lack of leadership in cheyenne i think what i ve seen is just a void or just a lack of leadership down in cheyenne particularly out of the governor s office for a long time he said and in particular the last three three and a half years bien said he has had his eye on the governor s seat in wyoming since he was a young man my first trigger i guess was way back when i was in flight school in pensacola florida when former president bill clinton got elected he said i wasn t happy about that and i said you know one of these days i m gonna be the governor of wyoming and that paved the way for today for bien gov mark gordon s handling of the pandemic reinforced the idea when mark gordon shut the state down i couldn t believe it that something would happen like declaring a state of emergency after one case of covid he said and of course there s a lot of federal money tied to declaring an emergency in the state and i thought you know we re 20 000 square miles bigger and 300 000 people fewer than south dakota and they re open for business and i couldn t figure out why wyoming was closed down he continued no one in d c bien said that he was also persuaded to take the leap when he realized that no one in washington d c was looking out for the best interests of people in wyoming nobody is protecting the freedoms of the people in the state of wyoming he said and because we already have seen the governor put our freedom on the table i thought you know i ve got to do this bien said he resigned his position as director of safety and standardization at big horn airways in sheridan in november he has been traveling the state since he announced as a candidate in march meeting constituents and spreading his message of promoting freedom for wyoming residents my platform is to make wyoming the freest state in the nation bien said i plan on doing that by actively aggressively protecting personal freedoms and that includes private property rights and second amendment rights and the unborn and making sure parents have primacy over their decisions for their children his secondary agenda bien said is to provide more government accountability that s our state government he said that s voter integrity that s eliminating crossover voting it s trying to get our budget under control i don t think we have any idea how much it really takes to run this state because i can t find a full blown top to bottom wall to wall audit since gosh for nearly 30 years what it really comes down to is figuring out how much money we actually need to run this state he added energy education wyoming s education system is also high on bien s list of priorities for changes particularly in the area of transparency for parents after receiving nearly 500 million in covid money we are tied to the federal government for several years now just in some of their education requirements across the board he said and i know that folks are not happy with that bien said that state sovereignty is a major issue as well i believe that coal gas and oil particularly coal because we re such a big coal state that it is just as much our future as it is our past he said we produce so much coal here and and we have the technologies that make it very very clean bien said he would like to see the state change how wyoming s natural resources are perceived they ve been made out to be so bad and we ve got to change that narrative he said because when it s cloudy and when the wind doesn t blow and that doesn t happen that often here in wyoming but you know when the turbines stop and the solar panels don t work we really have to keep our energy independence bien said wyoming produces about 14 times more energy than it uses and he would like to see more production i do think the way to target all of that objectively is to really take a look at the permitting process across all the sectors of energy and make sure it s fair across the board he said and right now i know it s not standardized bringing people together bien said he s had extensive experience in getting diverse groups to work together for a common goal as recently as his command in guam when various governments environmental groups and local citizens needed to come together to build the marine corp base it was a matter of coalescing these groups getting them all together and trying to explain to them hey this is what we re doing he said and you know it was about an 8 7 billion project and of course it s still going on right now that experience bien said would be beneficial should he be elected wyoming s governor i will work with the federal government as long as it benefits the state of wyoming and as long as it doesn t encroach upon personal freedoms or the sovereignty of the state he said but as soon as it does i will have push we haven t seen that in nearly 30 years from our office particularly with our current governor bien acknowledged that the state has made an effort to stand up to federal policies under gordon s direction by filing a series of lawsuits over federal policies including rules limiting oil and gas leases on federal lands and requiring coronavirus vaccinations for federal employees health workers and workers at large companies this week wyoming joined a friend of the court brief asking the u s supreme court to overturn a federal ban on bump stocks however bien noted that he sees wyoming jumping on the bandwagon rather than taking the lead in standing up to what he sees a federal overreach i don t see wyoming leading in anything really he said i d like to see more proaction out of our current administration and i can assure you we will be far more proactive if i get down there as governor consequences bien said he realizes that standing up for wyoming might mean consequences from the federal government i always make sure that people know that hey you know when i say no that could potentially mean loss of federal funds he said and wyoming probably takes more federal funds than any other state in the nation and so far that s been very well received he continued people want that people want somebody to stand up for the state and i m willing to do it however bien said he understands how difficult the road to the governor s office could be during this year s race i m under no illusion how difficult it s going to be he said because we have a lot of establishment folks in there but i think the rallying cry is let s be number one wyoming needs to be number one and we ve got to fight to get there to advance our state to its rightful position at the top for all things wyoming sign up for our

musk swoops on twitter with 31bn takeover bid tesla tycoon hints he might dump his 9 2 stake if best and final offer is not accepted elon musk yesterday pounced on twitter with a 31 4billion bid to take the social media giant off the stock market the tesla tycoon s offer of 54 20 a share comes just days after he rejected an invitation to join the company s board the bid represents a 38 per cent premium to twitter s closing price on april 1 the last trading day before it was revealed that the billionaire had become the social media site s biggest shareholder with a stake of more than 9 per cent the world s richest man disclosed the offer in a regulatory filing saying he is the right person to unlock the social media platform s extraordinary potential the move would transform the tech entrepreneur into a social media baron able to set the future direction of a platform where he has 80m followers and which he has used to pursue personal vendettas and promote his agenda in a letter to twitter chairman bret taylor musk set out his reason for the offer he wrote i invested in twitter as i believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech and i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy however since making my investment i now realise the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form twitter needs to be transformed as a private company but he hinted that he could walk away if the deal fell through he added my offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted i would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder in a statement twitter confirmed that it had received an unsolicited non binding proposal from 50 year old musk to acquire the company the twitter board of directors will carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all twitter stockholders shares in new york initially shot higher by more than 5 per cent when news of the offer was made public but fell back later in the session to finish down 1 7 per cent at 45 08 shares fell after analysts said the move was hostile and questioned whether he would be able to push the deal through late last night musk was engaged in a twitter spat with saudi business tycoon prince al waleed bin talal who said that as one of twitter s biggest long term shareholders he rejected musk s takeover bid the prince added that he did not believe the offer comes close to the intrinsic value of twitter given its growth prospects musk is engaged in a twitter spat with saudi business tycoon prince al waleed bin talal who said that as one of twitter s biggest long term shareholders he rejected musk s takeover bid the electric car company boss hit back at al waleed bin talal who owns kingdom holding company saying interesting just two questions if i may how much of twitter does the kingdom own directly and indirectly what are the kingdom s views on journalistic freedom of speech this tweet was followed by a separate post from musk who said it would be utterly indefensible for twitter not to put his offer to a shareholder vote he said they own the company not the board of directors if the deal was pushed through there are also question marks over whether twitter s chief executive parag agrawal would stay on agrawal 37 who took over in november has history with musk in december musk compared agrawal to joseph stalin superimposing his face on a famous photo of the soviet dictator over his approach to free speech agrawal hit back over musk s decision to decline a seat on the firm s board earlier this week he referred to musk as a distraction telling twitter s supporters to tune out the noise and focus on the social media giant s work musk also caused doubt about the deal after speaking at a ted conference in vancouver following the announcement musk said he had sufficient assets to fund the deal before quipping that i m not sure that i will actually be able to acquire it he added at the conference that he had a plan b if the bid was not successful although he did not elaborate further he also said that twitter should avoid deleting posts and advocated for time outs over permanent bans a position that could ultimately pave the way for a return of banned figures such as former us president donald trump to the platform twitter based in san francisco owns one of the world s largest social networks it was set up in 2006 and makes most of its money through advertising the group went public in november 2013 musk is the world s richest man with a personal fortune of 209billion according to forbes following the extraordinary rally of shares in tesla which is now worth nearly 1 trillion pounds musk noted that his 54 20 per share offer amounted to a 54 per cent premium on where twitter was trading in january when he started buying shares shares in twitter are up almost a fifth on where they were before musk s stake was first disclosed but they are down 40 per cent from the record high of 77 63 they scaled last march

inflation is among the most important economic risks faced by individual investors following the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic and the war in ukraine inflation resurfaced in many countries because of this rising inflation and the increasingly important role individual investors play in capital markets a growing number of articles in the financial press discuss how individual investors could preserve the real value of their financial wealth against rising prices with many of them pointing toward investments in stocks 1 however little is known about how individual investors actually respond to the prospect of higher inflation and theory provides conflicting hypotheses on this issue on the one hand the hedging hypothesis predicts that investors are more likely to buy and less likely to sell stocks when expected inflation increases this is because investors understand that stocks entitle them to a fraction of the income generated by the underlying real assets allowing them to preserve the real value of their investments e g fama and schwert 1977 fama 1981 boudoukh and richardson 1993 bekaert and wang 2010 on the other hand the money illusion hypothesis suggests that investors are less likely to buy and more likely to sell stocks in periods of higher expected inflation this is because they adjust nominal interest rates but ignore that firms cash flows also grow with inflation leading them to require higher dividend yields to hold stocks e g modigliani and cohn 1979 ritter and warr 2002 cohen et al 2005 given these two competing hypotheses understanding how individual investors react to expected inflation is an empirical question germany in the 1920s as a laboratory a test of individual investors response to inflation is subject to three main empirical challenges first one needs granular data on investors security transactions this allows for direct analysis of investment decision making in inflationary periods second one needs a period in which inflation if overlooked produces sizable financial losses and thus attracts the attention of investors 2 third one needs a reliable measure of expected inflation that varies both over time and across investors this is a necessary condition for a within person analysis and enables one to control for the overall time trend this setup is not available in the most common investor level datasets in a new study braggion et al 2022 we introduce a unique dataset containing security portfolios of over 2 000 private clients of a german bank between 1920 and 1924 the period of the german hyperinflation the data and the time are ideally suited to address each of the empirical challenges outlined above first we have detailed information on every trade executed by the bank s clients allowing for direct analysis of individuals investment behaviour second inflation was high between january 1920 and september 1923 potentially yielding large financial losses if overlooked and arguably grabbing investors attention third we have inflation data at a monthly frequency for hundreds of towns in germany resulting in an inflation measure that captures inflation experienced locally over time which should be a reliable proxy for expected inflation 3 individual investors buy less sell more stocks when facing higher inflation figure 1 visualises our main finding each month we sort towns in germany into deciles based on their local inflation and compute for each inflation decile the average buy sell imbalance for stock trades of clients living in those towns the buy sell imbalance captures individual investors net demand for stocks we then plot average buy sell imbalances against inflation deciles the figure shows a strong negative relationship between the two this suggests that investors buy less sell more stocks when facing higher local inflation moving from the decile with the lowest inflation to the decile with the highest inflation reduces buy sell imbalances by 17 percentage points more formal regression based analyses confirm this result hence we find investor behaviour consistent with the money illusion hypothesis but inconsistent with the hedging hypothesis figure 1 local inflation and stock trades in additional tests we find the negative relationship between local inflation and buy sell imbalances for stocks to be attenuated for more sophisticated clients for institutional clients of our bank we even document a positive association between local inflation and buy sell imbalances these findings support the notion that sophistication reduces money illusion we also find a positive relationship between local inflation and foregone real returns following stock sales suggesting that investors facing higher local inflation mistime their sales and incur extra losses this evidence is again consistent with investors committing an inflation induced investment mistake a large number of robustness tests indicate that our findings are unlikely to be driven by investors using local inflation as a proxy for future economic outcomes by investors risk aversion increasing with local inflation by investors liquidating stocks to meet consumption needs and by investors shifting to other asset classes also offering a hedge against inflation conclusion our analysis provides evidence that individual investors in particular unsophisticated ones make inflation induced trading errors this stresses the importance of the ongoing debate on the financial literacy of individuals recently the european commission pointed toward the limited financial literacy of households and advocated for making financial education a priority for europe similar calls were made in the us 4 our findings underscore concerns that the financial literacy of individuals may not be sufficient to respond appropriately to the currently resurfacing inflation references bekaert g and x wang 2010 inflation risk and the inflation risk premium economic policy 25 64 755 806 boudoukh j

at a press conference on tuesday vladimir putin downplayed the impact of the economic sanctions that the united states and european countries have imposed on russia since it invaded ukraine while acknowledging that these measures which include restrictions on russian banks the freezing of much of the country s foreign exchange reserves and bans on imports of some russian goods have achieved certain results putin confidently insisted that the russian economy will adapt to the new environment as an example he pointed out that russia s central bank has been able to cut interest rates in recent days that blitzkrieg on which our foes were counting did not work he declared to be sure there was bluster in putin s statements the sanctions have certainly hit russia s economy last weekend the world bank estimated that russian g d p would decline by about eleven per cent this year noting that the country was already in a deep recession but most of the sanctions still don t apply to oil and gas russia s primary exports which are critical to the country s trade balance and financial stability indeed with the price of oil and gas having risen sharply since the war began russia is now earning more money on every barrel of oil and cubic foot of gas that it sells these revenues which often get paid in dollars and euros are offsetting the decline in other russian exports providing the kremlin with new foreign exchange reserves and helping to restore a degree of confidence in its banking system which was tottering after the initial wave of sanctions russia s financial system appears to be stabilizing now two economists at the washington based institute of international finance noted in an article last week the value of the ruble after collapsing when the freeze on russia s foreign exchange reserves was announced appears to have strengthened in recent weeks and is almost back to pre crisis levels the economists wrote one of them elina ribakova pointed out in a separate analysis that russia thanks to its energy exports and a fall in its imports reported a quarterly current account surplus of fifty eight billion dollars in the first quarter of 2022 the highest in recent history and more than double the amount reported in the previous first quarter this doesn t look like an economy on the verge of collapse or one that can no longer finance a deadly war earlier this week european union officials reportedly drew up proposals for an e u oil embargo but germany and certain other member countries haven t agreed to support this move going cold turkey on fossil fuels from russia would cause a massive instant disruption emily haber germany s ambassador to the united states wrote in a twitter thread on wednesday you cannot turn modern industrial plants on and off like a light switch the knock on effects would be felt beyond germany the eu s economic engine and 4th largest economy in the world she added meanwhile the effect of an abrupt import ban on putin s war would not be clear to ukrainians under indiscriminate russian assault this attitude is infuriating we are in a state of cognitive dissonance oleg ustenko an economic adviser to president volodymyr zelensky told me by phone from kyiv on the one hand ustenko pointed out president joe biden has called the russian war in ukraine genocide but on the other hand the u s s european allies are dragging their feet about an energy embargo we are saying look guys it cannot work the way you are proposing ustenko said you are stopping caviar exports however what can really harm this russian military machine is oil and nothing has happened with oil we just had talks and talks and talks and then nothing happened far from cutting off their imports of russian energy products some european countries are in fact buying more gas and oil than they were before the war ustenko claimed he suggested that some countries may have been trying to build up their energy reserves in anticipation of an embargo that they think is coming he acknowledged that germany and france the e u s two largest economies had reduced their imports of russian oil and gas since the war began but noted that they are still buying large amounts when i read out to him some of the tweets from the german ambassador ustenko accused germany of trying to play with putin for decades and said that history showed this strategy had produced disastrous results

shares opening below 50 and struggling to make any sort of traction this seems rather an odd reaction unless you believe that the board will reject musk s offer or you believe musk isn t serious about his offer in any event a rejection could then prompt musk to sell his shareholding sending the share price back down to where it came from given the recent share price performance of twitter they

inflation the dow jones industrial average added around 177 points at 34 742 while the s p 500 gained around 12 points to stand at 4 458 the tech laden nasdaq index advanced around 11 points to go to

ms rose over 3 as it unveiled an earnings beat but wells fargo dropped over 5 7 after its first quarter revenue that fell short of analyst estimates goldman shares added almost 2 6 35am wall street seen little changed us stocks are seen little changed in early trading as investors await the release of quarterly earnings from the biggest us banks analysts said investors will be looking for clues as to how these financial institutions have weathered inflationary pressures in the first quarter as well as their outlook for the industry for the rest of the year futures for the dow jones industrial average rose 0 21 in pre market trading while those for the s p 500 fell 0 01 and contracts for the tech heavy nasdaq 100 were 0 06 higher yesterday apart from jpmorgan whose first quarter profit dove from a year earlier driven by increased costs for bad loans and the market upheaval caused by the russian ukraine war others such as blackrock and delta performed better than analysts expectations richard hunter head of markets at interactive investor said alongside slightly lighter volumes which have traditionally accompanied a shortened trading week leading into easter the quarterly earnings season is kicking off in earnest as us banks begin to report inflationary pressures such as energy and labour costs are expected to pressure earnings which are unlikely to scale the heights of last year while there are expected to be some strong numbers emanating from the energy and materials sectors the likes of consumer discretionary and communication stocks may be feeling the pressure more than most he added a decent showing within the airline sector offset some of the disappointment from jpmorgan whose numbers set the season off to a weak start as it reported a drop in quarterly profit hunter noted jpmorgan shares closed more than 3 lower on wednesday after the biggest us bank by assets said first quarter profit fell 42 from a year earlier to us 8 28 billion but analysts said banks reporting today such as citigroup morgan stanley nyse ms goldman sachs nyse gs and wells fargo may not go the way of jpmorgan the mood has lifted slightly as investors begin to assess the possibility that inflation could be nearing a peak hunter said while the overall inflation number continues to run hot core inflation which strips out food and energy prices saw gains which appear to be moderating in comparison to recent readings this in turn raises the question of whether much of the negative news has already been priced into stocks although the situation remains fluid however the performance of the main indices remains weak he noted with the dow jones industrial average losing 4 9 in the year to date the s p500 down 6 7 and the nasdaq 100 12 8 lower traders will

china s state run propaganda newspaper global times on wednesday blamed american sanctions on russia due to the war in ukraine for sri lanka s increasingly dire economic disaster a disaster greatly exacerbated by the country taking out predatory loans from china the global times acknowledged the loans and sri lanka s enthusiastic participation in the belt and road initiative bri a global plan to erode the sovereignty of impoverished states by offering predatory loans to be used to pay china for infrastructure projects in sri lanka the government was forced to hand over its critical hambantota seaport to the communist party in 2017 after it defaulted on its prodigious debt to china and still struggles to make its payments to beijing nationwide protests have rocked sri lanka in the past month as the price of living soared hospitals ran out of medicine and canceled surgeries gas stations ran out of fuel and markets grew increasingly empty protesters have attempted to storm president gotabaya rajapaksa s home and have now established a permanent protest camp demanding he prime minister mahinda rajapaksa and every rajapaksa family member in government resign regarding the rajapaksa family gotabaya and mahinda are brothers and another 40 rajapaksas have enjoyed national government posts in the past decade they have dominated sri lankan politics since mahinda as president ended the 26 year war between the government and the tamil tigers organization protesters routinely condemn the rajapaksa oligarchy for overspending borrowing too much from china and now failing to have enough money to secure basic food and medicine supplies as sri lanka is a democratic socialist republic colombo and not private corporations is responsible for said purchases no protest against the government has displayed any significant opposition to the united states nor has the opposition movement cited america as a meaningful actor in the crisis in any way the rajapaksa regime announced this week that it would default on its foreign debts to use the money that would have gone to those payments to buy food and medicine the global times made the effort to tie the sri lankan socialist crisis to washington and bizarrely kyiv claiming that russian sanctions had devastated the sri lankan economy the russia ukraine conflict and the us led economic sanctions against russia may have further aggravated sri lanka s economic plight the chinese state outlet asserted this week the deteriorating economic crisis in the south asian nation is a typical example of how emerging economies especially those small and vulnerable ones are suffering from the shocks from the reckless western economic sanctions while the west claimed their sanctions are against russia they are seriously harming the interests of developing economies and may even cause a widespread humanitarian crisis the global times claimed the outlet added that the sri lankan crisis should serve as a wake up call for the global economy especially the developing world that is exposed to the growing external risks from geopolitical turbulence instigated by the us led west china certainly does not want to see sri lanka stuck in an economic crisis and would help wherever it can especially when it comes to addressing its economic challenges it continued however in a broader sense developing countries especially those in the asia pacific region should step up and work jointly to fend off risks posed by toxic policies pushed by the us and its western allies the global times admitted that most objective international observers consider the bri and china s debt traps a meaningful contributor to the sri lankan economic crisis but called such an observation shortsighted unreasonable and groundless the debt composition of the south asian nation is very complicated and its outstanding external debt is mainly owed to international markets china is only sri lanka s fourth biggest creditor behind international financial markets the asian development bank and japan the state propaganda newspaper contended so it is unreasonable and groundless for some forces to hype up chinese debt as a major cause of sri lanka s economic crisis while turning a blind eye to other major creditors the global times nonetheless acknowledged that sri lanka s belt and road efforts were massive however rather than noting them as needless expenses the chinese outlet insisted the bri was crucial for the country to integrate into the global value chain china s defense of its relationship with sri lanka follows offering it a 1 2 billion loan in 2009 that directly resulted in the seizure of the hambantota port an especially important asset given that the island nation relies on imports of key supplies the seizure grants china control of the port for at least 99 years but potentially as many as 198 it also follows reports that china is offering to help sri lanka with yet another predatory loan potentially valued at 1 5 billion according to reuters the permanent protest encampment now dubbed gota go gama for its demand that president rajapaksa and his relatives all resign refused an offer from gotabaya rajapaksa this week to meet and discuss their concerns in a letter to the president on wednesday the group notably omitted any references to america or the war in russia its main demand was for the rajapaksas to leave power n a letter sent to rajapaksa a group of protestors said they were not ready to meet him unless president gotabaya rajapaksa resigns and all rajapaksa members leave the government sri lanka s daily mirror reported in the second demand the protestors specifically ask for the prime minister and all other rajapaksa members namely chamal rajapaksa basil rajapaksa namal rajapaksa shashindra rajapaksa and nipuna ranawaka to step down from all government posts immediately and also leave parliament opposition journalists have similarly not included the russian war in their complaints regarding government expenditures their plunder has caused the country dearly columnist vishwamithra wrote in the colombo telegraph on wednesday ommissions ill earned from excessive borrowings from china for construction and improvement of infrastructure facilities in the country are not merely a catchword coined by the opposition it s an authentic expression of a defined set of expenditures undertaken for and on behalf of the land they preside over ever since mahinda came to power in 2005 the unrestrained spending they committed to has now come to eat them alive vishwamithra continued the fundamentals of balancing a budget have evaded them and instead of those who committed that mortal sin it s the country and its inhabitants who have to suffer scarcities and brutal living conditions outside of the protest movement the health worker community has condemned the government for giving so much money to china that it can now no longer afford medicine again not referencing the war in ukraine in any way they overspent on the chinese vaccine thrice more than what the chinese government spent on other countries as such all these haphazard and hasty decisions have contributed to the prevailing crisis government medical officers forum president dr rukshan bellana told the mirror this week a sum of rs 61 billion was allocated for health during the previous budget but now former state minister prof channa jayasumana reveals how much of this was spent on health another doctor all ceylon medical officers association general secretary dr jayantha bandara told the mirror now he says there s no money compared to other countries the per head expenditure for health in sri lanka is almost negligible almost all drugs devices and reagents are being imported almost all reagents are being imported even though we produce gauze and other items the raw materials are being imported another 60 drugs are being locally manufactured but here again the raw materials are being imported bandara observed as sri lanka is a democratic socialist state there is no robust private healthcare system for those who do not belong to the wealthy elite the government has denied any concerns about medical supplies there s no acute shortage of drugs and the ministry is managing the issue at the moment health minister keheliya rambukwella who abruptly resigned this month along with all other cabinet members who are not rajapaksas claimed on thursday the health ministry now under different management finally acknowledged the shortages which include both medicine and key hospital equipment follow frances martel on facebook and twitter
after firing its largest ever missile north korea is preparing to conduct a nuclear test officials and analysts say reviving a longstanding debate south of the border should seoul have nukes too pyongyang has conducted a blitz of sanctions busting weapons tests this year including launching an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm at full range for the first time since 2017 it was a dramatic return to long range testing after a years long pause while leader kim jong un embarked on a round of failed diplomacy with then us president donald trump in 2018 renewed north korean sabre rattling coupled with the russian invasion of ukraine has shifted the public mood in south korea with growing demand for their own deterrent discussions on south korea possibly pursuing its own nuclear capability have been circulating said soo kim of the rand corporation the nuclear option is likely to remain on the discussion table for seoul s decision makers but this of course will have implications and reach beyond the korean peninsula the discussion on whether south korea should pursue nuclear armaments extends beyond official circles with a majority of citizens also appearing to support such a move seventy one percent of south koreans now favour the country getting nuclear weapons according to a research paper published in february by the us based carnegie endowment and the chicago council on global affairs north korea has tested nuclear weapons six times since 2006 and touted the success of its last and most powerful one in 2017 a hydrogen bomb with an estimated yield of 250 kilotons as north korea s icbms are still in development there is a high risk of failure each time said cha du hyeogn a researcher at seoul s asan institute for policy studies last month a north korean missile exploded in the skies above pyongyang that cramps pyongyang s style said cha adding a nuclear test is less risky another test is likely soon south korean officials and the top us envoy on north korea say as part of the celebrations for the 110th anniversary of the birth of founding leader kim il sung on friday satellite imagery shows signs of new activity at a tunnel at the punggye ri testing site which north korea said was demolished in 2018 ahead of a trump kim summit the vienna based open nuclear network says it has spotted signs of excavation and increased activity indicating north korea may be preparing it for a nuclear weapon test seoul ran a covert nuclear programme in the 1970s ending it up in return for security guarantees from the united states america stations 28 500 troops in south korea to protect against its nuclear armed neighbour and has recently ramped up military displays sending an aircraft carrier close by this week for the first time since 2017 many commentators see too clear parallels with ukraine s fate kyiv gave up its large stock of ussr era nukes over which it never had operational control in return for security guarantees an actual war that we couldn t even imagine broke out and has heightened the importance of self defence said park won gon a professor of north korean studies at seoul s ewha university for its seventh nuclear test north korea will likely seek to miniaturise nuclear warheads to mount on its icbms aiming to reach a point where no one can deny it is a de facto nuclear power he said some south korean politicians have proposed asking the united states to redeploy tactical nuclear weapons to south korea something analysts say us president joe biden has not shown much interest in on the campaign trail south korea s hawkish new president elect yoon suk yeol opposed the idea saying that strengthening us extended deterrence would be the answer this would be far less politically complicating economically costly and regionally destabilising than nuclear proliferation said leif eric easley a professor at ewha university the lesson of russia s invasion of ukraine is not to go nuclear but rather to strengthen the kind of defense alliances that ukraine wanted but couldn t obtain he added but for many south koreans a us security guarantee is no longer enough

the stunning spectacle of the eu committing slow motion hara kiri is something for the ages like a cheap kurosawa remake the movie is actually about the empire of lies detonated demolition of the eu complete with subsequent rerouting of some key russian commodities exports to the us at the expense of the europeans it helps to have a 5th columnist actress strategically placed in this case astonishingly incompetent european commission head ursula von der leyen with a brand new vociferous announcement of an extra sanctions package russian ships banned from eu ports road transportation companies from russia and belarus prohibited from entering the eu no more coal imports over 4 4 billion euros a year that translates in practice into the empire of lies shaking down its wealthiest western clients puppets russia of course is too powerful militarily the empire badly needs some of its key exports especially minerals mission accomplished in this case amounts to nudging the eu into imposing more and more sanctions and willfully collapsing their national economies allowing the us to scoop everything up cue to the coming catastrophic economic consequences felt by europeans in their daily life but not by the wealthiest 5 inflation devouring salaries and savings next winter energy bills packing a mean punch products disappearing from supermarkets holiday bookings almost frozen le petit roi macron in france maybe up to a nasty electoral surprise announcing food stamps like in wwii are possible we have germany facing the returning ghost of weimar hyperinflation blackrock president rob kapito saying in texas for the first time this generation is going to go into a store and not be able to get what they want farmers in africa not able to afford fertilizer at all this year reducing agricultural production by an amount capable of feeding 100 million people zoltan poszar former ny fed and us treasury guru current credit suisse grand vizir has been on a streak stressing how commodity reserves and here russia is unrivalled will be an essential feature of what he calls bretton woods iii yet in fact what s being designed by russia china iran and the eurasia economic union is a post bretton woods poszar remarks that wars historically are won by those who have more food and energy supplies in the past to power horses and soldiers today to feed soldiers and fuel tanks and fighter jets china incidentally has amassed large stocks of virtually everything poszar notes how our current bretton woods ii system has a deflationary impulse globalization open trade just in time supply chains while bretton woods iii will provide an inflationary impulse de globalization autarky hoarding of raw materials of supply chains and extra military spending to be able to protect what will remain of seaborne trade the implications are of course overwhelming what s implicit ominously is that this state of affairs may even lead to wwiii rublegas or american lng the valdai club has conducted an essential expert discussion on what we at the cradle have defined as rublegas the real geoeconomic game changer at the heart of the post petrodollar era alexander losev a member of the russian council for foreign and defense policy offered the contours of the big picture but it was up to alexey gromov chief energy director of the institute of energy and finance to come up with crucial nitty gritty details it was quite enlightening to juxtapose the coming geoeconomic turbulence the eu obsession with bypassing russian gas and the onset of rublegas with the real reasons behind operation z in ukraine completely obscured by western media psyops russia so far was selling gas to europe to the amount of 155 billion cubic meters a year the eu rhetorically promises to get rid of it by 2027 and reduce supply by the end of 2022 by 100 billion cubic meters gromov asked how and remarked any expert has no answer most of russia s natural gas is shipped over pipelines this cannot simply be replaced by lng the risible european answer has been start saving as in prepare to be worse off reduce the temperature in households gromov noted how in russia 22 to 25 degrees in winter is the norm europe is promoting 16 degrees as healthy and wearing sweaters at night the eu won t be able to get the gas it needs from norway or algeria which is privileging domestic consumption azerbaijan would be able to provide at best 10 billion cubic meters a year but that will take 2 or 3 years to happen gromov stressed how there s no surplus in the market today for us and qatar lng and how prices for asian customers are always higher the bottom line is that by end of 2022 europe won t be able to significantly reduce what is buys from russia they might cut by 50 billion cubic meters maximum and prices in the spot market will be higher at least 1 300 per cubic meter an important development is that russia changed the logistical supply chains to asia already that applies for gas and oil as well you can impose sanctions if there s a surplus in the market now there s a shortage of at least 1 5 million barrels of oil a day we ll be sending our supplies to asia with a discount as it stands asia is already paying a premium from 3 to 5 dollars more per barrel of oil on oil shipments gromov also commented on the key issue of insurance insurance premiums are higher before ukraine it was all based on the fob system now buyers are saying we don t want to take the risk of taking your cargo to our ports so they are applying the cif system where the seller has to insure and transport the cargo that of course impacts revenues an absolutely key issue for russia is how to make the transition to china as its key gas customer it s all about power of siberia 2 which will reach full capacity only in 2024 and first the interconnector through mongolia must be built we need 3 years to build this pipeline so everything will be in place only around 2025 on the yamal pipeline most of the gas goes to asia if the europeans don t buy anymore we can redirect and then there s the arctic lng 2 which is larger than yamal the first phase should be finished soon it s 80 ready an extra problem may be posed by the russian unfriendlies in asia japan and south korea lng infrastructure produced in russia still depends on foreign technologies that s what leads gromov to note that the model of mobilization based economy is not so good but that s what russia needs to deal with at least in the short to medium term the positives are that the new paradigm will allow more cooperation within the brics the expansion of the international north south transportation corridor instc and more interaction and integration with pakistan india afghanistan and iran only in terms of iran and russia swaps in the caspian are already in the works as iran produces more than it needs and is set to increase cooperation with russia in the framework of the strenghtened strategic partnership hypersonic geoeconomics it was up to chinese energy expert fu chengyu to offer a concise explanation of why the eu drive of replacing russian gas with american lng is well a pipe dream essentially the us offer is too limited and too costly fu chengyu showed how a lengthy tricky process depends on four contracts between the gas developer and the lng company between the lng company and the buyer company between the lng buyer and the cargo company which builds vessels and between the buyer and the end user each contract he pointed out takes a long time to finish without all these signed contracts no party will invest be it investment on infrastructure or gas field development so actual delivery of american lng to europe assumes all these interconnected resources are available and moving like clockwork fu chengyu s verdict is stark this eu obsession on ditching russian gas will provoke an impact on global economic growth and recession they are pushing their own people and the world in the energy sector we will all be harmed it was quite enlightening to juxtapose the coming geoeconomic turbulence the eu obsession with bypassing russian gas and the onset of rublegas with the real reasons behind operation z in ukraine completely obscured by western media psyops so i submitted a few questions to a us deep state old pro now retired and quite familiar with the inner workings of the old oss the cia precursor all the way to the neocon dementia his answers were quite sobering he started by pointing out the whole ukraine issue is over hypersonic missiles that can reach moscow in less than four minutes the us wants them there in poland romania baltic states sweden finland this is in direct violation of the agreements in 1991 that nato will not expand in eastern europe the us does not have hypersonic missiles now but should in a year or two this is an existential threat to russia so they had to go into the ukraine to stop this next will be poland and romania where launchers have been built in romania and are being built in poland from a completely different geopolitical perspective what s really telling is that his analysis happens to dovetail with zoltan poszar s geoeconomics the us and nato are totally belligerent this presents a real danger to russia the idea that nuclear war is unthinkable is a myth if you look at the firebombing of tokyo against hiroshima and nagasaki more people died in tokyo than hiroshima and nagasaki these cities were rebuilt the radiation goes away and life can restart the difference between firebombing and nuclear bombing is only efficiency nato provocations are so extreme russia had to place their nuclear missiles on standby alert this is a gravely serious matter but the us ignored it republished from the cradle by permission of author or representative

oil posts weekly gain as analysts continue to disagree on state of supply and demand by ship bunker news team meanwhile china refiners are set to radically cut crude throughput due to lockdowns file image pixabay oil prices on thursday posted a daily gain and rose over 8 percent for the week amid a host of conflicting reports on the state of inventories and demand and as the european union was said to be moving toward adopting a phased in ban on russian oil brent rose 1 35 or 1 30 percent at 110 19 per barrel while west texas intermediate gained 1 24 or 1 18 percent at 105 48 per barrel at 1706 gmt andrew lipow president of lipow oil associates said a phased in ban would force european buyers to seek alternative sources some of which in the near term is being met by strategic petroleum reserve releases but in the future more supplies coming out of the ground will be required more supplies coming out of the ground will be required andrew lipow president lipow oil associates the recent reserve release by the u s and allies combined with china s zero infection policy against covid leading to more government mandated lockdowns in that country has caused a rollercoaster style pattern of crude trading in the past few weeks mike tran analyst at rbc capital markets noted that government energy intervention the perceived self shunning of russian crude and the erratic buying patterns in recent weeks have all altered the near term path and moving forward trading looks volatile and sloppy over the near term as the market digests the onslaught of 240 million barrels of crude unleashed from strategic reserves that s perhaps the safest assessment of upcoming trading patterns given that analysts can t seem to agree on anything to do with supply or demand on thursday salih yilmaz senior energy analyst for bloomberg intelligence said that oil risks are skewed to the upside due to a multi year deficit coming later this year the outcome of russia s invasion of ukraine prompting widespread sanctions by other countries yilmaz added that calculations point to an undersupply of up to 1 million barrels per day bpd in the second quarter but this is contrary to expectations of the international energy agency and the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec for a surplus yilmaze reinforced his conviction about a deficit by pointing out that opec has refused to raise its output levels and many other countries are unable to do so meanwhile inventories in china are reportedly bulging and refiners in that country are set to cut crude throughput this month by about 6 percent accordingly a scale last seen in the early days of the covid 19 pandemic two years ago in other oil related news on thursday analysts are now conceding that the surprise build in u s inventories announced earlier this week was due largely to the spr releases stocks climbed 9 38 million barrels to 421 75 million barrels in the week ended april 8 they also acknowledged that demand still seems to be robust with gasoline declining 3 65 million barrels to 233 14 million barrels and distillates falling 2 9 million barrels to 111 4 million barrels

societal imperative in its current form musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist and has been critical of twitter s rules about what people are allowed to say on the site among musk s

help us drive to be better every day our team has faced many challenges and shown resilience agility and strength to overcome and deliver upon the many directives that were asked to them at times certain directives and decisions have led us away from the core of the business along the way we have grown very quickly from 70 team members last year to over 200 this year with growth can come many opportunities and also challenges some of those challenges have led us to decisions that have taken us away from our plan the executive committee members on this call today are determined not only to speak but also to act upon our core values that lead to mutual respect in an obligation to be the best that we can be for our stakeholders our team has 3 immediate priorities first execution of a refocused strategy provided by the board of directors and a transition into a culture of operational excellence focused on sustainable growth and profitability our mission remains the same to get millions to rethink their food choices while helping them do a world of good second we plan on increasing retail and food service distribution points with a focus on wholesale business third focus on short term priorities while renovating our core portfolio and being strategic in our product innovation ambitions to disrupt the market which is in line with our long term strategy thank you question and answer session a janet meiklejohn so the first question and jordan i think this ties back in with what you just concluded on but it says with and this comes from an investor with the change in leadership with james as head chef and chief researcher how is the team focusing on not only growing but also improving and innovating on the skus jordan rogers thank you that s a great question our team is very strong in terms of not only back of house but on the research and development side and we re quite confident that we will be able to continue on with what james had provided and improve upon that driving us forward janet meiklejohn okay thank you jordan question 2 i believe this is for kevin following the increase in production capacities how does very good food intend to increase the number of stores carrying their product and how many new stores can be expected in q2 if onboarding of new stores proves difficult will high margin skus be prioritized and which ones are those kevin callaghan great question and thank you for allowing me to join this call let me tackle the first part how does we intend to increase the number of stores carrying future capacity over the past year our sales team has grown we brought in 8 regional managers to cover north america 3 in canada and also 4 in the united states over that year we have been hitting many opportunities and category reviews at major influential retailers so with that we are hitting every opportunity possible in the natural conventional and also the club channels providing the great products that the very brand offers we ve also hired a director of foodservice to kind of to manage this untapped channel for us michael hoeksema joined the company 4 months ago and he has already partnered with some key foodservice i guess outlets that we hope to announce very soon as for the next question part of the question if onboarding the new stores proves difficult how many skus or what will be our strategy in terms of skus onboarding has not been difficult we ve launched into the u s a little over 8 months ago we have not even gone over a full cycle calendar year with the in the pre recorded call we ve had much success in terms of launching into new stores so the onboarding new stores have not proved difficult and with the increased capacity that we ve unleashed with rupert and our other facilities i look forward to filling those lines and making sure that they run at full capacity janet meiklejohn thank you kevin again back to jordan with the cost saving practices that are being implemented why was the decision made so late on implementing them was it blocked from the ceo and leadership or was there another holdup and going forward how do you intend to make this process more transparent jordan rogers thank you that s a great question we re looking to understand this better as well internally and we can provide some more information at a later date janet meiklejohn okay great then let s move on to the fourth question have the personal loans been reimbursed and are the have the personal loans being reimbursed and where are we at on that process steven hoang i think i can answer that steven here so mitchell scott s personal loan has been reimbursed as of december 31 but the loan to the crdo remains outstanding as of today but however on february 4 the company entered into a share pledge agreement with the crdo whereby the crdo pledged 1 million common shares of the company as of today the pledged shares have not been disposed off by the company and then if there s any additional details required they should be they re definitely found in note 14 on the financial statements janet meiklejohn thank you steven and over to you parimal it s perceived again from a a question from a private investor it s perceived that you have too much capacity will you be closing the victoria plant patterson plant and doing everything out of rupert parimal rana we are currently looking at the capacities of all 3 locations assessing which plants could be consolidated based on financial stability we want to make sure that we make the right decisions moving forward and so we are going to take some time and not weeks or months but fairly quickly here to decide on which locations can consolidate we are also considering sort of the implications of leases at that point janet meiklejohn thank you again another question from an investor how much investor money was lost steve this probably goes to you how much investor money was lost to mitchell s pockets before he was terminated steven hoang so exactly this compensation is disclosed publicly i just want to reiterate that neither mitchell or james were fulfilling the service as of their termination and the departure from the company any unexpected or unexercised options will expire within 90 days of their departure janet meiklejohn okay and jordan i guess and this is another toughie but i ll throw it over to you how did you let the stock price drop so badly without trying to keep investor confidence jordan rogers yes indeed that s a great question i think the spirit that we re trying to move towards is being in front of our community and being as open and as available as we can janet meiklejohn i m not sure who this goes to jordan again it might be you what is the strategy on the restaurants on a go forward basis jordan rogers sure i m happy to tackle that one so our victoria restaurant has performed exceptionally well we have tremendous 5 star reviews and we re really focused on that facility and have some exciting plans down the road for it but we are focused on the victoria restaurant for the time being janet meiklejohn great and steve i think this one is over to you has the company already applied for an extension with nasdaq virtually regarding the dollar requirement if not will reverse split be an option to maintain compliance with the requirement or are we considering or are you considering a delisting as a viable option steven hoang okay thank you no we have not placed for an extension as of yet we have until july 10 and we re hoping that our new strategy will help us organically regain compliance however we re always committed to we bring all available options to resolve the deficiencies and are in compliance with the bid principle janet meiklejohn kevin this is going to go over to you and why has the company not been able to land a major grocery deal will we clarify that one kevin callaghan okay yes great question in terms of a major grocer deal we ve done a great job in establishing listings in raleyâ s erewhon earth fare to name a few as we go through the category review process sometimes it takes time we launched into the u s 8 months ago where a majority of our category views at these major retailers happened in quarter 4 and quarter 1 2022 as i can t report on some of the i guess some of the decisions that have been made i m very excited to soon announce some of the partnerships where we will have listings very soon and i look forward to those announcements janet meiklejohn and i think this one probably goes to you as well but what is a very good plan for pricing products in the future the premium price seems to be a big barrier to wide scale uptake kevin callaghan our strategy remains the same the premium price compared to other meat alternatives i think it is very much in line with whole food ingredients and our strategy of creating a premium product does have i guess a premium price in to assay so i think there is no change in strategy at this time janet meiklejohn okay great jordan any feedback on the uk or china s marketing testing market testing jordan rogers yes i think we took an exploratory approach in terms of looking at those markets to see where the opportunities were for us at this current time we have decided to put a pause on those opportunities and really dig into the north american expansion and lower hanging fruit at the time janet meiklejohn great thank you steve this one this is over to you does the company know how long its current runway is before it requires a further round of financing or feel like it can improve profitability enough to avoid that result steven hoang certainly as a growth company there is a need for capital although this should go along the way to getting us there as path to profitability it will all be this year as far as financing we are certainly looking at all options including certain debt facilities but it really depends on the current market conditions janet meiklejohn thank you here s another tricky one jordan i m going to hand it over to you from a private investor why was the ceo fired jordan rogers yes thank you for that question we re not in a position to discuss employment all i can say is that it was a strategy change janet meiklejohn great and again jordan this is probably over to you as well how can very good food expand their market share and at the same time cut operating costs jordan rogers i think we ve done a lot of heavy lifting in terms of investing in our capex and facilities to get us there so i think we re coming out of that heavy lifting that we ve done and that excites me as we chase down a lot of opportunities that we have in front of us right now janet meiklejohn great thank you so kevin i m going to send this one over to you and so the question again from a private investor is are fast food chains off the table now kevin callaghan i would say that we re seeking out any opportunity or that fits the basis of our company and what we believe in we hired michael as our foodservice director and him to set the path of our foodservice strategy so as we investigate these channels we ll have to investigate the opportunities and what s best for the company janet meiklejohn great thank you i think again over to it s either between jordan or kevin but what does the company see as the biggest opportunity for growth over the next fiscal year is it mostly from wholesale number of locations or are there other opportunities kevin that s probably you kevin callaghan absolutely absolutely our focus is u s retail for 2022 that is going to be where a lot of our resources are geared to very good food company creates products that can fit multiple categories and have multiple uses there s a lot of value there so in terms of growth as of right now u s wholesale will be the main growth for 2022 janet meiklejohn so here s one for parimal that s quite straightforward what are we producing in patterson and rupert as of right now parimal rana sorry can you repeat the question janet meiklejohn sorry what are we producing what are you producing at rupert at this particular moment parimal rana thanks for the question rupert produces a line of select items which includes the meatballs the bangers the burgers as well as legacy products steak ribs hot dog british banger smokin banger pepperoni and the two burgers and patterson is currently producing 1 item and that s the taco stuffâ er janet meiklejohn okay great jordan i think it s at you what is the status of the previous founders as shareholders of the company and what influence do they have on the board composition and appointment of senior management jordan rogers yes thanks janet i think that is a question we re seeking to understand and learn better internally and we ll be in a better position to provide some more information at a later date janet meiklejohn great another question from a private investor i m not sure who takes this but are you going to continue to expand the meatball line to get you into new accounts since it won taste awards such as making the sweet and sour meatballs jordan rogers yes i ll take that one so the meatballs won a nexty award the nexty award is an award given out to an exceptional product at expo west in anaheim california the meatball is a fan favorite and we continue to see same store sales growth on the product we also feel it is a everyday product with a lot of versatility and we re excited about the prospects for it janet meiklejohn great and again we touched on this question at the very beginning so i and obviously it hasn t been completely cleared up so i m going to throw out a similar question from another investor there hasn t been any mention on product development more skus is there a search going on for an r d officer and what is currently in the pipeline jordan rogers yes i ll take that one janet so as i mentioned earlier our focus on short term priorities while renovating our core portfolio we have an exceptional team a very talented back of house chef and individual who has a deep restaurant development experience not to mention a solid r d team led by celeste trujillo who is formerly of daiya and we re confident in their ability to take us forward and where we need to go janet meiklejohn thank you jordan and i think back to you again is the strategic review and options to be bought out with a larger company in the space being explored jordan rogers yes thank you for that question i think that s something again we re looking to understand better internally and we can provide more information at a later date janet meiklejohn and steve as the company has been able to scale up production have the gross margins had a noticeable improvement steven hoang yes so that s so thank you for the question that s definitely something that we see in q3 and q4 with the scale up of the rupert facility we ve seen an increase in gross margins over the last couple of quarters janet meiklejohn okay and i think the and we re pretty much running down on questions so if anybody else wants to get them please go ahead now but steve at this point in time this is the last question what are the projected timelines for breakeven and return to profitability is there a year by which we could expect this to occur steven hoang yes thank you for the question again the team is still evaluating all forecasts just to show in the breakeven time at this moment janet meiklejohn great so i ll just i ll give it a few seconds here i m just going through the last question i think at this time i think all of the questions that have been oh okay here s okay here s oh now they re all coming in okay sorry about that so another one from a shareholder steve i think this is for you what is the ceo compensation plan and is it tied to the stock price and if not why steven hoang as of right now i don t have any insights into the ceo compensation plan but again we ll update or it will be posted and filed accordingly janet meiklejohn how many parimal this is for you how many production shifts are running now parimal rana we are currently running 2 production shifts in rupert and 1 production shift in victoria and patterson janet meiklejohn and then jordan this might be a good question to say from an investor is for us to wrap up on which is what can you say to give investors confidence to continue to invest in your company jordan rogers that is a great question to end this session and we really take a heart at these questions and appreciate them so thank you i think the fact that we have amazing products that taste great that have really been validated in the market through same store sales growth with authentic ingredients and as climate change and world issues become more precarious our brand offers a solution to our consumers and they continue to validate it so i m really excited with our great products and also what we have in the r d pipe which has generated a lot of retailer excitement and i think we re really just getting started yet we have a lot of work to do and we re excited to have everyone on this very good journey with us janet meiklejohn with that i think we ll close out this call operator could you help us with that operator thank you this concludes today s conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation

hey there time traveller this article was published 13 04 2022 732 days ago so information in it may no longer be current as manitobans began to dig out from a major spring snowstorm thursday environment canada defended its dire warning and credited early precautions for saving lives before the colorado low started moving into the province tuesday the national forecaster warned it could be manitoba s worst blizzard in decades by the time it moved into northern ontario on friday its message for people to stock up and stay home appeared to raise expectations for calamity while prompting schools and businesses to announce closures before the first snowflakes fell and the rcmp to consider shutting highways in advance for some parts of manitoba it probably was the worst blizzard in decades where we ve had huge amounts of snow and visibility reduced to near zero said natalie hasell a warning preparedness meteorologist for environment canada i d rather we had sent the warnings out instead of not telling people and horrible things happening we ll never know how many people we saved by taking these precautions people should realize the outcome isn t as bad as it is because people who need to make decisions made those decisions and people listened and heeded those warnings the behaviour of storms is difficult to predict she said as the different computer models used by environment canada don t always agree hasell said unconfirmed snowfall amounts reported by volunteers as of thursday afternoon are within the range that was predicted some such as 82 cm in onanole and 60 centimetres in killarney are near the higher end of what was expected winnipeg s total will be on the lower end of the 30 cm to 50 cm that was forecast some of the highest totals reported by environment canada volunteers or weatherlogics by 4 p m include 45 cm in selkirk and somerset 40 cm in morden and 38 cm in st andrews it was a very different storm depending on where you are in the province said hasell environment canada lifted its severe weather warnings in southern manitoba after the worst of the storm had cleared the region by afternoon hasell said the storm stalled over manitoba for a time and will take longer to move out of eastern manitoba as the four day event ends friday snowfall warnings were still in place for parts of central and northern manitoba including swan river grand rapids poplar river and oxford house life rolled on in winnipeg on thursday after it avoided the worst of the april storm thanks to a lengthy break in heavy snowfall a day earlier the city said it would reopen facilities and resume services in the days ahead after being closed cancelled or suspended as a precaution the winnipeg regional health authority ended its severe weather response plan and flights resumed at winnipeg james armstrong richardson international airport schools remained closed across southern and central manitoba memes created by winnipeggers made light of the storm with one circulating on social media describing it as a letdown people living in rural manitoba had a different take however residents were snowed in by massive drifts or still dealing with poor visibility and highway and business closures we ve lived here for 16 years i don t think we ve ever seen a storm this bad here deb bauche we ve got one drift on our deck that s five feet high and almost touching one coming off the roof said deb bauche who lives just north of the international peace garden border crossing in southwestern manitoba s turtle mountains we ve lived here for 16 years i don t think we ve ever seen a storm this bad here to those who think the storm wasn t that bad i d say it s lucky it missed you said bauche who was waiting for impassable roads to be plowed i don t think we ll be getting out of here until at least monday guy chamberlain who lives in sandy lake about 90 kilometres northwest of brandon had to clear snow from a neighbour s door so she could get out in my yard the drifts are a good three feet tall there are snow drifts of five feet in the back lane he said i haven t seen this much snow in well over 20 years scott kehler president and chief scientist at winnipeg based forecaster weatherlogics said some manitobans may feel the storm was overblown because they didn t experience the brunt of it after hearing the worst blizzard in decades warning guy chamberlain s home in sandy lake he said snow drifts formed by strong winds are about five feet 152 cm tall now guy chamberlain photo winnipeg s wind gusts weren t as strong and visibility not as poor as in western manitoba said kehler and hasell environment canada reported gusts of 91 km h in brandon on wednesday the experience in the west was far more severe said kehler had that break in the snow which we call a dry slot not moved in we probably would have ended up near 50 cm in winnipeg even if it wasn t the worst blizzard in a long time said kehler the warning encouraged people to plan for the worst and stay safe justin oertel who runs the manitoba weather centre said the announcement this storm could be the worst in decades rang hollow with many i think we have to be careful with the wording we use said oertel who lives in brandon i think it was right for them to come out and say this has the possibility of being a large storm rcmp spokeswoman cpl julie courchaine and dr rob grierson chief medical officer of emergency services for shared health agreed lives were saved as manitobans took warnings seriously and hunkered down i think by having that messaging out there early it really changed how things went said courchaine people really seemed to plan ahead i m really pleased people stayed off the roads as much as possible i think by having that messaging out there early it really changed how things went people really seemed to plan ahead i m really pleased people stayed off the roads as much as possible rcmp spokeswoman cpl julie courchaine she said no serious crashes had been reported as of thursday morning and only a small number of stranded drivers had to be rescued grierson said calls to the medical transportation centre were lower than the usual volume during a major storm which allowed crews to get to other incidents we primarily attribute that to the fact people decided to stay home he said cancellations and closures club regent casino mcphillips station casino and the shark club gaming centre closed for the day at 2 30 p m all winnipeg and rural liquor marts will close at 6 p m on wednesday except for locations in brandon dauphin flin flon the pas and thompson which will remain open until their regular closing times the virden liquor mart closed at 4 p m liquor marts across manitoba reopened at their usual times today

high risk highways click here for the latest highway information close hospital and emergency services workers including the rcmp slept overnight at work in case roads became impassable heather mack

in brandon university s applied disaster and emergency studies department said the warnings and precautions were the right thing to do to prevent situations such as children getting stuck at school in

bad or nothing serious happens said lindsay if nothing serious happens it looks like we overreacted i hope people see that s why it didn t get that bad instead of seeing it as an overreaction as media

china s new rules in the pipeline on human genetic resources will clarify jurisdictions of regulatory bodies and enhance supervision related to biopharmaceutical research and will have a lasting impact on international cooperation regarding the nation s biomaterials experts said last month the ministry of science and technology released the draft implementation rules for human genetic resources management the proposal now in its public consultation phase will be a major addition to china s regulation of human genetic resources following the adoption of the biosecurity law and the data security law both of which took effect last year academia has deemed the 21st century as the century of biology given the fact that biology plays a key role in tackling global challenges such as pandemic prevention food security and treatment of cancer new technologies including artificial intelligence and big data are also being used to drive biological innovations therefore the new rules may help china mitigate risks and promote the healthy development of its biopharmaceutical sector making its companies and products more competitive and in tune with international standards experts said chu jiayou former director of the institute of medical biology of the chinese academy of medical sciences said china s biopharmaceutical research has advanced rapidly in recent years so there is a massive need for human genetic resources during drug development according to a report by mckinsey co last year the combined market value of publicly listed chinese biopharmaceutical companies on nasdaq the hong kong stock exchange and the shanghai stock exchange science and technology innovation board surged from 3 billion in 2016 to over 380 billion in july last year however some entities have used human genetic materials to conduct risky and even illegal research so protecting human genetic resources will play a key role in safeguarding the rights of individuals and national biosecurity chu told a newspaper affiliated with the central commission for discipline inspection in recent decades the united states brazil japan and many european countries have strengthened their management of human genetic resources this subject has gradually become a field with global strategic importance he added china s new rules define human genetic resources as genetic materials including organs tissues and cells as well as genetic information such as the human genome and genes the new rules state that foreign organizations and individuals as well as entities formed or controlled by foreign stakeholders are prohibited from collecting and preserving chinese human genetic resources inside china or taking them outside of the country the collection storage and supply of chinese human genetic resources must be carried out by chinese scientific research institutions universities medical institutions and enterprises it added according to british law firm simmons simmons the new rules may affect china s international cooperation in biomedical research since it will grant the country s ministry of science and technology significantly increased capacity and efficiency in processing project applications related to human genetic resources the new rules also clarify the definition of a foreign controlled entity as an organization in which foreigners hold more than 50 percent of equity or wield major influence over decision making internal management and contractual or other arrangements data security related to human genetic resources is strongly emphasized in the draft rules the proposal also dedicates a chapter to the procedures for administrative penalties the proposed new rules have fleshed out many details of the regulatory framework on human genetic resources that was issued in 2019 by the state council china s cabinet according to a chief scientist of a tianjin based biotech company who requested anonymity it is a very instructive and meticulous piece of regulation that will have a lasting impact on how bio research will be conducted in china and with global partners the scientist said bio ethics regarding human genetic research has always been a pressing issue for the global biotechnology sector i believe china s latest effort to optimize its management of human genetic resources will ensure the positive growth of its bio industry

russian president vladimir putin will not get the imperialist vindication he craves a frustration that has hardened his resolve to settle down for an exhaustive war of attrition photograph evgeny biyatov sputnik kremlin pool photo via ap it is difficult to dispute the stark assertion of ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy that russia s war on his country will become an endless bloodbath while he and his people will continue to be applauded for their courage and spirit they will not get what they want international intervention on a scale that will halt the barbarity of vladimir putin neither will putin get the imperialist vindication he craves a frustration that has already hardened his resolve to settle down for an exhaustive war of attrition historians of the future will devote considerable effort to defining the essence of putinism and they will find that prior to the war on ukraine there were plenty of signals as to what drove his project in many ways putin is firmly on the path to what andrei kovalev who served during the final years of the soviet union in the ussr ministry of foreign affairs described in his 2017 book russia s dead end billed as an insider s testimony from gorbachev to putin kovalev s book depicts a putin s russia dragged backwards corrupt authoritarian and with increasing unpredictability and antipathy towards the west and its allies but kovalev holds out the possibility that eventually russia will be rebuilt from within from the bottom up a task that will take at least three generations kovalev also chastises the west for its self interest and naivete in appeasing putin embezzlement and remilitarisation kovalev focuses on how a rather narrow but powerful circle of ideologues vanquished history and established a monopoly over historical truth or more accurately pseudo truth russia s 21st century czars simply kept the soviet methods and apparatchiks in place with kovalev suggesting the west s indulgence allowed putin the space and wealth to exploit russian citizens in a manner indicating a distressing degree of continuity he quotes the poet nikolai nekrasov from 1875 who observed in the midst of the 19th century imperialism that russians had endured tough times historically but none that were morally more despicable kovalev argues that verdict is even more applicable to recent times with the added ingredient of an unprecedented rise in world prices for oil and gas enabling vast sums to be embezzled and spent on remilitarisation an essential ingredient in the overall project of restoring russia s greatness and which also involves the promotion of a national ideology to make it easier to target internal enemies and inconvenient people historians of the future will devote considerable effort to defining the essence of putinism and they will find prior to the war on ukraine there were plenty of signals but some of the analysis of putin also held out hope that because russian oligarchs deposited so much of their wealth in the west they would only tolerate putin going so far and that due to putin and his circle s reliance on targeted terror according to kovalev they simply won t be capable of engaging in mass repressions an inability that would ultimately prompt internal upheaval read more putin s bloodlust is also born of an insecurity described in robert nalbandov s 2016 study of russian foreign policy not by bread alone as necessitating a vision of a significant external threat to ensure that domestic institutional actors would rally around his rule this was accomplished by exploiting russia s own identity crisis in aspiring to superpower status it needs to construct a superpower nemesis on the other side of the international relations field economic elite the annexation of crimea in 2014 prompted external self serving suggestions that it was an illustration of weakness and the limits of expansionism rather than a revival of russian imperialism which explained the pitiful sanctions in response the moscow stock market even lifted after those sanctions were announced at that time it was widely held that given its trading patterns and economic elite russia could not afford to be ostracised in the words of john cassidy in the new yorker logic and putin s own history suggest he will push the west as far as he can without causing real damage to russia s economy but no further there has been much focus on how putin s actions have solidified a ukrainian unity of identity purpose and resolve but the price exacted is appalling for all the attempts to excavate the layers of history and social political and cultural currents the psychology of putin seems horribly simple revolving around a reverence of strength above all else no matter what the human toll there has been much focus on how his actions have solidified a ukrainian unity of identity purpose and resolve but the price exacted is appalling the bravery and dignity of those who face the gravest consequences will continue to be lauded and putin will go down in history as a war criminal but it seems too optimistic to hope the war might prompt the beginning of what kovalev argued would be a challenge from within russia something zelenskiy hoped for too when he spoke directly to the russian people hours before the invasion imploring them to hear us international relations professor nina khrushcheva great granddaughter of former soviet premier nikita khrushchev has no doubt that putin believes blood will be forgotten and his legacy as the uniter of russian lands no matter what the cost will remain
between air raid sirens in odessa svetlana niselevitch an 84 year old ukrainian jewish holocaust survivor has been preparing to join a passover seder for the first time in her life we didn t observe jewish traditions in my family niselevitch a poet who was born in kharkiv told the jewish telegraphic agency but she said russia s invasion of ukraine as well as the covid 19 pandemic convinced her that every chance to practice jewishness is important niselevitch who will celebrate passover at an event organized by the american jewish joint distribution committee or jdc is among the thousands of ukrainian jews who are preparing to celebrate the jewish holiday in dozens of group seders both in ukraine and outside it for jewish refugees from russia s war emergency curfews supply chain interruptions and the dangers of war are complicating ukrainian jews efforts to celebrate passover the holiday that celebrates jewish freedom and security advertisement still the fact that so many jews are participating demonstrates both the robustness of the worldwide relief effort supporting ukrainian jews and judaism s ongoing resilience in a region scarred by the holocaust and communist suppression of religion staff of jdc packing matzahs and hagadahs for online seders in odessa ukraine april 7 2022 credit jdc thousands of ukrainians have died in the ensuing conflict and millions have left the country mostly into neighboring european countries and for jews and their family members to israel millions more have become internally displaced seeking refuge in places they hope are unlikely to draw russian bombings for the jews who remain inside ukraine wanting to participate in large gatherings in such circumstances may seem counterintuitive especially considering that the pandemic is still raging across eastern europe but it s only natural said gershon birenboim a jewish teacher who is helping to prepare a group seder for jewish refugees from odessa kharkiv kyiv and beyond who are staying at a resort in irshava in western ukraine when you ve fled a war sometimes being separated from family leaving behind everything that s when you ll start looking for the things that connect you and tie you down he said chabad and jdc have been organizing group seders across eastern europe for decades including under challenging geopolitical circumstances other groups such as the hias jewish refugee agency are departing from their normal activities to offer passover events advertisement at least 20 cities in ukraine will have group seders run by chabad similar to normal years according to motti seligson the chabad lubavitch movement s director of media relations chabad alone has collected at least 20 tons of matzah in ukraine despite border closures customs delays and other supply chain failures connected to russia s feb 24 invasion into ukraine there are other complications part of the tradition of passover is to discuss the story of the jewish exodus from egypt late into the night but most of the country s cities have emergency curfews in place some seders including one for 300 guests in kyiv are being held at hotels where the seder participants can sleep over for people unable or afraid to attend in person seders the jdc has set up a virtual online seder the event will build on technology and techniques the organization has perfected during covid to relieve loneliness among thousands of elderly aid recipients without exposing them to risk funded by the uja federation of new york the jewish federations of north america and the claims conference the new york federation said it had sent more than 20 000 prepackaged seder kits to ukraine in advance of the holiday niselevitch the poet from odessa is opting for the online celebration which is held before sunset so as not to violate the jewish legal prohibitions around using electricity on passover we celebrate jewish holidays at home the way we are able to and the way we know probably not the most perfect way she said evgenia malikova a 67 year old retired international aid professional from kyiv who last month fled ukraine to belgium has attended seders in the past but only a couple of times my father was jewish my mother was not i m not very deeply immersed in religion in judaism though i am attached to it she told jta in brussels she has decided to join the seder being organized by hias at the city s european jewish community centre she feels she s very much behind on celebrating jewish traditions generally but part of what made malikova who has one daughter and two grandchildren in berlin want to attend a seder is the symbolic similarity of the exodus which reminds me of what s happening now she added many ukrainian refugees outside their country are also seeking a seder and the company of their fellow jews according to rabbi zushe abelsky the director of chabad in moldova where hundreds of thousands of ukrainians have fled including many members of the jewish minority of ukraine which numbers at least 43 000 people demand for seders in chisinau moldova s capital is so high that abelsky and his staff have had to open the central synagogue of chisinau even though it is currently closed for renovations the local community which numbers about 1 900 people according to a 2020 study had planned to celebrate in a smaller alternative venue this year chabad of moldova which usually stocks up on matzah and other passover supplies months in advance has received them only this week we were hunting for matzah every piece we could get abelsky said part of the problem was that moldova s jewish community relies on ukraine s for such supplies they had to be imported from israel and hungary this year with help from the international fellowship of christians and jews many other groups sent supplies to eastern europe in advance of passover the orthodox union for instance said it had sent more than 200 tons of food and medical supplies including 70 000 pounds of matzah 50 tons of kosher meat and chicken and 14 500 gallons of grape juice in addition to moldova poland hungary romania are among the east european countries where jewish communities are organizing public seders for refugees complete with russian language haggadahs containing the seder text in poland world central kitchen the food aid group operated by chef jose andres will be serving 15 000 kosher for passover meals a day to jewish refugees there according to the new york federation in hungary the government this week set aside at the request of local jewish leaders one refugee housing facility to be made kosher for passover they chose the lush őszöd lakeside resort 70 miles outside of budapest where 200 ukrainian jews were already staying the resort is where a former prime minister in 2006 delivered a famous profanity laden speech accusing his own socialist party of corruption widely seen as a factor in bringing prime minister viktor orban s right wing fidesz party to power the thousands of jewish arrivals to western europe and especially germany and austria will also have seders especially designed for them including at the lauder chabad campus in vienna and in israel where thousands of ukrainians and russians have moved because of the war the jewish agency chabad and individual municipalities such as nof hagalil are also giving public seders for refugees mostly at the hotels where they are being housed in chisinau abelsky a 55 year old who has four children with his wife chayah is preparing to deliver a few words addressed to the hundreds of ukrainians who have joined his community at least temporarily and its three public seders the israelites began fleeing egypt under the cover of darkness at night he told jta but

cents while atomos has yet to appoint a new ceo atomos chief technology officer trevor elbourne will assume the interim position estelle mcgechie and cto trevor elbourne image credit atomos the reason for this move according to atomos was estelle mcgechie s appointment as ceo of atomos has concluded primarily because she has not yet relocated to australia the company has always indicated that it requires the ceo to be based in its melbourne headquarters estelle mcgechie was only announced as ceo back in september last year the press release issued by atomos at the time stated sydney australia atomos limited announced the appointment of its chief product officer estelle mcgechie to the position of chief executive officer effective immediately whilst currently based in silicon valley estelle

platform which was acquired by adobe in august 2021 during her time at apple estelle oversaw worldwide product development and marketing of professional video applications such as final cut pro motion and compressor in addition to further developing apple technologies of prores and prores raw xml fxplug and workflow extensions chris tait atomos executive chair said after estelle s appointment as chief product officer in june this year she quickly demonstrated to the board and her peers her understanding of our key technologies markets and customers it became clear she can substantially contribute to and lead the effort on delivering our strategy her signature collaborative style and rigorous approach to developing and bringing video technology products and services to market is a

community of customers who are so deeply committed to their craft i look forward to bringing everything i ve learnt from my international career home to australia to continue our positive momentum image credit atomos on the 15th of february this year atomos released its half yearly revenue figures even though the company made almost 41 million australian dollars in revenue which was almost 25 more than they made in the previous corresponding half year they spent a lot more money on r d and advertising this meant that its net profit after tax for the half year was just 321 000 this was 82 less than the previous corresponding half year over the last 6 months the share price has fallen quite a lot atomos doesn t pay shareholders dividends it invests all of its money back into the company companies often have to go through cycles where they need to invest a lot of money into r d especially when they need to come up with new products to sell i would assume that because atomos released quite a few products in 2021 they needed to invest a lot of the profits they subsequently made into coming up with new products to release this year despite this news and the falling share price financial experts still forecast good results for atomos moving forward image credit atomos below you can read the full statement that was released by the atomos board of directors atomos limited asx

mr price i have a couple of announcements at the top and then we ll turn to your questions you may have seen yesterday that the cdc announced changes to their covid 19 travel health notice system we here at the department of state have also reassessed how covid 19 considerations factor into our travel advisory levels for u s citizens starting next week the state department travel advisory levels will no longer automatically correlate with the cdc covid 19 travel health notice level however if the cdc raises a country to a level 4 for covid 19 or if covid 19 related restrictions threaten to strand isolate or otherwise seriously affect u s citizens the state department s travel advisory for that country will also be raised to a level 4 or do not travel the updated framework will significantly reduce the level the number of level 4 travel advisories and we believe it will help u s citizens make better informed decisions about the safety of international travel at this time we encourage u s citizens planning international travel this summer or any other time to check their passport expiration date act now to renew or apply for the first time keep in mind that many countries do require passports to have at least six months remaining validity for entry routine passport processing as we have warned can take eight to 11 weeks we also encourage u s citizens to stay connected with us via travel state gov and through our travel gov social media accounts and to enroll in the smart traveler enrollment program or step to receive timely alerts about evolving health and safety conditions and finally today the u s department of state released our first ever equity action plan to implement executive order 13985 on advancing racial equity and support for underserved communities through the federal government we joined over 90 federal agencies and all cabinet level agencies across the u s government in this launch this plan is the product of president biden s historic executive order directing federal agencies to address barriers to opportunity for underrepresented and underserved communities our equity action plan outlines commitments actions and accountability mechanisms to improve our effectiveness in successfully integrating equity across our foreign affairs work with that happy to take your questions daphne question russia warned today that it would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles into leningrad if finland and sweden joined nato is the u s concerned about russia upping its rhetoric around this and then i have a question on embassy staffing as well mr price the warning i saw in that regard came from a former russian official who is no longer in power and arguably may not have been in power at the time he purportedly was in power so no we don t have a specific response to that the russian federation knows where we stand in terms of our commitment to article 5 the idea the sacrosanct commitment we have that an attack on one is an attack on all but we don t have a specific response to that question france said today it will very soon transfer back its embassy in ukraine from kyiv to lviv are u s embassy staff still commuting from poland to lviv and are there any plans to stop commuting and be fully operational in lviv or to reopen the embassy in kyiv mr price well a number of weeks ago just before the start of the invasion a core mission ukraine team that previously was working from lviv relocated to poland they remain in poland they are not currently traveling over the border to ukraine due to the unstable security situation i will say however that we are constantly evaluating and re evaluating the safety and the security situation it is of course our goal to have a diplomatic presence re established in ukraine as soon as it would be safe and practical to have u s diplomats on the ground there but i would also hasten to add that the lack of a u s diplomatic presence u s diplomatic officials in ukraine has in no way hampered our ability to coordinate and to consult with our ukrainian partners in fact just today just a few hours ago secretary blinken again had an opportunity to speak over the phone to foreign minister kuleba foreign minister kuleba of course is the same foreign minister kuleba that we saw last week in brussels it was the same foreign minister kuleba that secretary blinken saw just before that in warsaw the same foreign minister kuleba that he saw just before that inside ukraine when we met with foreign minister kuleba and his team along the polish ukrainian border of course president biden spoke to president zelenskyy yesterday secretary austin routinely speaks to his ukrainian counterpart so the point is that our engagement has been consistent it s been routine it s been very deep to discuss precisely the issues that are of most important to us how we can continue to support our ukrainian partners and how we can continue to hold the kremlin to account for its illegal war of aggression against the state and the people of ukraine question is there a likelihood that secretary is there a likelihood that secretary blinken will go to ukraine mr price i don t have any travel question there s been a great deal of talk mr price i don t have any travel to speak to what i would do is reiterate what i just said secretary blinken on very frequent occasions has the opportunity to speak to his ukrainian counterpart he ends up speaking to foreign minister kuleba roughly several times a week most weeks and in recent weeks we ve ended up seeing foreign minister kuleba in person as well question on the issue of diplomacy and diplomatic presence and so on you spoke about diplomatic presence in ukraine american diplomatic presence can you update us on the u s diplomatic presence in russia in moscow and vice versa is there anything that is happening are you guys in contact with the russians through ambassador sullivan or are you here in contact with ambassador antonov mr price that s the point of our diplomatic presence in russia and around the world to be in contact with the host government so of course we do have a functioning embassy in moscow ambassador sullivan is in as are ambassador sullivan s deputies and colleague in regular contact with their russian counterparts on issues of bilateral interest we have spoken not only in recent months but throughout the course of this administration about the unfortunate actions that the russian federation has taken to limit our diplomatic presence on the ground in russia what we seek is parity in terms of the level of diplomatic staffing that we are able to have in our embassy in russia our embassy in moscow and what the russians have here in the united states we believe that the diplomatic relationship the ability to communicate clearly effectively and oftentimes frankly is important at all times but it s especially important in times of increased tension and in the case of russia s aggression against ukraine in the case of conflict yes jenny question the icc prosecutor general is on the ground in ukraine right now i know you mentioned repeatedly that the u s is supporting international mechanisms is the u s sharing information with the icc on potential war crimes and then can you just clarify is the u s doing its own assessment of whether atrocities like genocide and war crimes have taken place in ukraine mr price let me start with that second question which i appreciate because i believe there is a misimpression about the process that is involved here i think specifically there s a misimpression that the department would require a demand signal or an order from on high to undertake a careful review of what is transpiring on the ground in ukraine to be clear there is a constant demand signal including from secretary blinken for insight into potential atrocities or atrocity crimes committed around the world and as a matter of course our office of global criminal justice and their colleagues other experts from the department are carefully reviewing all of the inputs that are available to us regarding what is transpiring in ukraine that includes very public data points that all of us have seen across our television screens that we ve read in newspaper but it also includes details gleaned from intelligence reporting as well as we ve said and this gets to the first part of your question our priority at the moment is pursuing accountability for atrocity crimes and we re supporting the efforts of various accountability mechanisms including the efforts of the ukrainian prosecutor general whose work we have assisted since long before russia s current military campaign in ukraine began we ve been assisting this work for the better part of a decade now as you may know and i mentioned this yesterday our ambassador at large for global criminal justice beth van schaack is going to have an engagement she s going to engage virtually with her ukrainian excuse me with the ukrainian prosecutor general who is leading an effort when it comes to criminal accountability for what has already transpired in ukraine that will take place tomorrow but let me hasten to add that same broader process the process to collect analyze share document evidence of atrocities and potential atrocity crimes is the very same one that could ultimately inform other potential atrocity crime determinations including the atrocity crime of genocide as you know the department has already assessed that members of russia s forces have committed war crimes one of the three forms of atrocity crimes another atrocity crime there is just to reiterate a constant demand signal in this building for that work for a few reasons it helps us shine a spotlight on these atrocities it helps us bring the world together in our diplomatic campaign in support of our ukrainian partners and in the diplomatic campaign to hold russia to account and to craft our public messaging how we speak about what is transpiring in ukraine and when it comes to all of those elements we will follow the facts we will follow the law wherever they lead yes question so sorry just to clarify mr price sure question are you currently sharing information with the icc given that the u s is not a party mr price so we are in the first instance supporting the work of the ukrainian prosecutor general because there is a very clear jurisdiction in terms of her work for potentially holding war criminals in this case accountable for the atrocity crimes they have committed we are consulting very closely with allies and partners about potential other accountability mechanisms in fact we ve helped to birth at least one accountability mechanism we as part of our re engagement with the un s human rights council helped to establish the commission of inquiry that is now focused on this as well the osce and the moscow mechanism the first report of which was issued yesterday we re supporting but when it comes to the icc we know that the icc is one potential venue for accountability we have cooperated with the icc in the past i believe i mentioned this yesterday that within recent days the trial of a former janjaweed commander has begun at the hague under the auspices of the icc that is that individual is being tried in part based upon evidence that the department of state ourselves collected for his role in the genocidal campaign that the omar al bashir regime carried out a number of years ago but we are consulting very closely with allies and partners with an eye first and foremost to the mechanisms and to the jurisdictions that will help us see that ultimate goal of accountability achieved yes question thank you mr price good opportunity for me i ask three questions mr price good to see you question number one thank you number one the taliban still continue their policy toward afghan girls not allowed to go to school what will be the next consequence from the state department number two the people who are approve for siv visa are still there was some problem because they have children over 21 or 22 years old they have problem they cannot travel without their kids and number three the people who applied for the siv visa after september 10 they didn t get any response from the state department and also the last question some afghan former soldiers disappearing from the taliban jail and nobody know where they are of course some people think that they get killed by the taliban and afghan people think that united states forgot afghan people and all attention goes to the ukraine i don t know mr price well nothing could be further from the truth as you know we have continued to stand by the people of afghanistan in terms of our humanitarian leadership and the contributions that we have made including in recent days to the humanitarian needs of the afghan people but also in terms of what we re doing diplomatically on the world stage together with our allies and partners and you raise the issue of girls education and the egregious decision last month march 23rd what was supposed to be the first day of the school year for school children including girls across the country turned into a day of horrible disappointment and despair for millions of afghans with the taliban s very regrettable decision not to allow girls to return to secondary school this in doing so the taliban reversed commitments that they had made very publicly and commitments that we had discussed with them privately as well their decision as i mentioned before it was a deeply disappointing one it was in some ways an inexplicable reversal of the commitments that they had made to their own people we ve made the point previously that education is not only a human right but it is indispensable to the success of any particular country holding back more than half of any country s population is not a recipe for success for afghanistan or anywhere else around the world no country can succeed economically no country can succeed politically no country can succeed on any basis when half of its population or more than half of its population is unable to go to school ultimately unable to join the join a workforce together with our partners in the international community we have been working for some time and we continue to work to support education in afghanistan expecting that schools last month would have opened for all we have called on the taliban to overcome whatever impediments exist to implementing the commitments they ve made to honor the commitments they ve made to their own people each day that afghanistan s secondary schools remain closed to girls is another missed day of school another missed opportunity not only for the girls of afghanistan but for the people and the country of afghanistan the secretary the deputy secretary tom west our special representative for afghanistan our special envoy for afghan women girls and human rights rina amiri our chargé d affaires who is now based in doha they have all decried this decision on the part of the taliban we have also done so in coordination with many of our close partners around the world shortly after the taliban announced this decision we released a joint statement with our counterparts in canada in france germany italy japan norway the uk and the high representative of the european union all condemning the decision on the part of the taliban not to reopen secondary schools the organization of islamic cooperation similarly put out a statement as well as female foreign ministers from 16 at least 16 countries around the world from albania to tonga and the uk this was a topic of discussion during the extended troika that tom west attended late last month in tunxi china and we have been very clear that if this decision is not reversed and if it s not reversed promptly it will hold significant serious implications for our ability to engage with the taliban and the taliban s desire to have better relations not only with the united states but with the international community yes question on taiwan several u s senators arrived to taiwan today was the do you have anything on that first and first of all and then second of all was the state department given a heads up before their visit what is the message u s is sending to taiwan and china thank you mr price i don t have a comment on the congressional delegation i would need to refer you to the members of congress the state department does assist members of congress as a routine matter oftentimes when they travel overseas but for comment on this particular visit i would need to refer you to those members said question and also i have a follow up earlier in april deputy secretary mckeon met with who director general and taiwan s participation of who was discussed how hopeful is the united states that taiwan will be invited as an observer to the world health assembly in may thank you mr price well it s something that we support that we have consistently supported we believe that taiwan consistent with its status should have meaningful participation in international organizations so it s something that we ll continue to support said question thank you i have a couple of questions on the palestinian issue first of all i want to note that the palestinian affairs unit chief george noll spoke to the family of ghada sabateen yesterday to express your condolences to the family and demand investigation does that mean there is a marked change i mean you ve never done that before do you have evidence that this was done in a cold blooded fashion for instance i mean she was a mother of five she was partially blind and so on mr price i don t have any additional information for you on that as you know our officials on the ground do often engage with israelis with palestinians but i don t have anything to read out from any particular engagement question okay i have a few other questions the israeli times of israel newspaper reported that the u s aims to fold palestinians into an expanded cooperation between israel and arab states how do you envision this happening mr price well said you saw the negev ministerial that secretary blinken attended with several of his counterparts from israel and the arab world and there was a focus during the course of that ministerial on of course the abraham accords and the normalization agreements that have brought built bridges and brought new opportunities for israelis and arabs alike with normalization becoming in some ways the new normal and the opportunities that come with that but what we heard during the ministerial itself and what you heard during the press availability that the ministers participated in was a recognition on the part of secretary blinken on the part of others that normalization can t be a substitute for progress between israelis and palestinians and so as israel and its arab neighbors enjoy additional opportunities owing to the progress that normalization is bringing with it there was a concerted desire on the part of secretary blinken on the part of his arab counterparts on the part of foreign minister lapid of israel to do what we can across several different areas the working groups that are emanating from the negev forum to achieve progress when it comes to conditions for the palestinian people question and my last question regarding the human rights report i mean the human rights report that was a issued a couple days ago it talks extensively about the west bank and israel and so on my question pertains to the six human rights organizations that were listed as terrorist organizations they have they issued an appeal to you to europeans and so on to follow through i mean you were investigating this you i guess requested the israelis to supply you with why they listed them to begin with and that was back in october where do we stand have you gotten a satisfactory response from the israelis do you believe that these organizations should be or should remain listed as terrorist organizations mr price well we have received detailed information on that very question from our israeli partners and it s something that we re continuing to review question but is their response satisfactory as far as you re concerned mr price we received question that they have committed such egregious acts to require enlisted or being enlisted on the terror organization mr price we received detailed information from our israeli partners on the basis for their designation we re taking a very close look at that ourselves michel question hello ned do you have any update on the talks with iran any new session in vienna soon and did the u s unfreeze any money for iran or do you know of any of your allies that unfrozen any amount mr price all of our sanctions remain in effect and all of our sanctions will remain in effect until and unless we re able to achieve a mutual return to compliance with the jcpoa it s been very unfortunate to see a number of stories that are false that are completely untrue not only on the questions of sanctions or reported sanctions relief i should say but the related question or the way it s been conflated of false claims of a detainee deal the fact is unfortunately we don t have any breakthrough to announce any information relating to our negotiations regarding wrongful detainees americans who are held wrongfully in iran would come directly from the state department we know there s been a lot of false information out there we urge everyone to exercise caution with these reports but the fact is now that there are two parallel tracks that are underway with iran one as we ve talked about in the context of vienna for mutual return to full implementation of the jcpoa and one on the release of all four u s citizens who are unjustly held in iran unfortunately at this stage neither of these negotiations has been successfully concluded any reports otherwise including as you referred to michel reports that iranian funds held in restricted accounts in third countries would be transferred are false and our partners have not released these restricted funds to iran nor has the united states authorized or approved any such transfer of restricted funds to iran we are continuing to approach both of these negotiations with the utmost urgency we urge iran to do the same we urge iran to allow u s citizens baquer and siamak namazi emad shargi and morad tahbaz to return home to their loved ones yes question thank you so much this is jahanzaib ali from ary news tv pakistan pakistani newly elected prime minister shehbaz sharif has said that he wants better relations with united states to promote shared goals of peace security and development in the region does the u s see his election of pm sharif of an opportunity to improve the bilateral relations with pakistan mr price well you probably saw a statement that we released from the secretary last night regarding the selection of prime minister shehbaz sharif for almost 75 years the relationship between the united states and pakistan has been a vital one we look forward to continuing that work with pakistan s government to promote peace and prosperity in pakistan and the broader region and in that spirit we ve congratulated prime minister shehbaz sharif on his election by the pakistani parliament and we look forward to working with him and his government question the former prime minister of pakistan imran khan still blaming u s for his ouster while his supporters are organizing anti u s protest here in america like in different states yesterday d c his supporters attack on pakistani american journalist and a few community members who disagree with them so do you have any message with them who are organizing anti u s protests here in america even when you rejected all those claims and white house also rejected all those claims mr price our message has been clear and consistent on this there is no truth whatsoever to the allocations that have been put forward we support the peaceful upholding of constitutional and democratic principles including respect for human rights we do not support whether it s in pakistan or anywhere else around the world one political party over another we support broader principles including the rule of law and equal justice under the law question sir one last question if you allow me please so today the pakistan s military spokesperson said that they had no evidence to suggest that united states had threatened or was involved in the conspiracy to seek the ouster of imran khan s government your thoughts and comment on this statement mr price we would agree with it thanks question inaudible from azerbaijan inaudible my question is when will the inaudible also amendment to the freedom support act be lifted from azerbaijan mr price well we remain committed to promoting a peaceful democratic and prosperous future for the south caucasus region and we welcome as you ve heard from us before in the readouts from secretary blinken the april 6 meeting between prime minister pashinyan and president aliyev in brussels including the positive momentum on preparations for peace talks and the formation of a bilateral commission on border delimitation as the secretary emphasized in the calls he had with those two leaders the day before on april 5th we continue to encourage further peace negotiations between armenia and azerbaijan and we reiterated and the secretary reiterated that the united states stands ready to engage bilaterally and with likeminded partners including through the role as an osce minsk group co chair to help the countries find a long term comprehensive peace question the same topic mr price sure question there s a phone call between deputy secretary sherman and her french colleague yesterday in which she discussed the south caucasus nagorno karabakh issue now we have lavrov a couple of days ago complaining that u s and france are not informing us about what they are doing are you guys deliberately shutting the door to russia s mediation efforts and given everything russia has done in ukraine do you think that doesn t that disqualify russia in peacemaking efforts between azerbaijan and armenia mr price i can t speak to the role that russia might play in this what i can say is that we stand ready to engage armenia and azerbaijan again bilaterally or with likeminded partners including through the osce mechanism conor question and one more question about osce report that you mentioned earlier so there are details that russia has been using osce symbols to do what it has been doing does that bother you at all is russia going to be suspended from osce if they continue doing that mr price i would have to refer you to the osce they put out the moscow mechanism under the auspices of the osce put out a comprehensive report yesterday regarding the atrocities the potential war crimes that according to the moscow mechanism the russians russia s forces have committed in ukraine but i would need to refer you to the osce to speak to the particulars conor question staying on ukraine pro russian social media accounts published what appears to be the u s passport of an american citizen named joseph ward clark claiming that he was captured or killed can you confirm whether or not that s the case mr price i cannot confirm that because reports that this u s citizen was captured in ukraine are not true can t offer anything further due to privacy considerations but those reports and those claims are not true question so are you saying that he wasn t captured but is the possibility that he was killed or is it s entirely false mr price i m limited in how much i can say due to privacy considerations but i have reason to believe that this individual is safe question is safe great mr price yep question and then to follow up on jenny s questions just on the meeting tomorrow that s happening between ambassador van schaack and the ukrainian prosecutor general are you is the u s providing intelligence to her office beyond just sort of cooperating and any financial support you re offering are you sharing intelligence on what you know about potential atrocities mr price so to the point earlier we are pulling every lever that s available to us to garner insight into what has transpired on the ground in ukraine what russia s forces have committed in terms of atrocity and atrocity crimes we are looking at open source information that is to say what all of us are seeing with our own eyes and reading with our own eyes but also we have the advantage of the resources of the u s intelligence community and the intelligence sharing relationships that we have around the world and as you might imagine there is quite a bit of focus trained on this very question i m not going to get into the specific type of information that ambassador van schaack may or may not share with her with the ukrainian prosecutor general tomorrow but what i can say is that we are providing our ukrainian partners with a range of information strategic information tactical information information that they would need for the purposes of primarily self defense question so not question ned do you have any comment on the ship moskva question sorry question i m sorry question so not for documenting atrocities it s more for the battlefield information mr price i m just not in a position to detail specifically what ambassador van schaack may provide in that regard but when it comes to our work here at the department we are taking a close look at everything that is available to us and our goal and what we are doing is documenting analyzing preserving and yes sharing that evidence and in the first instance we re sharing it with the ukrainian prosecutor general question and just one more on this then ambassador van schaack and ambassador carpenter have both said that all options are on the table including in terms of the question that jenny had about the icc but does that include the u s this administration potentially joining the icc and signing the rome statute or is that out of the question mr price i don t believe that is what s being referenced here what s being referenced here is the icc s is a potential venue for accountability for russian war criminals yes question i wanted to question yes thanks thank you for the opportunity mr price sure question my name is boris kunoski from macedonian information agency i have just couple of questions quick it s on it s about the eu integration process in the western balkans you know we know actually that bulgaria is blocking the process two years now almost two years now by vetoing north macedonians north macedonia s opening quote accession talks with the eu so my question is is are u s supporting the process to be untied because albania albanian prime minister recently met with the german chancellor and they said that i guess albanian minister prime minister that they might start the negotiation process with the eu besides macedonia and north macedonia to be left behind blocked excuse me blocked by bulgaria so this is my first question the second question is what is united states doing to convince bulgaria to lift its veto on north macedonia opening to open the accession talks with the eu having in mind the widespread russian influence on the balkans mr price thank you so for these questions i would need to refer you to the countries in question and to the eu we have bilateral partnerships with all of the countries in question as well as with the eu but those countries are best positioned to speak to it yes question i have two questions on north korea first is the u s treasury imposed another sanction on north korea today but yesterday the north korean regime opened a luxury housing complex in pyongyang so do you see this as evidence that there are many loopholes in north korean sanctions enough to that north koreans can build luxury houses in their capital and my second question is the department announced that special representative for dprk ambassador sung kim and the deputy representative dr jung pak will travel to seoul and so can you share about how they will address the concerns that north korea can test another icbm or resume nuclear test soon mr price so on your on the second part of your question we did announce today that sung kim our special envoy for the dprk and his deputy dr jung pak will travel to seoul later this month they don t leave for several days they ll be there from april 18th through the 22nd and during this trip they ll have an opportunity to meet with their counterparts other senior rok officials to discuss the situation on the korean peninsula including the international community s response to the recent icbm launches this is part of a regular engagement that our special envoy has with his south korean counterparts it s also part of the regular engagement and similar to the regular engagement that he has with our japanese counterparts as well and if i m not mistaken the special envoy had a phone conversation with his japanese counterpart just yesterday because we believe in the indispensability of working closely in the first instance with our japanese and south korean allies on the challenge posed by north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons program but also trilaterally and we have had recent opportunity to engage trilaterally with these two important allies including when secretary blinken met with his counterparts in honolulu late last year to discuss the dprk to your question about reports of potential planning on the part of the dprk i m not in a position to speak to those reports to confirm or to speak to any intelligence but what i can say and what we know is that the dprk in the past has on has used the occasion of holidays and other notable occasions within the dprk to engage in provocations so of course we re closely watching for that possibility yes question can i follow up on that mr price sure question so when ambassador sung kim is in south korea is he planning to meet dprk officials in the region mr price i am not aware of any plans to meet dprk officials he s there to meet with his south korean counterparts question thank you mr price yes question i wanted to follow up on a earlier question is there any change in how the u s views finland and sweden potentially joining nato given russia s threat today mr price there is no change because we believe that nato s open door is an open door and it is up to the nato alliance to determine and only the nato alliance to determine what its membership looks like as you know there are there is a set of criteria that any aspirant country would need to satisfy would need to answer for before it would be in a position to join the alliance that ultimately is a question for that aspirant country and nato s 30 allied members question can i follow up on that mr price sure question are there any discussions going on between finland and sweden and state about providing any sort of security in an interim period between application and accession to nato mr price well this is something that the nato secretary general spoke to when we were in brussels last week he said when he was asked quote i m certain that we will find ways to address concerns they may have regarding the period between the potential application and the final ratification so i d refer you to his comments on that question so no plans for any bilateral like security agreements or anything between the u s and either of those countries mr price we have sweden and finland are already close nato partners of course they are close partners bilaterally of the united states as well but i don t have anything to add beyond what the secretary general said daphne question if i could just follow up first of all regardless of medvedev s comments and he s still quite close to putin but the kremlin has also described this as something that would not bring stability to europe is the united states concerned that sweden and finland addition to nato could prompt russia to escalate mr price without speaking to any countries in particular we would not be concerned that the expansion of a defensive alliance would do anything other than promote stability on the european continent now of course any aspirant country would have to meet the criteria that s spelled out in nato s charter would have to receive consent from the alliance itself but again nato is a defensive alliance that is there to defend and to fortify and nato would not be a threat to anyone who is not attacking nato question ned can you comment on the ship the battleship russian battleship moskva that was allegedly struck by a ukrainian missile or do you have any other information that you could share with us mr price i don t have any information beyond what you ve heard from the department of defense the department of defense as i understand it this morning confirmed that there appears to have been an explosion on board but i don t have any further details to offer question can i ask you a question on the genocide aspect mr price sure question do you think that in the long term that frequent use or the repeated use of terms like war crimes or genocide would vitiate the enormity of such a thing like when one talks about genocide rwanda comes to mind or some things that are really horrendous do you believe that keep repeating this thing as we have seen in the last few days ultimately is not good in terms or that it lessened the enormity of such events mr price said we ve repeated the term war crimes because russia s forces are committing war crimes in ukraine that is the assessment of this department that russia s forces have engaged in war crimes i think that it underscores the atrocities and the level of atrocities the scale and the scope of atrocities that are being committed and as a general point i think your point is well taken but there is nothing routine there is nothing general about what all of us are seeing and have seen with our own eyes the level of brutality the level of atrocity that russia s forces have engaged in against the ukrainian people inside sovereign ukrainian territory question ned on ukraine and russia mr price sure question foreign minister kuleba tweeted that he discussed further sanctions with secretary blinken today should we expect them this week and also related to today s announcement on office of sanctions coordination which is a new office at the state department will the office coordinate efforts between the agencies here or is it about coordination between allies and partners like for instance the immediate neighbors to russia azerbaijan armenia and georgia i don t think they have clear understanding of what is allowed to what they are allowed to do what they are not allowed to do mr price inaudible that ll be a key charge of ambassador jim o brien who is the head of that new office at the department of state i hope many of you saw the announcement this morning that jim o brien who was confirmed by the senate last week is now hard at work in his new role this week he will work throughout this building he will work with the interagency throughout the administration but he ll also work with allies and partners to ensure that our approach to sanctions the implementation of sanctions the development of sanctions specific ones and sanctions authorities are coordinated and implemented effectively with allies and partners around the world remind me of your first question question it s about the new sanctions package mr price oh the we have previously made the point that as long as russia continues to escalate its actions against the people of ukraine until and unless its brutality comes to an end we will continue to escalate our measures and that would include additional financial and economic measures against the russian federation conor question on sanctions as russian forces now prepare for this offensive in the east and in the south is there any sense of urgency to apply new sanctions to provide obviously this new 800 million tranche of weaponry in order to try to stop its offensive from even happening in the first place mr price well conor i think the what is true and you ve heard this from our department of defense counterparts is that the russians have quite a bit of firepower in part because they ve been defeated in the battle of kyiv a battle that senior russian officials apparently thought that they would be able to win within a couple days of initiating it in february we re now some six weeks into this conflict and russian forces have been repelled from kyiv and are now repositioning to the south and the east to begin what we believe to be a concerted campaign against those areas so what we are doing in the face of this shifting tide of battle is providing our ukrainian partners precisely the level and the particulars of the security assistance that they have requested and that they would need to defend themselves from the campaign that the russian federation plans to undertake we believe that is one element of the equation the other element of the equation is to continue with the pressure on the kremlin and that pressure primarily has taken the form of financial sanctions other economic measures that by just about any metric have had a profound effect on russia s economy on russia s financial system on russia s positioning in the world you take a look at the economic toll of this and because of the coordinated sanctions and other economic measures russia s economy has contracted by is forecast by most estimates to contract by some 15 percent over the course of this year some 30 years of economic integration have been wiped out in the course of the past five or six weeks six hundred companies multinational companies have already been forced have already chosen to leave the russian marketplace that the pinch the hurt of that will only compound over time as inventories continue to be depleted with nothing there to replenish them inflation is at some 15 percent the russian federation the kremlin has been forced to employ draconian and drastic measures to artificially prop up its ruble and to keep its stock market afloat artificially so putin has been is facing a strategic defeat on the military front on the economic front as we ve just talked about politically president putin is a pariah his country is isolated diplomatically you can measure that in terms of the votes we have seen at the un of the condemnation that is raining down on russia from all corners of the globe his cronies face international sanction their assets are being seized they re not able to travel but also strategically and you take a look at the strategic implications of what has already been borne by the kremlin putin i think and this goes to the question we were just discussing about nato but the fact is as the secretary likes to say that president putin has precipitated just about everything he has sought to prevent that has course of course has been the case during the this invasion of ukraine but this goes back over the course of the better part of a decade starting in 2014 when the european reassurance initiative began when the united states began to increase our investments in the european continent nato is more united more determined more purposeful than it has been really since anytime since the end of the cold war and president putin faces an international community that is arrayed against him in a way that it never has been before so whenever this ends however this ends russia we already know will be weaker it will be enfeebled it will have endured a strategic defeat and we can already see elements of that the military elements the political elements the economic elements but also the strategic elements question but it doesn t seem to be stopping this coming offensive now and my question is is there anything economically in terms of the sanctions that you were preparing that you think could have that effect or you think this offensive is going ahead either way mr price when president putin made the decision to go into ukraine he did so knowing because we were very vocal both in public and in private about the severe consequences that would befall his economy his financial system his government were he to make that choice president putin has prioritized this military campaign in ukraine over just about everything else in russian society so what we re focused on now is providing our ukrainian partners with the security assistance the level and the specifics of precisely what they will need to continue defending themselves effectively and doing together with our partners and allies everything we can to further diminish the economic the political the strategic standing of the russian federation we ve already done that to good effect a final question or so jenny question given that a number of officials in this administration have said this next phase of the conflict could be months and months long what conversations is the state department having about sustaining this high level of support over the course of many months given there could even be like supply chain issues for example or just logistical problems how are you planning around that mr price so we have been i think heartened if not at all surprised by the level of consensus and near unanimity in the international community and really what is at the core of that consensus number one the efforts that the united states has put into this not over the course of the past six weeks but almost over the course of six months now this was a campaign that started for us last year even then it was a campaign that was built on the first year of this administration that was predicated on rebuilding on repairing on revitalizing the systems of alliances and partnerships those very systems of alliances and partnerships that have been so very critical to our ability to stand up to russia and to stand for what our ukrainian partners are fighting to defend i think the world has continued to be shocked by the level of atrocity the level of violence the level of brutality that russia s forces have engaged in against the ukrainian people i think that will necessarily maintain this level of consensus within the international community we ve had an occasion several occasions to gather in brussels in other parts of the world with our key allies and partners who are with us on this whether that s nato whether that s the european union whether that s the g7 whether it s our partners in the indo pacific who of course have been a key element and there is no sense that these countries are preparing to move on to look the other way and in fact every time we gather there is renewed horror there is renewed condemnation there is renewed determination to continue to see to it that our ukrainian partners have what they need now there are practical challenges that come with this supply chains supplies other elements of it those are things that we are working through but at a political level at a strategic level there has been no indication that we ve seen that the focus the determination the perseverance will diminish over time thank you all very much the briefing was concluded at 2 42 p m
china daily updated 2022 04 15 07 50 jin ding china daily as the russia ukraine conflict casts its shadow on the global food market many countries are seeing sharp rises in grain and food prices some foreign media outlets have recently claimed that china s expansion of its grain reserves have triggered anticipation of a conflict leading to global grain price rises they even called on china to release 20 percent of its grain reserves to save the european market an argument that is absurd and untenable the rise in global food prices is not china s fault on the contrary china s self reliance in feeding more than 1 4 billion of its people has contributed to global food security given that china s grain reserves protect it against emergencies a drastic reduction in its grain stocks will seriously affect china s stable grain supply trigger violent market fluctuations and affect national food security grain reserves are an important measure for all countries to ensure food security the united states european countries japan and other developed countries all have grain reserves the size of a country s grain reserve varies with the degree of grain abundance they enjoy the covid 19 pandemic extreme weather events and regional conflicts in recent years have undermined the global food industry and supply chains in order to better ensure domestic food supply some countries have increased grain imports china s central grain and local grain reserves have been complementing each other since the launch of reform and opening up playing an important role in stabilizing the food market since the beginning of this year china s food prices have been facing increasing pressure because of the continuing epidemic drought in south america and the russia ukraine conflict by ensuring stable grain production and an output increase china has met the nation s grain demand and kept domestic food prices stable according to the national bureau of statistics china s food prices even dropped 1 5 percent year on year in march in sharp contrast to global food price rise of more than 30 percent but despite successive bumper harvests abundant grain reserves and guaranteed grain supply the tight balance between china s grain supply and demand has not changed severe shortages of some agricultural products such as soybeans and oilseeds are a potential threat to the country s food security therefore china should do its best to ensure grain production and the supply of important agricultural products to cope with uncertainties in the international environment

updated april 14 2022 at 9 55 pm et twitter ceo parag agrawal is trying to assuage employee fears in the wake of elon musk launching a hostile 43 billion takeover attempt of the social media company at an all staff meeting on thursday agrawal said twitter s board is considering musk s offer and will act in the best interest of company shareholders according to two employees in attendance when an employee suggested that musk s aggressive acquisition bid felt like a hostage situation agrawal dismissed the notion i don t believe we are being held hostage agrawal shot back according to the employees after the meeting many were dismayed saying they feel like they were being left in the dark about what was really going on and that a musk owned twitter represents to some a nightmare scenario given musk s long history as a volatile business leader the culture here and this platform deserves to be protected and i hope the board does the brave thing and refuses the offer said one twitter employee who requested anonymity our democracy is more important than a payout this employee said i hope the board agrees but this twitter worker added it does feel like there isn t much we can do as employees this person said musk revealed his interest in purchasing twitter earlier in the day by tweetinga filing to the securities and exchange commission stating the acquisition depended on the completion of anticipated financing suzanne cordeiro afp via getty images afp via getty images tesla elon musk speaks at the tesla giga texas manufacturing cyber rodeo grand opening party on april 7 in austin texas musk is offering to buy twitter for 43 billion in cash that was unusual analysts noted because an investor eyeing a takeover typically discloses financing along with a bid i m not sure that i will actually be able to acquire it musk said at the ted2022 conference in vancouver british columbia which was his first appearance since making his twitter purchase public when asked if there was a plan b if his takeover failed he said there is but he refused to provide further detail musk s bid could attract other potential twitter buyers musk s offer of 54 20 per share is 38 more than the value of twitter stock the day before his investment was publicly announced and 18 2 higher than wednesday s closing price it would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote musk tweeted on thursday afternoon they own the company not the board of directors twitter stock closed down 1 35 on thursday well below musk s offer price however suggesting investors may be skeptical of the billionaire s bid prince alwaleed bin talal of saudi arabia a longtime twitter shareholder tweeted on thursday that musk s offer doesn t come close to the company s intrinsic value and said he would reject it musk responded on twitter by asking what are the kingdom s views on journalistic freedom of speech interesting just two questions if i may how much of twitter does the kingdom own directly indirectly what are the kingdom s views on journalistic freedom of speech elon musk elonmusk april 14 2022 but musk s approach may open the door to other interested buyers who have their own designs on twitter said scott kessler an analyst at research firm third bridge this is really perhaps the beginning of a process and it s not necessarily going to start and end with elon musk kessler said however analyst dan ives of wedbush securities wrote in a note to clients that he expects musk to succeed it would be hard for any other bidders consortium to emerge and the twitter board will be forced likely to accept this bid and or run an active process to sell twitter ives said still there are unanswered questions including how musk would balance his time given that he is already ceo of tesla and spacex and how he would finance his cash offer most of his 266 billion net worth is held in tesla shares selling part of his stake could affect tesla s valuation from twitter s most vocal user to would be owner the takeover bid is the latest twist in a wild two weeks for the billionaire and the social media platform on april 4 musk disclosed he d been buying up twitter shares and had become its largest individual shareholder earlier this week a twitter shareholder filed a securities fraud lawsuitagainst musk alleging his late disclosure of his stake cost investors money and saved musk around 143 million the tesla ceo is both a prolific user of twitter and a vocal critic so his investment immediately sparked questions about his intentions in the weeks before his stake became public he had publicly questioned twitter s commitment to free speech and mused about creating his own rival social network the next day twitter ceo agrawal announced musk would join the company s board and had agreed to limit how much more twitter stock he could buy both men said they looked forward to working together on the company s future but those plans quickly fell apart over the weekend musk notified twitter he would not join the board after all a decision that agrawal described as for the best before his about face became public on sunday night musk had spent much of the weekend tweeting suggestions criticisms and jokes about twitter is twitter dying he asked in one tweet noting that many of its most followed users such as barack obama and katy perry rarely tweet musk is a self described free speech absolutist while it s not clear why musk changed his mind about joining the board in his filing on thursday he doubled down on his vision of twitter s role in society and what is needed to realize it i invested in twitter as i believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe and i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy he wrote in a letter to twitter chairman bret taylor however since making my investment i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist and has been critical of twitter s rules about what people are allowed to say on the site among musk s other proposals for twitter include cracking open the black box of the social platform s algorithm so there is more transparency around what tweets get promoted or demoted that automated process being secret he said at the ted event is quite dangerous i don t like to lose musk but twitter which has far fewer users compared to social networks like facebook and tiktok is also under pressure to grow its business changing its policies against content such as hate speech and false claims about covid could be a turn off for users and advertisers this is a moneymaking platform where your ideas are amplified if they re going to help the company make money said karen kornbluh of the german marshall fund who studies online disinformation when you poll people people say they want moderation that they don t want conspiracy theories floating freely on their platforms that they don t want harassment she said so i think it s a misunderstanding of what people want at the ted conference on thursday musk said his interest in twitter was not about economics or making money twitter has become kind of the de facto town square he said so it s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law he added i don t like to lose copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
like most nations but more acutely the ireland of the late nineteen fifties and the sixties was torn between isolation and community most important it had to navigate a path between the claims of the church and the secular appeal of the new the country s apparent strengths its population s ethnic and religious homogeneity its battle scarred unity against the old colonial aggressor the romantic brilliance of its self mythologizing were the very forces that were pushing it toward disruptive upheavals o toole is almost hegelian in his understanding of history as a critical process in which eras helplessly recruit the agents of their own undoing religion and nationalism the cross and the clover promised a timeless stability but were actually subversive forces they were subversive because despite the rhetoric of confidence they were anxiously unstable held together by a will to hypocrisy when the deficits of this hypocrisy overwhelmed the benefits the will began to wane reading this book i was struck by parallels with the collapse of various european communist regimes in particular i often thought of the jokes novels and allegories that circulated in places under communist rule like czechoslovakia and albania with their comic grim evasions and knowing irony around doublethink josef škvorecký as much as flann o brien could have produced the basic script will you spend eighteen months and tens of thousands of dollars planning a party with me cartoon by sofia warren copy link to cartoon copy link to cartoon shop shop take contraception the pill though illegal in ireland had been imported into the country since 1963 officially as a cycle regulator as long as no one spoke the word contraceptive doctors could conspire with their female patients in this medical fiction the church connived at this solution too catholic schools and hospitals would have ceased to function if teachers and nurses were not having awful trouble with their periods o toole winkingly comments pregnant teachers and nurses would have been sacked it was only in the year of his birth he points out that the government lifted its prohibition on married women working as teachers o toole bundles these hypocrisies under the delicious term connie dodging cornelius hence connie lucey the bishop of cork had demanded a particularly strict version of lenten fasting in which parishioners were restricted to one meal a day along with two collations which were understood to be something like a biscuit to be had with one s tea a resourceful local baker then invented a gigantic biscuit for lent known as a connie dodger the law of god was not defied o toole observes it was dodged and so it was with the pill one of the liveliest episodes in the book occurred in 1971 when members of a new feminist group known as the irish women s liberation movement aided in the legal realm by the young law professor mary robinson a future president of the republic mounted a campaign to break the law restricting the importation of contraceptives the women took a train to northern ireland with the intention of buying contraceptive pills in belfast and then openly declaring them at customs in dublin but because they were unable to acquire the pill in belfast without a prescription they returned with aspirin confident that the customs guards would not be able to tell the difference alas nothing much happened when one of the group announced that she was carrying the banned substance o toole recounts the customs men in dublin dropped their eyes silent and fussed and waved the women through as if they hadn t heard anything official hypocrisy doubled down connie dodging lived to fight another day o toole s book pulses with righteous anticlericalism and at its heart lies his eloquent outrage at what amounted to a vast religious penal colony this network comprising the ordinary catholic schools run by the christian brothers the more shadowy mother and baby homes the magdalene asylums and the industrial schools variously disciplined and incarcerated boys girls and pregnant or otherwise wayward women of these institutions the most notorious thanks to a landmark government investigation in 2015 are the mother and baby homes most of which were run by catholic nuns unmarried pregnant women were sent to these homes to deliver their babies who were put up for adoption or neglected unto death and buried in situ at the tuam children s home which was administered by the sisters of bon secours some eight hundred children were buried within a decommissioned sewage tank o toole writes between 1920 and 1977 many hundreds of dead babies were dispatched from these homes to the nation s finest medical schools in dublin for research purposes the magdalene asylums confined women who had broken the law and were perceived to have fallen into sexual immorality the industrial schools were boarding schools for problem kids who were subdued by regimes of terror that included flogging burning head shaving beatings on the soles of the feet and being made to sleep outside overnight the network incorporated fifty two such places and interned some fifty thousand children o toole writes that he can t recall a time when he didn t know the names of the biggest schools which formed a hinterland of dread when he was eight a boy named george who lived across the street disappeared into one of these places he had apparently stolen a bike o toole was lucky enough to attend a relatively normal school run by the christian brothers if normality can be stretched to accommodate unrestrained physical violence meted out with leather straps or bamboo canes and much enforced propaganda the brothers published such texts as courtesy for boys and girls and a catechism of the history of ireland which asserted that in the martyrology of history among crucified nations ireland occupies the foremost place the duration of her torture and the ferocity of her executioner are as revolting as the power of the victim is astonishing a crucified nation must imagine itself a holy nation allied in defeat and in victory with christ s necessary suffering but once suffering is somehow necessary all control is lost and violence can be theologically justified because punishment is really a kind of shared self punishment that s the kind of thing i used to hear in my church of england school in the north of england as the headmaster the reverend canon john grove bent down to beat my bottom with the back of a wooden hairbrush believe me wood this hurts me more than it will hurt you it is the logic of original sin all have sinned all must suffer and only through suffering is glory achieved will you spend eighteen months and tens of thousands of dollars planning a party with me cartoon by sofia warren copy link to cartoon copy link to cartoon shop shop irish society was premised on what o toole calls the unknown known ireland s genius for knowing and not knowing at the same time this gap this useful fiction could be maintained in the postwar decades as long as ordinary people many with modest educations and modest aspirations understood their lowly place in the hierarchy parents trusted predatory or violent schoolteachers and priests and were happy to outsource a fair amount of the parenting a dog s obeyed in office as mad king lear has it the secret can survive as long as the monarch stays sane and does not reveal himself in all his doglike animalism because then someone in the street might yell out but he s just a dog for instance until the divorce referendum of 1995 a couple who needed to get divorced in ireland had to convince a body called the diocesan marriage tribunal that their marriage should be annulled on the ground that owing to some defect at the time of the nuptials they were never properly married anyway in dublin o toole writes the moral arbiter before whom you had to lay these sophistical contortions was a priest named appropriately enough ivan payne in 1968 payne had become the chaplain of the crumlin children s hospital not far from where the young o toole lived he replaced father paul mcgennis who had been discovered photographing little girls genitalia and had been secretly pardoned and protected by our man with the magnifying glass archbishop mcquaid at the children s hospital payne started abusing little boys o toole tells us that there were sixteen known victims at the hospital and fifteen more identified victims after payne joined the marriage tribunal the church knew about payne s activities as early as 1981 when one of his young victims alerted church authorities payne admitted his offense and was quietly moved from one parish to another as o toole puts it with measured fury from 1985 to 1995 the body charged with making discriminations about the moral fineness of marriages included a man who had admitted the sexual abuse of a child and two other priests who knew about that abuse hypocrisy shrivels when it is named in sunlight in the nineteen nineties that sunlit naming happened fast and the two sides of the unknown known the knowing and the not knowing started openly talking to each other like a mistress and a wife finally comparing notes on the same atrocious man four events were propulsive in 1992 eamonn casey the popular and telegenic bishop of galway fled ireland for new york on an aer lingus plane his american lover annie murphy had told the irish times about her long affair with casey and about their son peter born in 1974 who was being financially supported by the bishop or more precisely by funds from the galway diocese without its knowledge not that peter was being supported with much grace bishop casey had of course urged murphy to give the child up for adoption peter was not her child he had admonished her in the hospital but god s what right did she have to keep a boy who had been born in sin o toole writes that with the irish times story a code of silence had been broken forever connie was not dodged this time it was connie who had dodged politically change was also under way in 1990 mary robinson was elected president after a brutal campaign that exposed the nation s religiose misogyny a fianna fáil parliamentarian asked at a rally if robinson was going to set up an abortion referral clinic in the presidential residence prime minister haughey the fianna fáil leader claimed that robinson was just fronting for a marxist leninist communist party and a government minister pádraig flynn accused her of faking a newfound interest in the family and wondered aloud about her bona fides as a mother and a wife o toole notes that this kind of morally presumptuous misogyny worked when it remained unspoken as part of the general contract of hypocrisy the mistake was speaking it so blatantly since to do so revealed the reality obscured by the rhetoric a deep contempt for women it triggered a visceral rage that had been built up over generations robinson s election according to o toole broke the reflexive alliance of the church and the fianna fáil party debunking the notion that both had some kind of moral monopoly over irish culture haughey whose florid sharp eyed face with its ruddy wattles proved an icon for an era resigned as the fianna fáil leader in 1992 a government tribunal held in 1997 revealed that he had funded his lavish life style from other people s pockets and shielded his wrongdoing via a shell company based in the cayman islands a year later the good friday agreement announced by the irish and british governments largely ended the armed conflict between catholics and protestants on both sides all political prisoners who accepted the agreement were to be released simultaneous referendums were held in northern ireland seventy one per cent of voters a majority of protestants and catholics voted in favor of the agreement in ireland ninety four per cent did so paramilitary organizations agreed to disarm the agreement bound the signatories to accept the principle of self determination namely that they must recognize the birthright of all the people in northern ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as irish or british or both as they may so choose both governments moved to allow citizens to hold simultaneous british and irish passports which pushed the irish to amend their constitution thus it is the firm will of the irish nation in harmony and friendship to unite all the people who share the territory of the island of ireland in all the diversity of their identities and traditions o toole s commentary here is especially acute he points out that these words allowed for the reconciliation of two compound identities catholic irish and protestant british that had once seemed immutably at odds and in consequence broke any necessary link between irishness and catholicism identity could now be plural and open ended this prospect was still largely conceptual perhaps but thanks to the enormous investments from america and elsewhere which had been pouring into ireland since the nineteen eighties irish society was indeed being transformed something unimaginable in 1958 was coming to pass mass emigration was being reversed a quarter of a million people flocked to an economically revivified ireland between 1995 and 2000 foreign born inhabitants grew from six per cent of the population in 1991 to ten per cent in 2002 once the european union allowed the free flow of people and labor in 2004 later to be one of the main engines of brexit irish society began to diversify rapidly by 2016 o toole informs us seventeen per cent of the population had been born elsewhere in j f powers s novel morte d urban a priest named father urban is put under moral pressure when a woman undresses in front of him he averts his eyes and keeps them averted it was like tearing up telephone directories the hardest part was getting started powers jokes change in postwar ireland was a bit like that except in moral reverse ireland was slow to throw off its repressions and deceits slow to unseat a theocratic system that insisted on votive masses to bless theatre festivals and slow to overturn a moral arrangement that coddled molesting priests and murderous secretive institutions the nineteen eighties so violently transformative in thatcher s britain produced little evidence of general secularization in ireland the irish reaffirmed the prohibition on divorce in a 1986 referendum but when the process began for good in the nineteen nineties the establishment phone book as it were got ripped up very fast indeed the key dates fall on o toole s closing pages like accelerating hammer blows mary robinson s election 1990 eamonn casey s flight 1992 the tribunal on charles haughey 1997 a documentary series produced by mary raftery on the industrial schools titled states of fear 1999 which was such a powerful exposé that the government began discussing the possibility of making a formal apology the day after its screening on irish tv the governmental report 2009 that confirmed raftery s reporting and in the same year an official report into sexual abuse in the dublin archdiocese these were followed by happier events moments of triumph not just through suffering but over suffering the 2015 vote in favor of gay marriage the 2018 referendum that lifted the ban on abortion what happened ireland became normal to be normal was a wonder that deserved celebration o toole writes is it possible to say how in a sentence he makes a brave effort in what may be the most moving line of the book this i think was what really changed ordinary catholics realized that when it came to lived morality they were way ahead of their teachers o toole leaves unspoken the gaping implication and perhaps way ahead of god himself
elon musk said thursday and later backed it up with a tweet that he wants to retain as many of twitter inc s shareholders as possible if he s successful in his bid to take the social media network private first he might have to persuade them to accept his offer i should also say the intent is to retain as many shareholders as is allowed by the law in a private company which i think is around 2 000 or so musk said at a ted event in vancouver we ll try to bring along as many shareholders as we re allowed to as
china s new rules in the pipeline on human genetic resources will clarify jurisdictions of regulatory bodies and enhance supervision related to biopharmaceutical research and will have a lasting impact on international cooperation regarding the nation s biomaterials experts said last month the ministry of science and technology released the draft implementation rules for human genetic resources management the proposal now in its public consultation phase will be a major addition to china s regulation of human genetic resources following the adoption of the biosecurity law and the data security law both of which took effect last year academia has deemed the 21st century as the century of biology given the fact that biology plays a key role in tackling global challenges such as pandemic prevention food security and treatment of cancer new technologies including artificial intelligence and big data are also being used to drive biological innovations therefore the new rules may help china mitigate risks and promote the healthy development of its biopharmaceutical sector making its companies and products more competitive and in tune with international standards experts said chu jiayou former director of the institute of medical biology of the chinese academy of medical sciences said china s biopharmaceutical research has advanced rapidly in recent years so there is a massive need for human genetic resources during drug development according to a report by mckinsey co last year the combined market value of publicly listed chinese biopharmaceutical companies on nasdaq the hong kong stock exchange and the shanghai stock exchange science and technology innovation board surged from 3 billion in 2016 to over 380 billion in july last year however some entities have used human genetic materials to conduct risky and even illegal research so protecting human genetic resources will play a key role in safeguarding the rights of individuals and national biosecurity chu told a newspaper affiliated with the central commission for discipline inspection in recent decades the united states brazil japan and many european countries have strengthened their management of human genetic resources this subject has gradually become a field with global strategic importance he added china s new rules define human genetic resources as genetic materials including organs tissues and cells as well as genetic information such as the human genome and genes the new rules state that foreign organizations and individuals as well as entities formed or controlled by foreign stakeholders are prohibited from collecting and preserving chinese human genetic resources inside china or taking them outside of the country the collection storage and supply of chinese human genetic resources must be carried out by chinese scientific research institutions universities medical institutions and enterprises it added according to british law firm simmons simmons the new rules may affect china s international cooperation in biomedical research since it will grant the country s ministry of science and technology significantly increased capacity and efficiency in processing project applications related to human genetic resources the new rules also clarify the definition of a foreign controlled entity as an organization in which foreigners hold more than 50 percent of equity or wield major influence over decision making internal management and contractual or other arrangements data security related to human genetic resources is strongly emphasized in the draft rules the proposal also dedicates a chapter to the procedures for administrative penalties the proposed new rules have fleshed out many details of the regulatory framework on human genetic resources that was issued in 2019 by the state council china s cabinet according to a chief scientist of a tianjin based biotech company who requested anonymity it is a very instructive and meticulous piece of regulation that will have a lasting impact on how bio research will be conducted in china and with global partners the scientist said bio ethics regarding human genetic research has always been a pressing issue for the global biotechnology sector i believe china s latest effort to optimize its management of human genetic resources will ensure the positive growth of its bio industry

more than the value of twitter stock the day before his investment was publicly announced and 18 2 higher than wednesday s closing price it would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote musk tweeted on thursday afternoon they own the company not the board of directors twitter stock closed down 1 35 on thursday well below musk s offer price however suggesting investors may be skeptical of the billionaire s bid prince alwaleed bin talal of saudi arabia a longtime twitter shareholder tweeted on thursday that musk s offer doesn t come close to the company s intrinsic value and said he would reject it musk responded on twitter by asking what are the kingdom s views on journalistic freedom of speech interesting just two questions if i may how much of twitter does the kingdom own directly indirectly what are the kingdom s views on journalistic freedom of speech elon musk elonmusk april 14 2022 but musk s approach may open the door to other interested buyers who have their own designs on twitter said scott kessler an analyst at research firm third bridge this is really perhaps the beginning of a process and it s not necessarily going to start and end with elon musk kessler said however analyst dan ives of wedbush securities wrote in a note to clients that he expects musk to succeed it would be hard for any other bidders consortium to emerge and the twitter board will be forced likely to accept this bid and or run an active process to sell twitter ives said still there are unanswered questions including how musk would balance his time given that he is already ceo of tesla and spacex and how he would finance his cash offer most of his 266 billion net worth is held in tesla shares selling part of his stake could affect tesla s valuation from twitter s most vocal user to would be owner the takeover bid is the latest twist in a wild two weeks for the billionaire and the social media platform on april 4 musk disclosed he d been buying up twitter shares and had become its largest individual shareholder earlier this week a twitter shareholder filed a securities fraud lawsuitagainst musk alleging his late disclosure of his stake cost investors money and saved musk around 143 million the tesla ceo is both a prolific user of twitter and a vocal critic so his investment immediately sparked questions about his intentions in the weeks before his stake became public he had publicly questioned twitter s commitment to free speech and mused about creating his own rival social network the next day twitter ceo agrawal announced musk would join the company s board and had agreed to limit how much more twitter stock he could buy both men said they looked forward to working together on the company s future but those plans quickly fell apart over the weekend musk notified twitter he would not join the board after all a decision that agrawal described as for the best before his about face became public on sunday night musk had spent much of the weekend tweeting suggestions criticisms and jokes about twitter is twitter dying he asked in one tweet noting that many of its most followed users such as barack obama and katy perry rarely tweet musk is a self described free speech absolutist while it s not clear why musk changed his mind about joining the board in his filing on thursday he doubled down on his vision of twitter s role in society and what is needed to realize it i invested in twitter as i believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe and i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy he wrote in a letter to twitter chairman bret taylor however since making my investment i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist and has been critical of twitter s rules about what people are allowed to say on the site among musk s other proposals for twitter include cracking open the black box of the social platform s algorithm so there is more transparency around what tweets get promoted or demoted that automated process being secret he said at the ted event is quite dangerous i don t like to lose musk but twitter which has far fewer users compared to social networks like facebook and tiktok is also under pressure to grow its business changing its policies against content such as hate speech and false claims about covid could be a turn off for users and advertisers this is a moneymaking platform where your ideas are amplified if they re going to help the company make money said karen kornbluh of the german marshall fund who studies online disinformation when you poll people people say they want moderation that they don t want conspiracy theories floating freely on their platforms that they don t want harassment she said so i think it s a misunderstanding of what people want at the ted conference on thursday musk said his interest in twitter was not about economics or making money twitter has become kind of the de facto town square he said so it s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law he added i don t like to lose copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
