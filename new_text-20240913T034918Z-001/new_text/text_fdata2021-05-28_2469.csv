throughout its history wherever it arrived and settled in as the dominant economic system capitalism provoked struggles over the redistribution of wealth in other words this system always distributes wealth in a particular way and likewise produces dissatisfaction with that particular distribution those dissatisfied then struggle more or less consciously or not peacefully or violently to redistribute wealth the struggles are socially divisive and sometimes rise to civil war levels the french revolution marked the end of french feudalism and its transition to capitalism the revolutionaries slogans promised the transition would bring with it liberté égalité fraternité liberty equality and fraternity in other words equality was to be a key accompaniment to or product of capitalism s establishment of finally replacing feudalism s lord serf organization of production with capitalism s very different employer employee system transition to capitalism would erase the gross inequalities of french feudalism the american revolution likewise broke not only from its british colonial master but also from the feudal monarchy of george iii all men are created equal was a central theme of its profound commitment to equality together with capitalism in france the united states and beyond capitalism justified itself by reference to its achievement or at least its targeting of equality in general this equality included the distribution of wealth and income at least in theory and rhetoric yet from the beginning all capitalisms wrestled with contradictions between lip service to equality and inequality in their actual practices adam smith worried about the accumulation of stock wealth or capital in some hands but not in others thomas jefferson and alexander hamilton had different visions of the future of an independent united states in terms of whether it would or would not secure wealth equality later dubbed jeffersonian democracy there was and always remained in the united states an awkward dissonance between theoretical and rhetorical commitments to equality and the realities of slavery and then systemic racist inequalities the inequalities of gender likewise contradicted commitments to equality it took centuries of capitalism to achieve even the merely formal political equality of universal suffrage thus there should be no surprise that u s capitalism like most other capitalisms provokes a widely troubling contradiction between the actual wealth inequality it produces and tendentially deepens as thomas piketty has definitively shown and its repeatedly professed commitment to equality efforts to redistribute wealth to thereby move from less to more equal distributions follow yet they also disturbingly divide societies where the capitalist economic system prevails wealth redistributions take from those who have and give to those who have not those whose wealth is redistributed resent or resist this taking while those who receive during the redistributions of wealth develop rationales to justify that receipt each side of such redistributions often demonizes the other politics typically becomes the arena where demonizations and conflicts over redistribution occur those at risk of being deprived due to redistributions aim either to oppose redistribution or else to escape it if the opposition is impossible or difficult escape is the chosen strategy thus if profits of capitalists are to be taxed to redistribute wealth to the poor big businesses may escape by moving politically to shift the burden of taxation onto small or medium businesses alternatively all businesses may unite to shift the burden of such redistributive taxation onto higher paid employees wages and salaries and away from business profits recipients of redistributions face parallel political problems of whom to target for contributing to wealth redistribution will recipients support a tax on all profits or rather a tax just on big business with maybe some redistribution flowing from big to medium and small business or might low wage recipients target high wage workers for redistributive taxation all kinds of other redistributions between regions races and genders display comparable strategic political choices conflicts over redistributions are thus intrinsic to capitalism and always have been they reflect but also deepen social divisions they can and often have become violent and socially disruptive they may trigger demands for system change they may function as catalysts for revolutions because pre capitalist economic systems like slavery and feudalism had fewer theoretical and rhetorical commitments to equality in general they had fewer redistribution struggles those finally emerged when inequalities became relatively more extreme than the levels of inequality that more frequently provoked redistribution struggles in capitalism no solution to divisive struggles over wealth redistribution in capitalism was ever found capitalisms keep reproducing both theoretical and rhetorical appeals to equality as self celebrations alongside actualities of deep and deepening wealth inequalities criticisms of capitalism on grounds of wealth inequality dog the system everywhere divisive social conflicts over capitalism s unequal wealth distributions persist endless efforts to find and implement a successful redistributive system or mechanism continue the latest comprises various proposals for universal basic incomes to avoid divisive social conflict over redistribution the solution is not to distribute unequally in the first place that can remove the cause and impetus for redistributive struggles and thus the need for endless and so far fruitless efforts to find the right redistribution formula or mechanism the way forward is to democratize the decision about distributing wealth as it emerges from production this can be accomplished by democratizing the enterprise converting workplaces from their current capitalist organization i e hierarchical divisions into employers public or private and employees into worker cooperatives in the latter each worker has one vote and all basic workplace issues are decided by majority vote after a free and open debate that is when different views on what distribution of output should occur are articulated and democratically decided no redistribution is required necessitated or provoked workplace members are free to reopen debate and decide anew on initial wealth distributions at any time the same procedure would apply to workplace decisions governing what to produce which technology to deploy and where to locate production all workers collectively and democratically decide what wage the collective of workers pays to each of them individually they likewise decide how to dispose of or allocate any surplus which is above the total individual wage bill and replacement of used up inputs that the enterprise might generate a parable can illustrate the basic point imagine parents taking their twins mary and john to a park where there is an ice cream vendor the parents buy two ice creams and give both to mary john s wails provoke a search for an appropriate redistribution of ice creams the parents take away one of the ice creams from mary and hand it to john anger resentment bitterness envy and rage distress the rest of the day and divide family members if affection and emotional support are similarly distributed and redistributed deep and divisive scars result the lesson we don t need a better or right redistribution we need to distribute more equally and democratically in the first place richard d wolff is professor of economics emeritus at the university of massachusetts amherst

similar msrs reported by many public companies last week for example ocwen financial nyse ocn struck a deal to purchase 48 3 billion of fannie mae freddie mac msrs from amerihome mortgage which was acquired earlier this year by western alliance bancshares nyse wal ocwen had acquired servicing assets from texas capital bank earlier in the year ocwen s phh subsidiary will pay roughly 600 million for conventional servicing assets supported by 48 billion in unpaid principal balance of 1 4 family loans if we divide the consideration by the upb the result is a valuation of about 125bp for the msrs acquired or precisely 5x annual servicing income of note western alliance is financing the purchase thus the top performing bank exchanges an arguably overvalued msr for a financing asset the positive environment in the market for msrs may not last however the biden administration has proposed a new alternative minimum tax structure on book income the biden tax proposal could negatively impact the value of independent mortgage banks the market for msrs and severely impair the value of servicing assets owned by banks nonbanks and investors during the 2020 campaign then candidate biden proposed an alternative minimum tax of 15 on book income for companies with a net income of 100 million or more the proposal was most recently adjusted by now president biden with the release of the made in america proposal s tax components the most recent proposal adjusts the application threshold of the amt to companies with a net income of 2 billion or more the amt would require certain companies to make a new tax calculation on book income and pay a minimum tax of 15 even on assets and business activity that has not yet generated any taxable income in cash terms this calculation would ignore previous losses so even companies with large net operating losses would be forced to pay the minimum tax during the congressional debate on tax cuts in 2017 a proposal was advanced that would have eliminated the exemption for msrs which accrue income over time the biden tax proposal would tax msrs when the mortgage note is sold forcing mortgage lenders to pay taxes on income they have not yet received the negative impact on the value of existing and future msrs owned by banks and nonbanks alike could be disastrous an industry concern during the debate on the bill related to a provision which would have eliminated the tax deferral on the creation of mortgage servicing rights mike fratantoni of the mortgage bankers association wrote in a recent op ed column msrs are booked as a balance sheet asset when loans are sold into the secondary market and show as book earnings at that time fratantoni wrote however if the servicing is retained the lender does not receive any cash income when the msr is created the tax deferral in the current code recognizes this difference between book and tax income taxing servicing income over time as the cash arrives the biden tax proposal to impose a corporate amt is part of a larger democratic attack on homeownership that includes an increase in the taxes on capital gains as well as an end to 1031 exchanges for the sale of property i outlined the impact of these proposed changes on family farms and small investors in residential real estate in a recent blog post for the institutional risk analyst president biden is seeking higher taxes on real estate transactions with gains of more than 500 000 a target aimed directly at the heart of small real estate investors family farmers and owner occupied businesses in combination with his plans to eliminate step up basis on the resolution of estates the biden tax proposal will greatly increase the cost of farmland and thus food prices property prices and rental costs in some markets the amt will have a unique and negative impact on mortgage lenders and servicers particularly imbs the negative treatment of msrs under the amt will force imbs to sell most servicing assets when the mortgage note is sold to investors in the bond market since imbs are large and long term holders of msrs and today service two thirds of all 1 4 family mortgages the biden amt could negatively impact the availability of credit for all consumers indeed this is precisely the objective of the cynical and deliberate biden attack on the american dream of homeownership one issuer tells national mortgage news that the amt may accelerate tax exposure for banks and imbs and change how servicers and investors view large positions in msrs the ill considered proposal from the biden administration could result in depressed mortgage originations higher costs to borrowers and less availability of credit and perhaps even forced sales of servicing assets since commercial banks apparently want nothing to do with mortgage servicing assets in large part due to the specific advice of federal bank regulators who would want to own the msrs if not imbs and large buy side investors this is a question that the biden administration needs to answer meanwhile members of the residential mortgage industry need to immediately mobilize to kill the biden amt proposal and protect consumers and the mortgage sector from this unwarranted attack on home ownership

workforce was only 335 in constant 1982 1984 dollars still below the 346 seen in october 1972 europeans would be aghast at the low levels of minimum wages and the lack of parental and annual paid leave available to american workers especially in southern states the covid 19 pandemic hasn t helped workers are demanding more paid hours than employers are able to offer leading to underemployment bell and blanchflower 2021 this might not be such a problem if the labour market was operating efficiently with workers being able to find jobs that suit them or if workers had means to fix their problems at work the traditional mechanism available to workers for fixing problems at work is a trades union under wagner act arrangements in the us a union has the right to bargain with the employer as the workers sole agent to raise wages and improve terms and conditions once a majority of workers have voted union at the workplace and union representatives can help fix problems at work grievances bullying discrimination by providing workers with a voice as richard freeman and james medoff 1984 said 37 years ago union voice offers workers an alternative to simply quitting when the job gets too much over the last half century there has been a precipitous decline in union membership in the us especially in the private sector today barely 6 of private sector workers in the us are union members in 17 states that voted for donald trump private sector density is below 4 while in north and south carolina and utah in 2020 private sector union density was below 2 this is partly a problem of trade union supply rather than union demand workers often want union representation but can t access it leading to what towers 1997 referred to as a representation gap the reason for this is at least in part the legal framework surrounding unions ability to mount a successful union organising campaign what john paul ferguson 2008 memorably described as being as hard as getting through the eye of a needle this is illustrated recently by unions inability to win a union vote at amazon s huge warehouse in bessemer alabama lee 2021 also in the past where unions did exist workers were less satisfied with their jobs not more satisfied perhaps union negotiation with employers spilt over into conflict souring employer employee relations or with the information unionized workers received from their union they became more aware of the shortcomings of management than they might have been in the absence of a union or else job dissatisfaction is the natural by product of union voice which raises the job dissatisfaction threshold required by workers before they quit increasing the stock of dissatisfied workers whatever the reason this appeared to be the settled view as to what unions did not anymore things have changed first there are signs that union density is on the rise according to the bureau of labor statistics 1 overall union density has risen by half a percentage point in the last year to 10 8 although by only a little in the private sector from 6 2 to 6 3 numerically the number of union members has fallen but the decline in employment in the non union sector explains the rise in density these union gains are small but they are potentially very significant because this is the first rise in density in more than a decade second union workers are now more satisfied than non union workers as reported in our last vox column freeman et al 2020 union members have been more satisfied in their jobs than non union workers in the united states since the time of the great recession we showed this to be the case with cross sectional data from the general social survey and the gallup daily poll and for european countries we have since revisited this issue using panel data for younger and older workers in the national longitudinal survey of youth nlsy 1979 and 1997 cohorts artz et al 2021 these panel data confirm that in contrast to the years before the great recession union workers are now more satisfied than non union workers the effects are quite sizeable and economically meaningful they are approximately equal in size to the positive impact on job satisfaction of having three employer provided fringe benefits or having a job in the public versus the private sector artz 2010 nearly the value of taking part in an employer provided profit sharing scheme heywood and wei 2006 and roughly half the effect of getting a promotion kosteas 2011 the findings are important because they show that when a worker becomes unionized that worker s job satisfaction rises on average this indicates that the improvement in union workers job satisfaction is not simply an artefact of differential sorting into union status it might be a causal effect so what has changed we show that one thing that has not changed much is the union wage premium the gap in wages earned by union workers relative to their non union counterparts ceteris paribus this premium which is fairly substantial at over 10 has remained largely unchanged in the last two decades even so given the wage stagnation experienced by many workers the sizeable albeit constant wage premium in the union sector may have generated greater job satisfaction since the great recession we find some diminution in unions ability to lower quit rates albeit confined to older workers which is suggestive of a decline in their effectiveness in operating as a voice mechanism for unionised workers we also present evidence suggestive of unions ability to minimise covered workers exposure to underemployment a phenomenon that has negatively impacted non union workers unions ability to help workers avoid underemployment suggests that what seems to have changed is the value attached to the insurance component of the union good this conjecture is supported by our earlier finding that prior to the great recession union workers expressed greater apprehension about job loss than non union workers an apprehension that has now gone this all matters because trade unions have a billing in president biden s new new deal he came out in solidarity with those amazon workers seeking to establish a union in bessemer alabama herndon 2021 biden says he has a plan for strengthening union organising1 and has followed through with an executive order establishing a white house task force on worker organizing and empowerment 3 it is headed by vice president kamala harris so it seems he means business perhaps the positive effect of unions on job satisfaction has come at a

when it comes to investing in the middle kingdom tech companies such as alibaba group nasdaq baba baidu inc nasdaqbidu tencent holdings otcpk tcehy and netease inc nasdaq ntes tend to hog the limelight and investor dollars however bargain hunters may want to think twice before piling into china s beaten down technology stocks despite the recent selloff china s tech giants are still trading at valuations pretty much in line with their three year averages and well above levels that marked the bottoms of the last two big downturns on the other hand chinese energy companies appear deserving of a second look first off they might not be cheap when viewed in terms of potential earnings but are still trading at multi year lows thanks to last year s energy crisis second not only do chinese oil and gas companies continue to dominate the global oil and gas sector when it comes to revenues but their renewable energy brethren are equally dominant with 7 of the 10 biggest renewable energy companies coming from china china s biggest oil and gas companies are state owned energy conglomerates with sprawling international operations in diverse segments such as exploration and production storage and transportation petroleum and chemical processing as well as many other functions along the vast oil and gas supply chain that said some of china s energy companies are good potential

in the renewable energy sector is falling costs and nowhere has this been more evident than the solar sector indeed solar photovoltaics pv has seen the sharpest cost decline of any electricity technology over the last decade with the international renewable energy agency irena finding that between 2010 2019 the cost of solar pv globally dropped by 82 but that bullish thesis is now in grave danger a quadrupling in the cost of polysilicon has pushed solar module prices up 18 ytd and threatens to lay to waste years of gains polysilicon makers have been struggling to keep up with demand lifting prices to as high as 25 88 kg up from 6 19 kg less than a year ago related opec set to proceed with plans to boost july oil production one of china s leading solar names jinko solar nyse jks has been feeling the full brunt of the price inflation jinko s been in correction mode for seven months already since january it s lost nearly 50 of its value after being cut in nearly half this year it s tempting to load up on jks stock given how hot this name has been in the past however we still don t think it s time because solar in general is having a hard time dealing with soaring prices of raw materials that are making it difficult to move forward with projects economically 2 daqo new energy advertisement daqo new energy corp nasdaq dq is a chinese company that manufactures monocrystalline silicon and polysilicon solar pv systems daqo shares have held up relatively better than sector peers with a 26 ytd gain being well above the sector average however overall market weakness could continue to put short term pressure on the stock also strong anti china sentiment specifically in connection with xinjiang where daqo s polysilicon plant resides could prove to be a major challenge for daqo but for the contrarians strong industry demand could keep polysilicon prices high and portends strong earnings potential for daqo 3 cnooc limited last year one of china s oil supermajors cnooc limited nyse cnooc crashed after the trump administration added the company and chipmaker smic otcqx smicy to a blacklist for alleged military ties u s investors hold nearly 17 of cnooc s shares in its hong kong listed unit something that could potentially trigger major outflows if trump s ban takes hold and the company is forced to divest its holdings cnooc one of china s so called big three nocs national oil companies was allegedly targeted due to the company s drilling activity in the controversial south china sea cnooc s operations in the south china sea have run into controversy because beijing has been claiming drilling rights in waters far from its borders and as close as 200 miles off the coasts of the philippines and vietnam although us investors have to sell cnooc shares by november 2021 due to the investment ban wall street is increasingly optimistic that the ban will be lifted by the biden administration another major lure cnooc offers a consensus forward fy 2021 dividend yield of 7 3 and trades at 8 4 times consensus forward fy 2021 p e other major attractions cnooc is china s main deepwater explorer with its partnerships with exxonmobil nyse xom in offshore guyana being some of its most successful to date cnooc exxon and hess corp nyse hes have made 18 discoveries totaling 9b boe in guyana s massive stabroek block southwest of kaieteur unfortunately other discoveries by the trio have not been as promising as the stabroek find with their tanager 1 well the deepest well drilled so far in offshore guyana revealing hydrocarbons but initial analysis showing that the well might not be economic on a standalone basis still we feel that the possibility of the biden administration upholding the trump ban remains a dark cloud over cnooc that investors might want to avoid by alex kimani for oilprice com more top reads form oilprice com
the growing urgency to address climate change and concerns about the financial performance of exxon mobil aligned this week to help activist investors place two directors on the company s board but it is not clear if the activists can deliver on their dual goals reducing the emissions that are warming the planet and lifting the profits and stock price of exxon the potential tensions between those objectives could doom the investor effort to transform the company and the oil industry getting exxon a behemoth company with 265 billion in revenue in 2019 and oil and gas fields around the world to switch to cleaner energy will be a yearslong and difficult process it is unlikely to produce quick returns and could sap profits for a while as the company spends a small fortune to retool itself and the biggest investment firms which lent critical support to the activists and control a lot of exxon s stock may be too timid to keep the pressure on company executives and board members who are determined to resist big changes

a fertility clinic lab in san francisco continues to use equipment from a company accused of selling a defective tank that failed in 2018 and destroyed more than 2 000 human eggs and embryos san francisco cn on the fourth day of a jury trial over a mishap that destroyed thousands of frozen eggs and embryos a freezer tank manufacturer s lawyer suggested that fertility clinic employees caused the catastrophe falsified records and violated their own quality control standards it s very unusual to backdate measurements in a reproductive laboratory is it not chart inc attorney john duffy asked a lab worker on the witness stand thursday metadata shows that pacific fertility center embryologist gina cirimele input measurements on march 20 2018 for liquid nitrogen levels in a chart manufactured tank that failed weeks earlier the backdated entries covered records for feb 15 feb 28 and march 4 the same day the tank in question failed and destroyed 500 frozen eggs and embryos belonging to hundreds of people on the witness stand cirimele denied falsifying data while she couldn t remember precisely how the numbers were retrieved she said they wouldn t have been added unless she confirmed them with colleagues or found them in handwritten notes if i couldn t find a value i wouldn t just make something up cirimele said i wouldn t falsify a value at the time those numbers were added the lab was facing a post tank failure inspection by the college of american pathologists which later put the facility on probation for deficiencies identified in its procedures duffy suggested that pacific fertility lab director joseph conaghan ordered his employee cirimele to falsify the records by lying for him you save the lab and your job do you not duffy asked cirimele if you take a bullet for dr conaghan you keep your job do you not i don t know cirimele replied testifying earlier on thursday conaghan told jurors he would never instruct an employee to fabricate records i have never asked anybody to falsify data conaghan said dena sharp an attorney for three women and one couple suing chart over the tank failure asked conaghan if missing measurements for liquid nitrogen levels could have any effect on the tank s structural integrity or have caused the tank to fail absolutely not conaghan said the plaintiffs say the catastrophe resulted from chart s use of a weaker weld near a liquid nitrogen feeder pipe making the tank susceptible to cracking leaks and failure chart denies those claims and says the failure resulted from fertility clinic employees misusing the product chart s attorney also suggested thursday that the clinic violated its own policies by not having a functioning alarm system connected to the tank that failed conaghan testified wednesday that he disabled chart s controller device which sends alerts when liquid nitrogen levels get too low because the device started malfunctioning and sending out false alarms while questioning conaghan thursday duffy read a passage from the clinic s quality management plan that sets out policies and procedures for the lab the plan stated that cryogenic tanks also called dewars must have alarm systems connected to them at all times they were not in compliance with the quality management plan at that time duffy said you re storing human tissue in a dewar with no alarm conaghan replied that because chart s controller was defective the plan was unable to be implemented after the controller device malfunctioned on feb 15 2018 conaghan told lab employees to start using a dipstick to manually measure liquid nitrogen levels in the tank each day on thursday duffy showed that dipstick to jurors noting that chart s customer service phone number is listed on the top of the measuring tool if your employees are following procedure from feb 15 to march 4 they would have seen my client s phone number in their hands every day duffy said building on his argument that lab staff did not try hard enough to get the controller device repaired or replaced before the tank failure after the march 2018 mishap pacific fertility center made several changes to its protocols the facility now has backup monitors and alarm systems for each storage tank the lab also stores patients eggs and embryos in separate vessels to ensure one tank failure won t wipe out a patient s entire stock of reproductive tissue as a result of the incident we decided that s something we should do going forward conaghan said i ve never seen another lab that does that the college of american pathologists ended the facility s probation in about january 2019 and restored its full accreditation status after the lab made several changes to its operations conaghan reported when asked if he still trusts chart s freezer tanks and monitoring devices the lab director said he no longer has full faith in the company s technology no i don t trust them 100 anymore conaghan said i certainly have less faith in them than i had before but conaghan said the lab still uses chart s freezer tanks and monitoring devices because it now has reliable backup systems 20 years experience working with the equipment and because transferring delicate tissue samples to new containers is risky and should be avoided at all costs how many patients tissues are stored in chart s freezers in your lab today duffy asked thousands conaghan replied the federal jury trial involves only five plaintiffs but it could establish chart s liability for the loss of reproductive tissue belonging to hundreds of other people the plaintiffs are suing chart for product liability and failure to recall the tank s allegedly defective controller device chart recalled its cryogenic storage tanks on april 23 2018 saying it needed to investigate a vacuum leak and or failure which may be due to inadequate adhesion of the composite neck to the aluminum unit the fertility clinic and its owners were also sued for the loss of eggs and embryos but those claims were sent to private arbitration prelude fertility acquired pacific fertility in september 2017 and prelude s subsidiary pacific mso now manages the san francisco clinic according to the lawsuit one cycle of egg retrieval freezing and annual storage costs 8 345 and a second cycle costs 6 995 some women including a plaintiff known only as s m in the originally filed complaint paid as much as 10 000 out of pocket to retrieve freeze and store eggs the trial overseen by u s magistrate judge jacqueline scott corley is expected to continue through june 10

joe biden s pick to run the atf didn t do himself many favors on wednesday during his confirmation hearing from claiming that his anti gun advocacy will have no bearing on his job performance if he s confirmed as permanent director to advocating for a ban on assault weapons even though he couldn t actually define the guns he wants to make illegal advertisement senjohnkennedy gave atf nominee david chipman multiple opportunities to define assault weapons you re going to be running this agency and you don t have a definition of assault weapons if you won t answer my question how can i vote for you pic twitter com dqu4arr3og washington examiner dcexaminer may 26 2021 we don t know when chipman s nomination will come up for a vote in the senate judiciary committee much less the a vote by the full senate but we do know that chipman and the atf are the lynchpin for joe biden s anti gun agenda at the moment with the senate filibuster in place and no movement on the gun control bills that were passed by the house earlier this year on today s bearing arms cam co stephen gutowski of the reload joins me to discuss chipman s nomination and how the biden administration is already using the atf to try to reshape our nation s gun control laws gutowski has been checking in with republican senators like alaska s lisa murkowski and susan collins of maine along with democrats kyrsten sinema of arizona and west virginia s joe manchin but so far none of them have made any commitment to vote for or against chipman s nomination in order for chipman s nomination to be successful every democrat will need to be on board or else chuck schumer is going to have to reach across the aisle to find at least one gop vote to put a committed gun control activist in charge of the agency that oversees the laws and regulations for gun owners and the firearms industry advertisement to that end it s interesting that chipman claimed that despite his nearly 10 years working for gun control groups like mayors against illegal guns and giffords if he s confirmed as atf director he ll simply follow congress s lead and enforce the laws that they put on the books chipman downplayed the fact that the atf has enormous regulatory power and is even now busy trying to redefine terms like frame receiver and even the word readily as they re used in the gun control act with the intent of turning even unfinished gun parts into working firearms in the eyes of the agency the atf and justice department are also set to unveil a new proposed rule dealing with ar style pistols and stabilizing braces next week and the language that emerges from their backdoor strategy sessions is going to be very revealing joe biden has made it clear that he wants to use an agency rule to redefine these ar style pistols as short barreled rifles that must be registered with the federal government under the national firearms act if biden and the atf are successful that could turn millions of legally owned firearms into prohibited items almost overnight but it would also set the stage for an even bigger gun grab declaring that ar 15s and other modern sporting rifles can be readily converted into machine guns and therefore fall under the nfa as well advertisement with their new broad and vague definition of readily the atf under biden could easily determine that all existing modern sporting rifles meet the definition of machine gun which is defined in the national firearms act as any firearm that shoots is designed to shoot or can be readily restored to shoot automatically more than one shot without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger gun owners actually got a hint of this strategy during the trump administration when the atf reclassified bump stocks as machine guns it wouldn t be much of a stretch for the agency to do the same with semi automatic rifles themselves and given that david chipman has already embraced the idea of classifying these rifles as machine guns it s ludicrous to believe that chipman and the biden administration would wait for congress to pass a new assault weapons ban if they thought they could do it themselves obviously there would be enormous pushback both politically and legally if the biden administration actually attempted to do this but the desire is certainly there on the part of the gun control movement and with gun control legislation not going anywhere at the moment in congress biden and his anti gun allies including the potential head of the atf may very well decide that a hail mary attempt at the holy grail of gun control is worth the risk of having their new rule overturned by the court advertisement as gutowski says chipman s confirmation isn t guaranteed so gun owners need to be contacting their senators to voice their opposition murkowski collins manchin and sinema all represent constitutional carry pro second amendment states and they need to be hearing from the second amendment supporters they re supposed to be serving in the senate if we stand a chance at defeating a key piece of joe biden s anti gun agenda

peru the commies are coming yeah this is mexfiles not perufiles but worth noting like here and elsewhere it s the upstart leftist parties that are pushing the old establishment parties to the fringes in peru it s peru libre a marxist leninist and maríateguist maríategue was a peruvian communist philospher who argued that in latin america european theories of proletarian revolution needed to be adjusted to the realities of the culture here that surprised everyone when with only 20 of the vote in the first round for the upcoming presidential election it came in first not too hard with 30 parties on the ballot followed by the standard bearer of the old guard and establishment the proto fascist keiko fujamori the daughter of disgraced former dictator alberto fujamori peru is the county where one time presidential candidate and world establishment favorite mario vargas llosa described a previous election in which fujimori fille also faced a radical leftist as the choice between dying of cancer and dying of aids which disease is fujimori s and which is rural school teacher and union leader pedro castillo s is best left to the peruvian electorate but the powers that be among others opt for not dying of whatever it is castillo has which according to the not always accurate latest peruvian poll is what s going to happen an ipsos ameríca television poll has castillo leading fijimori by a comfortable 4 percent 52 to 48 with indications that his support is growing and taking into account that it s difficult or nearly impossible to poll in some rural areas where castillo has the most support fujimori polls much better when it comes to the nitty gritty of politics knowledge of the media professional teams etc and knowledge of the business community on the other hand for all his marxist leninist rhetoric it has to be remembered that castillo s rise in public affairs was as a union organizer and negotiator suggesting a more pragmatic as opposed to ideological driven style opposed to fujimori a legacy candidate s background as a business owner what got mexfiles thinking about peru besides noticing a rejection of politics as usual here and throughout latin america and the inevitable attemps to turn back the clock to normal i e corrupt and elitist political discourse is that despite having neither the money nor the knowledge to even risk a modest amount in mining stocks mexfiles is a huge fanboy of inca kola news a mining investment newsletter and blog coming out of lima without any background or information on the issues involved otto s two latest posts show why i expect castillo will be the next president although he has been warning of a downturn in the value of peruvian mining stocks or rather investments that include peruvian assets especially in copper and that investors are wise to consider their options one company s shares have been rising considerably in good part for the simple reason they re not dicks they re responsible miners as responsible as is possible in a dirty exploitative industry playing by the rules set by the peruvian state not over exploiting their labor force and so on while at the same time another canadian operation is pulling out of the country and no one neither the workers nor the investors would be sorry to see them go in short the good miner element 29 resources wasn t conceived by dirtbags as a way of ripping off idiots and turning director paper into dollars as quickly as possible and something any investor or expat with a business plan should remember governments change the left is rising and no matter who is in charge or in what country once the shock of change is over track records and as a good corporate or social citizen will matter most payback time for bad actors well yeah maybe but this is less about upcoming acts of vengeance and more when national policies affect local stakeholders companies with strong track records will be defended by locals rather than attacked actualadad ikn
germany will start offering coronavirus jabs to children over the age of 12 from next month so schools can return to normal in september despite concerns over scarce jab supplies chancellor angela merkel made the announcement on thursday but stressed that vaccination would not be compulsory and would have no bearing on whether children can attend school or go on holiday the european medicines agency is expected to approve the pfizer biontech covid jab for 12 to 15 year olds on friday it is already authorised in the eu for those over 16 chancellor angela merkel made the announcement thursday but stressed that vaccination would not be compulsory and would have no bearing on whether children can attend school or go on holiday children and young people aged 12 and over will have the chance to book a vaccine appointment from june 7 merkel said after talks with germany s regional leaders those willing will be offered at least their first of two shots by the end of august she added roughly in time for the new school year the main message to parents is there will be no compulsory vaccinations merkel told reporters schools would not require pupils to be vaccinated she said and it would be totally wrong to think you can only go on holiday with a vaccinated child inoculating children is seen as a key step towards achieving herd immunity in the fight against the pandemic canada and the united states have already started vaccinating over 12s but experts have also expressed reservations pointing out that children rarely suffer from severe covid and that vaccine supply is still tight merkel urged patience saying not everyone would get an appointment for their child right away the european medicines agency is expected to approve the pfizer biontech covid jab for 12 to 15 year olds on friday stock image germany s stiko vaccine regulator is due to give its recommendations for over 12s shortly after the pfizer jab is approved the agency has already signalled it intends to recommend the jab only for children in risk categories such as those with underlying medical conditions all over 12s will still be allowed to get jabbed regardless similar to the astrazeneca vaccine which is officially recommended only for people over 60 in germany but is open to anyone who has consulted with their doctor after a much criticised slow start the coronavirus inoculation campaign in europe s top economy has kicked into high gear in recent weeks more than 40 percent of adults have now had their first jab and 15 percent are fully vaccinated the accelerated pace along with rapid testing and widespread shutdowns has helped break a third coronavirus wave and allowed germany to relax restrictions this is a great success merkel said but she called on germans not to ditch precautions such as social distancing mask wearing and airing out rooms the pandemic is not over

by raquel mustillo south australia s peak timber processors association has questioned why log exports out of the port of portland have continued amid a nationwide shortage of structural timber but onefortyone plantations and the australian forest products association say local mills are already running at full capacity with customers continuing to receive sawlog despite high demand for the product demand for sawlog which is the wood that can be processed into beams planks or components of timber frames has skyrocketed across the globe with the finished product fetching prices 350pc higher than the same time last year in some international markets photographs taken on april 26 at the port of portland show what south australian timber processors association chair david quill described as intense activity at marshalling yards owned and managed by various forest companies images taken on may 17 show what appears to be an increasing amount of log with other images showing a half empty wood holding yard obviously it is going to india because they are pursuing a market as the china ban on log exports continues mr quill said port of portland chief executive greg tremewen said there was hardly anything being exported from the port of portland and directed questions about volumes to onefortyone hvp plantations and timberlands while hvp plantations and timberlands did not respond for comment onefortyone said it had not exported structural sawlog since 2018 and had exported minimal quantities of pulp log this year earlier this year the south australian parliamentary inquiry into the limestone coast timber industry heard there were two definitions of sawlog with difference hinging on 15cm to 20cm in diameter but onefortyone executive general manager australia cameron macdonald said a log that meets the diameter specifications of a structural sawlog was unable to be used for construction if it does not meet certain classification requirements a defected log that does not meet all classification requirements for construction is classified as a pulplog he said india is currently the only export market for onefortyone pulplog however due to covid 19 disruptions there is no export of any log until the end of august mr macdonald acknowledged while there was a short term demand for structural sawlog nationwide mill customers were continuing to receive the resource it is our understating that green triangle mills are operating at full capacity he said australian forest products association deputy chief executive victor violante said green triangle sawmills had increased production as imported timber has been unable to fill the domestic gap due to global demand for framing the fact is that all the timber framing sawmills in the green triangle are already working overtime double shifts and weekends at maximum capacity to try to meet the unprecedented demand caused by the covid pandemic induced building boom which has been spurred on by incentives like homebuilder he said but mr quill said processor association members with sawmilling capacity would work a double shift if the resource was available and term of log supply was sufficient to justify increasing the workforce there is no doubt provided that there was term associated with supply some of the smaller processors would start a second shift and they could employ the necessary labour he said the question that needs to be asked is why are we continuing to export sawlog from this country which would be suitable to meet our building requirements sa best parliamentarian frank pangallo who sits on the state based timber inquiry has called for an emergency summit next week to discuss the state s timber stock and implications for the shortage the country is desperately short of timber and we are shipping it offshore to india and korea and eventually it is finding its way to the united states he said there s actually a worldwide shortage of timber at the moment but we are feeling it pretty badly here it s almost a repetition of lpg gas where we were shipping it out cheaply to japan its being processed over there and then coming back here at a much more expensive price it s ludicrous federal and state governments need to realise just how important the forestry industry is in australia it is crucial and unfortunately not many pay attention to it because it s not that visible but it will be when you suddenly can t get buildings and homes completed or even started the recently completed federal parliamentary committee into the timber supply chain has recommended the establishment of a voluntary code of conduct as well as an index of relevant log prices to facilitate access to timber by softwood processors the state based committee is continuing to hear evidence as part of its inquiry with a hearing scheduled for june 1 have your say editorial tbwtoday com au

there will be no climate benefit from electric vehicles until all of us are dead if ever two thirds of global automotive fleet will remain gasoline powered in 2050 ihs markit vice chairman daniel yergin says electric vehicles will make up as many as 8 out of 10 new cars sold in 2050 but it will still be a long road before they dislodge gasoline as the predominant fuel in transportation ihs markit vice chairman daniel yergin writes in his new book the new map energy climate and the clash of nations oil is no longer the unchallenged king in automotive transportation but for some time to come its writ will still extend quite widely across the realm of transportation yergin writes ihs markit projects that electric vehicles including battery plug in hybrid and fuel cell electric will comprise 60 80 of all new car sales in 2050 that increased market share from 2 2 of new car sales in 2020 according to ihs markit data will be driven by greater scale in manufacturing as well as the continued improvement of batteries ihs markit now projects that the average cost of lithium ion cell cost will fall below 100 per kilowatt hour by 2023 nevertheless gasoline powered vehicles will still comprise two thirds of the 1 9 billion cars on the road in 2050 owing to the time it takes for the fleet to turn over the average age of vehicles on the road in the united states is nearly 12 years at least for now the demand for electric vehicles is largely coming not from consumers but from governments whose evolving policies are shaped by climate concerns as well as by urban pollution and congestion yergin observes in the new map failure to meet new government targets for lowering emissions could cost european automakers as much as 40 billion in fines over the next 5 years he adds that is a strong signal that is coming from regulation rather than consumer demand electric vehicles also bring their own set of challenges particularly in the supply chain of some battery materials yergin observes electric vehicle demand for lithium could rise 1 800 by 2030 and would represent about 85 of total world demand demand for cobalt another essential element in batteries could rise 1 400 percent and more than 50 of global cobalt supply comes from one place the democratic republic of the congo nevertheless yergin writes that the possible emergence of what he calls a new triad the convergence of the electric car ride hailing and car sharing services and self driving autonomous vehicles could disrupt oil s century long dominance in transportation this would give rise instead to

representative image a vial is displayed containing the astrazeneca covid 19 vaccine at a mass vaccination centre in madrid april 9 2021 photo reuters sergio perez mohammad rahmani is not a covid 19 denier he wears a mask and practices social distancing but the 24 year old software engineer from kabul afghanistan is deeply sceptical of covid 19 vaccines online videos created in afghanistan and neighboring countries then uploaded on social media have convinced him that sars cov 2 and the vaccine that protects against it are part of a large conspiracy to reduce the global population this kind of scepticism is common within afghanistan where very few residents even follow basic public health guidelines local physicians lament that many people mistakenly believe the covid 19 threat is already over or that it has been greatly exaggerated they fall for rumors like the virus will not affect muslims said mohammad sarwar firozi a physician and administrator within the afghan ministry of public health there is very little awareness and people don t realise that this virus can kill you and is killing afghans in fact covid 19 sceptics could point to the government s statistics which suggest just over 2 800 coronavirus deaths have occurred in the country of 38 million people but the government has likely undercounted a survey backed by the world health organisation found that roughly 10 million people nearly one third of the country s population had been infected with the virus as of last summer according to firozi 40 to 50 of sars cov 2 tests in kandahar province are coming back positive the percentage is particularly high for individuals returning from neighboring pakistan which is experiencing a new wave of infections in february india donated half a million doses of the astrazeneca covishield vaccine to afghanistan as part of a diplomacy effort tragically not long after making the donation india suffered one of the world s worst coronavirus outbreaks and it is now experiencing vaccine shortages despite being home to the world s largest producer of vaccines the way to hell is often paved with good intentions wrote one former diplomat in the times of india a second slightly smaller batch of vaccines arrived in kabul in march through covax the world health organisation backed program designed to distribute vaccine doses to poorer countries but a mixture of scepticism and misinformation perpetuated on social media has slowed an already under resourced vaccination campaign as a result doctors and officials contacted by undark say vaccines that are desperately needed in india may soon expire in afghanistan the afghan government denies this charge ghulam dastagir nazary director of the afghan ministry of public health s immunisation campaign confirmed that the country received 500 000 vaccine doses from the indian government that were due to expire on june 4 but he said they have already been utilised of the first doses we received we have so far administered over 80 acknowledged a senior health official working on the country s immunisation campaign however he shared an internal tally of available vaccine in one government department alone that showed more than 5 000 doses set to expire on june 4 in addition the vaccines donated through covax will expire on july 15 the health official spoke with undark on the condition of anonymity out of fear of government reprisal we won t be surprised if they are wasted simply because people are not convinced the official said showing stocks of unused vaccine vials to undark s reporter in the afghan capital afghanistan s vaccine rollout started out well said nazary the ministry of public health prioritised health care workers security forces journalists and teachers and demand was huge but then interest tapered off after reports that the vaccine had been paused in some european countries due to a rare but potentially associated side effect blood clotting the european medicines agency has since determined that the benefits of the astrazeneca vaccine outweigh the risks these legitimate reports of possible side effects soon gave way to misinformation and false rumors said nazary and the country s vaccination rate was reduced to almost zero for some weeks in response the government is undertaking a crisis communication management plan he said the ministry of public health is asking other ministries as well as the media for help promoting the vaccine immunisation has also been opened to all adults not just essential workers in afghanistan vaccination is voluntary and afghans must proactively seek vaccination from medical centers currently with vaccine doses from india and the who the country has enough to cover 3 of its total population said nazary but health officials are struggling to administer even this amount to the public yet nazary denied that there is any expected wastage we only have 75 000 doses remaining across the country he said and they expire in mid july when undark showed nazary photographs of vaccine vials with a june 4 expiration date he insisted that no such vials exist inside the country he did however say that some wastage is inevitable as part of any covid 19 vaccine rollout also read how the covid 19 pandemic led to new cases of polio in afghanistan the anonymous official who showed undark the soon to expire vaccine doses agreed that some amount of wastage is to be expected because each vaccine vial contains eight to 10 doses and an opened vial is good only for a very short period of time if a physician opens a vial but only sees say six patients that day some of the vaccine will go to waste but this type of wastage is different from what he s witnessing in the capital vaccines at risk of exceeding their shelf life even before they ve been opened in contrast to the many vaccine deniers in the country some employees at the various government departments administering vaccines are putting together leftover shots to make whole doses and taking them to their families the health official shared each vial usually has a little left over even after the 10 doses are administered he said government employees are combining the leftover drops to create a full dose then taking it to their families they are treating these vaccines as precious lifesavers he said and that is how it must be because wasting these precious lifesaving drugs that were gifted to us by india even though they needed it more is criminal firozi agreed it would be a grave injustice if these vaccines get wasted especially when people in the donor country are suffering people should be motivated to take these vaccines and make india s sacrifice worthwhile he added not taking the vaccine when you have the opportunity to is an oppression to yourself and the society many afghans remain unconvinced if the vaccine really works then why is india giving it away to us for free when thousands of them are dying on daily basis asked ghulam farooq a 29 year old civil servant from kabul who has also refused to take the vaccine he reasons that if the vaccine really worked then india its largest producer would not be in the position it is in today farooq s decision to abstain from the vaccine also arrived from claims of alleged side effects including infertility and impact on sexual performance i am still young and i got married only four years ago i have two kids and i am planning to have at least a couple of more kids i can t risk that he explained anyway this whole corona thing is propaganda by the west these types of conspiracy theories are rife in much of afghan society and range from the vaccines being a cia project to track and target afghans to a widespread but mistaken belief that the vaccine was made with ingredients that violate islamic law a serious issue in the muslim majority country the claims of cia interference and its resulting impact on immunisation campaigns have a precedent in parts of afghanistan and pakistan where the united states government did in fact use a hepatitis b vaccination drive to track osama bin laden in an attempt to reach a wider and largely devout muslim population the public health ministry has enlisted the help of prominent religious leaders to dispel some of the rumors swirling around the vaccine after years of living in conflict afghans are susceptible to fake information because we tend to believe the worst explained mauvali ehsanul haq hanafi a religious leader who had joined the afghan government s campaign to spread awareness of the vaccines i have come across people with no medical or religious knowledge who are spreading wrong information that the vaccine is haram or un islamic he said adding that their information was based on rumors spreading rumors is considered sinful in islam firozi went one step further and blamed rumor spreaders for the covid 19 deaths in afghanistan people who are spreading misinformation and influencing others to not get the vaccine are responsible for the lives we lose on a daily basis he said they will be answerable to god on the first day of ramadan last month the ministry of public health enlisted the leadership of the country s ministry of hajj and religious affairs to take the vaccines in front of the media to dispel the myth that the vaccine could impact the practice of fasting during the most holy month for muslims as a deeply religious and conservative society it isn t uncommon for afghans to devoutly follow the words of religious leaders and community elders hanafi attempts to use his influence to convince the people to take the vaccine by delivering sermons talking to other religious leaders and using social media to encourage afghans to get the shots he says he is often challenged to respond to misinformation particularly related to claims questioning the religious soundness of the vaccine i once heard from a person saying that the vaccine consists of pork ingredients which are forbidden in islam he said i know there is no evidence to this rumor another person believed that because the vaccine is produced by a non muslim it can have a negative impact on a believer s faith in response he explains that the virus does not see if one is a muslim or a non muslim there is only one thing it targets and that is the human body hanafi says he urges all afghans including religious leaders to stop the spread of misinformation the anonymous official blamed the government for creating an environment of mistrust that allows such conspiracies to thrive the leadership of the government specifically his excellency the president and his deputies should have taken the vaccine in front of the media in order to convince the people of its effectiveness the official said other world leaders did so that is how you earn your people s trust hanafi agreed adding that the government could have done more early in the vaccine rollout they could have used the voice of those who people listen the most to who will be most effective in convincing people instead they ran the campaign with artists and singers he said referring to the choice of campaign ambassadors endorsing the vaccine hanafi believes that employing community elders security officials and more religious leaders to address concerns of the community would have been more effective it would be grave negligence if these vaccines are wasted he added islam is against wasting however his appeals fail to resonate with those like farooq who believes that his faith will protect him better than the vaccine i believe that if i survived so many wars it is unlikely that this corona will kill me he said i have faith in god and i know god will protect me this article was

capital gains to the extent permitted and if necessary a return of capital a return of capital may occur for example when some or all of the money that you invested in the fund is paid back to you a return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund s investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income even though the fund may realize current year capital gains such gains may be offset in whole or in part by the fund s capital loss carryovers from prior years under the fund s managed distribution policy the fund makes monthly distributions to common shareholders at a targeted annual distribution rate of 6 5 of the fund s average nav per share the fund will calculate the average nav per share from the previous three full months immediately prior to the distribution based on the number of business days in those three months on which the nav is calculated the distribution will be calculated as 6 5 of the prior three month s average nav per

beit hanoun gaza in the first days of israeli shelling mohammed ghabayne and his family tried to stay in their house just 300 meters from the barrier that separated the occupied gaza strip from israel ghabayne was unsure when and where to flee by the fourth night of shelling the war hit home each day it got rougher just unstoppable shelling from the ground said ghabayne and the sky he went on we felt the shaking of the house and the sounds of bombing very loud and close we have no shelters here as the israelis have so we just wait in fear around 11 p m without any warning ghabayne s neighborhood came under bombardment we are sitting at the house and started hearing random shelling he recalled then in like 4 minutes our entire area is under attack it felt like 50 bombs in an instant then in the dark we all escaped shoeless in the streets not knowing where to go when ghabayne and his family emerged shards of glass covered their floor he quickly discovered that israeli airstrikes had not only damaged his home but also those of his nearby family members his grandfather s home had also been scarred but his cousin s just 50 meters away had been hardest hit killing the cousin his wife and three of their children in the black of night with the electricity out ghabayne and his neighbors frantically scrambled through the rubble to pull his cousin s remaining now orphaned children from the concrete ruins the task at hand took primacy over the fear of another round of israeli shelling then in the dark we all escaped shoeless in the streets not knowing where to go ghabayne told the intercept from the courtyard of one of the emergency shelters set up in a united nations school we came here because we have no place to go costs of war ghabayne and his family were among the nearly 80 000 gazans including 30 000 children forced to flee their homes during the 11 day bombardment his is one of more than 17 000 homes destroyed or damaged in the recent war at least 9 000 gazan residents have been left homeless or displaced with gazans taking stock of the destruction and death toll human rights advocates and the international community are turning their eyes toward rebuilding in the strip and accountability for the attacks with three past rounds of escalated israeli attacks on gaza over a decade and a half it s a familiar cycle that will face familiar obstacles not least the israeli siege of gaza and the geopolitics of control by the militant palestinian political faction hamas for gazans like ghabayne the future in the strip is itself a kind of barefoot wandering in the dark seeking the next shelter however precarious it may be they are grieving for loved ones they ve just lost family members and children who are gone and for their homes and possessions in ruins they re in shock and despair over a life that they will mourn forever said sherine tadros of amnesty international and then to step back now what that this round is over will the gaza siege be lifted we have three examples that tell us no so this is what gazans have in front of them the costs of the war in human lives are only beginning to come into focus in the 11 day flare up at least 254 gazans including 66 children were killed and nearly 2 000 were injured by israeli airstrikes using u s made warplanes and bombs twelve israelis including two children were killed by rockets fired by gazan militants on tuesday gaza s ministry of health said that 19 palestinian families had been killed wholesale wiped off the civil registry according to a release both the u n and gaza s government have stated that the total financial cost of damages may not be known for weeks on thursday the u n launched an initial emergency funding appeal for the gazan reconstruction to a world already depressed by donor fatigue from the coronavirus pandemic palestinians sit among the rubble of their destroyed houses after a cease fire between israel and gaza fighters in beit hanoun northern gaza strip on may 22 2021 photo fatima shbair getty images on tuesday in ramallah the de facto seat of the palestinian authority in the occupied west bank u s secretary of state antony blinken announced a 110 million aid package to the palestinians including 5 5 million in emergency relief for gaza the biden administration had already reinstated u s funding to unrwa the u n s palestinian refugee agency that had been cut during the trump administration a 12 year old in gaza has lived only under a siege and now through four wars we know that to prevent a return to violence we have to use the space created to address a larger set of underlying issues and challenges blinken said sitting alongside palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas during his trip to the west bank and that begins with tackling the grave humanitarian situation in gaza and starting to rebuild even as these diplomatic efforts get underway though parallel to calls for human rights investigations little seems poised to change in the financial and physical control israel exerts over gaza and the lasting obstacle of isolation and blockade imposed against its people tadros of amnesty said a 12 year old in gaza has lived only under a siege and now through four wars politics threatens aid the political realities of washington and the logistical interference of the 13 year israeli egyptian blockade of the tiny coastal enclave remain firmly in place legally the administration cannot deal directly with the government of gaza which is controlled by hamas a u s designated terrorist organization on monday a state department official said aid would be channeled through the u n and palestinian authority but such moves routinely face opposition from republicans on capitol hill who have cut off aid through both channels in the past on the ground the siege has kept the majority of gaza s crossings closed for over a decade with only three crossings two with israel and one with egypt open sporadically based on israel defense forces and egyptian military decisions the escalation has exacerbated an already dire humanitarian situation in gaza generated by nearly 14 years of blockade and internal political divisions alongside recurrent hostilities said lynn hastings the u n humanitarian coordinator for the occupied palestinian territories in a sunday statement the generous support of our donor partners from all regions is essential as is unimpeded access of humanitarian personnel and provision to those in need we must all do our part read our complete coverage israel s war on gaza after each previous war israel s siege restrictions have kneecapped reconstruction prolonging the misery of gazan civilians the idf categorizes necessary construction materials like concrete and steel as dual use items products that could be used for civilian or military purposes and places heavy limitations on their import to the strip in the first six months following the last war israel allowed only a fraction of the 5 4 billion pledge for gaza s reconstruction to reach gazans the restrictions left approximately 100 000 gazans displaced through the winter and prompted 30 aid organizations to collectively demand that israel comply with its international legal obligations beyond the cycles of reconstruction the israeli siege has intentionally placed a stranglehold on gazan civilians and their economy at the outset israeli officials described the restrictions as designed to put palestinians on a diet even calculating the minimal caloric intake to keep gazans from starving to determine a daily humanitarian portion that would be allowed into gaza since then the idf has at times restricted such products as food sanitary items school supplies and medicine the devastating controls on the movement of people goods and supplies brought the gazan economy to its knees and transformed the strip into what s often called the world s largest open air prison for more than a decade gaza s 2 million residents have been trapped under the thumb of this cruel system of collective punishment with no end in sight then come the attacks israel has demonstrated that it will not shy away from provocations and hamas can be relied upon to respond with rudimentary missile fire toward israeli population centers unless dynamics dramatically shift it s a cycle that s likely to repeat the brunt of whatever escalation comes next will likely be felt by families like the ghabaynes for whom even the shelters of international aid are little comfort tadros the amnesty official pointed to a pattern across the four wars of israel announcing evacuation orders with presumed bombings to follow for u n run schools acting as shelters she said when gazans seek refuge and i say refuge because it s not a safe place it s just the safest place they can think of they are not just sitting there with their families waiting it out mohammad recep 17 juggles to entertain children among the rubble of destroyed buildings targeted by israeli attacks in beit hanoun gaza on may 25 2021 photo abed zagout anadolu agency via getty images eid deferred ghabayne and his family were able to return to their beit hanoun home after the cease fire was announced a week ago as with many gazans the cease fire was a mix of relief and grief on the evening after it went into effect people flooded the streets in the early hours of friday morning it was not lost on many palestinians in the gaza strip that the latest israeli assault had coincided with the final days of ramadan many families tried to provide their children with a delayed celebration a celebration of survival more than the specific holiday the usual sites for festivities like the seaport and commercial districts lay in ruins thanks to israeli airstrikes instead parents gave their children balloons with backdrops of collapsed buildings and emergency teams the ghabaynes had been lucky enough to survive but not lucky enough to celebrate it instead like other families the past six days were consumed by grief loss and the hard labor of salvaging their homes businesses and property for my family for all of gaza our holiday was only the bombings the martyrs the injuries only bloodshed the ghabaynes spent their days making funeral arrangements and gathering what was left of their homes all while mourning the tragedy of lost family members and making arrangements for their orphaned nieces and nephews the whole world celebrated a happy eid al fitr except us mohammed ghabayne said for my family for all of gaza our holiday was only the bombings the martyrs the injuries only bloodshed on tuesday in jerusalem israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu thanked blinken and the biden administration for firmly supporting israel s right of self defense for ghabayne the word defense rankles as his family mourns their loved ones and extended members shelter in his damaged beit hanoun home what the israelis call defense is not defense we need the world to help us defend our families and homes against the occupation ghabayne said we have been enduring this siege and occupation for a long time we just wish that we palestinians can finally live with a little peace we don t want wars we don t want occupation we just want our families to live in a free palestine
