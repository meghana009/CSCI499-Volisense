in chinese patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis achieved primary clinical endpoint as a new generation of il 23p19 target drug picankibart shows clear advantages in the long dose interval and long term efficacy the dosing frequency is only 5 times annually and it shows a great potential for both efficacy and safety and could be offered as a more friendly treatment option compared to the current ones on the market whose dosing frequency is 7 16 times annually currently there is no il 23p19 target drug independently developed by chinese pharmaceutical companies in the domestic market we are greatly encouraged by the results of good efficacy safety and tolerability of picankibart in the phase 2 clinical study based on this we are confident and will actively advance the phase 3 clinical study of picankibart in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and we plan to optimize the dosing regimen scientifically based on quantitative pharmacology to further improve efficacy and synchronize the use of auto injector in the phase 3 clinical study we are striving to provide more convenient user friendly and effective treatment options for patients with moderate to

his regular video address last night ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky called for new international sanctions to affect russia s nuclear capabilities the reason is the alleged missile strikes against the nuclear power plant in zaporizhzhia there is already an appropriate reaction from the international community but sanctions must be increased because russia does not respect messages and concerns new sanctions are needed against the terrorist state and the entire russian nuclear industry because of the threat of a nuclear catastrophe the ukrainian president said zelensky reiterated that the war in ukraine should not be seen as a frozen conflict and that his country s goal is to regain all lost territories the ukrainian head of state thanked the air defense forces for

russian appointed occupation authorities are currently based in melitopol the russian armed forces have been in full control of the kherson region since mid march tass reports yesterday ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky warned that if the planned referendums on the accession of zaporizhzhia and kherson regions to russia take place all opportunities for peace negotiations will fail today kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said that the residents of the two neighboring southern ukrainian regions partially occupied by moscow themselves want such polls and zelensky has nothing to ask russia and its leadership the president of ukraine should address the ukrainian citizens and ask why many of them do not want to live in his country peskov said wryly olga kovitidi who is a representative in the federation council the upper house of the russian parliament from crimea said that such referendums could be produced not only in zaporizhzhia and kherson regions but also in other ukrainian territories russia occupied the southern ukrainian peninsula and annexed it after a similar referendum in 2014 the results of this referendum were not recognized by the international community the us announced a record 1 billion in military aid to ukraine the united states has announced that it will provide new arms aid to ukraine worth 1 billion the largest package since the beginning of the war bta reported on monday weapons aid from the pentagon stockpile will go to the ukrainian armed forces it will come as russia moves troops and military equipment to the port cities it occupies in southern ukraine to stop a ukrainian counter offensive the new us arms assistance includes additional missiles for the already provided himars high mobility artillery rocket system and nasams national advanced surface to air missile system air defense systems 75 thousand 155 mm artillery shells for western artillery systems which kyiv already has mortar fire systems javelin anti tank missiles as well as other ammunition and military equipment reported afp with the new package the arms aid provided by the united states to ukraine since the beginning of the russian invasion will reach about 9 billion since august last year the pentagon has provided a total of 18 times military equipment from its stocks to the ukrainian armed forces bta reminds at every stage of this conflict we are focused on getting the ukrainians what they need based on the changing conditions on the battlefield said us under secretary of defense for policy affairs colin kahl the new aid is expected to arrive faster than previous packages because it comes directly from pentagon stockpiles for the past four months russia has focused on capturing the donbas the russian armed forces are gradually advancing in the industrial region of eastern ukraine and in other places they are trying to stop the ukrainian army with missile strikes the associated press agency notes this package of us arms aid to ukraine does not include new himars colin kahl recalled that these are precision guided systems designed to hit specific targets the ukrainian armed forces do not need hundreds of himars to achieve the corresponding effect they are aiming for he explained they already have 16 volley fire systems the deputy head of the pentagon also said that the us and its allies are still considering whether to supply military aircraft to ukraine it is not out of the question that western aircraft will be part of further arms aid packages he noted according to colin kahl s estimates between 70 000 and 80 000 russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since the beginning of the conflict dozens of torture camps operate in eastern ukraine in the olenivka pow camp in eastern ukraine the authorities subject detainees to horrific torture human rights activists suspect that dozens of detention camps have been operating in the donbas region since 2014 in which not only prisoners of war but also people from all over russia fall and are tortured a large part of those fighting for ukraine at the front always carry a hand grenade it is intended for themselves if they fall into captivity death is better than what awaits them in the concentration camps this is confirmed by many of the prisoners who survived these camps former prisoner anna vorosheva spoke to the german television station ard she was held captive in the olenivka camp at the same time as 50 ukrainian soldiers who burned alive tied to their metal beds all of them were tortured reports vorosheva she herself spent three months in the camp and today reports on brutal guards who tortured the detainees in a medieval way they made the prisoners duck out of their barracks and walk 100 120 meters to a neighboring building they were brutally beaten there i could hear the blows on their bodies the cries for help the pleas to stop the ukrainian says ukraine has also accused russia of killing and torturing prisoners of war and trying to cover it up the name of the olenivka camp appeared in testimonies of survivors as early as 2015 there are over 70 such camps in the donbas region they are under the control of the separatists this is stated by human rights activist oleksandra matviychuk these camps are illegal people are kept in inhumane conditions and subjected to torture i have spoken to hundreds of survivors they say that they were beaten raped their fingers were cut they were kept for days in wooden crates they were shocked most such torture centers are located in detention centers police buildings prisons but also in hotel basements or empty factories the most famous in the world is still the izolatsiya isolation camp which is located on the territory of a factory for insulation materials after the separatists took over the donetsk region a military base was built there and the separatists used prisoners detainees and captives for slave labor olenivka is another example of this system terror and torture are used massively to keep local people in subjection matviychuk also claims the ukrainian journalist stanislav aseyev was a prisoner alone for over two years in the isolation camp some of those detained with him were prisoners of war others actually supported the separatist government but had a good business and with such means it was taken away from them and others were interned from various parts of russia after moscow backed separatists took power in donbas in 2014 they first started a personal attack on the active part of society journalists like aseyev religious leaders and politicians were arrested some of them are directly killed others disappear forever in the basements of captured cities such arbitrary arrests continue to this day the reason for this is in the structure of this power explains the journalist ilya ponomarenko these are actually criminal organizations that control the captured cities sometimes it is also a war between separate gangster clans that fight for control over territories and money anyone who has a good business or a factory that was liked by someone in the so called power figures can be arrested this is the wild west says ponomarenko the separatists do not allow representatives of world organizations to the detention centers and camps relatives of detainees also do not have any contact with the arrested currently the same system is imposed in the

opinion there is a model for government to turn around struggling economies throughout the world it includes respect for private property rights light touch regulation and a simple way to collect taxes the alternative is continued economic turmoil the next challenge for governments throughout the world after dealing with sky high energy prices and the aftermath of the covid 19 pandemic is the possibility of stagflation cnbc reported on june 21 2022 about a survey of the economists in prominent global and regional financial institutions 80 of economists in the same survey named stagflation as the greater long term risk to the economy according to the securities industry and financial markets association the next biggest risk they identified was deflation with 13 of respondents as inflation is enraging americans the world is on the brink of a marriage of inflation and economic stagnation one way for the government to combat this is to promote pro growth policies that will incentivize investment in areas that have a friendly legal framework for business development on the other hand bad government policies about private enterprise typically led to even more economic stagnation inflation and underemployment north korea cuba and venezuela for example have been suffering for decades under oppressive governance their regimes have zero respect for property rights and economic freedom leading to stagnation and as the specter of stagflation looms ever larger in the western hemisphere too many of us are forgetting what good governance looks like but an emerging community of entrepreneurs and workers on the island of roatan in honduras could soon change that by reviving respect for good governance if extremists don t destroy it first ground zero is prospera a honduran zone for economic development and employment on roatan the goal of the zede is to establish an area with a governance structure that promotes human flourishing through rapid economic development job creation and innovation what that means is strong property rights reasonable regulation employee owned social benefit funds and one page tax returns so far they are succeeding and that success has made it a target prospera zede has drawn over 80 million in investment together with the two other zedes based on the mainland of honduras nearly a quarter billion dollars in private investment has been drawn to the most unlikely of places that has meant thousands of jobs for the honduran people with tens of thousands more anticipated under conditions of legal stability for the american people this means reducing the pressure for those workers to migrate to the united states why move thousands of miles when you can have a good job at home it also promises greater stability for the region and a reduction of the influence of narco and human traffickers how is this small miracle happening prospera zede relies on the private sector to deliver governance as a service with the actual consent of the governed no one is forced to live or work there instead each resident has an actual enforceable contract for services with the government governance is thus furnished without political intrigue feather bedding or favoritism and by deeming all governing officials literal fiduciaries who owe the highest duty of care and loyalty to the governed this governance structure solves the twin problems of abusive bureaucracies and improper corporate influence naturally prospera is driving both leftist extremists and international elites nuts they are out to eradicate the idea of zedes by terminating them and making sure no more spring up in other developing nations local elites oppose zedes because they don t want any new competition and the hard left looks unfavorably on any structure that promotes property rights and consent of the governed because they favor collectivism and the idea that government not the people needs to make decisions relating to sovereignty property and individual rights if prospera is squashed by this unholy alliance of elites and ideologues we can expect continued misery for the honduran and american people alike but it must be allowed to prove itself because the example set by the zone points the way forward to prosperity in the microcosm of the zede we are witnessing nothing less than a battle for the future of the western hemisphere governments are approaching a fork in the road where they can choose prosperity or the road of heavy government spending regulation and high taxation that will lead to even more economic malaise it would be smart for government officials to study the example of prospera to take the lessons learned there to battle stagflation and an angered populace peter mihalick is former legislative director and counsel to former reps barbara comstock virginia republican and rodney blum iowa republican

listen to this article listen to this article americans may finally be catching a break from relentlessly surging prices if just a slight one even as inflation is expected to remain painfully high for months thanks largely to falling gas prices the government s inflation report for july to be released wednesday morning is expected to show that prices jumped 8 7 from a year earlier still a sizzling pace but a slowdown from the 9 1 year over year figure in june which was the highest in four decades the forecast by economists if it proves correct would raise hopes that inflation might have peaked and that the run of punishingly higher prices is beginning to ease slightly there have been other hopeful signs too that the pace of inflation may be moderating at the same time an array of other economic developments are threatening to keep intensifying inflation pressures the pace of hiring is robust and average wages are up sharply and even as gas prices fall inflation in services such as health care rents and restaurant meals is accelerating price changes in services tend to be sticky and don t ease as quickly as they do for gas food or other goods those trends suggest that overall inflation may not drop significantly anytime soon president joe biden has already pointed to falling gas prices as a sign that his policies such as releases of oil from the nation s strategic reserve are helping combat the higher costs that have hammered household budgets particularly for lower income families yet republicans will push ongoing high inflation as a top campaign issue in this fall s elections with polls showing that high prices have driven biden s approval ratings down sharply on friday the house is poised to give final congressional approval to a revived tax and climate package pushed by biden and democratic lawmakers the bill which among other things aims to ease pharmaceutical prices by letting the government negotiate medicare s drug costs is expected to cut the federal budget deficit by 300 billion over a decade yet economists say the measure which its proponents have titled the inflation reduction act will have only a minimal effect on inflation over the next several years though it could could slow price increases a bit more later this decade economists have forecast that wednesday s inflation report will show that consumer prices rose 0 2 from june to july according to factset that would mark a steep drop from the 1 3 jump from may to june but excluding the volatile food and energy categories so called core inflation likely stayed high economists project that core prices rose 0 5 from in july still a sharp rise though down from the 0 7 jump in june such an increase would leave core prices 6 1 higher than a year ago up from a 5 9 year over year increase in june if overall inflation did ease in july it will largely reflect a 16 plunge in prices at the gas pump from their peak in mid june when gas hit a national average of 5 a gallon the average price fell to about 4 20 by the end of july and was just 4 03 by tuesday the continuing drop means that lower gas prices will likely pull inflation down further in august other items may have also helped lower price gains in july food costs though they likely kept rising probably did so at a slower pace than in june prices for used cars clothing and rental cars may have fallen too federal reserve chair jerome powell has said the fed needs to see a series of declining monthly core inflation readings before it would considering pausing its interest rate increases though the fed more closely tracks a different inflation measure it also monitors the figures in wednesday s report known as the consumer price index the fed has raised its benchmark short term rate at its past four rate setting meetings including a three quarter point hike in both june and july the first increases that large since 1994 a blockbuster jobs report for july that the government issued friday with 528 000 jobs added rising wages and an unemployment rate that matched a half century low of 3 5 solidified expectations that the fed will announce yet another three quarter point hike when it next meets in september financial markets are betting that the fed will raise rates several more times this year to a range of 3 5 to 3 75 but will ultimately have to cut rates by next summer because traders expect the higher rates to cause a recession some trends do point to lower future inflation the supply chain snags that have elevated prices for cars furniture appliances and other goods are easing the number of ships waiting to be unloaded at the los angeles long beach port has fallen for six straight months according to oxford economics shipping costs have generally leveled off or declined including for trucking and rail services oxford said though they remain high and a drop in americans expectations for future inflation may also keep higher prices from becoming entrenched such expectations can be self fulfilling if people believe inflation will stay high or worsen they are likely to take steps such as demanding higher pay that can then send prices higher in a self perpetuating cycle companies often raise prices to offset higher their higher labor costs but a survey by the federal reserve bank of new york released monday showed that americans now expect lower inflation in the next few years than they did a month ago yung yu ma chief investment strategist at bmo wealth management said lower inflation expectations may allow the fed to react less aggressively

omaha neb ap inspired by a contentious nebraska law abortion opponents in five other states have won passage of measures banning virtually all abortions after five months of pregnancy the late term bans based on the premise that fetuses at that stage can feel pain a view that has been disputed are among a record wave of more than 80 restrictions aimed at reducing access to abortion all of them approved so far this year in state legislatures other measures expand pre abortion counseling requirements ban abortion coverage in new insurance exchanges and subject abortion clinics to tough new regulations with only a few legislatures still in session each side in the abortion debate is now assessing the potential impact of the new laws they may not drastically slash the overall number of u s abortions 1 2 million a year at last count but they have emboldened anti abortion activists angered abortion providers and will likely make decisions all the more wrenching for women affected by the late term bans in almost every instance at that late stage something has gone terribly wrong with what typically was a very wanted pregnancy said peter brownlie head of planned parenthood of kansas and mid missouri what we see are parents in anguish over some type of medical condition and these very cruel laws double or triple that anguish kansas is one of the five states along with alabama idaho indiana and oklahoma that enacted abortion bans this year modeled after the groundbreaking fetal pain bill passed in nebraska in 2010 the kansas ban is effective after 21 weeks the others after 20 weeks exceptions are allowed when the mother s life is at risk or she faces severe physical impairment the bills depart from the standards established by the u s supreme court which allow states to limit abortions when there s a reasonable chance the fetus could survive outside of the womb generally considered to around 23 or 24 weeks mary spaulding balch legislative director for the national right to life committee said she was pleased the late term bans got attention from lawmakers amid widespread fiscal problems if we have to pass them in 50 states and that s the plan we will do that she said in nebraska only one woman has come forward publicly to say the fetal pain law prevented her from terminating a pregnancy danielle deaver of grand island said she was denied that option at 22 weeks after she learned the baby was nonviable ended up going into natural pre term labor and gave birth to a girl who died after 15 minutes it was very frustrating and added to our grief because the waiting compounded everything deaver said in an interview earlier this year anti abortion activists acknowledge that some late term cases can be difficult but believe the bans are warranted for the sake of the fetus the abortion industry always likes to run to the hard cases said julie schmit albin executive director of nebraska right to life yes there are situations where tragedies occur but that doesn t mean you allow the killing of unborn children beyond 20 weeks who can feel pain she contended that many women in the past who sought late term abortions cited their own psychological concerns and were not faced with a fetal anomaly the guttmacher institute a research organization that supports abortion rights estimates that only about 1 5 percent of all abortions in the u s take place after 20 weeks of pregnancy that would be roughly 18 000 annually as of the 2008 the last year with nationwide figures and probably only a few hundred at most in states enacting the new bans it s very small percentage but it s a lot of distress said elizabeth nash who tracks state legislation for the guttmacher institute critics of the late term bans say other women in predicaments like deaver s may be forced to choose between traveling out of state to get an abortion or proceeding reluctantly with a pregnancy after learning the fetus has a severe anomaly for pregnant women in kansas who want an abortion after 21 weeks that could mean a trip to colorado or new mexico some people will probably just give up the logistics the expense seems overwhelming brownlie said but in general if women have decided the best thing for their family is to end a pregnancy they will go to great lengths to do so of all the anti abortion measures introduced this year one of the most ambitious remains pending in ohio s republican led legislature it would ban abortions after the first detectable fetal heartbeat which can occur within six weeks of conception ohio gov john kasich signed a different bill wednesday that would ban abortions after 20 weeks if the doctor after a mandatory test determines that the fetus is viable there s no exception for the health or life of the mother although those reasons may be used as a defense if a doctor is prosecuted abortion rights advocates say the roughly 200 late abortions performed in ohio each year are often complex involving decisions that should be left to women and their doctors i continue to be amazed that legislators believe they should have a voice when i take care of my patients said dr catherine cansino an obstetrician gynecologist from columbus they should not dictate which medical interventions are available or not she cited the case of a pregnant patient who wrestled with whether to have an abortion because her fetus had a lethal anomaly our state s legislators have decided to force women in these situations to endure weeks months of a doomed pregnancy cansino said in an email what a cruel situation to inflict on them and their families overall according to abortion rights supporters the new laws will have the most impact on low income and rural women especially in states which already have few abortion providers in addition to the late term bans other new restrictions include regulations in kansas specifying what drugs and equipment abortion clinics must stock and setting requirements for room sizes and temperatures two of the state s three abortion providers sued after they were unable to meet the new standards and a federal judge has blocked the rules until the lawsuit is resolved a texas law requiring doctors to conduct a pre abortion sonogram and describe the fetus features to the pregnant woman doctors who don t comply would face loss of their medical license and possible prosecution the law doesn t allow women to opt out with exceptions for cases of rape or incest the new york based center for reproductive rights has filed a lawsuit to overturn the law which is scheduled to take effect oct 1 a south dakota law now under a preliminary injunction requiring women seeking abortions to face a three day waiting period and undergo counseling at pregnancy centers that discourage abortion a law in north dakota also subject of a lawsuit that critics say would prevent the state s only abortion clinic from using medicines to induce abortions another type of law enacted this year in wisconsin indiana kansas and north carolina eliminates public funding for planned parenthood the funds had been earmarked for family planning and other non abortion services but planned parenthood became a target for cutoffs because it also is the nation s largest provider of abortions rachel sussman a planned parenthood policy analyst says the cutoffs could backfire if they undermine family planning programs and increase the number of unintended pregnancies that result in abortions planned parenthood has filed suit to challenge the funding cutoff in indiana one of numerous pending legal challenges to the array of new laws so far however abortion rights advocates have not filed suit against any of the nebraska style fetal pain laws a fact likely to encourage their spread to even more states we will challenge them when the right circumstances present themselves said nancy northup president of the center for reproductive rights they re unconstitutional the nebraska law targeted dr leroy carhart whose clinic near omaha was one of the nation s few to provide late term abortions after the law passed he opened a clinic in germantown md while some doctors contend that fetuses can feel pain after 20 weeks the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists says it knows of no legitimate evidence showing a fetus can ever experience pain the supreme court which established the nationwide right to abortion in its landmark 1973 roe v wade ruling has made clear in subsequent rulings that states can restrict the procedure after viability it has not addressed the issue of fetal pain the anti abortion movement holds out hope that roe v wade will one day be overturned but meanwhile many activists are enthusiastic about the state by state approach of enacting laws that chip away at abortion access we talk about accumulating victories said charmaine yoest president of americans united for life any time you want to make long term change on an issue that s been extremely controversial you do it by developing momentum you don t change something all at once overnight ___ david crary reported from new york city

the raid on donald trump s florida estate is either a political assassination attempt or the most significant criminal investigation into a us president in history that s according to mick mulvaney former chief of staff for mr trump while mr trump described it as a dark times for our nation white house officials admitted that they knew nothing of the fbi s plans to storm his mar a lago home advertisement mr mulvaney told the hard shoulder his former boss is facing investigations from several sides the president is under investigation from a couple of different sources he s under investigation by congress the january 6th committee s looking into the events surrounding the riot at the capitol on that day that s a political investigation it has no real legal standing we ve learned just in the past couple of weeks the president is also under investigation by the federal department of justice very high ranking members of the trump white house have been called before a criminal grand jury under subpoena to testify we assume regarding the events of january 6th so we knew there was investigation going on what we learned late last night however was that it was actually a search warrant issued by a federal judge that gave the fbi the right to go into donald trump s home in florida to look for things he says such a warrant would have had to reach certain thresholds they have to be able to show a judge that there s probable cause that a crime has taken place probable cause that there s evidence around that crime at a particular place and that there is a likelihood that that evidence would disappear if the government can t get its hands on it right away that s apparently what the department of justice convinced a judge of which is what gave them the right to go into the president s house he adds either it s the most egregious political assassination attempt by my own government against a political leader in history or it s the most significant criminal investigation into a president in history keep in mind not even nixon had his home raided what are they looking for after donald trump s presidency ended in january last year officials found he had taken 15 boxes from the white house to his home in mar a lago this investigation was launched by the us national archives and records administration nara the independent government body charged with preserving government and historical records after demanding he return the boxes the nara discovered in january this year they contained government documents including ones marked as classified national security information as well as gifts letters and mementos the nara then referred the case to the us justice department to probe whether mr trump s unauthorised handling of the documents amounts to a violation of federal law some of the documents in the boxes are subject to the presidential records act passed by congress in wake of the 1972 watergate scandal it dictates that presidential documents are not the then president s property and should be handed over to the nara when they leave office to be then made public 12 years later mr trump could have also potentially broken legislation on the appropriate handling of government documents while he was still in office or be charged for obstruction of justice if he was found to have been covering his tracks in april it was reported that a federal grand jury investigation had begun and the justice department there had made several requests including a subpoena to nara for the boxes and interviews with various people in the trump administration it is not clear what law enforcement officials were looking for but it is likely to have been any additional evidence that would help with prosecutors case additional reporting irn main image composite image shows donald trump talks to reporters at his mar a lago estate in palm beach florida in march 2019 and an aerial view of mar a lago in february 2017 picture by reuters zuma press inc alamy stock photo

there may even be some fireballs larger and longer lasting explosions of light and color example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video minneapolis one of nature s best celestial shows is coming back this month but a full moon might steal the show nasa says the perseids have a peak of 50 to 100 meteors per hour and are known for occasional fireballs larger and longer lasting explosions of light and color that come from larger comet fragments the perseids are typically active from mid july to september but this year they peak from friday night to saturday morning aug 12 13 the meteors are best viewed in the hours before dawn but they can appear as early as 10 p m one problem the full moon is on thursday its bright light can outshine meteors and make all but the brightest impossible to see the show s gonna be a bit muted but still there s enough bright meteors that you can still see enough activity by just facing away from the moon said american meteor society editor robert lunsford while the perseid meteor shower is typically considered the best meteor shower of the year nasa says this may not be the year to make a special trip to see the celestial show but if you find yourself out under the night sky during the peak try taking a look after the peak the perseids will slow down nasa says they ll begin to wane on aug 21 and completely stop by the start of september when can you watch the perseid meteor shower despite being active for weeks the perseids reach a crescendo in mid august the peak was aug 11 and aug 12 in recent years but the exact time of the peak gets later by about 6 hours each year that s simply due to the fact that it takes the earth 365 days and a quarter day which is six hours to complete its full revolution lunsford explained nasa and the american meteor society say you can watch the peak of the perseids from aug 12 to aug 13 in 2022 but meteor activity from the shower will also be high in the nights before and after the best time to watch the perseids is the early morning hours because the constellation perseus the place in the sky the meteors will appear to originate from will be high in the night sky instead of close to the horizon you can still see perseid meteors as soon as it gets dark but the numbers will be reduced lunsford said there s not much skywatchers can do about the moon but lunsford said facing away from it and avoiding city lights will help earthsky recommends watching for at least an hour since meteor showers are known for bursts and lulls of activity where do the perseids come from we see comets when earth passes through a trail of space debris for the perseids that debris comes from the swift tuttle comet nasa says the comet takes 133 years to orbit the sun and is 16 miles across astronomers discovered it in 1862 and realized it was the source of the perseids a few years later so where does the name come from meteor showers are named after the point they appear to come from in the night sky in this case the constellation perseus this is known as the radiant and helps skywatchers know where to look when is the next big meteor shower if you decide not to wake up early for the perseids this year there s still some good news meteor season is just getting started the next major one to watch is the orionid meteor shower which peaks on oct 21
when the doughty edinburgh insurer standard life merged with fund manager aberdeen in 2017 the deal was hailed as ushering in a new era of asset management in britain yet in spite of a raging bull market and the optimism of the buccaneering martin gilbert of aberdeen and the cerebral keith skeoch of standard life it has been downhill ever since both have departed the scene the firm was trendily renamed abrdn the standard life insurance brand sold to zombie insurance specialist phoenix and the mandate to manage funds for lloyds bank was lost abrdn plunged into a pre tax loss in the first half of this year chief executive stephen bird took the group in a new direction by buying retail platform interactive investor for 1 49billion this year in the hope of breathing life into the group growth has been stunted just 19 000 new investors were added to the platform in the first half of this year against 49 000 in the same period of 2021 abrdn plunged into a pre tax loss in the first half of this year there was an outflow of 36billion as lloyds removed a final tranche of 25billion of pension fund assets and to pile on the humiliation abrdn is on the verge of being expelled from the ftse 100 latest response to this debacle is to simplify matters by closing or merging 100 non scale or duplicated funds in a cost saving measure affecting up to 40 per cent of its portfolio that looks sensible but will be disruptive for both investment professionals and ordinary savers my own experience with merged axed or disposed of funds would suggest it can destroy the bond between managers and client such ruthlessness may only hasten a punishing decline for retail investors and sap confidence in the future of the new whizzy brand retail therapy anyone tuning into the press conference by andrew bailey last week might have wanted to go out and get a stiff drink interest rates up half a percentage point inflation to peak at 13 3 per cent and five quarters of recession yes the energy price shock is immense but by the spring of next year all things being equal the uk should be past the worst people at the bottom end of the income scale do face a crisis big energy could provide some self help by temporarily diverting some of their dividend income to hardship funds the government is already providing some 15billion of help to the poorest there can be little doubt that the new tory prime minister will be unsheathing a further support package soon after taking office in september common sense can often seem to be missing from the bank s thinking even as bailey was speaking britain s airports were operating at close to current capacity and ryanair was maintaining a full summer schedule ba s focus on the north atlantic may have led to bottlenecks elsewhere but it is delivering earnings again then there is real world data from the british retail consortium against the odds the industry body reported the value of total sales was 2 3 per cent higher in july than a year ago when the economy was still enjoying a post pandemic bounce higher sales were driven by summery items clothing food for picnics and air conditioning eating out took a hit but that could be down to many better off people being overseas the rise in spending in july contrasts with the fall in the previous three months brc chief executive helen dickinson insisted that in spite of the numbers consumer confidence is weak really barclaycard reports that consumer spending was 7 7 per cent higher this july than a year earlier boosted by spending on beauty products clothing and staycations in spite of the energy crisis and rising interest rates consumers surveyed by barclaycard were feeling better about their household finances with 66 per cent reporting confidence against 59 per cent in june fancy that dark glasses fans of the dynastic series succession on sky and its montana equivalent yellowstone on paramount will have no trouble seeing parallels at italian sunglasses champion essilorluxottica where founder leonardo del vecchio recently died leaving behind a 22bn fortune del vecchio sought to circumvent the succession issue by putting the company in the hands of professional management that won t stop his six children and last wife nicoletta all with stakes in holding company delfin fighting over the ultimate spoils tune in
posted in comics marvel comics spider man venom tagged acetategate black flag boston c2e2 deadpool ghost rider ultimate fallout ultimate fallout 4 variant venom marvel did not approve ultimate fallout 4 acetate covers at c2e2 it s black flag ultimate fallout 4 acetate c2e2 drama time but let s step back a little a comic book store can get an exclusive to them retailer cover of a comic book being published by marvel or dc by ordering a minimum of 3000 copies they pay the full wholesale price plus artist costs and they can be sold for a premium or used for promotional purposes other publishers list smaller print runs as options but it can still be a hefty upfront fee and some stores can be stuck with them for a long time comic book store black flag comics has been doing something different in a very entrepreneurial fashion they regularly commission a number of exclusive variant covers to comics often drawn by friend of the store clayton crain a while ago they commissioned an exclusive retailer variant by crain for the ultimate fallout 4 facsimile that marvel put out last year reprinting the first appearance of miles morales a cgc 9 8 slabbed copy recently sold for 36 on ebay which is basically the cost of the slab the juice seemed to have gone out of that one so what did black flag do they created a new acetate cover and stapled it over the top of the remaining 750 copies of the unsold comic they had in stock and made it a patriotic thing with the cover stamp saying usa the united states flag the words in god we intrust and citing it as an infinite black publishing production then sold it as a retailer variant exclusive at last weekend s c2e2 show in chicago for 85 each and they have been making bank initially there were complaints from the collectors who stood in line when the show opened after other retailers instagrammers influencers whatnot sellers could walk up and buy a hundred copies at a time for 85 each and then black flag upped the price of the remaining copies to 100 each and still sold out but copies of this new version of the comic have sold on ebay for up to 350 each with a 9 9 cgc graded version selling for up to 2000 a now deleted but reposted to youtube video explanation by black flag stated that they allowed those retailers to pay in advance towards the production process but concern about how the comic was sold soon turned to curiosity about how it was made today bleeding cool has been able to confirm that marvel comics did not approve black flag s addition of an acetate cover as a further variant and it is also not something they would permit i am sure david gabriel svp print sales marketing at marvel is having fascinating conversations with black flag comics right about now while stopping copycat moves from other retailers while retailer exclusive covers have been popular in the market publishers have to approve them for branding and taste issues and to avoid possible controversies opening it up to anyone to amend covers in this way and then sell them is something marvel will not allow cgc has also been criticised for grading this comic without noting that a it is not an official variant cover and has been altered and b the original grade of the cover must have been damaged by having a new cover stapled into it cgc user captainzombie asked i am baffled how cgc would grade these considering that there are 4 staples on this vs the normal 2 and if this would be a precedent cgc has issued an official response with an explanation of our thought process behind the grade assignments we treated them as we would any other variant cover that s attached with an extra set of staples after the book was printed and at times these books included the original cover as well there is a precedent for acetate covers being attached to a printed book and then graded by cgc an example is stray dogs 1 from last year an acetate variant cover was attached with an extra set of staples to which cgc assigned a universal grade and a notation of acetate cover on the label the extra set of staples were part of the manufacturing process of attaching the acetate cover and not considered a defect however collectors on their board seem not happy with that response as it didn t address the fact that it was the store rather than the publisher who made the alteration black flag also confirmed they had created two more acetate covers for boston fan expo this weekend ghost rider on friday and deadpool on saturday with 100 copies in one line for people who want one copy each at over 100 each and another line for retailers resellers influencers and then a non acetate venom cover for the sunday that black flag said they had been sitting on for two years that no one has seen being released for the show let s see what they actually have on sale at boston shall we does anyone want a job lot in second hand acetate and will there be more fallout for ultimate fallout what about retailers who do this kind of thing with frank cho cover prints it won t end here there s more to come bleeding cool has approached marvel black flag and clayton crain for comment enjoyed this please share on social

there may even be some fireballs larger and longer lasting explosions of light and color example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video minneapolis one of nature s best celestial shows is coming back this month but a full moon might steal the show nasa says the perseids have a peak of 50 to 100 meteors per hour and are known for occasional fireballs larger and longer lasting explosions of light and color that come from larger comet fragments the perseids are typically active from mid july to september but this year they peak from friday night to saturday morning aug 12 13 the meteors are best viewed in the hours before dawn but they can appear as early as 10 p m one problem the full moon is on thursday its bright light can outshine meteors and make all but the brightest impossible to see the show s gonna be a bit muted but still there s enough bright meteors that you can still see enough activity by just facing away from the moon said american meteor society editor robert lunsford while the perseid meteor shower is typically considered the best meteor shower of the year nasa says this may not be the year to make a special trip to see the celestial show but if you find yourself out under the night sky during the peak try taking a look after the peak the perseids will slow down nasa says they ll begin to wane on aug 21 and completely stop by the start of september when can you watch the perseid meteor shower despite being active for weeks the perseids reach a crescendo in mid august the peak was aug 11 and aug 12 in recent years but the exact time of the peak gets later by about 6 hours each year that s simply due to the fact that it takes the earth 365 days and a quarter day which is six hours to complete its full revolution lunsford explained nasa and the american meteor society say you can watch the peak of the perseids from aug 12 to aug 13 in 2022 but meteor activity from the shower will also be high in the nights before and after the best time to watch the perseids is the early morning hours because the constellation perseus the place in the sky the meteors will appear to originate from will be high in the night sky instead of close to the horizon you can still see perseid meteors as soon as it gets dark but the numbers will be reduced lunsford said there s not much skywatchers can do about the moon but lunsford said facing away from it and avoiding city lights will help earthsky recommends watching for at least an hour since meteor showers are known for bursts and lulls of activity where do the perseids come from we see comets when earth passes through a trail of space debris for the perseids that debris comes from the swift tuttle comet nasa says the comet takes 133 years to orbit the sun and is 16 miles across astronomers discovered it in 1862 and realized it was the source of the perseids a few years later so where does the name come from meteor showers are named after the point they appear to come from in the night sky in this case the constellation perseus this is known as the radiant and helps skywatchers know where to look when is the next big meteor shower if you decide not to wake up early for the perseids this year there s still some good news meteor season is just getting started the next major one to watch is the orionid meteor shower which peaks on oct 21

medicines for the treatment of oncology autoimmune metabolic ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the primary endpoint was met in a multicenter randomized double blind placebo controlled phase 2 study clinicaltrials gov nct 05003531 of picankibart r d code ibi112 a recombinant anti interleukin 23p19 subunit antibody injection in chinese patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis this study cibi112a201 was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of picankibart under various administration in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis a total of 250 subjects were randomized 1 1 1 1 1 to receive 50 mg once at week 0 4 then every 12 weeks 100mg once at week 0 4 then every 12 weeks 100mg once at week 0 4 then every 8 weeks 200mg once at week 0 4 then every 12 weeks of picankibart or placebo the primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of subjects who achieved a 90 improvement in the psoriasis area and severity index pasi at week 16 pasi 90 and the total study period is 52 weeks to date a total of 245 subjects 98 0 have completed the primary endpoint at week 16 and a total of 236 subjects 94 4 have completed the visit at week 28 in terms of efficacy 52 0 54 9 of the subjects achieved pasi 90 after picankibart treatment at week 16 which was significantly higher than that in the placebo group and reached the primary endpoint in addition the proportions of subjects who achieved pasi 75 and pasi 100 were also significantly higher than that in the placebo group all p values 0 001 the study results through 28 weeks showed a long term efficacy of picankibart with 61 2 72 5 of the subjects who received picankibart achieving pasi 90 78 4 88 0 of the subjects achieved pasi 75 and in one of the groups received picankibart about 40 0 of subjects achieved complete skin lesions clearance pasi 100 in terms of safety picankibart is generally well tolerated and no new safety signals occurred compared with previous clinical studies the overall safety profile is similar to other il 23p19 mabs the most frequently reported incidence 10 treatment emergent adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection with mild to moderate severity in addition we observed a significant increase from baseline in the dermatology life quality index dlqi of subjects treated with each dose of picankibart compared to placebo all p values 0 0001 clinical study results showed that 50 200mg picankibart administered every 12 or 8 weeks significantly improved the skin lesions and quality of life of subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis demonstrating the significant improvement effect at long dose interval it is worth noting that at the 16 week primary endpoint assessment subjects received only two administrations significantly less than other similar biologics moreover continued improvement in efficacy across the picankibart treatment was observed after reaching the primary endpoint up to 28 weeks demonstrating the potential sustained advantage of long interval dosing the study period is 52 weeks one year and currently subjects in the placebo group have been treated with ibi112 and the dosing and follow up of the study are ongoing full data on the study will be published at future academic conferences or peer reviewed journals professor jianzhong zhang of peking university people s hospital the principal investigator of the study stated psoriasis is a life long disease which has a huge impact on the physical and mental health and quality of life while the current traditional treatment is not ideal we are pleased to find significant clinical benefit and improved quality of life in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in the phase 2 clinical study of picankibart meanwhile picankibart also shows potential advantages in long dosing intervals and long term efficacy i am confident and looking forward to the success of its upcoming phase 3 study and hope it will provide an alternative treatment option for chinese psoriasis patients dr lei qian vice president of clinical development of innovent stated we are happy that phase 2 study of picankibart in chinese patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis achieved primary clinical endpoint as a new generation of il 23p19 target drug picankibart shows clear advantages in the long dose interval and long term efficacy the dosing frequency is only 5 times annually and it shows a great potential for both efficacy and safety and could be offered as a more friendly treatment option compared to the current ones on the market whose dosing frequency is 7 16 times annually currently there is no il 23p19 target drug independently developed by chinese pharmaceutical companies in the domestic market we are greatly encouraged by the results of good efficacy safety and tolerability of picankibart in the phase 2 clinical study based on this we are confident and will actively advance the phase 3 clinical study of picankibart in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and we plan to optimize the dosing regimen scientifically based on quantitative pharmacology to further improve efficacy and synchronize the use of auto injector in the phase 3 clinical study we are striving to provide more convenient user friendly and effective treatment options for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis as soon as possible and to fulfill our mission of providing high quality innovative biopharmaceutical products that are accessible to patients about picankibart ibi112 picankibart ibi112 is a monoclonal antibody independently developed by innovent with independent intellectual property rights this product specifically binds to il 23p19 subunit thereby preventing il 23 from binding to cell surface receptors resulting in the inhibition of the il 23 receptor mediated signaling pathway preclinical data demonstrated that ibi112 has a clear target and well elucidated mechanism of action and significant anti inflammatory effect further good safety and tolerability have been verified in the phase 1 clinical study at present the phase 2 clinical studies of ibi112 in

stocks surged as softer than expected inflation data fueled bets the federal reserve could pivot to a smaller pace of hikes a view taken with a grain of salt by market watchers saying officials may still be a long ways from achieving their goal traders went risk on wednesday with the s p 500 hitting a three month high a rally in tech shares sent the nasdaq 100 more than 20 per cent above its june bottom leaving it in a bull market going by a commonly held definition the gauge still sits 19 per cent below its november record the cboe volatility index slid to a level last seen in april the dollar sank the most since the onset of the pandemic treasury two year yields were lower by about five basis points in late trading after plummeting nearly 20 basis points immediately after the data west texas intermediate crude topped us 91 a barrel for a market plagued by fears about the fed s struggles to tame the inflation beast the july consumer price index brought a sigh of relief with both core and overall measures coming in below forecasts swaps are now suggesting a move of 50 basis points as more likely in september than a repeat of the 75 basis point increases that officials have opted to implement at their past two meetings this is overall good news for risky assets wrote florian ielpo head of macro at lombard odier asset management adding that a lower growth rate of prices does not mean the end of inflation and naturally the end of hawkish central banking inflation remains a situation that requires the fed s attention and more importantly the fed s measures one danger of the stock market bullishness right now is it could cause a relaxation of financial conditions that would go against the fed s goals it s also worth looking back to the early 1980s when then fed chair paul volcker eased policy as inflation peaked and the economy tipped into a recession but the moderation of price pressures proved to be much slower than officials wanted and they had to tighten again months later in fact the cpi surprise is just one piece of the intricate puzzle officials are playing with at the moment and possibly over the next several months with the central bank still miles away from reaching its inflation target food prices in the us soared the most since 1979 in july keeping the cost of living painfully high even as lower gasoline costs offered some relief to consumers two fed officials responded to softening inflation data by saying it doesn t change the us central bank s path toward even higher rates this year and next alluding to market pricing of the policy trajectory fed bank of minneapolis president neel kashkari said it was not realistic to conclude the central bank will start cutting rates in early 2023 his chicago counterpart charles evans said officials will probably continue hiking into next year to bring down unacceptably high inflation the easing of financial conditions likely annoys the fed and we should not be surprised to see fed speakers continue to try to talk down the market and risk assets said christian hoffmann portfolio manager at thornburg investment management more comments on cpi the fed still has significantly further to tighten and the us economy ultimately cannot avoid its fate enjoy today and the next few weeks it won t last for too long said seema shah chief global strategist at principal global investors this data point will fuel talk of a policy pivot but for me the issue really does boil down to the labor market wage growth is running red hot and absent a turn around in productivity this will ultimately fuel higher prices wrote neil dutta head of economics at renaissance macro research this is a step in the right direction but keep in mind we have many miles ahead of us before inflation normalizes one month s data point does not make a trend however so cautious optimism is likely the name of the game said mike loewengart managing director of investment strategy at e trade from morgan stanley wow finally the anecdotal evidence that inflation was easing has finally showed up in a mainstream inflation report the fed is rapidly losing its case for further tightening and this report reinforces for investors that either a new easing cycle has already begun or we are getting very close to one said jim paulsen chief investment strategist at the leuthold group in

article 3 months old always an independent thinker rudi has not shied away from making big out of consensus predictions that proved accurate later on when rio tinto shares surged above 120 he wrote investors should sell in mid 2008 he warned investors not to hold on to equities in oil producers in august 2008 he predicted the largest sell off in commodities stocks was about to follow in 2009 he suggested australian banks were an excellent buy between 2011 and 2015 rudi consistently maintained investors were better off avoiding exposure to commodities and to commodities stocks post gfc he dedicated his research to finding all weather performers see also all weather performers on this website as well as the special reports section rudi s view aug 10 2022 this story features appen limited and other companies for more info share analysis apx as has become an unofficial tradition fnarena editor rudi filapek vandyck was interviewed by livewire markets co founder james marlay ahead of the august results season in australia a link to the video which can also be viewed via youtube is included at the end of the edited transcript below james marlay co founder livewire markets last time we had a chat a little bit of a debate erupted in the comments section and the general context was about you holding extra cash in your portfolio given the uncertainties you had identified in the market so before we get into the reporting season i want to hear your views on the idea of timing the market because it always draws debate i d really love to hear what your views are on that particular topic rudi filapek vandyck editor fnarena this might actually surprise you i ve seen many statements like it s a bit foolish to try to time the market and i agree with that i also think there s a misunderstanding amongst investors about when someone like myself increases the cash level in the portfolio that s not because i try to time the market it s done because i make a risk assessment i think investors put too much emphasis on trying to sell at the ultimate peak in the share price and to buy back in at the ultimate bottom of the share price there is way too much emphasis and too much effort for something that is very difficult to achieve but what we all can do if we take good care of the money we have in the market we can all assess the risks whether they increase or decrease and when risks become very very high whereby i suspect there is an above normal drawdown waiting to happen in the market then i wouldn t be a cautious investor if i would not increase my level in cash that s basically the long and the short of it i m not timing the market i m simply adjusting the portfolio in line with my assessment of the risks that lay ahead to put this in very simple terms when you leave the house and you look out the window and it s raining you take an umbrella with you that s just the normal thing to do the same thing applies to the share market when the only thing that s going to work is keeping your money in cash why wouldn t you do it it is but the logical thing to do james that conversation happened back in february more recently you talked about phase one being the quality recovery so my question to you is are you carrying more or less cash than when we spoke in february and can you articulate some of the thinking behind your position right now rudi i think this might surprise you and some of the viewers but i have done very little since raised the cash level earlier in the year i ve basically been sitting on the stocks i ve felt comfortable with and that cash was just sitting on the sidelines in recent times the portfolio re allocated some of that cash back in the market but still holding more than 22 in cash at the moment as i always like to point out is a process and effectively what has now happened is the risk is now shifting towards corporate results there s more than likely a recession on the horizon so the risk is not necessarily diminishing risk is descending from the macro level which previously consisted of high valuations with very low bond yields as those bond yields had to reset the share market had to come down in terms of valuation and that has now happened but now we re going to find out how sturdy and resilient companies are in the face of all the challenges that already have exerted themselves this year and equally important in the face of the challenges yet to come this is where the true challenge for investors lays in the upcoming reporting season james interesting even in some of the early reports that are coming out you re seeing some big moves based on the fundamentals that companies have reported we ve seen some big surprises and we ve seen a couple of big disappointments most recently we re talking about appen apx with its share price down 30 last time i checked rudi and we have also the likes of united malt group umg which yet again issued a profit warning needless to say shareholders cannot be happy with what s happening with that share price we also have some smaller companies the likes of nitro software nto for example big reset in expectations thus big impacts on share prices then you have the likes of bega cheese bga again big drawdowns this is one of the reasons why i believe holding a big chunk of cash is still valuable because you can t predict all these drawdowns before the season there are many challenges out there and we can only adjust our views once we see the details that are coming out of those companies not in advance as we don t yet have all the details available james i was reading through one of your most recent notes and against that uncertain backdrop that we ve had there s been a gravitation towards resources companies but you re not convinced can you talk me through your circumspect position on resources companies rudi i m trying not to laugh too hard there s a fundamental misunderstanding amongst investors about how price earnings pe ratios work and i ve seen this throughout the whole year if you look at the likes of bhp group bhp rio tinto rio fortescue metals fmg bluescope steel bsl woodside energy wds and santos sto they are all trading on a mid single digit price earnings ratio based on the forecast 12 months out this is not because those companies offer great value this is because the market is preparing for a recession the fear is those companies are enjoying peak of the cycle product prices for crude oil iron ore copper nickel you name it so you are not by definition buying a bargain because it s only trading on a pe of seven you have to take the view that the price of iron ore or crude oil is not going to fall if we have an economic recession coming up that is a big call to make my favourite response when i am confronted with such views is i try to turn it into a little bit of a joke i say to people let me check the last time that commodity prices held up in an economic recession i then run through my papers do an extra check of history and then go the last time this happened oh that s right it has never happened before so basically if you put all your money in commodities you are hoping that this time is different and that this time prices will hold up in the face of a recession which has never happened before let s go back to your first question i said successful investing is all about managing risk it doesn t seem to me that betting hard on commodities equals managing your risk very well when i manage risks i m definitely not going to be taking a large leverage to a forecast that if it proves wrong i might lose my shirt and my trousers i think it is most important as an investor to realise investing is not about making forecasts it s about making sure that if the forecasts you re making are wrong that you don t end up going down by 30 by 40 or by 50 james alrighty the flip side is that you are interested in looking at some of the technology companies and some of the smaller cap stocks companies that have really borne the brunt of the selling is that because you like that area or because you think a lot of the bad news is already in the price rudi there are two sides to that one i have been waiting until i could feel comfortable with where bond yields are because bond yields ultimately are the master of everything i think bond yields have peaked for now which probably is a fair assumption to make unless we are all reading inflation in the wrong way that means the higher multiple growth companies no longer have to fall on the basis of bond yields rising so now it becomes an individual story now it s about picking the quality in the sectors you like and quality in this case means you should have an eye on how resilient are businesses going to be in a recession as i explained earlier that is the main question investors should now be asking even if we somehow by miracle escape an economic recession next year the question will still be asked by markets that s how i look at the share market right now in summary i think an era of quality is opening up and it s no coincidence that for example csl csl is back at almost 300 technologyone tne is at 12 and goodman group gmg is back above 20 you re seeing the quality companies in each sector taking the lead in the recovery and that is basically happening on that same philosophy i just explained other people are thinking the same way james you named three companies they re not exactly what i call small caps are there similar areas outside of the well established names that you think have the potential to be quality leaders across a few sectors rudi one of the small cap stocks that i ve held on to throughout this year s turbulence is idp education iel halved its position in that company and recently it was topped up again i believe this company is excellently positioned for the post covid era it should do well including in case of a recession obviously we re gonna find out the answers in august the mega trends that existed before we saw a resurgence in inflation and higher bond yields those mega trends will still continue but not every company that can claim to be supported by long term mega trends is necessarily well run in the short term is not necessarily profitable and not necessarily well managed enough to weather an economic recession hence it s still a field full of landmines i believe that putting an emphasis on quality in each sector that you re looking at will pay dividends james let s get on to reporting season because that is the catalyst for us to have a chat before we get into it is there a chart or a statistic that you can draw on that you think is really important for investors as we head into reporting season rudi i am assuming most people know what we re doing at fnarena for those who don t we also collect data on stockbrokers this might surprise a few people but the total percentage of buy ratings in australia is still 59 near a decade high on that basis you have to conclude two things this is still a bear market plus a lot of corrections still need to happen in terms of forecasts and in valuation modelling for companies august is not going to give us all the answers it ll probably happen in august and february next year but forecasts are probably too high another statistic i find very interesting is that the average savings rate in the united states is declining and quite rapidly so i can pick up on that because my impression from surveys done in australia is that the australian consumer and australian house owner has been quite resilient but also quite ignorant about what is basically laying ahead i think the consumer in general wants to keep doing what he she s been doing in past years but ultimately he or she will have to be forced into changing habits that s one of the reasons why i think the changes that will come through on the back of higher interest rates are very slow paced we all have to wait until the true effects show up i do think investors are realising this and they will be very hesitant to pile in into housing related companies in australia and in retailers etc it is also becoming clear in the united states that the divergence between new orders and inventories is widening almost every month now and that is not good news either this in itself will prove deflationary it also increases the chances significantly that companies will be left with too inventories you can see the bad news building if you have an eye for it james i noted in your most recent article to fnarena subscribers you said on face value the australian market looks like a bargain hunters paradise with the key word there being on face value rudi there are two elements to that statement first of all if you take the average price earnings ratio for the asx200 it s now 13x something and it was as low as 12x something a little while ago historically that looks like very very cheap the problem with that is of course the numbers behind the average tell a different story we have for example bhp making up 11 of the index we have to go back two decades before we had another example of one company representing such a big chunk of the index long story short after the banks and the financials in general the energy sector and the mining sector in australia are the second largest contingent in the index combine the banks and financials with the miners and energy companies they re all trading on below market average pe ratios that s more than half of the index trading below the average which shows you the other half is trading well above 20x i just mentioned csl that stock is trading on 36x but as i explained earlier the fact the banks are trading on pes of 11 12x with exception of commonwealth bank cba plus the fact that bhp rio woodside etc are trading on a pe of six or seven that s not a cheap market that shows you the fear for a big recession coming those low pes give investors the wrong impression the other big question mark is are we in a down cycle for profit forecasts if forecasts have to be cut this means pe ratios automatically rise assuming the share price stays the same you could call this a head fake because the 13x something might in reality be more like 14x something and if you accept that the long term average in australia is about 14 5x 14 7x then the share market is actually bang on valued in line with the long term average not cheap thus james in context of those comments to what extent do you think the market has priced in potential earnings downgrades which as i keep reading are going to continue to flow through rudi this is one of the answers we are going to find out in august the market previously sold down the retailers and anything related to the housing market but both have bounced hard recently it may well be that we re finding out in august that it s still early in this cycle don t underestimate we just had a fantastic july it means a lot of share prices have rallied quite hard already i also believe because we are looking towards a recession that hasn t arrived yet that in particular the institutional investors will be very reluctant to join a rising share price if they don t believe that that share price will prove resilient in light of the recession that is yet to come history shows that if a company surprises on the upside in reporting season that share price usually outperforms by up to four months in a relative sense this time might be different i suspect and i think there will be disappointment in that regard to put it very simple people always say the share market is all about company profits and dividends that is factually incorrect the share market is about forecasts of profits and dividends those forecasts are going through a down cycle and the downgrades might well last into next year this by definition will act as a headwind so we are looking at a share market that as i call it is a bit of dr jekyll and of mr hyde not everything will be functioning in the same way as it has done in the past there will be lots of curve balls and surprises both to the upside and to the downside james i d like to finish our chat on a positive note because i was telling our team today there s been too much bearishness july was a good month the sun s shining so to finish off on a positive note could you share a couple of companies that you think have the potential to provide an upside surprise or if that s too much to ask perhaps you can point to the ones that are just unlikely to be disappointing rudi i actually don t think my story is that negative sometimes as an investor we have to accept that risks are elevated during certain times this is one of those periods it doesn t mean that the share market can only go down by definition i have for years been poking fun at people who held shares in telstra tls for the dividend and then held on and held on while their capital eroded and eroded away over two long decades today i believe telstra is making a recovery and shareholders might well be positively surprised over the next three four years they should see share buybacks bonus dividends and higher dividends the latter hasn t happened for a very long time irrespective of what happens in august whether telstra surprises or not i think a new trend has been set in motion i ve been very fortunate that in early 2021 when i was looking for a replacement in dividend allocations that i chose telstra at that point in time it has been a very beneficial ride since you could say i m talking my own book but i truly believe what i just said otherwise i m predominantly focused on market leaders and on quality companies so what i just said about telstra also applies to csl i think csl is making a come back you can already see this in the share price response prior to august it is not about what csl might release in august as that might still be slightly negative we know the pandemic has had an impact i think the future looks increasingly better for csl which again all else being equal should prove very very resilient in a recessionary environment also held on to goodman group obviously if you look down from the peak the share price has fallen a lot but again i do believe that investors who simply treat goodman group as a bond proxy and little else will be proven wrong the share price is now back above 20 this company should above everything else continue to be carried by a mega trend and that mega trend is not going to disappear anytime soon one of the stocks said goodbye to earlier in the year because i was afraid of how far it might fall is nextdc nxt while reducing level of cash we bought back in recently again those who are worried about data becoming a commodity are way too early in their predictions nextdc is all else equal another quality operator in yet another sector that is carried by mega trends also don t forget that if one s worried about energy costs and the like this company has contracts to pass on those increases to customers there will be no shortage in demand for data the video of the interview 28 minutes the most

flow over to the real estate sector 1 2 while technology ignored the nasdaq and rose 1 7 the s p500 fell 0 4 last night but our futures are showing down 0 6 or 39 points this morning despite some strong gains in base metal prices recent history suggests that seemingly oversized moves in the futures reflect hedging of a big order set to hit the physical market in the morning t would be a bold move ahead of tonight s cpi or maybe it s a square up for safety s sake inflation consternation it is widely assumed tonight s us headline cpi will come in lower than june s 9 1 confirming a peak in inflation may have been seen given falls in oil prices various commodity prices from copper to lumber and freight costs but wall street may not be too happy if that dip is only minimal moreover it is also expected the core cpi ex food and energy could actually tick up and this is more pertinent for the fed the problem is the biggest component of the index is rent and rents have continued to rise with us mortgage rates despite an apparent rollover in the housing market due to higher mortgage rates as i have noted before rents can quickly go up but will not quickly come down unless an economic slump leads to vacancies with unemployment at historic lows mass vacancies are unlikely wall street posted another session last night that was largely stable ahead of the cpi otherwise impacted by more falls in the chip sector dragging down both the nasdaq and s p500 on monday night sector heavyweight nvidia fell 6 3 after warning of lower revenues ahead due to supply chain problems and a fall off in gaming demand last night peer micron fell 3 7 after echoing nvidia completely nvidia fell another 4 while these falls are not massive problems in the chip business resonate across the wider tech sectors including the mega techs the moves come on the day the president signed the chips act into law which green lights subsides and incentives to build chip manufacturing facilities in the us like chipmaker intel micron also has plans ready for construction of such a facility but like intel no spade has yet broken the ground the benefits will be long term so looking ahead to tonight the fundamental issue will be whether wall street becomes more certain the fed will go another full 75 points in september or the 50 hinted at by jerome powell the strong july jobs number has already

americans may finally be catching a break from relentlessly surging prices if just a slight one even as inflation is expected to remain painfully high for months thanks largely to falling gas prices the government s inflation report for july to be released wednesday morning is expected to show that prices jumped 8 7 from a year earlier still a sizzling pace but a slowdown from the 9 1 year over year figure in june which was the highest in four decades the forecast by economists if it proves correct would raise hopes that inflation might have peaked and that the run of punishingly higher prices is beginning to ease slightly there have been other hopeful signs too that the pace of inflation may be moderating at the same time an array of other economic developments are threatening to keep intensifying inflation pressures the pace of hiring is robust and average wages are up sharply and even as gas prices fall inflation in services such as health care rents and restaurant meals is accelerating price changes in services tend to be sticky and don t ease as quickly as they do for gas food or other goods those trends suggest that overall inflation may not drop significantly anytime soon president joe biden has already pointed to falling gas prices as a sign that his policies such as releases of oil from the nation s strategic reserve are helping combat the higher costs that have hammered household budgets particularly for lower income families yet republicans will push ongoing high inflation as a top campaign issue in this fall s elections with polls showing that high prices have driven biden s approval ratings down sharply related senate passes inflation reduction act house to vote next on friday the house is poised to give final congressional approval to a revived tax and climate package pushed by biden and democratic lawmakers the bill which among other things aims to ease pharmaceutical prices by letting the government negotiate medicare s drug costs is expected to cut the federal budget deficit by 300 billion over a decade yet economists say the measure which its proponents have titled the inflation reduction act will have only a minimal effect on inflation over the next several years though it could slow price increases a bit more later this decade file a customer pumps gas at an exxon gas station on july 29 2022 in houston texas exxon and chevron posted record high earnings during the second quarter of 2022 as energy stocks have faltered in recent months photo by brandon bell getty image expand economists have forecast that wednesday s inflation report will show that consumer prices rose 0 2 from june to july according to factset that would mark a steep drop from the 1 3 jump from may to june but excluding the volatile food and energy categories so called core inflation likely stayed high economists project that core prices rose 0 5 from in july still a sharp rise though down from the 0 7 jump in june such an increase would leave core prices 6 1 higher than a year ago up from a 5 9 year over year increase in june if overall inflation did ease in july it will largely reflect a 16 plunge in prices at the gas pump from their peak in mid june when gas hit a national average of 5 a gallon the average price fell to about 4 20 by the end of july and was just 4 03 by tuesday the continuing drop means that lower gas prices will likely pull inflation down further in august other items may have also helped lower price gains in july food costs though they likely kept rising probably did so at a slower pace than in june prices for used cars clothing and rental cars may have fallen too federal reserve chair jerome powell has said the fed needs to see a series of declining monthly core inflation readings before it would considering pausing its interest rate increases though the fed more closely tracks a different inflation measure it also monitors the figures in wednesday s report known as the consumer price index the fed has raised its benchmark short term rate at its past four rate setting meetings including a three quarter point hike in both june and july the first increases that large since 1994 a blockbuster jobs report for july that the government issued friday with 528 000 jobs added rising wages and an unemployment rate that matched a half century low of 3 5 solidified expectations that the fed will announce yet another three quarter point hike when it next meets in september financial markets are betting that the fed will raise rates several more times this year to a range of 3 5 to 3 75 but will ultimately have to cut rates by next summer because traders expect the higher rates to cause a recession some trends do point to lower future inflation the supply chain snags that have elevated prices for cars furniture appliances and other goods are easing previous inflation surges to 9 1 in june reaching new 40 year high the number of ships waiting to be unloaded at the los angeles long beach port has fallen for six straight months according to oxford economics shipping costs have generally leveled off or declined including for trucking and rail services oxford said though they remain high and a drop in americans expectations for future inflation may also keep higher prices from becoming entrenched such expectations can be self fulfilling if people believe inflation will stay high or worsen they are likely to take steps such as demanding higher pay that can then send prices higher in a self perpetuating cycle companies often raise prices to offset higher their higher labor costs but a survey by the federal reserve bank of new york released monday showed that americans now expect lower inflation in the next few years than they did a month ago yung yu ma chief investment strategist at bmo wealth management said lower inflation expectations may allow the fed to react less aggressively to reports such as last month s burst of hiring that

there may even be some fireballs larger and longer lasting explosions of light and color example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video minneapolis one of nature s best celestial shows is coming back this month but a full moon might steal the show nasa says the perseids have a peak of 50 to 100 meteors per hour and are known for occasional fireballs larger and longer lasting explosions of light and color that come from larger comet fragments the perseids are typically active from mid july to september but this year they peak from friday night to saturday morning aug 12 13 the meteors are best viewed in the hours before dawn but they can appear as early as 10 p m one problem the full moon is on thursday its bright light can outshine meteors and make all but the brightest impossible to see the show s gonna be a bit muted but still there s enough bright meteors that you can still see enough activity by just facing away from the moon said american meteor society editor robert lunsford while the perseid meteor shower is typically considered the best meteor shower of the year nasa says this may not be the year to make a special trip to see the celestial show but if you find yourself out under the night sky during the peak try taking a look after the peak the perseids will slow down nasa says they ll begin to wane on aug 21 and completely stop by the start of september when can you watch the perseid meteor shower despite being active for weeks the perseids reach a crescendo in mid august the peak was aug 11 and aug 12 in recent years but the exact time of the peak gets later by about 6 hours each year that s simply due to the fact that it takes the earth 365 days and a quarter day which is six hours to complete its full revolution lunsford explained nasa and the american meteor society say you can watch the peak of the perseids from aug 12 to aug 13 in 2022 but meteor activity from the shower will also be high in the nights before and after the best time to watch the perseids is the early morning hours because the constellation perseus the place in the sky the meteors will appear to originate from will be high in the night sky instead of close to the horizon you can still see perseid meteors as soon as it gets dark but the numbers will be reduced lunsford said there s not much skywatchers can do about the moon but lunsford said facing away from it and avoiding city lights will help earthsky recommends watching for at least an hour since meteor showers are known for bursts and lulls of activity where do the perseids come from we see comets when earth passes through a trail of space debris for the perseids that debris comes from the swift tuttle comet nasa says the comet takes 133 years to orbit the sun and is 16 miles across astronomers discovered it in 1862 and realized it was the source of the perseids a few years later so where does the name come from meteor showers are named after the point they appear to come from in the night sky in this case the constellation perseus this is known as the radiant and helps skywatchers know where to look when is the next big meteor shower if you decide not to wake up early for the perseids this year there s still some good news meteor season is just getting started the next major one to watch is the orionid meteor shower which peaks on oct 21

refunds financial commentary company cfo taylor greenwald added the second quarter was highlighted by meaningful profitability improvements in several key metrics as we increased gross margin to an all time high of 65 8 delivered net income of 5 3 million and recorded adjusted ebitda of 14 2 million or 21 8 of revenue the company also produced 3 6 million in positive unadjusted free cash flow and 6 7 million of adjusted free cash flow thanks in part to a 4 3 million tax refund received during the period the strong quarterly performance resulted from the underlying strength of the cloud business which will continue to be a catalyst for growth 2022 financial outlook compared to the second quarter of 2022 management expects third quarter revenue and adjusted ebitda to be down slightly after factoring in an approximate 2 million impact from the sale of the dxp and activation assets in the second quarter and recognition of approximately 4 million in deferred non cash revenue from the cloud business which benefited the second quarter and will not repeat in the third quarter while the company still expects to be free cash flow positive on an adjusted basis for the year management expects third and fourth quarter cash flow results to decline moderately compared to the second quarter due to the non recurring tax refund and timing of cash receipts and expenses looking to 2023 the company expects to be free cash flow positive on an unadjusted basis given the trajectory of its cloud business and the actions taken to drive down its cost structures based on the financial performance in the first half of 2022 and better visibility into the remainder of the year the company is narrowing the range of its full year 2022 adjusted ebitda expectations to between 48 0 million and 55 0 million from a previous range of 45 0 million to 55 0 million additionally the company now expects gaap revenue for the fiscal year ending december 31 2022 to range between 260 0 million and 270 0 million the comparable 2021 revenue is 265 0 million after adjusting for the divestiture of the company s dxp and activation assets despite delay in some customer decision making and

a few initiatives are in the works to make sure that kids have the most access to vegan options during the 2022 2023 school year the availability of vegan food and dairy free milk at schools across the united states varies greatly with some regions still serving the same greasy dairy pizzas and chocolate dairy milk while others push for more ethical environmentally friendly and healthier meals for kids a number of initiatives are aiming to close this gap to help all children thrive one obstacle to providing a full range of vegan options at schools is an outdated policy around dairy milk under the national school lunch and school breakfast programs nslp a usda regulation that is wrapped up in dairy industry lobbying schools are required to serve dairy milk in order to be reimbursed by the nslp for meals federal regulations stipulate that program participants cannot discriminate against the drinking of cow s milk before school after school on school grounds or at any school sponsored event established in 1946 the nslp serves more than 30 million children in more than 100 000 schools the requirement is predicated on claims that dairy is nutritionally important for children despite the fact that many of them particularly children of color are lactose intolerant when it comes to the numbers research shows that up to 80 percent of black and latinx people up to 95 percent of asian people and more than 80 percent of indigenous americans cannot digest lactose without adverse effects such as diarrhea nausea cramping and bloating this week a group of 28 organizations including national urban league national action network washington bureau naacp s maryland state conference switch4good and coalition for healthy school food sent a demand letter to the usda in regard to this policy which they say constitutes dietary racism if black lives matter so does our health and nutrition but the nslp has consistently failed children of color milton mills md said in a statement either schoolchildren drink the milk they re given and suffer in class while they re trying to learn or they go without a nutritionally significant portion of their meal the group is asking the usda to update the nslp policy to proportionately compensate schools for serving soy milk which the federal government recognized as nutritionally equivalent to dairy milk in its 2020 dietary guidelines it is hard to imagine a more inequitable and socially unjust usda practice than force feeding cow s milk to children who get sick from drinking it switch4good executive director dotsie bausch an olympic cyclist said in a statement if 80 percent of white children got sick from drinking milk schools parents and government agencies would rightly fall over themselves to find a solution jo saint george chief legal officer for women of color for equal justice points out that the nslp stands starkly in contradiction to the principles behind the usda equity commission a 15 member group charged with improving equitable practices across the organization the usda s own anti discrimination regulation mandates that the agency take action to correct the current injustice against lactose intolerant children saint george said in a statement failure to act delegitimizes the very existence of the usda equity commission getting vegan school lunch on the menu while the usda demand letter aims to give children equitable access to dairy free milk other developments are helping put vegan food on the school menu in illinois governor jb pritzker signed new legislation in may that will give nearly two million children within the state s school districts access to more plant based meals under the new law which goes into effect in august 2023 all illinois schools must provide a plant based meal that meets federal nutrition regulations to all students who request it this new law also serves to satisfy other requirements including those followed by muslim students

plant based diet after a type 2 diabetes diagnosis first put in place in february this program gives more than 930 000 children within the nyc public school system access to vegan food every friday

opinion by sarah anderson and rebekah entralgo for cnn business perspectives imagine if america s ultra wealthy invested the financial gains they made during the pandemic in affordable housing child care centers or any of our country s other urgent human needs as of may us billionaires had seen their wealth rise by more than 1 7 trillion an increase of almost 60 since the beginning of the covid 19 crisis according to the institute for policy studies and americans for tax fairness they could easily marshal their vast resources to make people s lives better or at least blunt the pain many are still feeling from the height of the pandemic instead how have we seen billionaires spending their fortunes space races jeff bezos s reported yacht that s too big to get out of the port elon musk s impulsive 44 billion twitter takeover bid that he s now trying to abandon efforts to buy elections it s hardly any wonder that people across the political spectrum are fed up with the billionaire class but it s taken much longer for washington to get the message it s time for lawmakers and the administration to double down on addressing america s wealth inequality before the next crisis hits as us workers quit their jobs at record rates we re seeing americans growing more frustrated with an economy where low wage workers make just a tiny fraction of the mega millions flowing to their bosses a recent institute for policy studies report found that the average ceo worker pay gap at the 300 us corporations with the lowest median worker pay hit 670 to 1 in 2021 that was up from an already staggering 604 to 1 in 2020 unionization campaigns are also surging with election filings increasing 56 over the past nine months it s no coincidence that the two highest profile unionization campaigns in the country are targeting companies starbucks and amazon with billionaire founders and ceos the inflation reduction act the senate passed over the weekend would be a great start for generating significant revenue from those who should really be paying more the biggest revenue raiser is a 15 minimum tax on corporations with profits of 1 billion or more which is expected to generate 258 billion over 10 years this addresses the problem of the rampant tax dodging among large companies that has mostly benefited wealthy shareholders and executives the bill also includes a 1 excise tax on companies stock buybacks raising an estimated additional 74 billion this will discourage corporations from siphoning resources into share repurchases that largely benefit shareholders and executives with stock based pay those resources could instead go toward worker wages or other productive investments and finally the bill would boost irs enforcement to ensure the ultra rich pay what they owe instead of getting away with hiding their wealth through complex accounting tricks if the bill passes the house revenue from these tax reforms would be used to reduce the deficit and pay for climate programs as well as capping out of pocket costs at 2 000 for those enrolled in medicare drug plans and extending expiring enhanced subsidies for affordable care act coverage the legislation is far from perfect though manchin and schumer had initially agreed to substantially narrow one of the most obscene examples of how the rich have rigged our tax code the carried interest loophole wealthy private equity and hedge fund managers have often paid lower tax rates than many firefighters and teachers because this loophole allows them to claim the bulk of their income as capital gains which are taxed at a significantly lower rate than ordinary income under pressure from senator kyrsten sinema that gaping loophole will remain unchanged other effective proposals for tackling inequality such as taxing the accumulated wealth of the ultra rich are also missing from the bill of course low tax rates aren t the only tool billionaires have used to concentrate their wealth and power lawmakers should also commit to reforming our nation s charitable giving system which the ultra wealthy have turned into a taxpayer subsidized platform of private power a new institute for policy studies report documents that in 2020 wealthy americans poured 48 billion into donor advised funds accounts that offer donors an immediate income tax deduction but have no legal requirement to pay out funds to charities ever the funds can exist in perpetuity and be passed on to heirs delaying the civic benefit indefinitely president biden could also do more on his own to act against wealth inequality for instance he could go further to lift the student debt burden that is a driving factor in our nation s wealth divide particularly for families of color and he could build on his executive order requiring federal contractors to pay a minimum of 15 per hour by also prohibiting the ceos of these firms from busting unions manipulating stock prices through share buybacks or paying themselves hundreds or even thousands of times more than their median wage employees if we want to be stronger in the face of future crises we need to tackle the wealth inequality that is distorting our democracy and leaving so many americans behind the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

beverage to beverage nvidia dgx station improves recognition accuracy of gordon tx scara monitors beverage inventory availability 24 hours a day while receiving this the ai system gordon predicts and schedules product display timing and instructs tx scara to refill beverage stock nvidia dgx station an ai workstation was adopted as the training environment for gordon by simulating product displays in a variety of patterns it can create an efficient and optimum image recognition model smooth remote operation and prevention of vr sickness if the ai display fails because of an unanticipated environmental change tx scara will shift to telexistence mode remote control and a remote control operator will make corrections via vr operation vr sickness can occur when there is a misalignment between vision and body senses because of delay in 3d video transmission in order to prevent this the system uses nvidia s powerful gpu accelerated compute capabilities for advanced image processing performance which enables video transmission at a maximum speed of 50 milliseconds the amount of time including network delay that elapses between when the video is inputted into the robot camera and when it is displayed at the operator s display a millisecond is a thousandth of a second main initiatives powered by microsoft japan tx has selected microsoft azure as the cloud platform for the robot solution service by tx scara and is using it for the robot s task management system microsoft azure used by gordon to make task decisions the inventory information scanned by tx scara which monitors beverage inventory 24 hours a day is captured by azure s cloud system as digital twin information and the ai system gordon uses this information to predict the optimal beverage display based on past sales trends at each store and demand by time of day the ai system gordon then predicts the optimal beverage display based on past sales trends and demand by time of day and determines the next task to be executed by tx scara and give instructions a task is a display task such as pick up products from point a and place them at point b database to minimize out of stock merchandise tx scara s cloud system by microsoft azure maintains and manages a database of sales trends at each convenience store where tx scara operates this enables tx scara to predict and execute optimal display tasks

in japan s labor population is one of the key management issues for familymart to continue stable store operations the introduction of telexistence robots into familymart stores will eliminate the need for store employees to replenish beverages in refrigerators and the newly created time can be reallocated to customer service and shop floor enhancement leading to higher quality store operations kano concluded we will continue to work with telexistence to create a new way to operate stores this initiative is a small step toward realizing telexistence s mission of improving all simple labor workflows in human society with robots telexistence is promoting this initiative based on a collaboration with nvidia and microsoft japan specifically nvidia gpu accelerated ai technologies are embedded in hardware originally developed by telexistence to provide ai and remote control of robots via microsoft azure platform currently the greatest limiting factor for any industry in any nation is human resources especially in developed countries like japan the shortage of human labor is rapidly becoming apparent in the retail and logistics industries which support human life in society said jin tomioka ceo of telexistence we are promoting large scale production and social implementation of our robots for industries other than factory automation industries that function as the infrastructure for daily life in society we also will bring our automated labor solutions to other regions such as the united states tomioka added telexistence s robots will become a powerful influence providing a virtually inexhaustible supply of new labor the new surplus resources will be appropriately redistributed through market mechanisms and in the long run this can lead to the transition of human society to be significantly augmented by automated labor tx scara is autonomous with gordon during normal operation in rare cases where the ai encounters issues due to miscalculation or external factors such as an item falling or being out of place remotely located telexistence employees using vr glasses take control of the robot to correct issues across stores each tx scara can replace one to three hours every day of human work at a single store the market potential for tx scara is vast in japan alone there are 16 000 familymart convenience stores plus approximately 40 000 more from other convenience store chains telexistence next plans to expand to convenience stores in the u s where more than half of consumers say they visit one of the country s 150 000 convenience stores at least once a month moving from proof of concept to mass production of 300 remotely operated robots with deep ai capabilities is a major step forward notes dr lewis pinault airbus ventures partner based in tokyo as an early investor of telexistence we are thrilled to see the company s diverse richly talented team begin to take flight rolling out their advanced technology across japan and activating new channels in support of their future expansion in north america masataka osaki japan country manager vp of corporate sales nvida entire industries are transforming as customers build their next generation of robotics and edge ai applications on nvidia platforms aiming to empower retailers to address labor shortages telexistence s robotics solution powered by nvidia s gpu accelerated technologies will enhance experiences for both retail customers and employees tomoko mikami managing executive officer small medium corporate business microsoft japan co ltd microsoft japan will be collaborating globally with telexistence in terms of cloud platform and business development in the implementation of artificial intelligent robotics for qualitative improvement of industry as promoted by telexistence we are pleased that our platform can contribute to this project and microsoft will continue to support the project to make a significant

flying commercially is already a hassle most of the time but the ripple effect of a recession can make it a complete disaster jack willison general manager of jetmembership com post this another potential impact of a recession on the travel industry would be an increase in price sensitivity among higher end consumers as all budgets become tighter consumers will likely comparison shop and look for the best deals on travel related expenses such as airfare accommodation and car rentals this could lead to a decline in margins for businesses operating in the travel industry a recession could also lead to an increase in business bankruptcies and consolidation within the travel industry as businesses struggle to cope with declining demand and squeezed margins some will inevitably fail this could lead to consolidation within the industry as larger companies acquire struggling businesses while the one percent are not exempt from the effects of a recession they are usually better able to weather the storm than those in lower income brackets this is because the wealthy typically have a larger financial cushion to fall back on as well as access to better resources and opportunities however they are still affected due to a number of factors including stock market declines reduced bonus payments and layoffs although the travel industry will feel the impact of a recession in its entirety the aviation industry is already feeling the negative effects of an economic decline with crude oil prices climbing to new heights the aviation sector is facing a fresh challenge in its efforts to recover from the pandemic higher fuel prices are eating into airlines profits complicating their efforts to rebuild after a disastrous 2020 and with air travel still well below pre pandemic levels there s little relief in sight the situation is a particular problem for budget airlines which have been struggling to compete with their larger rivals in the long run higher fuel prices could lead to higher airfares further hampering the aviation sector s recovery soaring fuel prices are yet another complication in the aviation sector s long and difficult road to recovery the higher cost of fuel isn t the only thing that is negatively affecting the commercial airline industry as the cost of living continues to skyrocket more people are forced to cut down on all unnecessary spending including travel with a recession airlines would see a drop in demand and would have to cut back on flights and routes this would result in job losses for airline employees from pilots and flight attendants to baggage handlers and ground crew a recession would also likely lead to a decrease in air travel tax revenue this is because fewer people would be flying and therefore paying taxes on their tickets this would put even more financial pressure on airlines and could lead to even more job losses flying commercially is already a hassle most of the time but the ripple effect of a recession can make it a complete disaster said jack willison general manager of jetmembership com it will lead to a slew of issues like costlier flights limited routes last minute delays and cancelations lost luggage the list goes on our program is available at a more reasonable cost compared to other private aviation companies as the old saying goes history tends to repeat itself the global financial crisis that began in 2008 also had a major impact on the aviation industry air travel demand decreased as consumers cut down on spending and business travel budgets were also slashed this led to airlines cutting capacity and in some cases going bankrupt aircraft manufacturers also experienced reduced orders as airlines delayed or canceled plans to purchase new planes with another upcoming recession on the horizon it can be difficult to predict whether recent aircraft orders through large aviation companies will eventually be fulfilled customers who fly privately using jet cards are already used to certain restrictions that limit their options with a recession however these limitations are only likely to worsen most of these programs require deposits of hundreds of thousands of dollars unused and expiring hours can also create a much more significant financial hardship for cardholders in trying economic times whether people are traveling for business or pleasure

author toshiro nishizawa university of tokyo affordability matters for government debt because the burden is eventually passed onto current and future taxpayers through tax hikes or inflation japan s general government gross debt was 263 per cent of gdp at the end of 2021 borrowing may seem affordable as long as the average yield is close to zero but low interest rates are no longer sustainable as japan falls behind global monetary tightening trends japanese sovereign debt relative to gdp has been the largest among g7 countries since 1998 it is double that of the united states 133 per cent and far larger than second place italy 151 per cent the bank of japan boj held 43 per cent of japanese government bonds jgbs at the end of march 2022 raising concerns about just how affordable the national debt really is jgbs amounted to 71 per cent or 526 trillion yen us 3 8 trillion of the boj s entire assets at the end of march 2022 the bank s liabilities were 732 trillion yen us 5 3 trillion including 563 trillion yen us 4 1 trillion of current deposits liabilities owed to depositors through financial intermediaries in 2012 some argued that the jgb rates could rise if the amount of debt outstripped the financial assets of the domestic private sector they simulated the ceiling breach occurring within the next ten years based on the flow of funds at the end of 2021 the net financial assets of the non financial private sector amounted to 188 per cent of gdp while general government liabilities reached 218 per cent of gdp the jgb landscape has changed dramatically with the boj s assets now four times larger than in 2012 this suggests that the simulation would have materialised in the absence of boj s prolonged purchase of jgbs the current global monetary tightening environment has not changed boj s easing stance japan s low interest rates continue to diverge from rising levels in the united states europe and some emerging economies the yen has fallen to a 24 year low putting pressure on domestic prices already affected by global commodity price hikes economics tells us that exchange rate management monetary autonomy and free capital mobility are incompatible the impossible trinity policymakers must give up one of these goals japan cannot maintain a stable yen keep interest rates low and keep up free capital flows simultaneously a rise in interest rates will soon become inevitable unless people tolerate price hikes or prefer capital control in april 2022 the international monetary fund imf in its annual article iv consultation warned of the risks associated with a long term rise in public debt the imf suggested that the current interest growth differentials may not continue without the boj s accommodative monetary policy and domestic investors home bias academic discussions on the implications of an end to quantitative easing have long been muted political motives have weakened any sense of urgency and prolonged the affordability illusion policymakers seem to be buying time either for fiscal consolidation or for their much anticipated economic revitalisation the japanese government s balance sheet shows a negative net worth of 592 trillion yen us 4 3 trillion with their authority to collect taxes existing conceptually as an invisible asset the population s ability to pay taxes depends on its wealth and income levels japan s national wealth was 3 669 trillion yen us 26 8 trillion at the end of 2020 and nominal gross national income gni was 563 trillion yen us 4 1 trillion in 2021 focusing on investment from savings may strengthen the nation s assets quality and income generation capacity in the long term but changes in the investment savings balance may have a short term impact on borrowers funding costs japan s ageing demographic also depresses income growth and shrinks the tax base while spending on healthcare and pensions increases tokyo is inclined to present optimistic growth prospects in 2013 the japan revitalization strategy aimed for an average of 3 per cent nominal gdp growth over the next ten years in order to increase nominal gni per capita by 1 5 million yen us 10 949 yet the nominal gni peaked at 580 trillion yen us 4 2 trillion in 2019 a meagre rise from 526 trillion yen us 3 8 trillion in 2013 on the other hand general government gross debt has nearly doubled since 2000 when it sat at 136 per cent of gdp unaccomplished economic revitalisation aspirations have trapped policymakers in a time buying mode full of repetitive rhetoric political compromise removed the deadline for the primary balance goal outlined in the basic policy the annual fiscal and economic policy guidelines released on 7 june 2022 politically driven narratives of extravagant spending dominated debates during the upper house election campaign japanese prime minister fumio kishida s initiative to reform the japanese economy through a new form of capitalism is another revitalisation trial but peer pressure toned down his redistribution policy and investor backlash shelved the capital gains tax debate the domestic and international environments are now significantly less favourable than ten years ago when limits for jgbs were suggested japan s efforts to defy gravity are already transitioning to a sharp descent meanwhile kishida said on 27 may 2022 that his government continues to debate the capital gains tax he also stated on 19 june 2022 that we need to continue raising the banner of fiscal reconstruction the landslide upper house victory seems to have given the prime minister the political capital necessary for a golden three years to revive the japanese economy but it will all be an illusion without a serious discussion on debt affordability and a resolute goal for fiscal health toshiro nishizawa is professor at the graduate school of public policy the university of tokyo the post waking up from the japanese debt dream first

washington americans may finally be catching a break from relentlessly surging prices if just a slight one even as inflation is expected to remain painfully high for months thanks largely to falling gas prices the government s inflation report for july to be released wednesday morning is expected to show that prices jumped 8 7 percent from a year earlier still a sizzling pace but a slowdown from the 9 1 percent year over year figure in june which was the highest in four decades the forecast by economists if it proves correct would raise hopes that inflation might have peaked and that the run of punishingly higher prices is beginning to ease slightly there have been other hopeful signs too that the pace of inflation may be moderating at the same time an array of other economic developments are threatening to keep intensifying inflation pressures the pace of hiring is robust and average wages are up sharply and even as gas prices fall inflation in services such as health care rents and restaurant meals is accelerating price changes in services tend to be sticky and don t ease as quickly as they do for gas food or other goods those trends suggest that overall inflation may not drop significantly anytime soon president joe biden has already pointed to falling gas prices as a sign that his policies such as releases of oil from the nation s strategic reserve are helping combat the higher costs that have hammered household budgets particularly for lower income families yet republicans will push ongoing high inflation as a top campaign issue in this fall s elections with polls showing that high prices have driven biden s approval ratings down sharply on friday the house is poised to give final congressional approval to a revived tax and climate package pushed by biden and democratic lawmakers the bill which among other things aims to ease pharmaceutical prices by letting the government negotiate medicare s drug costs is expected to cut the federal budget deficit by 300 billion over a decade

going as far as it used to i see such an increase in my utilities insurance car insurance everything has just gone up dramatically not to mention the grocery stores so this is really a blessing lundquist said on friday lundquist receives a limited income through social security benefits but after medicare expenses and other bills there isn t much left for groceries she said everything is

ask what to bring to a food pantry we always say think outside of the can of corn or can of green beans aguzino said aside from essentials and high priced meats the top five items people need are feminine care products shampoo and conditioner toothpaste and toothbrushes aguzino also reaches into monetary funds to buy items not covered by snap benefits like cleaning supplies or toilet paper as

from operations fueled by the execution of freehold s north american strategy by expanding the company s asset base to the premier basins across north america freehold has enhanced the sustainability of the company s cash flow profile which underpins our ability to grow our dividend and enhance our portfolio through reinvestment record funds from operations are a function of the structural shift in freehold s business yielding a larger exposure to us pricing with us realized pricing in the second quarter 19 higher on an oil equivalent basis than our canadian realized pricing with the quality and resiliency of freehold s current asset base further improved by three recent us acquisitions we will be increasing our monthly dividend by 13 from 0 08 share to 0 09 share we see this increase as striking a balance between returning capital to shareholders and maintaining balance sheet strength while retaining the optionality to pursue strategic acquisition opportunities volumes of 13 453 boe d showed a decline from the previous quarter although are up 21 from q2 2021 canadian volumes were flat quarter over quarter with spring breakup impacting activity levels for our us assets we continue to expect back half weighted growth in production through 2022 given a pronounced uptrend in spuds and permitted wells through the first half of 2022 given the extended cycle times in the us for permitting wells to generating sales production and with some of freehold s more active us producers facing further headwinds caused by global supply chain challenges and crew availability there have been delays in bringing new wells on production despite these delays the level of well permitting drilling activity and revenue generating capacity of our us assets have exceeded expectations we anticipate that some of the production additions expected in the first half of 2022 have been delayed to the second half of 2022 this has resulted in softer h1 2022 us production than originally expected and slightly lower forecast full year 2022 average production before taking into account the production additions associated with our recently announced acquisitions activity levels remained robust through the first half of 2022 with the seasonal slowdown in canada associated with spring breakup partially offset by a sizeable increase in drilling across the company s us asset base within our north american portfolio freehold has exposure to a strong suite of well capitalized public and private operators across all the premier basins including the eagle ford midland in the permian clearwater and the deep basin as previously announced and subsequent to quarter end freehold entered into definitive agreements with two private sellers to acquire mineral title and royalty assets located predominantly in howard county in the midland basin for 123 million and in the eagle ford basin for 32 million 2022 has been an exciting year for freehold as we continue to incorporate the us portfolio expansion into our business this expansion which started in late 2020 and continues to this day with our recent midland and eagle ford deals has provided us the opportunity to materially grow our production base and drilling inventory has delivered three consecutive quarters of record funds from operations and has allowed us to restore our monthly dividend to 2015 levels of 0 09 share all while maintaining balance sheet strength dividend announcement the board of directors of freehold the board has declared a dividend of 0 09 per share to be paid on september 15 2022 to shareholders of record on august 31 2022 the dividend to be paid on september 15 2022 represents a 13 increase over the 0 08 per common share dividend to be paid on august 15 2022 to shareholders on record on july 29 2022 the dividend is designated as an eligible dividend for canadian income tax purposes subsequent events on july 7th 2022 freehold announced that it had entered into definitive agreements with two private sellers to acquire high quality us mineral title and royalty assets located in the midland basin predominantly in howard county texas the howard county midland assets for 123 million and in the eagle ford basin in texas the eagle ford assets for 32 million net of estimates for exchange rate and customary closing adjustments the howard county midland assets consist of a

to close september 2022 and purchase price is expected to be funded by freehold s existing credit capacity these acquisitions enhance the quality of freehold s north american royalty portfolio through

up 19 over q1 2022 production averaged 13 453 boe d in q2 2022 an increase of 21 over q2 2021 and a slight decrease of 2 over q1 2022 canadian oil and gas royalty volumes declined 0 5 in q2 2022 relative to q1 2022 averaging 9 692 boe d this decline was mainly due to limited activity during the spring breakup period however activity levels began to show a strong recovery in june us oil and gas royalty production averaged 3 761 boe d in q2 2022 down slightly from 3 883 boe d in q1 2022 volumes in the us were negatively affected by a combination of lower completion activities and lower net royalty interest wells brought on production during the quarter new wells spuds have been strong in the first half of 2022 with q2 2022 increasing meaningfully over q1 2022 this drilling activity will result in production additions starting in the second half of 2022 and into 2023 achieved a 146 increase in gross wells drilled on our royalty lands in q2 2022 versus q2 2021 in total freehold had 224 gross 3 0 net wells drilled in q2 2022 slightly down on a gross and net basis versus q1 2022 given the higher proportion of wells drilled coming from us assets at the end of q2 2022 there were five rigs drilling on our canadian lands and 28 rigs drilling on our us lands net debt 1 of 33 1 million at q2 2022 represents 0 1 times trailing funds from operations 1 see non gaap financial ratios and other financial measure drilling and leasing activity in total 224 gross wells were drilled on freehold s royalty lands in q2 2022 a 146 increase versus the same period in 2021 for the first six months of 2022 460 gross wells were drilled on freehold s land this compares to 196 gross wells for the same period in 2021 the significant increase in drilling activity is attributed to the recovery of commodity prices and our us and canadian royalty acquisitions of the total wells drilled in q2 2022 approximately 59 of gross wells on freehold royalty lands targeted prospects in texas 22 in alberta and 13 in saskatchewan with the balance spread across other regions more broadly 61 of all gross wells drilled targeted us prospects with the remainder targeting canadian prospects canada with spring break up occurring for the majority of second quarter third party drilling activity within freehold s canadian portfolio was down compared to levels seen in the previous period in total freehold had 76 gross locations drilled on its royalty lands during the quarter this compared to 59 gross locations drilled in canada during the same period in 2021 for the first six months of 2022 220 gross locations were drilled on freehold s canadian land a 50 increase over the 146 gross locations drilled in the same period in 2021 approximately 83 of gross wells drilled on freehold s canadian lands targeted gross overriding royalty gorr prospects with the remaining 17 targeting mineral title prospects while producers continue to remain disciplined in setting their capital programs we continue to see significant and broad increases in drilling activity across our canadian portfolio compared to 2021 during q2 2022 freehold generated 0 5 million in bonus and rental revenue entering into 17 distinct leasing arrangements with 8 different counterparties for the first half of 2022 new leasing has already surpassed full year 2021 levels and is on trend to be as strong as 2019 activity levels us drilling activity levels on freehold s us lands were generally above expectations for the quarter with most activity targeting light oil prospects in the midland and eagle ford basins a trend in line with the previous quarter new wells drilled on freehold s us assets continue to be led by public operators however the proportion of wells drilled by private operators has increased in q2 2022 compared to q1 2022 freehold s inventory of permitted wells and spuds increased materially during the quarter and first half of 2022 indicative of the broad increase in overall industry activity during this time given the average timeline in the us for permitting wells to generating sales production and spudding wells to generating sales production of approximately 9 months and 5 months respectively this build in inventory is expected to provide production growth in the second half of 2022 and into 2023 overall 148 gross wells were drilled on our us royalty lands during q2 2022 which compares to 32 gross wells during the same period in 2021 and 100 gross wells in q1 2022 approximately 80 of gross wells drilled on freehold s us lands targeted mineral title prospects

standards ifrs which are the canadian generally accepted accounting principles gaap for publicly accountable enterprises requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses these estimates may change having either a positive or negative effect on net income as further information becomes available and as the economic environment changes conversion of natural gas to barrels of oil equivalent boe to provide a single unit of production for analytical purposes natural gas production and reserves volumes are converted mathematically to equivalent barrels of oil boe we use the industry accepted standard conversion of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil 6 mcf 1 bbl the 6 1 boe ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip it does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead and is not based on either energy content or current prices while the boe ratio is useful for comparative measures and observing trends it does not accurately reflect individual product values and might be misleading particularly if used in isolation as well given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil to natural gas is significantly different from the 6 1 energy equivalency ratio using a 6 1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value non gaap financial ratios and other financial measure within this news release references are made to terms commonly used as key performance indicators in the oil and gas industry we believe that the non gaap financial ratios cash costs and netback and a supplemental financial measure payout ratio are useful for management and investors to analyze operating performance and liquidity and we use these terms to facilitate the understanding and comparability of our results of operations however these terms do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by gaap and therefore may not be comparable with the calculations of similar measures for other entities cash costs which is calculated on a boe basis is comprised by the recurring cash based costs excluding taxes reported on the statements of operations for freehold cash costs are identified as operating expense general and administrative expense cash based interest financing and share based compensation pay outs cash costs allow freehold to benchmark how changes in its manageable cash based cost structure compare against prior periods the netback which is also calculated on a boe basis as average realized price less operating expenses general and administrative and cash interest charges represents the per boe cash flow amount which allows us to benchmark how changes in commodity

financial information presented on a gaap basis the company believes that excluding certain items from its gaap results allows management to better understand its consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project its future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare gaap based financial measures moreover flywire believes these non gaap financial measures provide its stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate the company s operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of the company s operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons there are limitations to the use of the non gaap financial measures presented here flywire s non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies other companies including companies in flywire s industry may calculate non gaap financial measures differently limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes flywire uses supplemental measures of its performance which are derived from its consolidated financial information but which are not presented in its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap these non gaap financial measures include the following revenue less ancillary services revenue less ancillary services represents the company s consolidated revenue in accordance with gaap after excluding i pass through cost for printing and mailing services and ii marketing fees the company excludes these amounts to arrive at this supplemental non gaap financial measure as it views these services as ancillary to the primary services it provides to its clients adjusted gross margin adjusted gross margin represents adjusted gross profit divided by revenue less ancillary services adjusted gross profit represents revenue less ancillary services less cost of revenue adjusted to i exclude pass through cost for printing services and ii offset marketing fees against costs incurred management believes this presentation supplements the gaap presentation of gross margin with a useful measure of the gross margin of the company s payment related services which are the primary services it provides to its clients adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda represents ebitda further adjusted by excluding i stock based compensation expense ii the impact from the change in fair value measurement for contingent consideration associated with acquisitions iii the impact from the change in fair value measurement of the company s preferred stock warrants iv other income expense net v indirect taxes related to intercompany activity vi acquisition related transaction costs and vii employee retention costs such as incentive compensation associated with acquisition activities management believes that the exclusion of these amounts to calculate adjusted ebitda provides useful measures for period to period comparisons of the company s business these non gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute the company s revenue gross margin or net income loss prepared in accordance with gaap and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a gaap basis reconciliations of revenue less ancillary services adjusted gross margin and adjusted ebitda to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure are presented below flywire encourages you to review these reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non gaap financial measures for each of the periods presented in future fiscal periods flywire may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items flywire has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted adjusted ebitda to forecasted gaap net income loss or to forecasted gaap income

california has the strictest gun control laws in the nation this is pretty much indisputable people on both sides of the debate agree completely on this one thing even if they can t agree on what color the sky is advertisement san francisco is a city that is openly hostile to the second amendment doing anything it can get away with to make it impossible to exercise your right to keep and bear arms even beyond that there are federal gun control laws contrary to what many think it s not possible for a six year old to walk into the curb store and buy an ak 47 we may not have as many gun control laws as many other nations but that doesn t mean they don t exist and yet the arrest of three teens in san francisco illustrates just how every single level of infringement failed seven guns were seized from three san francisco teenagers who are members of a criminal street gang police said monday the teenagers and a 20 year old man were arrested at a home on reuel court on august 4 police said the incident began when the san francisco police department s violence reduction team arrived at the home to serve a search warrant and one suspect attempted to flee officers seized a cache of guns and ammunition glock model 21 40 caliber pistol glock model 22 40 caliber pistol glock model 27 40 caliber pistol privately made firearm 223 caliber rifle api aero precision m4 carbine 556 rifle kel tec plr 16 556 short barreled rifle rifle butt stock loaded glock large capacity magazine large capacity pistol drum magazine ammunition of various calibers advertisement further looking at the picture included with the story at least one of those glocks had a 30 round magazine now to be clear it also looks like the kel tec is actually a pistol there s no stock so it s not properly considered a short barreled rifle by the atf at this point but the rest looks pretty on point and depending on what generation those glocks are there s a chance that absolutely none of them are legal in california in other words all those gun control laws from federal to state level failed to keep a bunch of teenagers and a 20 year old man from obtaining firearms let s also remember that california made it so that you have to be 21 to buy long guns in the state so even the 20 year old is too young to lawfully obtain any of these weapons honestly the most impressive thing is how completely the gun control laws failed in this case however it s also remarkably common to see them do so despite all the regulations you can care to name criminals are going to obtain guns if teenagers can do it do you really think all that many criminals are going to get tripped up advertisement no they won t frankly this arrest illustrates the failures of the gun control laws in question but it s also not even enough to consider a drop in the bucket these aren t the only underage people running around san francisco with guns we re talking thousands of others easily gun control doesn t work not to stop crime anyway it only stops good people from being able to protect themselves but that may just be what the california and san francisco governments are going for
speaker nancy pelosi s visit to taiwan has elicited a strong response from china three days of simulated attack on taiwan with further drills announced plus a withdrawal from critical ongoing conversations with the us on climate change and the military this strong reaction was predictable president xi had earlier warned president biden not to play with fire of course if pelosi s visit hadn t gone ahead the biden administration would have faced a strong reaction from both parties in congress for not standing up to china s threat to taiwan or human rights issues regarding tibet and xinjiang not to mention hong kong so where does it leave trade between the world s two leading powers how business trumped ideology consider the not too distant past the us supported the republic of china against japan in the pacific war of 1941 45 when the chinese leadership fled to taiwan in 1949 following the victory of mao zedong s communists in the chinese civil war washington continued to recognise the exiled regime as china s legitimate government blocking the people s republic of china prc from joining the united nations this shifted in 1972 following president nixon s historic visit to china in a move to isolate the soviets the us now recognised the prc as china s sole government and accepted its one china policy it downgraded its taiwan relations to merely informal while affirming a peaceful settlement to the mainland communists claim that this was a breakaway province that had to be assimilated president richard nixon meeting chairman mao zedong in peking beijing in 1972 manhhai cc by sa this opened us china trade ending a us trade embargo in place since the 1940s economic ties proliferated in the 1980s under mao s eventual successor deng xiaoping helping the chinese economy to multiply while the us enjoyed lower consumer prices and a stronger stock market western manufacturing firms either outsourced to chinese firms or set up operations themselves they benefited from cheaper production and for those outsourcing not having to own factories or deal with labour issues in turn the chinese gained tremendous manufacturing capability as china s middle class grew wealthier the country became a major target consumer market for us firms such as apple and gm the chinese authorities insisted this was done through local partner firms transferring technology in the process and further enhancing the nation s manufacturing know how the growing chinese threat china and the us captured more than half the growth in gdp across the world from 1980 to 2020 us gdp grew nearly five times from us 4 4 trillion 3 6 trillion to us 20 9 trillion 17 3 trillion in today s money while china s grew from us 310 billion to us 14 7 trillion china is now the second largest economy although the imf world bank and cia consider it the largest once purchasing power is taken into account see chart below the us is still well ahead on per capita income us 69 231 vs us 12 359 in 2021 though china s is now that of a developed country having lifted 800 million people out of poverty in the process the us has become increasingly concerned about china s faster economic growth and the fact that the us buys much more from its rival than the other way around this drove the big decline in us domestic manufacturing that famously helped donald trump to win the us presidency chinese and us gdp based on purchasing power parity 1990 2021 world bank equally the rivalry has extended to other areas as china has sought a leading role on the world stage both nations are nuclear powers although the chinese military has only 350 nuclear warheads to america s 5 500 china has a larger navy with some 360 battle force ships compared to the us 297 although china s are mostly smaller only three aircraft carriers compared to america s 11 for example the two countries are also competing in space to bring astronauts to the moon and establish the first lunar base all this has threatened american dominance while president xi has also been much more forthright both domestically and internationally than any chinese leader since mao the us has gradually become more hostile starting with president obama s pivot towards other asian nations in 2016 and then president trump s public complaints and eventual sanctioning of china s unfair trade practices trump imposed extra tariffs on goods imported from china in 2018 and restricted china s access to various semiconductor manufacturing technologies in 2020 while the chinese responded with countermeasures along the way when president biden took office in 2021 he began highlighting long simmering complaints about human rights issues in xinjiang and the threat to taiwan while still endorsing the one china policy he also imposed sanctions on certain chinese companies of a kind not been seen since the mao era trade embargo us trade in goods to china 2011 21 note the us trade in services to china is about one tenth that of goods in 2020 the us exported us 40 billion in services to china and imported us 16 billion statista biden also banned goods from china s xinjiang region on the grounds of forced labour in 2022 affecting the purchasing of goods by many western companies china reportedly moved workers to other parts of the country to enable western companies to keep purchasing bipolarity is back covid 19 further increased the distance between the two countries after china s zero covid policy helped to disrupt supply chains and cause product shortages the biden administration began calling for reduced dependency on its rival us firms have duly been restructuring their supply chains in june apple moved some ipad production from china to vietnam albeit also because of growing demand in south east asia near shoring to mexico is gaining momentum apple manufacturers foxconn and pegatron are considering producing iphones for north america in mexico rather than china to take advantage of lower labour costs and the free trade agreement between the us and mexico two global blocs are increasingly emerging with us treasury secretary janet yellen in april calling for friend shoring with trusted partners dividing countries into friends or foes the biden administration announced at the june g7 meeting a new partnership for global infrastructure and investment aiming to mobilise us 600 billion in investments over five years this is an overture to various developing countries already being courted by china under its similar belt and road initiative days earlier china had hosted the annual brics summit which includes brazil russia india and south africa it welcomed leaders from 13 other countries algeria argentina egypt indonesia iran kazakhstan senegal uzbekistan cambodia ethiopia fiji malaysia and thailand xi urged the summit to build a global community of security based on multilateral cooperation iran and argentina have since applied to join the bloc we are already seeing what bipolarity will mean for vital components and commodities in nanochips the us is leading a chips 4 pact with japan taiwan and possible south korea to develop next generation technologies and manufacturing capacity china is investing us 1 4 trillion between 2020 and 2025 in a bid to become self reliant in this technology another big issue is cobalt which is essential for making lithium batteries for electric vehicles to secure supply from the democratic republic of the congo which produces 70 of world reserves china has navigated congolese politics lobbying powerful politicians in mining regions by 2020 chinese firms owned or had a stake in 15 of the drc s 19 cobalt producing mines as china hoards cobalt supplies the us seeks alternatives gm is developing its ultium battery cell which needs 70 less cobalt than today s batteries while oak ridge national laboratory is developing a battery that doesn t need the metal at all silver linings as us china relations have moved from building bridges in 1972 to building walls in 2022 countries will increasingly be forced to choose sides and companies will have to plan supply chains accordingly those seeking to trade in both blocs will need to divisionalise running parallel operations american companies wanting to serve chinese consumers will still need to manufacture in china or other nations within that bloc while chinese companies will need to do the same in reverse interestingly chinese companies have been rapidly buying farmland and agriculture based companies in the us and elsewhere yet though the new supply chains will almost certainly increase costs for western consumers and dampen china s growth there will be benefits supply chains should be more resilient to future crises and also more transparent while reduced transportation and reliance on chinese coal should cut carbon emissions this should help to meet the un sustainable development goals on environmental and social sustainability the cobalt and nanochips examples also show how the us china rivalry is catalysing innovation and importantly global trade will continue growing as countries depend on each other even as trade links change it will certainly take time to find an equilibrium it took years for the ussr and us to figure out how to co exist without getting into direct military conflict hillary clinton wrote in 2011 as secretary of state that there is no handbook for the evolving us china relationship and that remains the case today at any rate the businesses that thrive in this new environment will likely be those that plan for a divided world with divisional supply chains the recent taiwan row will probably not lead to direct military conflict rather it will reinforce a trend that has been gathering momentum for a decade or more
