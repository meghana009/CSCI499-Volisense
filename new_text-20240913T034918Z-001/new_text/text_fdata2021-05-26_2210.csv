the right to repair and modify the right to repair broadly refers to consumers and presumably businesses having the legal right to repair their own equipment or get non factory service agents to do so if desired or necessary p roponents argue that this right comes from the fact that they are apparently the legal owners of the equipment in question it is spurred on by the fact that many manufacturers won t sell or otherwise provide spare parts service documentation such as circuit diagrams specialised tools and the software required to service equipment consider that a manufacturer could go out of business or decide to stop servicing a particular product this would leave owners with no means to repair or modify that equipment should it become necessary and even if the manufacturer does offer service it could be limited in scope overpriced slow require long distance transport of the equipment in question etc so there are many reasons why owners of equipment could argue that they need the ability to repair it themselves or have a third party do it for them right to modify in this context refers to enhancing a device s 12 silicon chip performance or capabilities by modifying software settings alone a device might have a certain capability but it is disabled in software unless a payment is made for the additional features note that generally this equipment is out of its warranty period this is not about a manufacturer avoiding an obligation to repair equipment for whatever reason companies that are currently in the right to repair spotlight include apple and other phone and computer manufacturers for not providing spare parts to non authorised service agents tractor manufacturer john deere in the united states for not providing the software to diagnose repair or integrate new accessories into the tractor system to individual farmers or mechanics another example is companies by dr david maddison including automotive manufacturers using tamper proof fasteners on their products making them more challenging to repair fortunately though third party manufacturers now make appropriate driver bits so that this is less of a problem other ways manufacturers can restrict non factory repairs include requiring proprietary software possibly available to manufacturer representatives only for service such as requiring dealer tools to install a new starting battery in a vehicle serialising components so that replacement parts can only work if their particular serial number is programmed into the device s firmware an identical replacement part with a non matching serial will simply not work or will give an error message this was a strategy introduced by apple in their iphones even including batteries see the videos titled apple s next move in the war on repair at australia s electronics magazine siliconchip com au youtu be glvlgmjmi98 and an important message from louis rossmann at valid reasons to restrict service for fairness we should present both sides of this story manufacturers might offer some or more of the following points they wish to maintain certain performance standards and thus reputation for their equipment so they want control of the repair processes and software including updates it is arguably beyond the scope of third party technicians to diagnose and repair the complicated software used in many products today although some specialists are well qualified using hacked software or other unauthorised repair procedures might compromise the safety of a machine or cause it to operate illegally such as transmitting on an unlicensed frequency botched repairs or modifications by third parties of devices under warranty could cause extra warranty service work down the track for the manufacturer although in this case they could refuse service if they realise what happened a manufacturer repair ensures a service record is maintained for equipment maintained by them but it s questionable how important this is reasons for self repair individuals might want to repair their own equipment or have an independent repairer do it for them especially if manufacturer repairs are expensive or take too long if the item is within warranty you would typically expect the manufacturer to repair it although in our experience they don t always do so successfully there are many experienced exfactory technicians and other highlyexperienced individuals who can competently make repairs as long as they have access to the required tools and software a manufacturer might declare a part or device to be unrepairable louis rossman and jessa jones have both repaired devices that apple said were unrepairable see the following videos apple refused to fix our siliconchip com au phillips phillips ii

there is also a concern that an item becomes useless once a manufacturer stops supporting it a device could be even made useless by a forced software upgrade or a built in end of life counter those who advocate the right to repair are against such actions for example read the news article headlined apple fined for slowing down old iphones at www bbc com news technology 51413724 some examples of repairability concerns follow 1 security screws many manufacturers use screws with special heads to prevent repair fig 2 the pentalobe screw head apple first used this on the macbook pro to secure the battery in 2009 then used from 2011 on the iphone 4 source wikimedia user ruudjah2 australia s electronics magazine or modification of their products see figs 1 2 drivers to fit so called security or tamper resistant types were not always readily available when communication was much slower these were somewhat effective in preventing access to devices but with widespread access to the internet it s much easier to find suitable drivers as soon as a new security screw is released a manufacturer produces a driver for it these are typically available at low cost from ebay as well as electronics and hardware stores an early example of a tamper proof fastener was used on original macintosh computers it was impossible to remove the back without a special tool which a third party eventually made this was a combination of a long handled torx t15 driver uncommon at the time and a spudger used to pry the case apart without damaging it as a flat bladed screwdriver would another example is the pentalobe screws on an iphone these were used in an attempt to prevent non apple repairers working on the phones but appropriate drivers were soon released onto the market by third parties sometimes when a security bit is used and the screw is recessed deeply in a narrow hole a typical driver bit won t be long enough so the screw might be inaccessible june 2021 13 fig 3 an aftermarket water

devices this resulting in apple inc being fined by the federal court of australia image credit ifixit such was the case with a recent uninterruptible power supply ups i tried to disassemble 2 water resistant seals on phones after repair many independent phone repairers cannot guarantee a phone s water resistance because manufacturers will generally not sell the water seals gaskets tapes or adhesives needed to render the phone resistant to water however there are some aftermarket products available see fig 3 if you need to get your water resistant phone repaired check with the repairer whether they will guarantee a factory level of water resistance after the repair note that most phones are not fully waterproof but many now offer limited resistance to water penetration 3 apple inc and error 53 in 2018 apple inc was fined 9 million by the federal court of australia after the accc australian competition and consumer commission took them to court concerning error 53 see fig 4 this started to occur in 2016 when some iphone or ipad users had the touch id sensor replaced by a thirdparty repairer instead of apple after the replacement the phone worked correctly until the phone software was updated at which point the phone was bricked ie unable to be used apple argued that this was a security fig 5 one of the end of life messages given by epson printers the pads referred to are not serviceable in some models and not economically worthwhile for others 14 silicon chip measure as the pairing between fingerprint data stored on the sensor and similar data stored in a secure enclave would be broken leading to the phone becoming disabled apple refused to help affected users because apple did not repair the phone the claim that this was related to security is contradicted by the fact that devices would only be bricked at the time of software update which could be many months after the sensor was replaced anyone with malicious intent would have plenty of time to act and in any case the sensor replacement still required a user to know the passcode for the phone see further comments in the video below fig 6 a solution from ifixit to the epson end of life problem an

ecu encryption on the 2019 c7 corvette zr1 has been cracked by hp tuners for those for whom the stock 563kw 755 horsepower output is not enough the accc argued that consumers had a right to have the phone repaired they said the court declared that the mere fact that an iphone or ipad had been repaired by someone other than apple did not and could not result in the consumer guarantees ceasing to apply or the consumer s right to a remedy being extinguished apple eventually apologised to customers and issued a software update to fix the affected phones they also offered to reimburse customers who paid for an out of warranty replacement see the news articles at siliconchip com au link ab79 and siliconchip com au link ab7a for more details also see the video titled apple fined millions for

a popular youtube channel apple also remotely deployed a feature that slowed down ageing phones ostensibly to put less load on old batteries mentioned earlier many investigators disagreed with apple s reasoning incidentally apple will not unlock a device for a new owner of used devices the onus is on the purchaser to ensure that the previous owner has unlocked the phone so if buying a use apple device make sure that it is not locked 4 difficult to access car components i recently had to replace the side mirror on my car i discovered that it was secured with security torx screws having the central pin these screws are not accessible from the vehicle s exterior i had to remove a considerable amount of internal trim to get to them it is difficult to imagine why the manufacturer would use

implements make measurements of ground conditions such as soil moisture nitrogen levels seed placement fertiliser and pesticide usage and many other parameters this data is used to make future farming decisions this requires highly digitised farm equipment john deere s reluctance to provide service data to non authorised service centres reflects a possible concern that inappropriate adjustments to software settings might compromise such an all encompassing system julian sanchez john deere s director of emerging technology said one tweak could cascade throughout an entire software system and lead to unintended consequences on the other hand it is difficult to see how the replacement of most broken parts would upset such a software system eg see fig 9 to service their john deere products

zealand the uk the usa and canada 11 network locked phones and modems often when an internet service provider isp supplies modems routers as part of their internet package they are locked to that provider and cannot be used with others this is wasteful given that most isps do not ask for the equipment back if a customer leaves and it would usually be out of date by then anyway certain modems and phones can be unlocked for a fee for example one portable 4g device from telstra fig 12 can be unlocked with the procedure explained at siliconchip com au link ab7g similarly a phone provided as part of a plan is usually locked to that provider the phone can be sometimes unlocked once the contract has expired for a fee some services claim to unlock a locked phone but you would have to decide if these are a breach of your service agreement and they might compromise the software or firmware on your phone 12 apple s t2 chip apple s t2 security chip shown in fig 14 present in some apple

spotted that clause and won us 1000 it is not certain whether eulas legally restrict the purchaser s rights according to wikipedia s page on the subject the enforceability of an eula depends on several factors one of them being the court in which the case is heard some courts that have addressed the validity of the shrinkwrap license agreements have found some eulas to be invalid characterizing them as contracts of adhesion unconscionable and or unacceptable it goes on to say that other courts have determined that the shrinkwrap license agreement is valid and enforceable australian consumers have more rights than most worldwide so it seems likely that many clauses in the typical eula are unenforceable it s hard to say for sure until a particular clause is litigated

electronics magazine we asked our non resident serviceman dave thompson what he thought about this article and here is his response having just read dr david maddison s excellent article on the right to repair i agree 110 with all the points he makes i have long railed against those dumb anti tamper fasteners and deride any company s attempts to prevent a device from being repaired by anyone with the wherewithal to want to do it whether they succeed or not i acknowledge any company s right to protect their copyright and ip including having watertight policies regarding voiding of warranties for their products but i object to those who build in premature end of life deliberate obsolescence or otherwise impede the right to repair and i ll continue to raise my voice against those practices i come from a generation who rolled their sleeves up broke out the tools and had a go rather than being shoe horned into the often expensive and drawn out repair systems offered by many official servicing agents obviously this carries some risks though many service people with the skills to pull any given repair off will weigh this against any downsides such as voiding warranties or junking the item in question at least this is our choice my point is that deliberately nobbling a device to prevent anybody but the typically slow and money gouging repair agents to service it is very much against my principles as such i ll continue to fight for the right to repair june 2021 23 this content requires the adobe flash player get flash

phillips i look forward to working with the board and the entire organization toward delivering the breakthrough promise of its potentially transformational technology overcoming cancer and other major diseases is an absolute necessity for patients their families and health care providers and i believe we have the opportunity to expand treatment possibilities for their benefit dr phillips who is currently president and chief executive officer of orphomed inc orphomed in the united states brings decades of experience in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries where he has led commercial operations clinical medicine business strategy and development functions before joining orphomed in 2018 dr phillips worked with mallinckrodt pharmaceuticals where he had served as executive vice president and chief strategy officer since 2013 prior to that role he was head of global health healthcare industries at the world economic forum served as president of reckitt

dr phillips maintains an active medical license and practiced as a general medicine clinician officer in the u s navy from which he was honorably discharged as a lieutenant commander we are pleased to welcome dr gary phillips to the nanobiotix supervisory board at this pivotal moment for the company said nanobiotix co founder and chief executive officer laurent levy his wealth of experience within the global pharmaceutical industry will be instrumental in supporting our continued expansion as we move toward commercialization and pursue the realization of our goal to revolutionize treatment for millions of patients around the world through physics on behalf of the nanobiotix team i also offer deep gratitude to laurent condomine i have no doubt that the successes we have achieved together for patients shareholders and team members would not have been possible without his clarity of vision and steadfast leadership over the past 11 years laurent condomine joined the nanobiotix supervisory board in september 2010 after serving as the vice president of business development for astrazeneca in london where he was responsible for developing corporate strategy and delivering external growth mr condomine s tenure as chairman of the nanobiotix supervisory board coincided with several significant milestones for the company including its listing on euronext paris in 2012 the 2014 launch of the first pivotal registration study for first in class radioenhancer nbtxr3 in soft tissue sarcoma market authorization in europe of nbtxr3 hensify for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in 2019 and listing on the nasdaq global select market in 2020 many thanks to the marvelous people committed to making a difference for humanity on the nanobiotix team said laurent condomine it has been a great pleasure to help guide this company that could potentially save many lives through a novel physics based approach when i joined the company over a decade ago we were in the early stages of transforming disruptive concepts into clinical applications and i am proud of the progress we have made in bringing our technology toward broad availability for patients around the world it was particularly rewarding to publish the interim results from the company s first pivotal registration study providing proof of concept for our science and the foundational support for european market approval in soft tissue sarcoma i am leaving nanobiotix as i believe it is good corporate practice to pass the baton of supervisory board chairmanship after 10 years however the team will always have a special place in my heart and i look forward to the company s ongoing success about nbtxr3 nbtxr3 is a novel potentially first in class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy the product candidate s physical mechanism of action moa is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long term anti cancer memory given the physical moa nanobiotix believes that nbtxr3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors nbtxr3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma hnscc as the primary development pathway the company sponsored phase i dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy and a phase iii global registrational study is planned to launch in 2021 in february 2020 the united states food and drug administration granted regulatory fast track designation for the investigation of nbtxr3 activated by radiation therapy with or without cetuximab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced hnscc who are not eligible for platinum based chemotherapy the same population being evaluated in the planned phase iii study nanobiotix has also prioritized an immuno oncology development program beginning with a company sponsored phase i clinical study evaluating nbtxr3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent metastatic hnscc and lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti pd 1 therapy given the company s focus areas and balanced against the scalable potential of nbtxr3 nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways pursuant to this strategy in 2019 nanobiotix entered into a broad comprehensive clinical research collaboration with the university of texas md anderson cancer center to sponsor several phase i and phase ii studies to evaluate nbtxr3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations

350 million in profits quickly becoming the world s top cryptocurrency exchange in march this year amid the cftc s investigation changpeng zhao responded that the company strictly adheres to u s

corrupt otc brokers and called them rogue 100 70 of the otc brokers in the rogue 100 are in the group of huobi accounts receiving bitcoin from illicit sources we think it s extremely likely that some percentage of the other highly active binance and huobi accounts taking in illicit funds also belong to corrupt otc brokers we ve yet to identify the report said otc transactions are considered the most likely means of cryptocurrency trading to be used to launder money or transfer property across borders the report said that while it s difficult to estimate what percentage of all cryptocurrency was sent from criminal wallets to otc brokers its analysis shows that otc brokers who carry out a significant percentage of all bitcoin transactions were receiving illicit funds and behaving in ways that suggest a desire to hide the nature of their transactions the report said that otc brokers typically have much lower kyc requirements than the exchanges they operate on many of them take advantage of this laxity and help criminals launder and cash out funds usually first by exchanging bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into tether as a stable intermediary currency before they presumably cash out into fiat kaiko an institutional grade digital assets market data provider estimates that otc trading can contribute to the majority of all cryptocurrency trading volume as of may

after very promising results on their first well in namibia s giant kavango basin global attention has turned to this small canadian explorer as it drills its second well in a basin estimated by a world renowned geochemist to potentially hold up to 120 billion barrels in an interview with oilprice com s james stafford steinke the founder and president of reconnaissance energy africa recon africa tsx v reco otcmkts recaf discusses why reco s first drill has garnered international attention after the 3 well drilling program and 450 km 2d seismic program reco expects to have cash of over 50 million what s in store for reco s second drill why excitement is building over the recent dewolf research report how much oil is potentially on the line what s next for the world s most exciting junior explorer how investors have reacted to this exciting oil play could namibia become the next potential global oil hotspot how reco plans to give back to the community and environment james stafford can you give me an update on how things are with reco in namibia craig steinke well james thanks as you know recon africa has been invited by the namibian government to help them generate indigenous sources of energy and we have committed to drilling 3 wells in the kavango basin to establish whether there is an active petroleum system or not so the company is now honoring that commitment it has drilled its first successful well and is now drilling a second well james stafford can you tell me about the licenses do you need a second license to drill more wells craig steinke well we are in the exploratory stage of the petroleum license and we have committed to drilling an initial three wells while drilling in the exploration phase of the license should reconafrica and the namibian government deem the results commercial that s when we are entitled to move into a 25 year production sharing contract james stafford you recently did a raise what was your thinking behind this and how much cash will you be sitting on after it closes and after the warrants craig steinke we raised money at 70 cents per unit in august 2020 and that set up the drilling program after drilling the first well we were very pleasantly surprised that we had proved there was an active conventional petroleum system of light oil and high btu gas in the first well it was more than we expected and as a result the government and reco disseminated a joint release on this success naturally the share price had a significant move upward and we were offered 25 million in a bought deal arrangement at 9 50 per unit we thought it was wise to take it the orders were so overwhelming that haywood securities the investment bank that offered us the bought deal asked us to upsize it to 36 million so we did we thought it was a smart move because it puts reco in a much stronger position once we drill the three wells and shoot the 2d seismic program which comprises 450 km if results are what we anticipate then we plan to enter into jv negotiations having additional cash in the treasury when you are conducting jv negotiations puts the company in a much stronger position because you can go and develop the play if you aren t happy with what s being offered james stafford after the three well program and 2d seismic how much cash should you have left over craig steinke we should have well over 50 million remaining in the treasury james stafford and when do you think all of the results will be back craig steinke we are drilling the second well currently and should commence the seismic by the middle of june by september we should have finished the 3rd well and the seismic james stafford and what happens then you ll have drilled 3 wells completed 450km of 2d seismic and will have 50 million cash sitting in the bank craig steinke we are looking for conventional traps this basin has seen a lot of faulting which should give rise to conventional reservoirs so after the 450 km seismic we expect to be conducting more 2d seismic we have established a basin we just need to find the most opportune areas to drill for the next round of drilling and that will be determined by the 2d seismic in conjunction with additional seismic we expect to be conducting jv negotiations james stafford what about another rig craig steinke we get asked that a lot and it is a possibility but the next step is to do the 2d seismic to accurately identify drilling locations any decisions on additional rigs will happen then we expect we will need more will we buy 1 or 2 perhaps but there is a good chance we won t and will leave it up to jv partners james stafford i recently read the dewolf report that just came out with great interest in his report he states the following every 1 billion barrels recoverable at a pv 10 of c10 per barrel which is very conservative adds 10 cdn billion to reco s enterprise value or 9 x the current market capitalization or by 72 cdn per share now with dan jarvies estimate that the basin could have generated north of 120 billion barrels these numbers are astonishing what are your thoughts on what dewolf has just put out craig steinke yes i just read the report there s no question the pv 10 of 1 billion bbls recoverable has a lot of value also dewolf does a great job in providing historical data on just how indicative success with the first well is on the success rate of wells to follow similarly reconafrica believes the success on its first well 6 2 the discovery well reflects very positively on the success rate of our next two wells we have much to look forward to james stafford can you tell us about the roe purchase why did it happen so quickly and what do you think you ve got there craig steinke roe holds an option to acquire a 50 working interest in the botswana lands that comprises 2 2 million acres and those are 100 lands long term licenses very good lands it was the results of the first well that reco drilled where management just felt that this was indicative of what the basin held we hit on the first well so that s either very lucky or the success of the first well is indicative of what the rest of the basin holds management is confident it is the later as a result reco definitely wanted the botswana lands and it was the right time to move no question it was the smartest thing to do james stafford tell us about this first well what do you think you ve got and when can we expect more results on it craig steinke with the first well as conveyed in the news release we drilled into some sedimentary rocks and then deeper down we drilled into carbonates both looked very opportune because we saw high btu gas and light oil in the sedimentary rock and then the same in the carbonates and it comprised 660 feet or 200 meters of light oil and high btu gas the carbonates specifically more than half of the world s oil comes from carbonate rock this is very prolific reservoir and source rock the middle east is pretty much all carbonates we have had some very positive comments after looking at the logs schlumberger ran for us and albeit early stage we think they could be prolific reservoirs james stafford so 660 feet of showing what does that mean do you need to frac the rock to get it out craig steinke these three wells are not designed to be producers can we produce them that s a possibility but with regards to completing the carbonates they look like carbonate rocks we have seen in northern africa where basically conventional completion methods will make them productive no fracking james stafford what do you hope to achieve in well 2 well 1 was incredible now that you have tasted success what are you expecting craig steinke we have high quality aeromagnetic data which allowed us to identify some structures and holes in the basin the first well was designed to drill into the side of a structure to prove there was an active conventional petroleum system and we did just that we proved there is light oil and high btu gas by way of a structure a faulted circumstance but the second well is designed to drill into a lesser disturbed lesser faulted area where we should be able to drill through the entire petroleum system so if you couple the two wells together the importance is that it should give us a good representation of the entire basin and what it has to offer james stafford if the project works out what would this mean to the people of namibia craig steinke this will be transformational for namibia namibia suffers from severe energy poverty their main goal in vision 2030 is to industrialize their country and pull their people out of poverty you have to remember they don t have a significant amount of indigenous energy for example namibia imports 60 of their electricity from south africa so how can they industrialize their country if you have to import energy to establish industries but at higher costs then how do you compete you can t james stafford and i suppose a successful project of the magnitude we are looking at could increase the standard of living as a whole craig steinke the entire country could be transformed particularly the 250 000 people of the kavango region over 40 of the local people live in generational poverty this will provide the local citizens with good paying jobs upwardly mobile jobs that will help pull them out of poverty provide access to fresh water and basic medical services one of the glaring problems in the region is the local population don t have the wherewithal to drill water wells but there is a fresh water aquifer right under their feet they have to walk up to 10 km per day with 45 lbs of water on their heads reco recognized this problem before christmas as soon as we landed the rig in conjunction with the local water authorities we started drilling water wells for the local community we now have four community water wells operational and are permitting six new wells reco is already employing approximately 300 people in namibia and over half of that in the kavango region where they need the jobs the most james stafford how have you found the ease of doing business in namibia and how is the government to work with craig steinke one of the reasons we are operating in namibia is because there is a very supportive government we work with four separate ministries there is a lot of oversight on reco and strong environmental laws in their constitution there is strong support from the local governors who are charged with providing their citizens with jobs access to fresh water and medical services and there is significant support from the local people james stafford there have been a number of articles in environmental journals that expressed concern about drilling for oil in kavango how are you ensuring the environment is protected craig steinke part of our commitment to the government is to prove there is a conventional petroleum system in the basin but beyond that we are committed to sharing oil and gas technology and good oilfield practices that have developed over decades in western canada there really is very little risk to the environment the seismic equipment we are using owned and operated by polaris natural resources inc in canada is the lightest impact seismic equipment in the world it is a mercedes benz tractor that is 9 feet wide and drives soundwaves into the ground which are received by wireless geophones the size of your cellphones this tractor just purrs along the surface at a low rpm or an idle everything is wireless the lightest impact worldwide it is their 10th or 11th program they have conducted in africa all of which have been very successful james stafford how about the drilling itself you had to use drilling fluids and you had to clear the site do you think there is any long term impact from the drilling of well one craig steinke we are only on that location for a few months then we reclaim the land and it is back to normal we are employing the most advanced drilling fluid in the industry a polymer water based drilling fluid it is a plant oil that we use in conjunction with water it is benign 100 organic and biodegradable and when we move from well to well we will take that with us because it is so expensive it s the best in the world it is being used as a soil enricher or fertilizer in the us as well as other parts of the world proximal to the first well we are doing a pilot project with local residents where we are cultivating a large area seeding it to vegetables and fertilizing with the organic drilling fluid james stafford so when you move on the land will be reclaimed and cultivated and there will be no pollution craig steinke that s right and furthermore with regards to the environment it is hard to understand if you have never been to kavango but due to generational poverty bush meat is high on the list of people s priorities no surprise consequently the wildlife has been overhunted because people have no other options worse poachers prey upon people with few options reco has assembled a wildlife team led by a former namibian ranger to better assess the situation we believe that bringing prosperity to the area will alleviate the pressure on the wildlife james stafford can you give me 5 reasons to buy reco stock this week craig steinke in my opinion the reco namibia drilling program is the most widely watched highest impact onshore drilling program in the world one reason for that is this is a small canadian company that managed to license the entire basin there is nothing out there like it we have already had success on the first well we were drilling into an abyss we didn t know what we were drilling into and the results went well beyond our expectations 660 feet of light oil and high btu gas in sedimentary and carbonate rocks we are drilling the second well right now and we think that either the first well was a lucky hit or it is indicative of the results of the wells to come that makes the second well extremely important we have strong support from the government and local community which is essential in my opinion the price of oil is going up in the medium term due to the energy transition investors are focused on short cycle assets if we are successful we believe we could be trucking and shipping oil as soon as late 2022 james stafford does that producing require additional licenses or is that covered craig steinke if we deem the play commercial in conjunction with the government then we are entitled to a production license but we have to move into that phase james stafford is there any risk there craig steinke i don t see a lot of risks namibia needs this source of indigenous energy it is the right thing to do to help pull the namibian people out of poverty james stafford if you do start producing could you do it on your own or would you need partners craig steinke we anticipate that we will be looking for quality partners to help the namibian government and reco produce and develop the basin in an environmentally and economically sustainable way james stafford when i last spoke to geologist dan jarvie he said his assessment suggests the kavango basin has generated up to 120 billion barrels of oil equivalent on just 12 of the land what does he think now craig steinke his estimation was that the basin holds approximately 120 billion barrels or that it has generated up to that that hasn t changed and we see no reason why that won t be the case based on successful drilling results it is still very preliminary but it just supports his estimations so yes dan is very happy these days james stafford thanks for your time craig you can find out more about reconnaissance energy africa at the following links tsx v reco otcmkts recaf for readers interested in other oil companies that are engaged in drilling new fields please see below other companies to watch that are drilling new major fields chevron nyse cvx holds the spot of the second largest oil company on the nyse chevron is also betting big on africa particularly nigeria and angola the supermajor ranks among the top oil producers in the two african nations other areas on the continent where the company holds interests include benin ghana the republic of congo and togo chevron also holds a 36 7 percent interest in the west african gas pipeline company limited which supplies nigerian natural gas to customers in the region though its assets are spread out across the region it s all strategic with bets on both oil and natural gas the company is looking to take advantage of both fossil fuels though prices are still depressed at the moment as fuel demand returns to normal chevron could be a big winner as prices climb back up to pre pandemic levels though chevron still has not bounced back from the massive hit it took back in march 2020 where it dropped to a 5 year low of just 59 the oil giant has made some progress thanks to recovering oil prices sitting at 104 at the time of writing chevron is slowly recuperating some of its losses and is positioned well to benefit in the mid to long term royal dutch shell nyse rds a is the third largest new york listed company coming in just under chevron and similar to chevron shell has also made some big bets in africa in fact it is one of the leaders in the region the dutch oil giant began drilling in the region over 70 years ago and now has energy assets in over 20 countries across the continent though it has sold off a number of its prized plays in the region in recent years it continues to maintain a strong presence especially in south africa south africa is key for shell because the government has been significantly more stable than some of the other big bets on the continent moreover the country has been very open to shell in its projects the company s operations in south africa include retail and commercial fuel lubricant chemical and manufacturing it s also heavily invested in upstream exploration it even holds the exploration rights to the orange basin deep water area off the country s west coast and has applications for shale gas exploration rights in the karoo in central south africa as the largest pure upstream company conocophillips company nyse cop has performed relatively well in this depressed market generating ample free cash flow and returning a good chunk of it to shareholders unlike many of its peers who continued to expand aggressively during the shale boom cop has taken several steps to lower costs and fortify its balance sheet leading to one of the best cash positions in the oil patch conocophillips has been gradually offloading non core assets including the sale of its north sea oil and gas assets for 2 7b and the planned sale of its australian assets for 1 4b its asset portfolio however remains healthy conoco has been particularly bullish on oil demand outlook in 2021 and it was one of the few companies which did not partake in the mass layoffs seen in the industry last year in addition conoco has also seen a fairly decent about of insiders buying into its stock which is a good sign growing demand for the sweet crude oil grades produced by brazil s pre salt oilfields sees petrobras nyse pbr focused on developing its pre salt operations brazil s national oil company has budgeted capital spending for exploration and production activities of 46 5 billion from 2021 to 2025 those upstream projects being approved for development must have a breakeven price of 35 per brent or less clearly while the pandemic has hit brazil s oil industry causing production to fall because of savage budget cuts and well shut ins it appears to have done no material long term damage demand for petrobras low sulfur content fuel is firm and will grow because of the global push to significantly reduce sulfur emissions for these reasons brazil s oil production will grow significantly with petrobras which for october was responsible for 73 of the country s oil output targeting oil production of 2 7 million barrels daily by 2025 major north american pipeline operator kinder morgan nyse kmi has been particularly upbeat in recent months in fact in early december it issued optimistic updates planning higher dividends and expecting more profits in 2021 after the challenges the oil industry has faced this year the company expects us 1 2 billion in net profit for 2021 after a slim us 100 million net income expected for 2020 the small 2020 net profit will be due to hefty impairments the pipeline operator has made throughout the year kinder morgan also expects to raise its dividend for 2021 by 3 percent compared to this year the company expects the board to declare a q4 dividend of us 0 2625 per share or us 1 05 annualized the board expects the 2021 dividend to be us 1 08 per share annualized or a 3 percent increase from the 2020 dividend with budgeted excess coverage of that dividend we expect also to be able to engage in share repurchases on an opportunistic basis kinder morgan inc s chief executive officer steve kean said enbridge nyse enb tsx enb is in a unique position as oil and gas stages its 2021 comeback as one of the more potentially undervalued companies in the sector it could be set to win big this year but that s only if it can overcome some of the challenges in its path most specifically its line 3 project has faced scrutiny from environmentalists the 2 6 billion project plans to replace enbridge s existing 282 miles of 34 inch pipeline with 337 miles of 36 inch pipe the new line 3 would have the capacity to move 370 000 barrels of oil per day alleviating the takeaway capacity constraints that canadian oil producers have been struggling with for years now line 3 is one of two pipeline projects in the works that are in their unfinished state keeping canada s oil industry from reaching its potential while this challenge may prove difficult for enbridge to overcome the health of the canadian oil industry is improving and with it the outlook for canadian producers such as enbridge the company has already started the year off strong and if it can continue its momentum it will likely be able to see a sustained rally in its share price over the course of the year while canada s oil sector was one of the hardest hit by the oil price crisis canadian natural resources nyse cnq tsx cnq kept its dividend intact after swinging to a loss for the first half of the year while canada s producers are scaling back production by around 1 million bpd amid low oil prices and demand though canadian natural resources kept its dividend it withdrew its production guidance for 2020 however it also said it would curtail some production at high cost conventional projects in north america and oil sands operations and carry out planned turnaround activities at oil sands projects in the second half of 2020 despite the negative stigma surrounding the oil sands the sector is starting to clean up its act a bit and canadian natural resources is leading the charge and if analysts are right about canada s comeback canadian natural resources could be in for a big year though the canadian energy giant has seen its stock price slump this year it could provide a potential opportunity for investors as oil prices rebound it is already up over 170 from its march lows and it could still have some more room to run tc energy corporation nyse trp tsx trp is a major oil and energy company based in calgary canada the company owns and operates energy infrastructure throughout north america tc energy is one of the continent s largest providers of gas storage and owns and has interests in approximately 11 800 megawatts of power generation it s also one of the continent s most important pipeline operators with tc energy s massive influence throughout north america it is no wonder that the company is among one of canada s highest valued energy companies one of tc energy s biggest struggles in recent years was grappling with the particularly difficult approval process for its keystone pipeline but that s all history now and with the bounce back in oil and gas demand tc energy could stand to benefit while tc energy s stock price has yet to recover from pre pandemic levels it is one of the few industry giants which has managed to keep high dividends rolling in with quarterly payouts exceeding 6 tc has kept investors on board and its share price from falling too far as one of the biggest names in energy suncor energy tsx su has

the pandemic prompted her to finally make those dough filled dreams of starting her own bagel bakery a reality it was the kick in the pants that i needed says the 26 year old chef and owner of salt and sunshine bagels bouchard grew up in a food loving family and has been cooking since she was 15 years old she enrolled in the culinary arts program at winnipeg technical college now the manitoba institute of trades and technology in high school and went on to graduate from red river college where she won a culinary exchange scholarship to study in france after school she worked at marion street eatery before landing a job in the kitchen at passero where she s been for three years mikaela mackenzie winnipeg free press carter bouchard owner of salt and sunshine bagels rents kitchen space at the irish association on erin street like everyone in the restaurant industry bouchard s work hours dried up under the public health restrictions she needed extra cash and she wanted to keep working with food bagels were the answer i ve actually been thinking about this for four years now she says before i was like no i ve gotta find somewhere that s going to teach me and show me how to do it and then once the pandemic hit i was like you know what i ve just gotta figure this out on my own bouchard was so adamant about having an authentic bagel making internship in fact that she travelled to new york a few years ago to find a bakery owner who would take her under their wing although her plans of staging doing unpaid kitchen work didn t quite pan out mikaela mackenzie winnipeg free press bouchard started her bagel bakery on instagram during the pandemic they seemed to not really be into that whole free labour thing she says with a laugh it was fine though i ate so many bagels while i was there and just kind of got an idea of the style i wanted she prefers a big bagel with a fluffy interior and decent amount of chewiness if the bagel doesn t bite back then it s not my kind of bagel bouchard has fond childhood memories of visiting the great canadian bagel a bagel café chain popular in the 90s with former franchises in winnipeg with her parents chocolate chip devoured in the car before they made it home was a favourite mikaela mackenzie winnipeg free press bouchard whips up a batch of sesame bagels before she started selling to the public as salt and sunshine bouchard tested her products on family and friends it was during the tinkering process when she landed accidentally on a feature that makes her bagels stand out from the crowd i m such a perfectionist so i was rolling them out the traditional way with the hole and i didn t like the way they looked she says i was like i m not going to put a hole who says i have to so i didn t bouchard doesn t see hole less or whole as she calls them bagels as an affront to the tradition but rather as an opportunity to give customers more surface area for spreads and a better base for bagel sandwiches mikaela mackenzie winnipeg free press bouchard prefers a big bagel with a fluffy interior and decent amount of chewiness if the bagel doesn t bite back then it s not my kind of bagel salt and sunshine lives online and in the small rented kitchen at the irish association of manitoba on erin street where bouchard spends two and a half days each week mixing resting boiling and baking more than 300 bagels for hungry customers a friend from culinary school helps out with the physically demanding rolling process i would not be able to roll out 300 bagels by myself she says our biceps are pretty jacked not gonna lie customers can order online at saltandsunshinebagels ca for pickup on thursdays bouchard stocks three standard flavours sesame sea salt everything and chocolate chip each week as well as a rotating specialty bagel coming up with new variations such as lemon poppy seed and salted rosemary honey keeps the job interesting mikaela mackenzie winnipeg free press bouchard stocks three standard flavours sesame sea salt everything and chocolate chip that s kind of like a creative outlet for me she says i just want to really do my best to try and spice things up a little bit and put my own flair on it and my own skill set that i ve learned from other places bouchard also makes a variety of flavoured whipped brown butter and labneh spreads to pair with her bagels social media particularly instagram has been a boon for her business which one day she d like to turn into a full time gig and a brick and mortar shop until then she s excited to be part of the wave of new online food businesses popping up during the pandemic i think it s awesome it s like a new era of cooking she says of the trend for me it s a nice stepping stone instead of jumping straight

similar level to 2021 c4isr at 23 of sales increased year over year primarily due to uas sales to asia pacific electro optics accounted for 9 of total sales and declined year over year mainly due to the phasing of elbit night vision programs in the u s other sales were 4 5 of revenues and increased significantly year over year due to growth at our u s medical device subsidiary our diverse geographic revenue base is important to the long term sustainability of our business in the first quarter north america was the largest contributing 31 of our revenues israel was 25 asia pacific 21 and europe 17 the growth in israel was due primarily to uas and security systems and asia pacific sales increased mainly due to sales of uas and precision guided munitions the decline in north america

first quarter of 2021 was 25 2 of revenues compared with 27 in the first quarter of 2020 lower gross margin in the first quarter reflect the impact of a stronger shekel versus the u s dollar relative

in the first quarter compared with 4 5 million in 2020 the lower level of financial expenses was mainly a result of weakening of the israeli shekel versus the u s dollar between december 2020 and

approximately 11 8 billion 1 billion higher than the backlog at the end of march 2020 and 770 million higher than that at the end of 2020 approximately 59 of the current backlog is scheduled to be performed during 2021 and 2022 and the rest is scheduled for 2023 and beyond this ratio is similar to that at the first quarter last year the order backlog is equivalent to more than two years of revenues and provides good visibility for future revenues cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter was 13 million outflow compared with 10 million outflow in the same quarter last year cash flow from investing activities included a 61 million deferred payment for the imi acquired in 2018 the board of directors declared a dividend of 0 44 per share for the first quarter of 2021 i will now turn the call over to mr machlis butzi please bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer thank you yossi before i begin a review of the results i would like to thank the thousands of employees of elbit systems and all the suppliers in israel that have worked tirelessly to support our customers in israel and around the world during an extremely challenging period turning back to the first quarter i am pleased with the growth in the order backlog that includes many of the contracts we discussed at our fourth quarter results and our investor day in april revenue and backlog growth in the quarter provide a good indication of the strong demand from our customers around the world elevated geopolitical tensions in europe and asia pacific have contributed to this demand many governments around the world are increasing defense spending to mitigate the impact of the covid 19 pandemic and prefer to spend the increased defense budgets domestically elbit systems is well positioned to benefit from this trend due our multi domestic strategy and subsidiaries in dozens of countries in april we were awarded a 1 65 billion 20 year contract from the hellenic ministry of national defense to establish and operate the international flight training center of the hellenic air force this follows the selection announced in january after an international competitive tender the contract is part of an agreement between the defense ministries of israel and greece under the contract elbit systems will supply new leonardo m 346 aircrafts and will maintain the international training fleets comprised of dozens of m 346 and t 6 aircrafts we will also provide our embedded virtual avionics or eva onboard the training aircraft networked flight simulators and ground based training stations as well as a command and control system to enable efficient management of the flight training operation we believe that militaries around the world are keen to expand the simulator and training capabilities to provide more realistic training that better prepare the soldiers for a wide range of scenarios at a lower cost elbit systems has developed a broad portfolio of market leading training and simulations solutions and over the last year we have been awarded 20 contracts in israel the uk and in asia pacific in april elbit night vision in the u s received a 40 million 41 million contract from the u s marine corp for squad binocular night vision goggle or sbnvg systems this was part of the 249 million idiq contract from september 2019 sb s night vision acquired in 2019 is the single sole supplier of sbnvg systems to the u s marine corp in march elbit systems deutschland was selected to provide xact nv33 night vision goggles for the special forces and special operation units of the german federal police this kind of night vision goggles are already in service with the german armed forces i am optimistic about the potential to generate synergies between our legacy thermal imaging night vision portfolio and the image intensifier night vision business over the coming years this is clearly the future of advanced systems for night operations and elbit systems is well positioned to benefit from the demand for integrated night vision systems in april we completed two acquisitions sparton corporation and rokar our u s subsidiary elbit systems of america completed the acquisition of sparton corporation from cerberus capital management for 380 million sparton develops and supplies electronic sensors that support undersea warfare for the u s navy and allied military forces sparton is one of two suppliers for sonobuoys to the us navy sparton will expand and enhance elbit systems portfolio of maritime capabilities and integrated solution that includes maritime unmanned systems communication combat management and weapon system as well as sonars and maritime electronic warfare solutions in april we also completed the acquisition of rokar international from bea systems for 31 million rokar is based in jerusalem and develops and manufactures high end gps receivers and guidance systems for advanced defense applications i would like to welcome the hundreds sparton and rokar employees to elbit systems i look forward to getting to know you and your contribution to the long term success of elbit systems in summary our backlog continues to provide us with good visibility and we continue to see significant potential around the world for our leading high technology solution and with that i will be happy to take your questions operator questions and answers operator thank you the first question is from ellen page of jefferies please go ahead ellen page jefferies analyst good morning thanks for the question just wanted to ask about the organic decline in electro optics it was weak in h2 20 as well and i just wanted to get a sense of when growth might return in that business and how to think about the conversion of the recent 41 million night vision contract with the u s marine corps joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer well we have seen a temporary delay in some of the development processes at elbit night vision this has been already solved and we expect to see the results of that in the revenues of the second quarter and on so that is regarding your first question the second question is just an ongoing multi year program with over 250 million potential and we are getting sequential purchase orders we record in our backlog only the firm funded purchase orders although in the idiq program we are quite certain that all of that will be will come through during the future ellen page jefferies analyst okay thank you that s it for me joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer thanks ellen operator the next question is from pete skibitski of alembic global please go ahead pete skibitski alembic global advisors llc analyst yes hello butzi and yossi and rami and good afternoon i hope everyone is doing well joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer thank you pete pete skibitski alembic global advisors llc analyst butzi it sounds like the global demand environment is very strong right now you mentioned europe and asia pacific was just wondering if covid is still sort of slowing things down at all particularly with india being sort of a covid hotspot are you seeing any problems closing deals because of covid still bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer we see an improvement in the overall situation which is related to covid all around the world we are starting to travel and to meet customers however in some countries like in india and in brazil for example it is still difficult to meet customers and because of that there are still some delays to deliver programs and to conclude contracts however i believe that the situation is improving and in the coming quarters we will continue to do business as we used to do in the past and the situation in these countries will improve as well so we are not yet it is not it is impacting us but we certainly see an improvement and i believe and i hope that it will improve in the coming quarters pete skibitski alembic global advisors llc analyst okay understood understood and then any color on what drove the sequential improvement in backlog it looked to be up nicely i wasn t sure if the greek deal got booked in the first quarter or if that won t get booked into the second quarter bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer the greek the 1 6 billion contract we got from the greece ministry of defense is not yet in the backlog of the first quarter we got it only in april so you will see it as part of the result of the second quarter it is the same answer is also relevant for the two acquisitions we made the sparton as well as the rokar acquisition the results of these subsidiaries are not yet included as well in the first in the results of the first quarter you will see them embedded in the results of the second quarter pete skibitski alembic global advisors llc analyst okay so first quarter which is pure organic backlog growth ok bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer right right pete skibitski alembic global advisors llc analyst okay and then on the headwinds to gross margin from the shekel strength should we expect maybe another one or two quarters of headwind there before things kind of level out what s the right way to think about that joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer hi pete we expect this over the year over the rest of the year to improve our gross margins gradually we expect to have an improved number in the second quarter as you know we do not give guidance so we ll not say anything about the specific number but the improvement will come pete skibitski alembic global advisors llc analyst okay got it i guess yossi just a couple more for you the decline in marketing expenses this quarter was fairly substantial for that particular line was that just kind of a one off spending save there or do you expect that spend to return to kind of that 70 million or so per quarter level or is that more of a permanent kind of a step down in expense for the marketing line joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer no this quarter it was an extraordinarily low number low travel low marketing expenses essentially no meetings face to face and no shows and so on and so forth so looking forward we see that we will catch up on this in the second third and fourth quarter gradually grow over the year and essentially i would not be surprised if we come back to the average levels of the 2019 numbers that we have seen in marketing and sales pete skibitski alembic global advisors llc analyst okay ok got it and then just last one from me on the imi payment that you mentioned in the quarter is that the last payment for imi i had actually modeled a payment in 2022 so i wasn t sure if you had one more left or not joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer yes this payment that you see that we did it in january we paid it on january initially it was planned to be paid in december so it moved a couple of days into this year and the next payment will be toward the end of 2022 it may move also into 2023 but right now it s planned for the end of 2022 pete skibitski alembic global advisors llc analyst okay and that s the last one joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer and that is yes it is the last one pete skibitski alembic global advisors llc analyst okay joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer there is one item there in our agreement with them that if we have an extraordinary business performance by imi due until the period of 2026 we might need to do another small payment to the government right now we hope we ll be doing it in the future but right now it is in the out years pete skibitski alembic global advisors llc analyst okay okay understood thanks so much for the help guys joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator the next question is from dina korshunov of leader capital markets please go ahead dina korshunov leader capital markets analyst hey guys good afternoon how are you bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer good afternoon dina dina korshunov leader capital markets analyst i have two questions my first question is if you can tell us a bit about the civil aviation regarding the covid 19 do you see any recovery in this field joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer yeah well the worldwide expectations and plan right now is that the recovery will be gradual and will come back to the levels of 2019 somewhere in 2024 and that is overall opinion of most of the analysts of that business area in our operation in the u s we do see some recovery it is not yet at the rate that shows us significant growth however we do see positive numbers compared with what happened during 2020 but we are still planning our multi year plan is to be like what the overall expectations are to come back or maybe even grow more than 2019 levels by 2023 or 2024 dina korshunov leader capital markets analyst i understand thank you and then the second question can you tell a bit about imi implementation what about it where does it stand bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer organization hi dina we combined as you know we combined imi with the land division in elbit so in this division we are producing platforms like howitzers and mortars and upgrading tanks and we are also developing and delivering guided munitions recently we announced reorganization in elbit and under this reorganization actually we are combining all our guidance capabilities under this new land division so i m quite convinced that this new division will be a world leader to provide fire support solutions and platform upgrades for many customers around the globe when we acquired imi most of their activities were in israel and i m happy to say that last year more than 50 of the new business came from the international market and we did it via the elbit marketing capabilities and via our subsidiaries and we have and i m also happy to say that we have nice contracts for active protection systems here in israel as well as in the netherlands and we are also progressing in the u s and the australia market as well with this system and we see a growing demand for the new portfolio which we have and we re also working hard on the margins to improve the margins of imi and we are progressing accordingly and we are even ahead of the plan we had when we did the acquisition and we re also progressing in the new facilities for imi that we re establishing in the south part of the country and right now we are planning to move imi to a big part of imi to these facilities around 2024 dina korshunov leader capital markets analyst all right i understand thank you very much guys bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer thank you joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer thank you dina operator the next question is from ella fried of bank leumi please go ahead ella fried bank leumi analyst hey good afternoon i have also a couple of questions the first is what immediate or long term impact if any are you seeing from the recent operation in gaza and the results on the local scene and maybe results concerning potential exports and will it affect in some way to think when bookings from local and foreign customers bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer as you know israel customers idf is a very important customer to elbit and we are working with idf to develop and to deliver new systems for many years and of course we supported our troops during the in gaza i m happy to say that the solution that we provided was relevant and effective and we continue to develop new technologies and new systems to the israeli customer and based on the experience we gathered here to deliver these solutions also to other customers if i just to touch one area which is very relevant and even more relevant than ever is the high power laser that we are developing for the israeli mod high power laser we are the world leader in this technology there is a breakthrough in the technology so we believe that we can provide a solution to protect israel as well as our other customers against missiles and rockets or via a high power laser we have been the israeli mod have chosen us to develop this system and we are working hard to do so and it will for sure will be a growth engine for elbit in the future and i believe it will change also the way israel defends itself as well as it can be relevant also for other customers as well but this is only just one example ella fried bank leumi analyst i have a question if you don t mind i know that the army is very much waiting for this high power laser when do you think i mean roughly it will become operational is it about two years three years or is there any deadline bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer no this is more or less the timeline we are actually waiting for the defense budget for the israel defense budget to continue the development and the production i hope that this budget will be formed soon and i believe that everyone is convinced right now that there is a need to find a way to finance this program and to bring this to the field as soon as possible to answer your question it will take few years until the development will be completed ella fried bank leumi analyst in a few years you mean more than two there is no besides the deadline okay and i have another question actually more on price surroundings and i really would like to learn from your experience because as we all know here locally in israel the israeli shekel strength is hurting most exporters in israel but not only in israel the weakening of dollar is actually affecting many other exporters in dollar so from your experience and also there s some inflation expected in the next two years quite prominent inflation whereas what we had in u s in your experience can the prices in such surroundings be adjusted for all these currency exchange influences or you think that they very much remain steady dollar dominated because i think it s very important for forecasting many companies who are not operating in the u s joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer hi ella this is yossi ella fried bank leumi analyst hi yossi good to hear you joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i would give you two aspects of that answer one is on contracts that we have in quite a lot of them we have elements of indexing so that they do protect us maybe not a 100 but quite significantly material protection against inflation ella fried bank leumi analyst relating dollar index or specific inflation joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer it depends on the customer and on the currency ella fried bank leumi analyst okay joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer so it varies of course so that is regarding what we call the backlog of orders ella fried bank leumi analyst okay joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer regarding future contracts we do take into consideration when we price our proposals we do take into consideration expected inflation rates and expected internal labor rates which are dependent on the expected local currency versus the dollar value so to some extent we do mitigate through that future medium and longer term impact in parallel with that of course we do every effort possible in order to reduce our cost base and in order to improve our competitiveness on one hand and our profitability on the other hand these processes take some time i did mention in the past the implementation of the one erp system that we do implement worldwide in our subsidiaries we do look at additional aspects that we have initiated in order to move some of the production activities and even some of the engineering activities to low cost countries so in that way we do mitigate our costs the increase in the cost basis of the company so all this is going on these are multi year plans the company executes them and we are optimistic that we will be able to mitigate the impact of the currency exchange rate ella fried bank leumi analyst well first it s good to hear that many aspects are protected because the exchange rate changes were quite dramatic as we know here and on the other hand do think we ll see also the time you re collecting payments from your customers becoming shorter or because you mentioned as far as one of the companies with the longer collecting time so or you will still use it as a marketing tool joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer no i think we did complete that s the strategic cycle that you referred to about using the payment terms as marketing tool we stopped that actually or significantly reduced that last year already ella fried bank leumi analyst and then came corona joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer and then came corona that s right but one of our major customers the ministry of defense here in israel did pay nicely toward the end of last year they continue to pay although there is still a material debt that they have not completed yet the payment of looking for the upcoming budget that is going to be approved somewhere this year hopefully and then this will be resolved as well in other places worldwide we are in a process of reducing as we just said reducing the terms of that we what we give our customers of payment and actually if you have looked at our recent two or three quarters we and you look at the number of the customer advances in our contracts you can see a constant increase in the advances and that is part as a result of the change of policy that we have here in putting more emphasis on cash flow and getting more initial down payments and progress payments from our customers so this is an ongoing process which focuses on cash flow ella fried bank leumi analyst okay thank you very much for taking my questions it was nice to talk to you joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer thank you ella bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer thank you ella rami myerson director investor relations thank you ella operator there are no further questions at this time before i ask mr machlis to go ahead with his closing

and internationally please call 9723 925 5900 a replay of this call will also be available on the company s website at www elbitsystems com i d now like to let ella ask another question please go ahead ella fried bank leumi analyst oh ok thank you it s not that important i just was late in reacting on the call so i would like to ask you about factoring as we spoke about cash flow actually how are you still using it and is it still a is it a higher rate now than you used to use it or it s the same level more or less joseph gaspar executive vice president chief financial officer occasionally we use it in the first quarter we had a relatively low level of factoring and if you look at the trend compared to last year we have lower level in overall and we plan to have a lower level during the year as well in assessing in our assessment the payments from the customer will come in time and will not need that element or reduce it significantly ella fried bank leumi analyst okay thank you again operator mr machlis would you like to make your concluding statement bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer i would like to thank all our employees again for the continued hard work particularly in these challenging times to everyone on the call thank you for joining us today and for your continued support and interest in our company have a good day and goodbye operator

massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth william galvin is taking on robinhood for violating massachusetts new fiduciary duty rule for broker dealers in december 2020 galvin filed a 24 page regulatory complaint seeking to ban the popular trading app for violating the state s strict fiduciary duty rule that requires broker dealers to act in the best interest of their clients galvin raised three different violations against robinhood that allegedly fell short of the new strict fiduciary standard this new rule passed in february 2020 was created in response to the securities and exchange commission s regulation best interest reg bi which massachusetts believed did not go far enough reg bi bars brokers from putting their own financial interest above those of their clients but fails to define what it means to act in the customers best interest or mandate that brokers recommend a single best product while reg bi requires the disclosure and mitigation of conflicts of interest massachusetts felt this requirement was also lacking galvin stated that reg bi is basically a souped up version of the suitability standard and felt a new state rule was necessary to protect the growing crowd of young investors in the state during this past year due to covid 19 and other meme based investment activities on the application robinhood accumulated over 3 million new users in the first four months of 2020 galvin s concerns revolve around the 500 000 customers in massachusetts with accounts totaling over 1 6 billion the allegations and robinhood s response galvin claims that robinhood fell short of acting in its clients best interest the first allegation claims robinhood s technological outages compromised its clients and their assets through robinhood s failure to supervise and respond adequately to the disruptions the second allegation claims robinhood violated its own rules regarding options trading by approving customers to engage in the practice without having the necessary qualifications lastly the third allegation claims robinhood uses gamification to encourage unnecessary trading risks under this gamification allegation galvin asserts robinhood s promise of free stocks push notifications and signature digital confetti encourages continuous and repeated engagement with its application robinhood responded to these allegations in the regulatory proceeding by filing suit in massachusetts state court against the state of massachusetts on april 15 2021 to remove the matter from the administrative process robinhood s representatives report that the company continues to work to ensure the system s scale and its availability to its customer base the company also disclaims the allegations that it targets an unsophisticated customer base but rather believes its application provides customers with the proper tools to educate themselves and invest on their own robinhood s suit against the state claims the new fiduciary rule is invalid under state and federal law first robinhood argues that federal law preempts this new rule given the introduction of reg bi secondly under state law robinhood asserts that massachusetts common law does not define brokerage firms as general purpose fiduciaries to their customers and the secretary s actions to usurp the authority of the judicial branch is prohibited also under state law robinhood asserts that the new fiduciary rule does not apply to them as a self directed brokerage firm given they do not make investment recommendations or provide investment advice upcoming issues for the court to address in this suit the state court is going to need to resolve three different issues preemption enforcement power and proper application the court will need to determine if the sec s reg bi preempted massachusetts new rule if the court decides the state law is not preempted the court will then need to determine if the securities division has the authority to enforce this rule given the states common law lastly the court will need to determine if the rule encompasses robinhood in its authority as a self directed brokerage firm this last question will revolve around the definition of recommendation as robinhood asserts in its complaint broker dealers as a matter of law do not owe their customers general fiduciary duties even when providing customers with investment advice and recommendations instead under massachusetts law broker dealers owe their customers fiduciary duties only when they act with discretion and make the investment decisions for their customers robinhood does neither of those things robinhood currently provides a list of securities in various categories for customers to choose from in its application there is a lot of debate regarding these lists and if they should qualify as providing investment advice barbra roper the director of investor protection at the consumer federation of america stated we can t tolerate a situation in which apps and digital platforms are able to do indirectly through psychological nudges what they would be prohibited from doing directly in the form of a recommendation while this matter unfolds robinhood continues to deal with the oversight of its application with the uptrend in meme investing and an influx of customers who have been drawn to investing during a year of covid 19 lockdown the combination of issues in this proceeding involving reg bi preemption what may constitute a recommendation and the interplay of advancing technologies make the battle between robinhood and massachusetts one to watch closely over the months and years to come

occurred under the law of the jurisdiction wherein the alleged loss occurred see monteleone v commissioner 34 t c 688 692 1960 the amount of loss and the date that the loss was discovered the court determined that theft under california laws under the california penal code the concept of theft consolidates various similar criminal conducts such as larceny theft by false pretenses and embezzlement cal penal code sec 484 a taxpayers claimed they suffered losses from fraud in inducement directing the analysis to false pretenses which includes elements on the defendant such as intent to defraud the owner of the property making false representations and obtaining title of the owner s property as consequence of the reliance in this case the court found that the petitioners did not provided any evidence that supported that mr zeilinger made false representations or with the intent to defraud therefore this element was not met the court also ruled that even if a theft was present the petitioners still would not be able to claim the loss because they had failed to prove the amount of the loss and to establish the year that the loss was sustained if the taxpayer has reasonable prospect of recovery the loss is not sustained treas regs sec 1 165 1 d 3 here the taxpayers did not have a reasonable prospect of recovery of their investment in 2015 because the bankruptcy proceeding for mr zeilinger was still in court alternatively the taxpayers argued that the loss was deductible as a loss incurred in a trade or business as provided by section 165 c 1 this argument is flawed because the involvement of the petitioners in globe was that of an investor and investment losses do not fall within this exception the second alternative argument was that the loss was deductible as a worthless security i r c 165 g because the taxpayers did not provide any evidence that the shares of globe became worthless in 2015 such rule does not apply penalties the penalties were sustained under i r c 6651 a 1 because the tax returns were filed after the due date and the taxpayers failed to prove that the failure to file was due to reasonable cause insight theft losses is an area with particular circumstances however it is clear that the taxpayers must provide evidence to support the three factor test mentioned by the court in this case more importantly the determination of a theft under state jurisdiction must be given special consideration because failure to fall within the specific scope of a theft in accordance with such jurisdiction will prevent the taxpayer from moving forward under the court s analysis

i love shopping at costco they seem to have most of the items that i want need and usually at a great price but it s super annoying when i m used to an item being in a certain area and then it s not there the next time i go back either it s moved or it s just not there anymore at all costco sioux falls ben davis well i found out that there is an actual trick to figuring out when this could happen as far as the item being discontinued or if it s a clearance item this is not always a known fact like in most big box stores and guess what items moved from one place to another that s actually done on purpose more on that coming up if something is on sale or clearance you can tell by the price tag sign the trick is looking for an asterisk in the upper right corner of the price tag sign if there is one there that is a signal that that specific location isn t going to restock the item or it may be seasonal so if it s a favorite then stock up now or just know that you are probably going to have to wait get our free mobile app get our free mobile app is the item you want not in the same spot it was before not your imagination costco does this on purpose so that you may be tempted to buy other items that you may not have noticed before it s a marketing trick do you have questions about the meats or other deli items and no employees are around go ahead and knock on the deli door yes hunt down the employees they will be more than happy to answer your questions keep in mind that costco is a warehouse store if an item is low and you re wondering if there is more in the back there isn t this is a warehouse what you see is what you get what if you miss a sale are you out on the savings not necessarily while they won t price match from other stores they will allow you to get the price at the discounted price for up to 30 days you can put in a request for a price change online and sometimes in store just head to the customer service membership counter to see if this is available remember you can order pizza ahead of time especially on a busy friday or a weekend just call ahead so you don t have to wait the extra 20 minutes or so for a fresh pizza easy peasy guess what you can tell if you are getting the best deal at costco if a price ends in a 7 instead of a 9 or an 8 you know that you are getting a clearance item learn more about secret code pricing it s still annoying when you don t get that favorite item that you got the last time at costco

there was statewide outcry in wisconsin when much loved irish butter brand kerrygold was outlawed at the end of february due to a 1970 law that dictates all butter sold there must be subject to scrutiny by a panel of experts who ruled that the grass fed dairy cows used by the brand were noncompliant with their regulations the ban which shopkeepers will face a 1000 fine and six months jail time for flouting means that many wisconsin residents must now cross state borders in order to stock up on their favorite kitchen staple the conundrum even inspired one milwaukee woman sharon o neill to create an online petition repeal the butter law wisconsin which calls on legislators to loosen the kerrygold restrictions this is butter for pete s sake she told the chicago tribune and revealed that she and others have begun hoarding the product when they can find it i have a friend with eight pounds in her freezer i just bought six the law which was put into place to protect wisconsin s nationally renowned dairy industry does not target any particular brand assured administrator for the wisconsin department of agriculture s division of food and recreational safety steve ingham we re not trying to keep out he said there s plenty of room in the food world we re not a butter hit squad a spokesman for kerrygold retailer ornua foods north america has released a statement confirming they are currently working with the wisconsin authorities on a solution
when uddhab gautam got his first vaccine dose back in february covid 19 cases in nepal were low now three months later coronavirus infections in the himalayan nation have spiraled out of control leading to a shortage of hospital beds and oxygen and sending most of the country into lockdown but despite needing it more than ever the 67 year old retired banker has no idea when he ll get his second dose of covishield the astrazeneca vaccine manufactured by the serum institute of india sii as an older person i m afraid of contracting the virus he said from his home in nepal s capital kathmandu i have chosen to stay indoors gautam s predicament is similar to one shared by millions worldwide as india s own coronavirus crisis has spiraled sii world s largest vaccine maker can no longer export its goods last week the sii said it wouldn t restart deliveries to covax a worldwide initiative aimed at distributing vaccines to countries regardless of wealth until the end of this year while sii s decision will be a lifeline for india which is still reporting about 200 000 new cases a day the delay poses a huge problem for developing countries that depend on covax to control large outbreaks of their own the world is already 140 million doses short and by the end of june that gap will have reached 190 million shots the united nations children s agency one of the partners in covax said last week there is currently no timeframe for resolving the shortage unicef said that creates a very real problem not just for countries with limited access to vaccines where cases are exploding but also for the whole world we are concerned that the deadly spike in india is a precursor to what will happen if those warnings remain unheeded unicef executive director henrietta fore said in a news release last week the cost for children and families will be incalculable why there are covax shortfalls last year the sii which manufactures covishield the name given to the astrazeneca vaccine manufactured in india promised to deliver 200 million vaccines to covax more than 111 million of those doses were set to be delivered between february and may this year mainly to countries in africa and asia pacific according to data from gavi a public private global health partnership that is co leading covax but as of tuesday only about 30 million sii doses had been distributed via covax according to gavi according to unicef sii s delivery delays are a major reason why the covax rollout is so behind schedule along with vaccine nationalism limited production capacity and a lack of funding covax should have already delivered 170 million total doses unicef said instead as of tuesday it has delivered 71 million shots to 125 countries and territories with about 42 coming from sii and 56 from astrazeneca according to gavi data sii began distributing vaccines overseas at the start of the year when india s cases had fallen and other countries were in desperate need of help the company s ceo adar poonawalla explained in a statement last week but as india s cases rose sii kept supplies at home where there was a growing need the government denied media reports it had banned vaccine exports the world health organization who warned in march that sii doses would be delayed by that point it had delivered just 28 million shots as india s caseload started spiking demand for vaccination grew and a number of states reported a shortage of shots that prompted questions about why india the world leader in vaccine manufacturing was running out of doses as of tuesday just 3 of india s population had been fully vaccinated sii said last week it had delivered more than 200 million doses in total we continue to scale up manufacturing and prioritize india we also hope to start delivering to covax and other countries by end of this year poonwalla said poonwalla said sii had never exported vaccines at the cost of the people in india and would remain committed to do everything we can in support of the vaccination drive in the country we have been working with the government tirelessly to do our best for humanity and will continue in the same spirit he said a gavi spokesperson said in a statement that it was in close contact with both sii and the indian government and hoped deliveries could resume in a reduced capacity in the third quarter of this year what this means for developing countries across the border in nepal where coronavirus cases and deaths are soaring sii s announcement has left authorities scrambling nepal has only fully vaccinated 1 9 of its population and has almost run out of vaccines the country has reported more than 500 000 covid 19 cases and 6 700 deaths but nepal has the third highest test positivity rate in the world about 40 of tests come back positive suggesting it is not catching all cases the spokesperson for the ministry of health and population dr jageshwor gautam said last week the country only has about 50 000 to 60 000 doses of sii s covishield in storage for emergency purposes nepal s health minister hridayesh tripathi said last week that authorities planned to use them in a few days to give elderly people their second dose the country was hoping to receive 1 million more vaccines by the end of april but they never arrived in total nepal only received 348 000 doses of its allocated 1 9 million doses of astrazeneca vaccine through covax according to tripathi covax initially promised 14 8 million doses enough for about a quarter of the country s population millions of nepalis have received no dose at all and 1 5 million people most of them 65 or older have received one dose of the vaccine but haven t yet received their second prompting concerns about how long their immunity will last i haven t heard anything since the first dose said durga kaumari paudel 66 a housewife who lives with her husband and son in kathmandu one of her neighbors died this month from covid 19 which only adds to her concern she has been so afraid she hasn t stepped outside her house in a month it s unclear whether delaying the timing of second dose will decrease efficacy but trials show two doses of a vaccine is likely to be better than one according to gavi health minister tripathi said nepal is in talks with a number of countries in a bid to get the vaccines it needs he said he s talked to officials from the united states the united kingdom and other countries about the astrazeneca vaccine and sent letters to the health ministers of the us uk china and russia wednesday updating them about nepal s needs we ll get the vaccines we need soon we are quite confident he said nepal isn t alone bangladesh was set to receive more than 10 million covishield doses by the end of may according to gavi s allocations but it s unclear if those ever arrived and bangladesh has now run out of vaccines according to the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ifrc the country has fully vaccinated just 2 4 of its 164 million population and cases appear to be rising again after a request from bangladesh china gifted another 600 000 vaccine doses the chinese embassy in dhaka said in a statement friday papua new guinea sri lanka and cambodia were also expecting covishield deliveries and are all now experiencing spikes in cases according to ifrc a majority of countries in asia were struggling with vaccine shortages asia is now the epicenter of this global pandemic said alexander matheou irfc s asia pacific director tens of thousands of lives are being lost each week and vaccines must be available so that we can prevent further terrible tolls in the weeks and months ahead what this means for the world a hamstrung covax isn t just a problem for countries in asia it has potentially worldwide ramifications we have issued repeated warnings of the risks of letting down our guard and leaving low and middle income countries without equitable access to vaccines diagnostics and therapeutics unicef s fore said in a statement the longer the virus continues to spread unchecked the higher the risk of more deadly or contagious variants emerging this month covax co leader coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi set up a covax manufacturing task force to tackle vaccine supply challenges such as a shortage of raw materials the gavi spokesperson said one of its top priorities currently was to work with governments with the largest supplies to deliver vaccines through covax to countries where they could have an immediate impact in addressing this short term supply disruption they did not specify which countries this included but as fore points out sii isn t the only group that can help solve the vaccine shortage only who approved vaccines can be rolled out via covax earlier this month who listed china s sinopharm for emergency use making it the sixth vaccine to be given the green light to be used as part of covax gavi said earlier this month it was in talks with manufacturers including sinopharm to get more covax doses reuters reported while some countries are desperate for vaccines others are inoculating the less vulnerable such as young people a situation that tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general described last week as vaccine apartheid in his opening remarks at the world health assembly monday he noted that more than 75 of all vaccines have been administered in just 10 countries the ongoing vaccine crisis is a scandalous inequity that is perpetuating the pandemic he said the number of doses administered globally so far would have been enough to cover all health workers and older people if they had been distributed equitably we could have been in a much better situation unicef said in an email that it was urging countries with excess doses to share them as an immediate stop gap measure ifrc is also calling for states and pharmaceutical companies to move faster in distributing vaccines we cannot afford to become bogged down in negotiations over the next six months ifrc president francesco rocca said adding that government needed to share stocks particularly with countries experiencing covid 19 surges tedros called on manufacturers to give covax the first right of refusal on new vaccines or commit 50 of vaccines to covax this year there is no diplomatic way to say it he added a small group of countries that make and buy the majority of the world s vaccines control the fate of the rest of the world

house prices are the eternal barbecue stopper in australia and the recent price action has been extraordinary with the 3 2 per cent gain in prices in march the highest in 32 years but it all looks pretty sedate when you consider some of kelman s other factoids about the intensity of the us market with the stock of homes for sale down 37 per cent to record lows the typical home sells in 17 days also a record low and the average home sells for 1 7 per cent above the asking price also a record and such is the scramble for stock redfin s annual survey of nearly 2000 buyers taken in april revealed a staggering 63 per cent had bid on a home they hadn t seen in person just as in australia there are a number of factors driving the us market chief among them being a lack of listings perhaps not surprising in a country where daily covid 19 cases are still running at 25 000 a day despite the country s impressive vaccine rollout advertisement on top of this the construction of new homes isn t coming through fast enough to satisfy demand america s post global financial crisis hangover caused housing construction to slow over the past decade with one estimate suggesting the nation needs 3 5 million more houses than it has but government data released on tuesday showed purchases of new single family homes fell 5 9 per cent in april as supply chain challenges and the soaring price of building materials particularly timber created big backlogs for builders and helped push the median price of new homes up 20 1 per cent the number of homes sold in april and awaiting the start of construction a key measure of backlogs rose 16 5 per cent month on month to the highest level since 2006 the remote working boom would also seem to be adding fuel to the us housing boom making buyers more willing to move to states where taxes and or property prices are lower a survey run by redfin in april showed two thirds of buyers got a bigger house but the same proportion paid less for it 78 per cent of respondents said they had more disposable income after their move advertisement although interestingly lenders apparently remain nervous about remote work trends holding kelman says lenders are calling employers to confirm buyers will have permission to work remotely when the pandemic ends but as in australia a huge part of this story is of course ultra low interest rates which have given buyers the confidence to take out bigger loans in a resurgent economy the big question in the us and australia is where things go from here the backlog of houses to be built says new supply is coming and as the northern hemisphere summer arrives and the pandemic continues to abate it s widely expected that more homes will come on the market and prices will at least plateau perhaps the bubble deflates in an orderly way but there are some worrying signs that the hot us housing market has attracted a level of speculation over the past 12 months a pack of wall street giants including brookfield cerberus capital management jp morgan s asset management arm and nuveen real estate have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into buying family homes for the rental market advertisement as noted by financial times columnist robert armstrong bloomberg last week reported that cerberus which operates 24 000 rentals bought more than 200 houses from online home brokers in the march quarter many of which never made it to the open market this activity has even grabbed the attention of central bankers the chairman of the federal reserve bank of dallas robert kaplan has been warning about imbalances and excesses in some asset classes for months he said recently he s hearing more and more widespread reports of private investors entering the single family housing market competing with families often making bids sight unseen above the asking price and requesting that the house remain furnished kaplan conceded monetary policy was part of the problem we re in a position where single families are being crowded out or squeezed out of being able to buy their first home this is an example of an excess maybe an unintended consequence a side effect of these extraordinary actions advertisement australia hasn t seen anything like this level of investor activity indeed the lack of investors in the market has been the factor giving local bank chiefs and regulators comfort that rising housing prices here are being driven by supply and not speculation there are also signs that some of the heat is coming out of the australian market while clearance rates remain strong experts report buyers have been more cautious since easter still the us experience is worth keeping in mind low rates are designed to push asset prices higher and encourage risk taking so it will be no surprise to see investors re enter the australian market local regulators and even politicians will be keen to see this doesn t further distort a hot market

when uddhab gautam got his first vaccine dose back in february covid 19 cases in nepal were low now three months later coronavirus infections in the himalayan nation have spiraled out of control leading to a shortage of hospital beds and oxygen and sending most of the country into lockdown but despite needing it more than ever the 67 year old retired banker has no idea when he ll get his second dose of covishield the astrazeneca vaccine manufactured by the serum institute of india sii as an older person i m afraid of contracting the virus he said from his home in nepal s capital kathmandu i have chosen to stay indoors gautam s predicament is similar to one shared by millions worldwide as india s own coronavirus crisis has spiraled sii world s largest vaccine maker can no longer export its goods last week the sii said it wouldn t restart deliveries to covax a worldwide initiative aimed at distributing vaccines to countries regardless of wealth until the end of this year while sii s decision will be a lifeline for india which is still reporting about 200 000 new cases a day the delay poses a huge problem for developing countries that depend on covax to control large outbreaks of their own the world is already 140 million doses short and by the end of june that gap will have reached 190 million shots the united nations children s agency one of the partners in covax said last week there is currently no timeframe for resolving the shortage unicef said that creates a very real problem not just for countries with limited access to vaccines where cases are exploding but also for the whole world we are concerned that the deadly spike in india is a precursor to what will happen if those warnings remain unheeded unicef executive director henrietta fore said in a news release last week the cost for children and families will be incalculable why there are covax shortfalls last year the sii which manufactures covishield the name given to the astrazeneca vaccine manufactured in india promised to deliver 200 million vaccines to covax more than 111 million of those doses were set to be delivered between february and may this year mainly to countries in africa and asia pacific according to data from gavi a public private global health partnership that is co leading covax but as of tuesday only about 30 million sii doses had been distributed via covax according to gavi according to unicef sii s delivery delays are a major reason why the covax rollout is so behind schedule along with vaccine nationalism limited production capacity and a lack of funding covax should have already delivered 170 million total doses unicef said instead as of tuesday it has delivered 71 million shots to 125 countries and territories with about 42 coming from sii and 56 from astrazeneca according to gavi data sii began distributing vaccines overseas at the start of the year when india s cases had fallen and other countries were in desperate need of help the company s ceo adar poonawalla explained in a statement last week but as india s cases rose sii kept supplies at home where there was a growing need the government denied media reports it had banned vaccine exports the world health organization who warned in march that sii doses would be delayed by that point it had delivered just 28 million shots as india s caseload started spiking demand for vaccination grew and a number of states reported a shortage of shots that prompted questions about why india the world leader in vaccine manufacturing was running out of doses as of tuesday just 3 of india s population had been fully vaccinated sii said last week it had delivered more than 200 million doses in total we continue to scale up manufacturing and prioritize india we also hope to start delivering to covax and other countries by end of this year poonwalla said poonwalla said sii had never exported vaccines at the cost of the people in india and would remain committed to do everything we can in support of the vaccination drive in the country we have been working with the government tirelessly to do our best for humanity and will continue in the same spirit he said a gavi spokesperson said in a statement that it was in close contact with both sii and the indian government and hoped deliveries could resume in a reduced capacity in the third quarter of this year what this means for developing countries across the border in nepal where coronavirus cases and deaths are soaring sii s announcement has left authorities scrambling nepal has only fully vaccinated 1 9 of its population and has almost run out of vaccines the country has reported more than 500 000 covid 19 cases and 6 700 deaths but nepal has the third highest test positivity rate in the world about 40 of tests come back positive suggesting it is not catching all cases the spokesperson for the ministry of health and population dr jageshwor gautam said last week the country only has about 50 000 to 60 000 doses of sii s covishield in storage for emergency purposes nepal s health minister hridayesh tripathi said last week that authorities planned to use them in a few days to give elderly people their second dose the country was hoping to receive 1 million more vaccines by the end of april but they never arrived in total nepal only received 348 000 doses of its allocated 1 9 million doses of astrazeneca vaccine through covax according to tripathi covax initially promised 14 8 million doses enough for about a quarter of the country s population millions of nepalis have received no dose at all and 1 5 million people most of them 65 or older have received one dose of the vaccine but haven t yet received their second prompting concerns about how long their immunity will last i haven t heard anything since the first dose said durga kaumari paudel 66 a housewife who lives with her husband and son in kathmandu one of her neighbors died this month from covid 19 which only adds to her concern she has been so afraid she hasn t stepped outside her house in a month it s unclear whether delaying the timing of second dose will decrease efficacy but trials show two doses of a vaccine is likely to be better than one according to gavi health minister tripathi said nepal is in talks with a number of countries in a bid to get the vaccines it needs he said he s talked to officials from the united states the united kingdom and other countries about the astrazeneca vaccine and sent letters to the health ministers of the us uk china and russia wednesday updating them about nepal s needs we ll get the vaccines we need soon we are quite confident he said nepal isn t alone bangladesh was set to receive more than 10 million covishield doses by the end of may according to gavi s allocations but it s unclear if those ever arrived and bangladesh has now run out of vaccines according to the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ifrc the country has fully vaccinated just 2 4 of its 164 million population and cases appear to be rising again after a request from bangladesh china gifted another 600 000 vaccine doses the chinese embassy in dhaka said in a statement friday papua new guinea sri lanka and cambodia were also expecting covishield deliveries and are all now experiencing spikes in cases according to ifrc a majority of countries in asia were struggling with vaccine shortages asia is now the epicenter of this global pandemic said alexander matheou irfc s asia pacific director tens of thousands of lives are being lost each week and vaccines must be available so that we can prevent further terrible tolls in the weeks and months ahead what this means for the world a hamstrung covax isn t just a problem for countries in asia it has potentially worldwide ramifications we have issued repeated warnings of the risks of letting down our guard and leaving low and middle income countries without equitable access to vaccines diagnostics and therapeutics unicef s fore said in a statement the longer the virus continues to spread unchecked the higher the risk of more deadly or contagious variants emerging this month covax co leader coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi set up a covax manufacturing task force to tackle vaccine supply challenges such as a shortage of raw materials the gavi spokesperson said one of its top priorities currently was to work with governments with the largest supplies to deliver vaccines through covax to countries where they could have an immediate impact in addressing this short term supply disruption they did not specify which countries this included but as fore points out sii isn t the only group that can help solve the vaccine shortage only who approved vaccines can be rolled out via covax earlier this month who listed china s sinopharm for emergency use making it the sixth vaccine to be given the green light to be used as part of covax gavi said earlier this month it was in talks with manufacturers including sinopharm to get more covax doses reuters reported while some countries are desperate for vaccines others are inoculating the less vulnerable such as young people a situation that tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general described last week as vaccine apartheid in his opening remarks at the world health assembly monday he noted that more than 75 of all vaccines have been administered in just 10 countries the ongoing vaccine crisis is a scandalous inequity that is perpetuating the pandemic he said the number of doses administered globally so far would have been enough to cover all health workers and older people if they had been distributed equitably we could have been in a much better situation unicef said in an email that it was urging countries with excess doses to share them as an immediate stop gap measure ifrc is also calling for states and pharmaceutical companies to move faster in distributing vaccines we cannot afford to become bogged down in negotiations over the next six months ifrc president francesco rocca said adding that government needed to share stocks particularly with countries experiencing covid 19 surges tedros called on manufacturers to give covax the first right of refusal on new vaccines or commit 50 of vaccines to covax this year there is no diplomatic way to say it he added a small group of countries that make and buy the majority of the world s vaccines control the fate of the rest of the world

islamabad military s top brass on tuesday raised alarm over the deteriorating situation in border areas of afghanistan where terrorist outfits have been gaining strength and urged kabul to prevent its soil from being used against pakistan the situation along the pak afghan border was extensively discussed at the 241st corps commanders conference at the general headquarters which was presided over by chief of the army staff gen qamar javed bajwa the participants took comprehensive review of the global regional and domestic security environment with particular focus on situation along borders especially loc working boundary and pak afghan border said the inter services public relations ispr forum was apprised of evolving operational imperatives and corresponding strategy to meet upcoming challenges the coas expressed satisfaction over army s operational readiness in view of the emerging security threats it said commanders expect afghan govt to deny any space to spoilers of peace says ispr gen bajwa and us secretary austin emphasise shared interest in security and stability in the region the evolving situation in afghanistan has been of great concern for pakistan especially the further weakening of the already very weak writ of kabul over the border areas where the tehreek i taliban pakistan ttp has sanctuaries ttp fighters have over the past few weeks conducted multiple attacks on pakistani border posts it is believed that besides the increased operational space now enjoyed by the taliban backing by the elements hostile to pakistan has allowed ttp factions to regroup and rearm the issue was discussed threadbare at a meeting at the isi headquarters on monday which was attended by prime minister imran khan key federal ministers and services chiefs national security adviser moeed yusuf also discussed the developing situation with his american counterpart jake sullivan in geneva over the weekend taking serious note of the recent cross border firing incidents from afghanistan and regrouping of terrorist leadership outfits across the forum expressed the hope that afghanistan soil will not be used against pakistan the ispr said in light of emerging regional security situation pakistan has taken effective border control management measures and the same is expected from afghanistan to deny any space to spoilers of peace the forum reiterated it warned in view of the situation the corps commanders took stock of the progress of development in the newly merged districts of khyber pakhtunkhwa which earlier formed tribal areas and noted that much more needed to be done urgently so that the ttp elements did not get an opportunity to exploit local grievances forum also especially reviewed situation in the newly merged districts of kp and balochistan and stressed upon fast paced socio economic development of these areas to capitalise on the hard earned peace to bring an enduring stability the ispr said major worry for pakistan the deadlocked peace process in afghanistan is also a major worry for pakistan government strategists are already looking at the possible scenario of us troops withdrawing by sept 11 without a political settlement in place while reviewing recent developments in the afghan peace process and its attendant effects on the security situation especially along pak afghan border the forum reaffirmed pakistan s support for regional peace and stability the ispr said violence in afghanistan has been very high since the us signed a peace agreement with the taliban as the situation is highly uncertain in afghanistan and is gradually worsening pakistan may have to bear the fallout in case of a civil war therefore islamabad has stepped up efforts for peace and reconciliation meetings between the taliban and afghan government negotiators have resumed but they have made little headway so far there are reports that pakistan is planning to host a peace conference gens bajwa austin discuss situation army chief gen qamar bajwa and us defence secretary lloyd austin on monday discussed the increasingly uncertain situation in afghanistan secretary of defense lloyd j austin iii spoke by phone with pakistan s chief of army staff general qamar javed bajwa to discuss shared regional interests and objectives pentagon press secretary john kirby said the conversation took place a day after the national security advisers of the two countries held a meeting in geneva the nsas meeting also focused on the situation in afghanistan although it had a bilateral element as well uncertainty in afghanistan has intensified after president joe biden s decision to pull out troops by sept 11 the announcement was greeted by the taliban with increased battlefield attacks which americans suspect to be the unannounced spring offensive by the insurgents the attacks have drawn a strong response from the afghan security forces this month alone several hundred combatants from both sides have been killed in addition to heavy civilian casualty suggesting that the situation is aggravating fast gen bajwa and secretary austin during their conversation emphasised shared interest in security and stability in the region during the call secretary austin reiterated his appreciation for pakistan s support for afghanistan peace negotiations and expressed his desire to continue to build on the us pakistan bilateral relationship the pentagon statement said published in dawn may 26th 2021

westpac banking corp raised us2 75 billion 3 54 billion of unsecured debt in the us bond market marking the first time an australian bank tapped the debt markets in this format since the onset of the covid 19 pandemic the sydney based bank sold five and 10 year bonds just five weeks before australian banks will lose access to the 200 billion term funding facility provided to them by the reserve bank the three year reserve bank facility which costs just 10 basis points has all but eliminated the need of the banks to tap wholesale markets but the eventual requirement to refinance the loans has led banks to consider returning to the capital markets for senior unsecured bonds westpac s sale is the first with analysts expecting more banks to return to the senior unsecured bond market in august as the refinancing task begins a lack of supply of australian bank bonds and support provided to credit markets by central banks has resulted in spreads shrinking to the lowest levels since before the global financial crisis as a proxy for funding costs westpac s five year credit default swaps currently trade at 25 basis points that compares to a peak in 2020 of 115 basis points and a 2019 peak of 78 basis points just prior to the covid 19 pandemic westpac s credit default swaps which are the cost of insuring against debt default traded at around 35 basis points
airbnbs have a future in brookline following a town meeting vote tuesday allowing and regulating short term rentals town meeting voted to amend brookline zoning and allow short term rentals also passing warrant articles outlining regulations and enforcement the new regulations take effect jan 1 2022 the town had previously interpreted its zoning bylaws to only allow rentals for 30 days or more a brookline airbnb operator is suing the town for the right to operate arguing the town s zoning bylaws do not specify a time limit more brookline airbnb owner suing the town for the right to operate short term rentals previously came up at the fall 2020 town meeting when the issue was referred to the moderator s committee on short term rentals tasked with proposing a framework for regulation there was again a motion to refer tuesday with some claiming there hasn t been enough public discussion on the matter nothing could be further from the truth said town meeting member paula friedman who chaired the moderator s committee i can t remember any other issue in the past 20 yeas that has received so much discussion so much scrutiny so much public engagement and so much review by town departments committees and public forums friedman said the committee drew on many sources of information and research including previous town reports public comment and complaints according to committee member sean lynn jones the massachusetts department of revenue provided a list of brookline short term rentals that paid state taxes he said although this list contained errors and was probably incomplete it was very valuable in revealing that about 75 of the strs in brookline were operated by investors lynn jones said nonresident or absentee investors can have negative impacts he said they displace long term residents by converting long term housing into short term rental units and that can make housing less affordable lynn jones said and absentee investors are less likely to care about or be able to monitor the quality of life negative effects of short term rental with owner occupancy and primary residency stipulations the regulations reduce the likelihood of absentee investors operating in brookline according to lynn jones committee and town meeting member chris dempsey further elaborated the regulations require short term rental units be inspected before they may be rented out prohibit short term rentals for commercial uses and require operators to communicate with guests regarding trash disposal and parking the regulations also cap operators at 90 rental days per year the select board can extend that cap up to 180 days on a case by case basis but dempsey maintained such extensions would be rare town meeting members linda pehlke and jonathan karon further proposed an amendment that would require condominium associations to permit short term rentals before strs could operate there some community members have previously cited short term rentals as an important source of revenue allowing them to continue living in brookline something dempsey touched on in his remarks more to airbnb or not to airbnb brookline considers the people who are choosing to do this are folks for whom the revenue matters he said rentals have long helped older residents afford to remain in brookline said joyce graff we may once have been professionals with nice salaries but today we re living on fixed incomes in an era of ever increasing taxes and with no income to offset them she said graff s annual real estate tax bill is now nearly one third of what she paid to buy her property in 1978 she said adding when the tax bill goes up it comes out of the grocery money or the savings not everyone was sold on the idea of short term rentals town meeting member ana albuquerque a member of the moderator s committee emphasized the need to protect against harmful impacts to neighbors quality of life town meeting member chi chi wu asserted airbnbs have had a devastating impact on boston s chinatown decreasing the housing stock there i m opposed to strs in brookline for several reasons most importantly because it removes rental housing for long term renters and it negatively affects housing affordability she said even with regulations she said some str operators will likely sneak in under the radar with a complicated regulatory scheme if some strs are allowed it s harder to crack down on the illegal strs than if none are allowed wu said however town meeting ultimately disagreed passing the zoning amendment with a vote of 201 in favor 29

udenafil to treat svhd patients who have undergone fontan palliation is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review the fda notice in the fda notice the fda advised that there were no filing review issues identified thus the fda review cycle has started with an expected nda approval date of march 26 2022 the fda also advised in the fda notice that the fda is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss mezzion s nda the fda had previously granted mezzion s request to designate udenafil for treatment of single ventricle congenital heart disease as a drug for a rare pediatric disease to encourage the development of drugs to treat rare pediatric diseases the us established a priority review voucher prv program under which the fda awards a prv to a drug

rare pediatric disease it will be awarded a prv at which time the prv will be fully redeemable and or transferrable mezzion looks forward to the fda review process and to bringing a novel pharmacotherapeutic option to this rare pediatric disease population about the fontan procedure and subsequent expectations the fontan procedure is a surgical intervention that allows for the survival of children born with congenital heart disease characterized by only a single functional pumping chamber this procedure consists of re configuring the circulation to allow the single ventricle to pump blood to the body while connecting the great veins directly to the arteries that bring blood to the lungs in this fontan circulation the blood returning from the body bypasses the heart and travels to the lungs without the assistance of a dedicated right ventricle pumping chamber the goal of the fontan procedure is to separate the systemic and pulmonary circulations and to improve oxygen levels by redirecting venous blood directly to the lungs while the fontan procedure creates a stable circulation the risk of hospitalization and cardiac death rises significantly in the second and third decades after fontan completion a risk that is associated with a decline in exercise capacity the fontan circulation is also associated with non cardiac complications such as protein losing enteropathy plastic bronchitis and liver failure all of which can be attributed to a chronic elevation in central venous pressure and a chronically reduced cardiac output for all of these reasons a 35 year old

in both sides now author and ethicist leslie cannold presents two sides of an argument then it s over to you what do you think is true and what do you think cannold really believes today does it matter if our political leaders lie yes lying is manipulative and disrespectful and australians deserve better from their political leaders if not nipped in the bud it can also destroy democracy no we all make mistakes sometimes once the record is corrected we need to move on yes lying is wrong because it s sneaky and manipulative it leaves us dependent on incorrect information on which to base our decisions and feeling like chumps when we realise we ve been had it is obnoxiously arrogant not to mention disrespectful to intentionally deceive someone whether to deny them the facts they need to assess your true character or trick them into doing what you want the liar says my needs feelings and projects are more important that yours you are nothing but a tool for me to use to serve my own ends when politicians lie these same problems arise but the victims are more plentiful and the arrogance more profound after all we elect these people to serve us an expectation they know about and promise to fulfil how else can we feel but furious when they lie to us and then lie about lying instead but the worst political deception goes further than this destroying the individual and institutional trust on which society and democracy depend if the internet has taught us anything it s that the real world can be constructed or deconstructed around what people believe is true or more precisely what people are manipulated into believing is factual look no further than the united states where despite joe biden s clear victory in a free and fair vote just under a third of americans believe trump won only to have the victory stolen from him this biglie as it has come to be known may yet pull american democracy down not because it has any basis in reality it s been disproven and contradicted by some of the most relevant and august institutions within the country but all the lies and sowing of suspicion in the recent past means there is no individual or institution that both sides trust to adjudicate the question fairly and render a verdict that everyone can believe this is how democratic systems decline and corrupt authoritarian ones remain standing by doing things that beef up distrust and make our grip on reality murky how can we fight for what should be if we re not even sure of what is and don t trust anyone to tell us the truth better to shut down and log out in disgust those who don t see any advantage in government by and for the people a category that ranges from the kremlin to fox news know this they understand that whether you are confusing citizens with lies or bombarding them with a murky torrent of fact and fiction the belief in the possibility of truth is the main casualty when russian soldiers seized crimea from ukraine putin said they weren t russians many months later he agreed without fanfare that they were as the new republic has noted putin wasn t lying in the traditional sense he was doing something far worse he was saying that facts just don t matter we can t let the facts don t matter brigade get a foothold in australia we must call out the lies and by doing it insist that truth matters because we don t just deserve the truth we must have it to protect australian democracy no we all lie sometimes whether it s to avoid hurting the feelings of a friend whose arse does look fat in that or to use the classic philosophical hypothetical to protect the jews hiding in the basement when nazis come to the door lying is sometimes defensible and occasionally the only right thing to do while it s easy to get high and mighty about truth telling the reality of political mistruths and falsehoods is more prosaic than that a lie requires knowledge and intention which politicians who get their facts wrong or otherwise err rarely have instead what they re guilty of is to use the technical term cocking up no one is perfect though the sanctimony of some commentators sometimes suggests otherwise when it comes to mistakes untruths and embellishments our current federal leaders don t have the market cornered both sides do it and have for as far back as there is recorded history and while it s fair to expect an mp who gets it wrong to say sorry and correct the record the high dudgeon put them in the stocks approach seems a bit naïve and way too old testament our representatives are busy and they get far more scrutiny and of a more exacting nature than in the past more than one has described it as living in a fishbowl while peccadillos as large as marital infidelity were once kept secret by the press corps today citizen journalists equipped with cameras and instant direct access to an audience can and do scrutinise our leaders every move every word they write or say can be instantly checked for originality and veracity who among us wouldn t have a bad day every so often under such conditions not because today s crop of politicians is any more casual with the truth than their predecessors but because our capacity to hold them accountable has expanded and become so much simpler to use we all need to take a deep breath australia is not the us insofar as the us really is at risk of losing its democracy a cassandra prediction i ll leave for another day the reasons for that cannot be reduced to a single one term president who did an awful lot of lying they just like the phenomenon of lying are more complicated than that which side do you think cannold sits on and what do you believe send your thoughts to letters crikey com au with both sides now lies in the subject line please include
