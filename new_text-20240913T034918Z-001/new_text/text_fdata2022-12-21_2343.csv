in this article we talk about the 12 most advanced countries in asia you can skip our detailed analysis of development on the asian continent and go directly to 5 most advanced countries in asia asian century the 21st century is exceedingly regarded as the asian century primarily due to the overall slowing economic growth in the western world relative to asia mckinsey estimates suggest that asia could account for over 50 of world s gdp by 2040 with asian consumers driving 40 of the world s consumption by that time higher consumer demand results from an expanding middle class with the world economic forum estimating that 2 out 3 members from the global middle class will be asian by 2030 on the corporate front asian companies are adding an average of 19 trillion to the global economy every year with alibaba group holding limited nyse baba toyota motor corporation nyse tm sea limited nyse se and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited nyse tsm being some of the biggest names the level of asia s technological development is also one of the highest in the world with china south korea and japan collectively contributing 30 share in exports in global knowledge and technology intensive kti industries china s share is 17 while japan and south korea make up 7 and 6 respectively as of 2018 according to the us national science foundation investment trends according to fdi intelligence singapore was the biggest recipient of greenfield foreign direct investment fdi as for the first two quarters of 2022 within the asean bloc foreign companies announced 142 projects in the city state that amount to over 8 billion it was followed by china with inflowing fdi at 6 billion for the same period when it comes to the annual outlook india has surpassed china receiving 60 billion in greenfield fdi so far for 2022 while its outgoing greenfield investments made up 35 billion according to numbers from the un overall asian greenfield fdi grew by 6 for the year asian economic sectors the continent is represented across many sectors but by far it dominates the manufacturing industry and within manufacturing asia s greatest edge is in the chip industry almost the entire technological ecosystem in the world relies on asia for chip manufacturing the region accounts for a whopping 75 of the global chip manufacturing industry with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited nyse tsm and samsung electronics co ltd kse 005930 ks collectively accounting for a staggering 69 of the global market share both are frontier companies in chip technology with the current fabrication process at 5nm taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company nyse tsm and samsung electronics co ltd kse 005930 ks are both expected to move to 2nm chips in 2025 pushing the limits of moore s law the recent chip shortage due to supply chain constraints has resulted in the us and eu taking steps to enhance the domestic chip production capacity however experts believe such moves would not be cost effective according to boston consulting group manufacturing chips in the us would cost 30 more to the us economy than relying on taiwan and 60 more than relying on china in this respect asia is well placed to keep dominating the manufacturing sector especially the chip industry and even increase its market share due to the cost advantage and manufacturing

legislation to open banking services to marijuana businesses was left out of a must pass government funding package ending a year end effort to move it to president biden s desk a person familiar with the decision said the bill s senate sponsors oregon democrat jeff merkley and montana republican steve daines had pushed to include a version of the safe banking act in the roughly 1 7 trillion funding measure but ultimately it did not make the cut this is the third failed attempt this year to get the measure passed with a larger package daniel acker bloomberg businesses operating in states where marijuana is legal have faced barriers to financial institutions because it remains illegal at the federal level forcing many of these businesses to deal only in cash or create workarounds to the banking system the most popular of which was recently shut down the safe banking act would prohibit federal regulators from penalizing banks and other depository institutions for providing services to legal cannabis businesses it would have been a huge boon to marijuana companies which have lobbied for the bill as the least controversial form of federal legislation that they ve sought over the past years we understand that the senate failed to enact safe missing an opportunity to pass one of the rare pieces of legislation that has the support of both republicans and democrats along with the majority of the american people said kadijah tribble chief executive of the us cannabis council which represents many of the industry s largest companies cannabis stocks fell steeply in tuesday trading on the reports of safe banking s failure leaving the advisorshares pure us cannabis etf down 18 for the session and 72 for the year the two biggest multistate sellers of cannabis by market cap curaleaf holdings and green thumb industries were off 17 and 12 for tuesday s session respectively the house passed the bill last year on a 321 101 vote but the measure never got consideration on the senate floor the bill has nine republican co sponsors in the senate and democrats would have needed the support of at least one more gop senator to avoid a filibuster but moving it as part of the large spending package created a political hurdle one of the bill s gop co sponsors sen cynthia lummis argued the legislation should have been considered on the floor on its own the bill would have to be reintroduced during the next session of congress which begins jan 3 but it is unclear whether the new republican majority in the house would bring the measure to the floor
jpmorgan chase s recent progress report on its 2020 commitment to racial equity lacks both methodological clarity and guidance on how the bank could improve some shareholders said tuesday america s largest bank in november released a report outlining 18 2 billion of the 30 billion it promised to direct toward programs and services that are designed to narrow the racial wealth gap but the report which was audited by jpmorgan s longtime accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers drew criticism tuesday from the shareholder group that pushed for its creation that group gave a more favorable review of a racial equity audit report released by citigroup on monday jpmorgan chase last month released a report audited by its longtime auditor pricewaterhousecoopers outlining 18 2 billion of its 30 billion commitment to advance racial equity chris ratcliffe bloomberg the jpmorgan report only reveals surface level details about the bank s work toward its stated goals of providing more opportunities for homeownership increasing access to affordable housing and bettering the financial health of black latino and hispanic households in the u s it just really missed the mark said tejal patel corporate governance director at soc investment group which works with pension funds there was a fundamental misunderstanding of what a racial equity audit is banks small and large launched initiatives to redouble their work toward racial equity in 2020 in the wake of protests sparked by the murder of george floyd now financial institutions are taking stock of their progress so far jpmorgan said its report did it exactly what it was designed to do it examined our racial equity commitment to date and found that we re making substantial progress with more work to do jpmorgan said in a statement among the criticisms leveled against jpmorgan the bank wrote the report itself and had it vetted by a third party instead of engaging a third party to write the report the report didn t assess diversity equity and inclusion issues within the bank and much of the funds that reportedly constitute parts of the bank s 30 billion commitment were related to existing loans and programs at jpmorgan it s unsurprising that jpmorgan seems to think its regular business operations are racial equity work when its business model has for centuries been predicated on extracting wealth from black and brown communities saqib bhatti co executive director of the action center on race and the economy an advocacy group that challenges the status quo at financial institutions said in a statement citi s audit on the other hand drew praise from soc for providing an independent review of the megabank s racial equity initiative rolled out in september 2020 citi s 1 billion plan action for racial equity has four goals expanding banking and access to credit in communities of color investing in black entrepreneurs investing in affordable housing while supporting more black homeownership and becoming an anti racist institution by improving citi s policies and practices citi was the first major u s commercial bank to allow an outside investigation of the way it does business and invests in nonwhite communities it agreed to a third party audit in october 2021 six months after a large minority of its shareholders voted in favor of one patel said that citi s analysis was customized to its products policies and goals overall i think the report was pretty well done because it does provide an objective assessment with the racial equity lens we were hoping for patel said and it gives very practical recommendations for citi to proceed which will assist them in achieving their goals the law firm covington burlington conducted citi s audit citi brought the firm on board last year to assess the design and implementation of its initiative and suggest ways that it could achieve the goals of the plan and integrate them into its core business operations covington said the audit took place over the course of several months during which the law firm worked closely with a team at citi to understand key elements and status of citi s efforts to address the racial wealth gap and to identify potential opportunities for improvement the law firm found that citi s plan design effectively leveraged citi s expertise network of business partners and resources to address some of the key factors contributing to the racial wealth gap and noted that while citi hasn t achieved every objective or commitment it laid out it has made progress toward many of them two years into its initial three year commitment among covington s recommendations citi should consider designating a senior executive or function to oversee citi s racial wealth gap closure plan on a permanent basis and figure out how to integrate the objectives of its racial equity plan into its core business citi should also continue to help consumers of color build and maintain higher credit scores and keep exploring ways it can work with regulators to come up with underwriting criteria that use alternative credit models according to covington on tuesday a citi spokesperson said the bank is weighing its options and using the report as a tool to inform future planning but that the company cannot share details yet some of the areas for improvement are already in the bank s pipeline for 2023 the third and final year of the commitment according to the spokesperson the jpmorgan and citi racial equity audits are the first such audits released by financial institutions patel said blackrock and state street are expected to release similar reports next year in september wells fargo also agreed to have its efforts toward racial equity audited by covington the san francisco based company said it expects to

california faces a projected deficit next year even if the u s avoids a recession despite the expected shortfall policymakers say they ll maintain spending on social programs though advocates are

situation than the state faced in 2008 2009 where they were running out of cash the governor nevertheless has signaled he is being cautious newsom in october said he had vetoed 169 bills and saved taxpayers billions seventy five of those vetoes were directly budget related with many including boilerplate language that the state was facing lower than expected revenues and that it was important to remain disciplined when it comes to spending particularly spending that is ongoing among the bills vetoed by the governor earlier this year were proposals to expand government funded care for new mothers expand free transit programs for california students and create grants for graduate students in mental health who commit to working at certain california based nonprofits newsom whom voters elected to another four year term has used surpluses to pay down debts build reserves and provide direct payments to millions of californians people who are excluded from our safety net have been the most adversely impacted from the covid 19 pandemic and are the most harmed during times of economic downturn sasha feldstein california immigrant policy center recently moody s analytics rated california one of the states most prepared for a recession citing its reserves nevertheless california s budget enacted in june 2021 committed to 3 4 billion in new ongoing spending and is expected to grow to 12 billion in the 2025 budget year the budget enacted in june of this year committed an additional 2 3 billion expected to grow to nearly 5 billion by the 2026 budget year the legislative analyst s office said the state has 37 billion in specific reserve funds that includes about 23 billion in a rainy day fund voters agreed to strengthen in 2014 at the urging of then gov jerry brown the state also has 900 million in a reserve account for safety net programs the rest of those reserve funds are in school specific and general operating reserves but palmer noted the state can only draw down the rainy day fund by half in any year the legislative analyst s office has advised the legislature to slow down or pause program expansions before dipping into reserves ting s office contends the state has billions in unspent federal and state dollars in its coffers that could address a potential deficit using that money would avoid cuts to programs but delay other projects is it time to spend anti poverty advocates said in interviews they plan to continue pushing for program expansions arguing the precipice of a downturn is the time to bolster social spending not cut it nearly 30 of california residents live in or near poverty according to the public policy institute of california experts expect poverty rates to increase after the end of a boost in federal cash aid which came in 2021 in the form of an expanded child tax credit included in the american rescue plan act advocates are proposing that california mimic that federal expansion by opening up the state s young child tax credit currently a 1 000 a year credit for low income families with children under age 6 to include all children in low income households they estimate 1 million children live in families that would qualify at an additional cost of 700 million a year additional tax credits could make a difference to people like ivonne sonato vega a medical assistant in santa rosa last year she used some of the 4 000 in federal child tax credits on school supplies and clothes for the four children she and her boyfriend are raising she said with prices rising this year she was unable to save any of that subsidy brian frank calmatters ivonne sonato vega at her home in santa rosa if the credits were an annual payment she said it would allow her to plan for expenses maybe use it as a little savings account to draw on when the children grow out of their clothes or save it for a security deposit if the family needs to move it was kind of like a tease she said of the credit it was here and then not advocates said they also want the state to create an unemployment benefits program for undocumented immigrants and to include all low income immigrants regardless of immigration status in its food assistance program we know the projected budget shortfalls make it more challenging but the past few years highlighted why something like this is so important said sasha feldstein economic justice policy manager at the california immigrant policy center people who are excluded from our safety net have been the most adversely impacted from the covid 19 pandemic and are the most harmed during times of economic downturn lawmakers and newsom this year allocated money to expand the california food assistance program a state version of food stamps to include undocumented immigrants age 55 and older the benefits are expected to become available late next year newsom vetoed a bill that would have tested an unemployment benefits program for undocumented immigrants citing costs the makings of a budget problem the projected shortfall is the state s first major fiscal challenge since newsom s office predicted a 54 billion shortfall in may 2020 when the country was in the grips of the covid 19 pandemic after financial markets rebounded and the federal government provided unprecedented stimulus the anticipated shortfall resulted in surpluses the federal reserve began hiking interest rates in march 2022 to cool inflation then housing sales initial public stock offerings and stock markets fell all are important sources of personal income tax revenue in california personal income withholding fell even as the job market recovered over the last decade california has increasingly relied on some of the state s highest earners to fund its budget which among other things takes aim at poverty and some of the nation s starkest income inequality much of the state s general fund is paid for by its progressive personal income tax which voters in 2012 raised on the state s highest earners after brown warned of cuts to health and education in 2016 voters extended those higher income tax rates through 2030 while also allowing a temporary sales tax to expire the increases meant for education and healthcare spending have also paid for increased social safety net spending about 49 of the personal income tax paid in california in 2020 came from just 1 of tax filers according to the state s finance department and in the past decade taxes collected from the most volatile form of income capital gains have doubled making up a larger share of the state s revenue and tying the state s budget to particularly unstable economic cycles to address that voters approved changes to the state s rainy day fund in 2014 the changes serve as a check on spending directing california to capture additional dollars in reserve when capital gains tax receipts are high building reserves large enough for a state to ride through a recession is difficult said donald boyd a state finance expert at the university of albany in new york as a practical matter it is very hard to build a rainy day fund that s big enough to get you through a rainy season boyd said you need huge amounts of money to offset the effects of even a modest recession
washington ap ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy is preparing to visit washington on wednesday according to three ap sources in his first known trip outside the country since russia s invasion began in february washington ap ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy is preparing to visit washington on wednesday according to three ap sources in his first known trip outside the country since russia s invasion began in february two congressional sources and one person familiar with the matter confirmed plans for the visit they spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the highly sensitive nature of the trip they said zelenskyy s visit while expected could still be called off at the last minute due to security concerns the visit to washington is set to include an address to congress on capitol hill and a meeting with president joe biden it comes as lawmakers are set to vote on a year end spending package that includes about 45 billion in emergency assistance to ukraine and as the u s prepares to send patriot surface to air missiles to the country to help stave off russia s invasion the visit comes a day after zelenskyy made a daring and dangerous trip to what he called the hottest spot on the 1 300 kilometer 800 mile front line the city of bakhmut in ukraine s contested donetsk province where he praised ukrainian troops for their courage resilience and strength as artillery boomed in the background the ukrainian leader told the troops he passed through sloviansk kramatorsk and druzhkivka to reach bakhmut in an unannounced trip that appeared designed to show moscow s failure to capture the city and dishearten the russians trying to surround it bakhmut fortress our people unconquered by the enemy who with their bravery prove that we will endure and will not give up what s ours he wrote on his telegram channel thanking the troops for the courage resilience and strength shown in repelling the enemy attacks since may the occupiers have been trying to break our bakhmut but time goes by and bakhmut is already breaking not only the russian army but also the russian mercenaries who came to replace the wasted army of the occupiers he said russia s invasion which began feb 24 has lost momentum the illegally annexed provinces of donetsk kherson luhansk and zaporizhzhia remain fiercely contested capturing bakhmut would sever ukraine s supply lines and open a route for russian forces to press on toward cities that are key ukrainian strongholds in the donetsk province in a video released by his office from the bakhmut visit zelenskyy was handed a ukrainian flag and alluded to delivering it to u s leaders the guys handed over our beautiful ukrainian flag with their signatures for us to pass on zelenskyy said in the video we are not in an easy situation the enemy is increasing its army our people are braver and need more powerful weapons we will pass it on from the boys to the congress to the president of the united states we are grateful for their support but it is not enough it is a hint it is not enough the latest tranche of u s funding would be the biggest american infusion of assistance yet to ukraine above even biden s 37 billion emergency request and ensure that funding flows to the war effort for months to come on wednesday the u s was also set to announce that it will send 1 8 billion in military aid to ukraine in a major package that will for the first time include a patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for its fighter jets u s officials said the aid signals an expansion by the u s in the kinds of advanced weaponry it will send to ukraine to bolster its air defenses against what has been an increasing barrage of russian missiles in recent weeks the package will include about 1 billion in weapons from pentagon stocks and 800 million in funding through the ukraine security assistance initiative officials said the decision to send the patriot battery comes despite threats from russia s foreign ministry that the delivery of the advanced surface to air missile system would be considered a provocative step and that the patriot and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for moscow s military it s not clear exactly when the patriot would arrive on the front lines in ukraine since u s troops will have to train ukrainian forces on how to use the high tech system the training could take several weeks and is expected to be done in germany to date all training of ukraine s forces by the u s and its western allies has taken place in european countries also included in the package will be an undisclosed number of joint direct attack munitions kits or jdams the kits will be used to modify massive bombs by adding tail fins and precision navigation systems so that rather than being simply dropped from a fighter jet onto a target they can be released and guided to a target the visit comes at an important moment as the white house braces for greater resistance from a republican controlled house that s signaled it will put more scrutiny on aid for ukraine in the new congress gop leader kevin mccarthy has said his party s lawmakers will not write a blank check for ukraine biden and zelenskyy frequently have held phone calls in coordination with the white house announcing new tranches of military assistance for ukraine the calls have been mostly warm with biden praising ukraine for remaining steadfast against the russians and zelenskyy thanking the u s president for support house speaker nancy pelosi who visited zelenskyy earlier this year in kyiv encouraged lawmakers to be on hand for wednesday evening s session we are ending a very special session of the 117th congress with legislation that makes progress for the american people as well as support for our democracy pelosi wrote tuesday in a letter to colleagues please be present for a very special focus on democracy wednesday night they are fighting for democracy for all of us she said of ukrainians for his part russian president vladimir putin on tuesday hailed the courage and self denial of his forces in ukraine but he did so at a ceremony in an opulent and glittering hall at the kremlin in moscow not on the battlefield mercenaries from the wagner group a shadowy russian military contractor are reported to be leading the charge in bakhmut unverified videos on a popular russian social media platform showed the wagner group s leader yevgeny prigozhin standing near an artillery piece and saying he was ready to meet zelenskyy in bakhmut at the kremlin ceremony putin presented awards to the moscow appointed heads of the four illegally annexed regions of ukraine our country has often faced challenges and defended its sovereignty putin said now russia is again facing such a challenge soldiers officers and volunteers are showing outstanding examples of courage and self denial on the front line in a video address honoring russia s military and security agencies he praised the security personnel deployed to the four regions saying that people living there russian citizens count on being protected by you putin acknowledged the challenges faced by the security personnel yes it s difficult for you he said adding that the situation in the regions is extremely difficult british authorities meanwhile gave a bleak assessment of how the war is going for russia some 100 000 russian troops were dead injured or have deserted in the invasion u k defense secretary ben wallace said wallace didn t give a figure for ukrainian casualties but the u s military recently put the estimated number of ukrainian troops killed and wounded at about 100 000 losses in russia s military command have also taken a toll as has the destruction of equipment not one single operational commander then in place on feb 24 is in charge now wallace told lawmakers in the house of commons russia has lost significant numbers of generals and commanding officers russian capability has been severely hampered by the destruction of more than 4 500 armored and protected vehicles as well as more than 140 helicopters and fixed wing aircraft wallace said ukraine s counteroffensive has succeeded in recapturing large swaths of land after 300 days of war the u k ministry of defense tweeted ukraine has liberated about 54 of the maximum amount of extra territory russia seized in the invasion it didn t say what portion of ukrainian territory russia controlled at the peak of its gains russia now controls about 18 of internationally recognized areas of ukraine including those parts of the eastern donbas and the crimean peninsula seized in 2014 with the fighting in the east at a stalemate moscow has used missiles and drones to attack ukraine s power equipment hoping to leave people without electricity as freezing weather sets in life in the ukrainian capital took a minor but welcomed step toward normality with the reopening of two of kyiv s main subway stations for the first time since the war began the key hubs of maidan nezalezhnosti and khreschatyk like the capital s other underground stations have served as air raid shelters it s the feeling that despite

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the large increase in direct hire revenues in fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 was driven by several factors including volatility and shortages in the labor markets which created a stronger demand environment particularly for highly skilled personnel this appears to have been a motivating factor for businesses to fill open positions with permanent employees rather than contract employees also the growing proportion of remote workers in the workforce appears to be motivating some employers to favor permanent hires over contractors so that they may maintain direct access and control for purposes of security over their networks and other assets gee group has been successful in meeting the increased demand for permanent placements and growing

industrial staffing services revenues were 4 0 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 down 0 4 million or 9 as compared with 4 4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the year over year

file patriot missiles are seen at the rzeszow jasionka airport march 25 2022 in jasionka poland the u s will send 1 8 billion in military aid to ukraine in a massive package that will for the first time include a patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for their fighter jets u s officials said tuesday dec 20 2022 as the biden administration prepares to welcome ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy to washington ap photo evan vucci file the u s will send 1 8 billion in military aid to ukraine in a massive package that will for the first time include a patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for their fighter jets u s officials said tuesday as the biden administration prepares to welcome ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy to washington u s officials described details of the aid on condition of anonymity because it has not yet been announced the aid signals an expansion by the u s in the kinds of advanced weaponry it will send to ukraine to bolster the country s air defenses against what has been an increasing barrage of russian missile strikes advertisement the package which was expected to be announced wednesday will include about 1 billion in weapons from pentagon stocks and another 800 million in funding through the ukraine security assistance initiative which funds weapons ammunition training and other assistance officials said zelenskyy and other ukraine officials have pressed western leaders to provide more advanced weapons including the patriots to help their country in its war with russia the patriot would be the most advanced surface to air missile system the west has provided to ukraine to help repel russian aerial attacks the timing of the military aid announcement as zelenskyy makes his first trip out of ukraine since the war began sends a strong message of continued u s support for ukraine as the war drags on the aid comes as congress is poised to approve another 44 9 billion in assistance for ukraine as part of a massive spending bill that would ensure that u s support will continue next year and beyond as republicans take control of the house in january some gop lawmakers have expressed wariness about the assistance advertisement during the quick trip zelenskyy is expected to meet with biden at the white house take questions from the press and deliver an address before congress white house officials said the visit which will come 10 months after the russian invasion is meant to help underscore biden s message that the u s will be there for ukraine for as long as it takes to repel russian forces biden and zelenskyy spoke about the possibility of the visit during their dec 11 call and the white house formally extended the invitation three days later the decision to send the patriot battery comes despite threats from russia s foreign ministry that the delivery of the advanced surface to air missile system would be considered a provocative step and that the patriot and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for moscow s military advertisement but the white house is pushing back against the notion that delivery of the patriot amounts to an escalation of u s involvement on behalf of ukraine a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity said that biden has been clear that his administration would lean forward in supporting ukraine but it is not seeking to engage in direct war with russia it s not clear exactly when the patriot would arrive on the front lines in ukraine since u s troops will have to train ukrainian forces on how to use the high tech system the training could take several weeks and is expected to be done at the grafenwoehr training area in germany to date all training of ukraine forces by the u s and the west has taken place in european countries also included in the package will be an undisclosed number of joint direct attack munitions kits or jdams officials said the kits will be used to modify massive bombs by adding tail fins and precision navigation systems so that rather than being simply dropped from a fighter jet onto a target they can be released and guided to a target advertisement u s fighter and bomber aircraft use the jdams and the pentagon has been working to modify them so they can be used by ukraine the u s so far has been reluctant to provide ukraine with american fighter jets russia has warned the the advanced aircraft would be considered provocative and the u s to date has said other weaponry would be a better fit citing the significant maintenance and training needs for those warplanes so instead of providing ukraine those u s aircraft the pentagon is helping kyiv find innovative ways to upgrade its fleet with the same capabilities it would get with a u s fighter jet advertisement the aid package will also include an undisclosed number of rockets for the high mobility artillery rocket system thousands of artillery and mortar rounds trucks and harm air to surface anti radiation missiles according to officials the urgent pleadings of ukrainian leaders and the devastating destruction of the country s civilian infrastructure including loss of electricity and heat during winter ultimately overcame u s reservations about supplying the patriots white house and pentagon leaders have said consistently that providing ukraine with additional air defenses is a priority and patriot missiles have been under consideration for some time officials said that as the winter closed in and the russian bombardment of civilian infrastructure escalated that consideration took on increased priority advertisement u s officials had balked at providing the patriots to ukraine because they could be considered a escalation that would trigger a response from moscow in addition there were concerns about the significant training that would be required and questions about whether u s troops would have been required to operate it biden has flatly rejected sending any u s combat troops to ukraine one patriot battery routinely includes up to eight launchers each of which can hold four missiles it would be coming from pentagon training stocks in the u s the entire system which includes a phased array radar a control station computers and generators typically requires about 90 soldiers to operate and maintain however only three soldiers are needed to actually fire it according to the army advertisement ___ associated press writer aamer madhani contributed to this report
washington gov jay inslee and attorney general bob ferguson are demanding lawmakers sign off on a number of new gun control restrictions when the 2023 session kicks off in olympia including a ban on the sale and manufacture of so called assault weapons and a measure to make it easier to sue gun makers and sellers when a gun is used in the commission of a crime that s bad enough as is but the pair are also pushing for another new restriction on washington state residents a permit to purchase a firearm you need to get a license to drive a car in the state of washington you need to get a license to go fishing it s time that you get a license to make sure that you have safety training to purchase a gun in the state of washington inslee said it s high time that we pass a bill to make sure that you get a permit before you purchase a firearm you don t actually need to have a license to drive a car on your own property nor do you need a fishing license before casting your line in a stock pond or private lake but in order for you to keep a firearm in your own home inslee believes you should not only have to pass a background check when you purchase your gun washington state has universal background checks so supposedly every firearm transfer is already scrutinized by the government but first receive a permission slip from the state or county before you can exercise your fundamental civil right to keep one the governor said he believes legislation to have a permit might be the single most important gun safety measure that legislators can pass next year citing a 40 reduction in gun violence in connecticut after similar legislation passed in 1995 in that state you can read the study abstract for yourself at the link above but suffice it to say that it offers no proof that the state s gun violence rate was reduced by 40 in the ten years after its permit to purchase law took effect the study s authors acknowledge that number is based on comparing the state s homicide rate between 1995 and 2005 to what they would have expected had the law not been implemented how s connecticut s permit to purchase law working out in the real world well you can ask the residents of the state capitol of hartford where homicides are currently the highest they ve been in decades somehow despite all of connecticut s gun laws violent criminals are still finding little difficult in getting a gun while avoiding the hoops and hurdles that law abiding citizens must go through from a legal perspective the constitutionality of inslee s proposal is also dubious at best even the pro gun control website the trace admitted as much shortly after the supreme court s decision in bruen bemoaning the fact that permit to purchase laws are very much in doubt thanks to their similarity to the may issue concealed carry laws the court declared invalid in its opinion the court s majority specified a 77 year span of history that lower courts should look to when determining the constitutionality of gun regulations from 1791 when the second amendment was ratified to 1868 when the 14th amendment which the supreme court has interpreted to apply the bill of rights to the states was ratified during that period permit to purchase laws do appear to have a historical analogue to today but for only one group black americans in 1828 florida passed a law requiring formerly enslaved people to obtain a license from a justice of the peace in order to use and carry a gun delaware followed three years later in 1865 just as the civil war drew to a close mississippi enacted a law requiring free black people to obtain a license from the board of police of his or her county to keep firearms of any kind or any ammunition that same year in louisiana black residents were required to seek approval from police and their employer if they wanted to own a gun this is where the new methodology runs into trouble because we have a history of racist gun laws said adam winkler a professor at ucla school of law how do you even conceptualize those in a history and tradition on one hand you d say to ignore them because they re racist and thus unconstitutional the racial disparities that were blindingly obvious in the jim crow era are still around today even when the laws are couched in racially neutral language one recent study that looked at the permit to purchase system in wake county north carolina found that black applicants were almost three times as likely to be denied compared to white applicants of course gun control activists largely ignore that inconvenient fact and sometimes even federal judges do too as in the case of u s district judge karen immergut who recently declined to block oregon s permit to purchase law on the grounds that the scheme was shall issue in nature and therefore constitutionally sound that s not really the case however given that the law allows the issuing authority to deny a permit if they claim to have reasonable grounds to believe you have been or are reasonably likely to be a danger to yourself or to the community at large as a result of your mental or psychological state or as demonstrated by your past pattern of behavior involving unlawful violence or threats of unlawful violence that s a loophole big enough to drive a semi truck through as even some progressives in the oregon have pointed out we don t know what the exact language of the proposed permit to purchase legislation will look like in washington but my guess is that it will closely resemble that of measure 114 despite immergut s ruling the permit to purchase scheme in oregon is still on hold thanks both to a circuit court judge who granted an injunction based on the likelihood that the measure violates the rights of oregonians under the state constitution and washington state has its own language protecting the right to keep and bear arms in its own guiding document article 1 section 24 states the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself or the state shall not be impaired but nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize maintain or employ an armed body of men that might not be explicit enough for the ninth circuit but i suspect that there s at least one circuit or county judge in washington state who would agree that a permit to purchase would indeed impair the right of individual citizens to bear arms in self defense not only in public but in their own private homes of course it s always better to defeat a bad bill than overturn a bad law in court and based on the full court press that inslee and ferguson are currently engaged in my guess is that they re not yet assured that they have the necessary votes despite their democratic majorities in both chambers washington state gun owners need to get and stay engaged with their own representatives and state senators starting now because anti gun politicians are going to hit the ground running once the 2023 session gets underway

most people in the uk drive a vehicle in today s world having a car to drive around and remain independent is necessary considering the quick advancement in technology and how the world is moving staying agile and mobile is a gift that should be taken seriously however purchasing a car outright is quite a headache car leasing deals allow you to get a new car at an affordable monthly fixed payment schedule without worrying about the vehicle s depreciating value while this may seem like a dream come true people are often wary about leasing cars thinking they may need better deals while this may be true for most it should be optional for you we have put together a few tips to help you get the best deals out of your car lease getting a reasonable price on a lease car should be your priority after all why else would you opt for a lease instead of a purchase let s look at how you can get the best deals when leasing a car always compare prices most people are pretty finance conscious however if you re not you should always compare the price of the same model year and kilometers driven with different dealers if this sounds tedious you can also delve into the considerable might of the internet and opt for a comparison website that helps you sort through different models their leases deals safety features and more all with the click of a button many large finance manufacturers have in house lease deals that differ from independent and franchised dealers in the uk many large car companies in the uk like volvo and ford also finance their own lease deals however it is best to check with auto dealers since they usually have better offers discounts and add ons that may benefit you in the long term independent dealers also have excellent support from local banks and can offer you better payment options as compared to manufacturers short lease agreement a short lease agreement will always benefit you and help you upgrade to a better car in a few years a longer term contract will help reduce the monthly payments but you would inevitably end up paying more in the long term if you were to lease a car for a period of two years you would pay a lot less than what you would for a car for three years this difference will matter in the long term because you will have to factor in the cost of maintenance and wear and tear of the car for a more extended period you would have to factor in the cost of the damage and any service issues it would also mean that you would drive an older car for longer than is necessary simply to save a few pounds each month opt for stock cars stock cars mean those that are in stock with the dealer not the popular american version of racing stock cars if the car you choose is in stock with the dealer you will get excellent deals since it is already part of the dealer s inventory dealers are usually in a hurry to ensure all cars are leased within a specific period to avoid additional holding costs on the car this is exceptionally beneficial for you since you can negotiate a fabulous monthly deal for yourself and ensure that you get additional safety security insurance and add on benefits stock cars are your best bet for affordable quickly available usually two weeks brand new cars check the offers first if you go down to see the cars first hand it s best to ask if any offers are available on the vehicle you like most providers and leasing companies have ready offers during festivals with many having excellent deals even during off times to promote the lease of their cars if you re not too picky about the model and make of the vehicle you should choose one with a special deal these cars are usually in good condition but have yet to become famous on the road however some special deals may have a catch a longer term contract or a higher initial rental agreement it s best to review each clause carefully before signing the dotted line when inquiring about special deals you should also request to see paperwork and financials in case you want to upgrade to a newer model before your contract expires while regular deals have terms and stipulations about such circumstances special discounts may not allow them

soggy night on wall street and sure enough the asx200 was down around 30 points by 11am ahead of the release of the rba minutes of its december meeting and they were the day s surprise number one the board considered a pause in rate hikes but at the same time they also considered a 50 point hike a 50 point hike was on the table because high inflation damages the economy and makes life more difficult for people a pause could also be justified because there had already been a significant cumulative increase in interest rates and the full effects of this adjustment would take time to occur so they split the difference and we got 25 there will be a pause anyway in january as there is no meeting the market was not quite sure how to absorb this information thus through to 2pm the index remained relatively flat but then the bank of japan shocked the world surprise number two the boj kept its cash rate at 0 1 but said it would allow the ten year yield to drift up as high as 0 50 from a previous limit of 0 25 and yet it would significantly increase bond purchases qe makes sense japan is renowned for its subtlety and that includes the central bank but in terms of market response you d think mt fuji had just erupted the nikkei crashed 2 5 as the yen rallied close to 4 to the us dollar the aussie ten year yield jumped 20 points to 3 72 and the asx200 dropped 50 points in a heartbeat it seems the land of the never rising inflation not for thirty years anyway has a problem with inflation japan s measure of inflation which is unique as it excludes fresh food and only fresh food has hit an annual rate of 3 6 it was revealed in late november oh the humanity the last bastion has fallen bearing in mind japan remains one of our largest trading partners and the yen carry trade has been set in stone for three decades you ll have to look that one up yourselves the extraordinary boj move rattled the local market and has subsequently rattled the world yet while every

washington ap the u s will send 1 8 billion in military aid to ukraine in a massive package that will for the first time include a patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for their fighter jets u s officials said tuesday as the biden administration prepares to welcome ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy to washington u s officials described details of the aid on condition of anonymity because it has not yet been announced the aid signals an expansion by the u s in the kinds of advanced weaponry it will send to ukraine to bolster the country s air defenses against what has been an increasing barrage of russian missile strikes the package which was expected to be announced wednesday will include about 1 billion in weapons from pentagon stocks and another 800 million in funding through the ukraine security assistance initiative which funds weapons ammunition training and other assistance officials said zelenskyy and other ukraine officials have pressed western leaders to provide more advanced weapons including the patriots to help their country in its war with russia the patriot would be the most advanced surface to air missile system the west has provided to ukraine to help repel russian aerial attacks the timing of the military aid announcement as zelenskyy makes his first trip out of ukraine since the war began sends a strong message of continued u s support for ukraine as the war drags on the aid comes as congress is poised to approve another 44 9 billion in assistance for ukraine as part of a massive spending bill that would ensure that u s support will continue next year and beyond as republicans take control of the house in january some gop lawmakers have expressed wariness about the assistance during the quick trip zelenskyy is expected to meet with biden at the white house take questions from the press and deliver an address before congress white house officials said the visit which will come 10 months after the russian invasion is meant to help underscore biden s message that the u s will be there for ukraine for as long as it takes to repel russian forces biden and zelenskyy spoke about the possibility of the visit during their dec 11 call and the white house formally extended the invitation three days later the decision to send the patriot battery comes despite threats from russia s foreign ministry that the delivery of the advanced surface to air missile system would be considered a provocative step and that the patriot and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for moscow s military but the white house is pushing back against the notion that delivery of the patriot amounts to an escalation of u s involvement on behalf of ukraine a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity said that biden has been clear that his administration would lean forward in supporting ukraine but it is not seeking to engage in direct war with russia it s not clear exactly when the patriot would arrive on the front lines in ukraine since u s troops will have to train ukrainian forces on how to use the high tech system the training could take several weeks and is expected to be done at the grafenwoehr training area in germany to date all training of ukraine forces by the u s and the west has taken place in european countries also included in the package will be an undisclosed number of joint direct attack munitions kits or jdams officials said the kits will be used to modify massive bombs by adding tail fins and precision navigation systems so that rather than being simply dropped from a fighter jet onto a target they can be released and guided to a target u s fighter and bomber aircraft use the jdams and the pentagon has been working to modify them so they can be used by ukraine the u s so far has been reluctant to provide ukraine with american fighter jets russia has warned the the advanced aircraft would be considered provocative and the u s to date has said other weaponry would be a better fit citing the significant maintenance and training needs for those warplanes so instead of providing ukraine those u s aircraft the pentagon is helping kyiv find innovative ways to upgrade its fleet with the same capabilities it would get with a u s fighter jet the aid package will also include an undisclosed number of rockets for the high mobility artillery rocket system thousands of artillery and mortar rounds trucks and harm air to surface anti radiation missiles according to officials the urgent pleadings of ukrainian leaders and the devastating destruction of the country s civilian infrastructure including loss of electricity and heat during winter ultimately overcame u s reservations about supplying the patriots white house and pentagon leaders have said consistently that providing ukraine with additional air defenses is a priority and patriot missiles have been under consideration for some time officials said that as the winter closed in and the russian bombardment of civilian infrastructure escalated that consideration took on increased priority u s officials had balked at providing the patriots to ukraine because they could be considered a escalation that would trigger a response from moscow in addition there were concerns about the significant training that would be required and questions about whether u s troops would have been required to operate it biden has flatly rejected sending any u s combat troops to ukraine one patriot battery routinely includes up to eight launchers each of which can hold four missiles it would be coming from pentagon training stocks in the u s the entire system which includes a phased array radar a control station computers and generators typically requires about 90 soldiers to operate and maintain however only three soldiers are needed to actually fire it according to the army ___ associated press writer aamer madhani contributed to this report

click to enlarge sanford nowlin millions of texans went without power in february 2021 as the state s electrical grid buckled under the strain from the prolonged cold front texas main power grid should have enough electricity later this week to keep customers warm amid bitter cold weather expected across large portions of the state the electric reliability council of texas which manages power for most of the state said electricity supply should keep up with an expected surge in demand texans should prepare to endure frigid temperatures beginning thursday night and lasting at least until saturday the national weather service warned an aggressive cold front is expected to dive south into texas plunging temperatures into the single digits across most regions of the state forecasters expect dangerous wind chills below 0 bitterly cold air and hard freezes bundle up folks a forecast report from the national weather service in el paso warned texans endured a catastrophic power blackout during winter storm uri in february 2021 which left millions of people in the dark for days and caused hundreds of deaths across the state many died from carbon monoxide poisoningafter attempting to heat their homes by bringing grills inside or running their vehicles in the garage ercot and the public utility commission have made several changes to the power grid to improve its performance during cold weather since the crisis many of them a result of legislation passed in 2021 improvements include better power plant preparation ensuring natural gas fired plants have additional sources of fuel on site in case of emergency and improving communications between electricity regulators oil and gas regulators and the texas division of emergency management as we monitor weather conditions we want to assure texans that the grid is resilient and reliable ercot president and ceo pablo vegas said in a statement we will keep the public informed as weather conditions change ercot has also implemented inspections of power plants to ensure they comply with the new requirements to better withstand extreme weather during an ercot committee meeting monday woody rickerson ercot vice president of system planning and weatherization said that 95 of facilities required to weatherize have sent the grid operator declarations of winter readiness ercot inspects facilities for compliance he expects about half of the more than 500 inspections to be complete by february crews are out there right now inspecting plants rickerson said andrew keese spokesperson for the texas railroad commission which regulates the state s oil and gas industry said in a statement monday that regulators are actively inspecting the weather preparedness of critical gas infrastructure on the electricity supply chain we ve met with large operators and pipeline companies and they ve confirmed they are prepared keese said the rrc will continue to monitor the weather and work with other agencies to protect residents energy regulators have sought to assure the public that another blackout crisis is a remote possibility peter lake the chair of the puc said during a november press conference that the grid is better prepared than ever we ve kept the lights on following uri and last winter and in the face of several winter blasts lake said during the late november press conference we know the reforms are working and we know that these changes have had an impact the puc is still working to redesign texas power market to implement a reliability standard and is expected to vote on the proposal early next year but some lawmakers have opposed the puc s favored proposal and pressured the agency to delay implementation alison silverstein a former senior adviser at the puc who works as an energy consultant expects most power plants in texas are prepared to operate during the extreme cold everybody who runs a power plant or a transmission line in texas knows that their reputation and their individual careers are on the line if they screw up right now silverstein said almost everybody should be very well weatherized in terms of power plant capability however silverstein said ercot has not been very accurate in its predictions for power demand during cold weather many texas homes are poorly insulated and rely on centralized forced air electric furnaces that means in very cold conditions many texans must increase electricity demand between two and four times higher than normal to keep the house warm she said the commission has done zero to improve energy efficiency and the terrible risk to consumers homes silverstein said to prepare for the weather texans should have a winter kit on hand that includes a one to two week supply of nonperishable food and water blankets extra warm clothes a first aid kit portable lights and batteries according to national weather service and emergency response experts pipes can be better protected by covering outdoor water hoses and draining outside faucets before temperatures drop experts emphasized that cars and gas generators should not be left running in closed areas and gas and charcoal grills should not be used inside the home without adequate preparations to insulate pipes they may freeze and burst experts warned during the 2021 blackouts the loss of pressure in water systems from so many dripping faucets forced some areas to issue boil water notices silverstein recommended that texans stock up on water ahead of the cold weather the texas tribune is a nonprofit nonpartisan media organization that informs texans and engages with them about public policy politics government and statewide issues

washington ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy is preparing to visit washington on wednesday according to three ap sources in his first known trip outside the country since russia s invasion began in february two congressional sources and one person familiar with the matter confirmed plans for the visit they spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the highly sensitive nature of the trip they said zelenskyy s visit while expected could still be called off at the last minute due to security concerns the visit to washington is set to include an address to congress on capitol hill and a meeting with president joe biden it comes as lawmakers are set to vote on a year end spending package that includes about 45 billion in emergency assistance to ukraine and as the u s prepares to send patriot surface to air missiles to the country to help stave off russia s invasion the visit comes a day after zelenskyy made a daring and dangerous trip to what he called the hottest spot on the 1 300 kilometer 800 mile front line the city of bakhmut in ukraine s contested donetsk province where he praised ukrainian troops for their courage resilience and strength as artillery boomed in the background the ukrainian leader told the troops he passed through sloviansk kramatorsk and druzhkivka to reach bakhmut in an unannounced trip that appeared designed to show moscow s failure to capture the city and dishearten the russians trying to surround it bakhmut fortress our people unconquered by the enemy who with their bravery prove that we will endure and will not give up what s ours he wrote on his telegram channel thanking the troops for the courage resilience and strength shown in repelling the enemy attacks since may the occupiers have been trying to break our bakhmut but time goes by and bakhmut is already breaking not only the russian army but also the russian mercenaries who came to replace the wasted army of the occupiers he said russia s invasion which began feb 24 has lost momentum the illegally annexed provinces of donetsk kherson luhansk and zaporizhzhia remain fiercely contested capturing bakhmut would sever ukraine s supply lines and open a route for russian forces to press on toward cities that are key ukrainian strongholds in the donetsk province in a video released by his office from the bakhmut visit zelenskyy was handed a ukrainian flag and alluded to delivering it to u s leaders the guys handed over our beautiful ukrainian flag with their signatures for us to pass on zelenskyy said in the video we are not in an easy situation the enemy is increasing its army our people are braver and need more powerful weapons we will pass it on from the boys to the congress to the president of the united states we are grateful for their support but it is not enough it is a hint it is not enough the latest tranche of u s funding would be the biggest american infusion of assistance yet to ukraine above even biden s 37 billion emergency request and ensure that funding flows to the war effort for months to come on wednesday the u s was also set to announce that it will send 1 8 billion in military aid to ukraine in a major package that will for the first time include a patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for its fighter jets u s officials said the aid signals an expansion by the u s in the kinds of advanced weaponry it will send to ukraine to bolster its air defenses against what has been an increasing barrage of russian missiles in recent weeks the package will include about 1 billion in weapons from pentagon stocks and 800 million in funding through the ukraine security assistance initiative officials said the decision to send the patriot battery comes despite threats from russia s foreign ministry that the delivery of the advanced surface to air missile system would be considered a provocative step and that the patriot and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for moscow s military it s not clear exactly when the patriot would arrive on the front lines in ukraine since u s troops will have to train ukrainian forces on how to use the high tech system the training could take several weeks and is expected to be done in germany to date all training of ukraine s forces by the u s and its western allies has taken place in european countries also included in the package will be an undisclosed number of joint direct attack munitions kits or jdams the kits will be used to modify massive bombs by adding tail fins and precision navigation systems so that rather than being simply dropped from a fighter jet onto a target they can be released and guided to a target house speaker nancy pelosi encouraged lawmakers to be on hand for wednesday evening s session we are ending a very special session of the 117th congress with legislation that makes progress for the american people as well as support for our democracy pelosi wrote tuesday in a letter to colleagues please be present

in an opulent and glittering hall at the kremlin in moscow not on the battlefield mercenaries from the wagner group a shadowy russian military contractor are reported to be leading the charge in bakhmut unverified videos on a popular russian social media platform showed the wagner group s leader yevgeny prigozhin standing near an artillery piece and saying he was ready to meet zelenskyy in bakhmut at the kremlin ceremony putin presented awards to the moscow appointed heads of the four illegally annexed regions of ukraine our country has often faced challenges and defended its sovereignty putin said now russia is again facing such a challenge soldiers officers and volunteers are showing outstanding examples of courage and self denial on the front line in a video address

from a ukrainian counteroffensive putin also called on counterintelligence officers to step up efforts to derail activities by foreign spy agencies and quickly track down traitors spies and saboteurs a russian newspaper rossiskaya gazeta reported that putin last week had visited his ukraine command headquarters its location wasn t disclosed and it wasn t even clear if it was in ukraine british authorities meanwhile gave a bleak assessment of how the war is going for russia some 100 000 russian troops were dead injured or have deserted in the invasion u k defense secretary ben wallace said

s prior outperformance had bled 2a7 assets tax exempt money funds had lost nearly 10 0b in assets in the prior weeks fabian said this was the largest four week loss since the 11 3 billion outflow in march 2020 some of that had flowed to dealer balance sheets whose variable rate demand obligation holdings rose to 5 7 billion on dec 7 some likely into the sub and other exchanged traded funds he said sub has added 1 billion in the same four weeks curve inversions happen only rarely in tax exempt aaa benchmarks and when they do they have resolved quickly in 2022 2023 this would seem to argue for a front end rally which would be in keeping with ust s movement last week fabian said and moves like this he said are more possible in weeks like this one where new issue supply trading liquidity and investor interest are apt to keep sinking into thin trading flows permit larger price movements all else equal the rest of the curve appears stable and relative value ratios are settling just below rolling averages at the five to 30 year spots he noted he said valuation has also been resilient reading as overbought on the first half of the curve oversold longer nuveen s anders s persson

essentially done raising rates as inflation is declining the other believes the fed should continue raising rates since inflation remains at about 7 rates are substantially higher than the beginning of the year attracting new investors they noted additionally managers continue to execute tax swaps through year end they noted munis should begin 2023 with a good tone as there will be billions of

we re entering an era where developmental biologists alone can t solve forthcoming organoid challenges the organoid project is a consortium that brings together riken researchers and external collaborators to tackle organoid challenges and find real world applications in addition to developmental biologists the organoid project includes researchers and technicians with expertise in areas such as microdevices 3d printing biomaterials and bioinformatics this positions us uniquely to become a world class base for generating organs in 3d research under the organoid project spans the four key phases that take us from basic research to real world applications research on the self organization mechanisms in stem cells designing organoids long term culture and maturation and optimization for applications developmental biologist mitsuru morimoto and i work on the earlier phases of this process at riken s kobe campus here morimoto s team has succeeded in developing human lung alveoli organoids in the lab which are now being used to model and develop treatments for lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis a scarring of the lungs his team has also elucidated the cell cell communication signaling in the foregut the top end of the esophagus the stomach and a portion of the duodenum which is the embryonic origin of the trachea and esophagus they have used these findings to develop tracheal cartilage tissue from human pluripotent cells his group is now collaborating with the center for stem cell and organoid medicine custom at cincinnati children s hospital medical center in the united states to create a multiple organoid system that replicates the respiratory organs and esophagus meanwhile my team has established a method for generating kidney and bladder organoids from human induced pluripotent ips cells the kidney organoids have all the components of a nephron the functional unit of the kidney the bladder organoids exhibit a barrier function that holds urine in a way similar to the bladder and we have also been able to replicate the muscle layers surrounding the bladder which help hold and release urine however a new frontier for organ regeneration is to replicate entire organ systems instead of standalone organs from a surgical point of view transplanting a whole urinary tract system instead of a kidney organoid alone could increase the likelihood of a transplant being successful my team is working to connect organoids of the kidney bladder and ureter which connect the kidneys to the urinary bladder to replicate the urinary system a challenge is that the urinary system connects organs tissues and cells derived from two of three types of cell layers called germ layers formed in the third week of human embryonic development the relevant cells here are from the endoderm which develop into the inner linings of the body such as the digestive system and bladder and from the mesoderm which develop into the kidney muscles and red and white blood cells among other things the connections at the kidneys and bladder are a rare point where these two types of tissues connect and replicating this connection would be a major feat research by takashi tsuji of riken bdr and masayo takahashi formerly at riken and now an external collaborator at kobe city eye hospital is closer to real world applications tsuji s team has developed a groundbreaking method called the organ germ method which uses organ inducing epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells to replicate organogenesis which is the growth and differentiation of tissues into organs during embryo development in mice his team has succeeded using this method to regenerate fully functional teeth hair follicles and the salivary and lacrimal glands using pluripotent stem cells tsuji s team has also generated organoids of the pituitary gland salivary gland and 3d integumentary system a skin system that includes hair follicles and sebaceous glands he is now focusing on bringing the functional regeneration of teeth and hair follicles to world first human clinical trials meanwhile masayo takahashi and her team at the kobe eye center have begun clinical research on retina organoid transplants in particular on optimizing organoids for transplant and assessing organoid quality retina organoids come as a flat sheet and a challenge is to ensure that they include a robust layer of photoreceptors previously takahashi s team found that treating ips cells with valproic acid helped yield retina organoids with sufficient photoreceptors achieving this however is dependent on the skill of the technician currently the quality of an organoid can only be assessed by slicing and examining a cross section takahashi and her team are now developing a technique that combines robotics and ai to achieve consistent quality and to monitor the quality in processing early career researchers working on the organoid project at riken bdr have also been working on cutting edge discoveries in kobe hidetoshi masumoto for instance has discovered a way of applying mechanical energy to ips derived heart tissue which will hopefully make it behave in similar ways to real heart tissue while working at riken cody kime developed synthetic embryos that should help us understand early development in the human body and hideya sakaguchi also based in kobe has generated organoids of the hippocampus the area of the brain associated with memory
us to send 1 8 billion in aid patriot battery to ukraine evan vucci ap file washington the u s will send 1 8 billion in military aid to ukraine in a massive package that will for the first time include a patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for their fighter jets u s officials said tuesday as the biden administration prepares to welcome ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy to washington u s officials described details of the aid on condition of anonymity because it has not yet been announced the aid signals an expansion by the u s in the kinds of advanced weaponry it will send to ukraine to bolster the country s air defenses against what has been an increasing barrage of russian missile strikes the package which was expected to be announced wednesday will include about 1 billion in weapons from pentagon stocks and another 800 million in funding through the ukraine security assistance initiative which funds weapons ammunition training and other assistance officials said zelenskyy and other ukraine officials have pressed western leaders to provide more advanced weapons including the patriots to help their country in its war with russia the patriot would be the most advanced surface to air missile system the west has provided to ukraine to help repel russian aerial attacks the timing of the military aid announcement as zelenskyy makes his first trip out of ukraine since the war began sends a strong message of continued u s support for ukraine as the war drags on the aid comes as congress is poised to approve another 44 9 billion in assistance for ukraine as part of a massive spending bill that would ensure that u s support will continue next year and beyond as republicans take control of the house in january some gop lawmakers have expressed wariness about the assistance the decision to send the patriot battery comes despite threats from russia s foreign ministry that the delivery of the advanced surface to air missile system would be considered a provocative step and that the patriot and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for moscow s military it s not clear exactly when the patriot would arrive on the front lines in ukraine since u s troops will have to train ukrainian forces on how to use the high tech system the training could take several weeks and is expected to be done at the grafenwoehr training area in germany to date all training of ukraine forces by the u s and the west has taken place in european countries also included in the package will be an undisclosed number of joint direct attack munitions kits or jdams officials said the kits will be used to modify massive bombs by adding tail fins and precision navigation systems so that rather than being simply dropped from a fighter jet onto a target they can be released and guided to a target u s fighter and bomber aircraft use the jdams and the pentagon has been working to modify them so they can be used by ukraine the u s so far has been reluctant to provide ukraine with american fighter jets russia has warned the the advanced aircraft would be considered provocative and the u s to date has said other weaponry would be a better fit citing the significant maintenance and training needs for those warplanes so instead of providing ukraine those u s aircraft the pentagon is helping kyiv find innovative ways to upgrade its fleet with the same capabilities it would get with a u s fighter jet the aid package will also include an undisclosed number of rockets for the high mobility artillery rocket system thousands of artillery and mortar rounds trucks and harm air to surface anti radiation missiles according to officials the urgent pleadings of ukrainian leaders and the devastating destruction of the country s civilian infrastructure including loss of electricity and heat during winter ultimately overcame u s reservations about supplying the patriots white house and pentagon leaders have said consistently that providing ukraine with additional air defenses is a priority and patriot missiles have been under consideration for some time officials said that as the winter closed in and the russian bombardment of civilian infrastructure escalated that consideration took on increased priority u s officials had balked at providing the patriots to ukraine because they could be considered a escalation that would trigger a response from moscow in addition there were concerns about the significant training that would be required and questions about whether u s troops would have been required to operate it president joe biden has flatly rejected sending any u s combat troops to ukraine one patriot battery routinely includes up to eight launchers each of which can hold four missiles it would be coming from pentagon training stocks in the u s the entire system which includes a phased array radar a control station computers and generators typically requires about 90

washington ap the u s will send 1 8 billion in military aid to ukraine in a massive package that will for the first time include a patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for their fighter jets u s officials said tuesday as the biden administration prepares to welcome ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy to washington u s officials described details of the aid on condition of anonymity because it has not yet been announced the aid signals an expansion by the u s in the kinds of advanced weaponry it will send to ukraine to bolster the country s air defenses against what has been an increasing barrage of russian missile strikes the package which was expected to be announced wednesday will include about 1 billion in weapons from pentagon stocks and another 800 million in funding through the ukraine security assistance initiative which funds weapons ammunition training and other assistance officials said zelenskyy and other ukraine officials have pressed western leaders to provide more advanced weapons including the patriots to help their country in its war with russia the patriot would be the most advanced surface to air missile system the west has provided to ukraine to help repel russian aerial attacks the timing of the military aid announcement as zelenskyy makes his first trip out of ukraine since the war began sends a strong message of continued u s support for ukraine as the war drags on the aid comes as congress is poised to approve another 44 9 billion in assistance for ukraine as part of a massive spending bill that would ensure that u s support will continue next year and beyond as republicans take control of the house in january some gop lawmakers have expressed wariness about the assistance during the quick trip zelenskyy is expected to meet with biden at the white house take questions from the press and deliver an address before congress white house officials said the visit which will come 10 months after the russian invasion is meant to help underscore biden s message that the u s will be there for ukraine for as long as it takes to repel russian forces biden and zelenskyy spoke about the possibility of the visit during their dec 11 call and the white house formally extended the invitation three days later the decision to send the patriot battery comes despite threats from russia s foreign ministry that the delivery of the advanced surface to air missile system would be considered a provocative step and that the patriot and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for moscow s military but the white house is pushing back against the notion that delivery of the patriot amounts to an escalation of u s involvement on behalf of ukraine a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity said that biden has been clear that his administration would lean forward in supporting ukraine but it is not seeking to engage in direct war with russia it s not clear exactly when the patriot would arrive on the front lines in ukraine since u s troops will have to train ukrainian forces on how to use the high tech system the training could take several weeks and is expected to be done at the grafenwoehr training area in germany to date all training of ukraine forces by the u s and the west has taken place in european countries also included in the package will be an undisclosed number of joint direct attack munitions kits or jdams officials said the kits will be used to modify massive bombs by adding tail fins and precision navigation systems so that rather than being simply dropped from a fighter jet onto a target they can be released and guided to a target u s fighter and bomber aircraft use the jdams and the pentagon has been working to modify them so they can be used by ukraine the u s so far has been reluctant to provide ukraine with american fighter jets russia has warned the the advanced aircraft would be considered provocative and the u s to date has said other weaponry would be a better fit citing the significant maintenance and training needs for those warplanes so instead of providing ukraine those u s aircraft the pentagon is helping kyiv find innovative ways to upgrade its fleet with the same capabilities it would get with a u s fighter jet the aid package will also include an undisclosed number of rockets for the high mobility artillery rocket system thousands of artillery and mortar rounds trucks and harm air to surface anti radiation missiles according to officials the urgent pleadings of ukrainian leaders and the devastating destruction of the country s civilian infrastructure including loss of electricity and heat during winter ultimately overcame u s reservations about supplying the patriots white house and pentagon leaders have said consistently that providing ukraine with additional air defenses is a priority and patriot missiles have been under consideration for some time officials said that as the winter closed in and the russian bombardment of civilian infrastructure escalated that consideration took on increased priority u s officials had balked at providing the patriots to ukraine because they could be considered a escalation that would trigger a response from moscow in addition there were concerns about the significant training that would be required and questions about whether u s troops would have been required to operate it biden has flatly rejected sending any u s combat troops to ukraine one patriot battery routinely includes up to eight launchers each of which can hold four missiles it would be coming from pentagon training stocks in the u s the entire system which includes a phased array radar a control station computers and generators typically requires about 90 soldiers to operate and maintain however only three soldiers are needed to actually fire it according to the army ___ associated press writer aamer madhani contributed to this report

this image released by 20th century studios shows trinity bliss as tuk in a scene from avatar the way of water the walt disney co has had good reason to expect big things and big returns on the long awaited sequel to 2009 s avatar a film that earned 2 9 billion and still stands atop the list of all time highest grossing movies and superstar director james cameron s avatar the way of water was by no means a slouch on its opening weekend bringing in 134 million from u s theaters and over 434 million globally problem is the u s returns fell short of analysts predictions for the film which projected the way of water would pull in 150 million to 175 million over its opening weekend according to a report from cnbc that perceived underperformance served to drag disney s stock value down on monday to a 52 week low and close to its lowest value since 2014 perpetuating a cycle that s been in play as the company faces myriad financial challenges disney stock has lost over 40 of its value in the past year beside coming up short on expected u s ticket sales the way of water also saw disappointing ticket sales in china over the weekend a country that helped drive the original avatar to its record earnings china s current covid 19 restrictions including temporarily shuttered movie theaters helped dampen returns there which came in at just over 57 million for the weekend according to the wall street journal only about 35 of china s movie theaters were open when the way of water opened moviegoers fears of contracting the virus also played into the underwhelming attendance numbers the problem is nobody wants to go to the cinema because they ve been told that covid is extremely dangerous tony chambers disney s global head of theatrical distribution told the journal although cinemas are open the appetite for going to them isn t really there while disney s stock value dropped almost 5 on monday shares were up 1 45 for the day at the end of regular trading on tuesday what are disney s financial woes all about tinkerbell s wand may not be packing the magical punch it once did according to the latest financial reports from the world that walt disney built but the return of bob iger last month the longtime disney head who built a reputation for minting gold when it came to creating profit for the company is boosting investor hopes that he can still conjure the twinkle of success even as a global economic slowdown looms to be sure disney theme parks are wildly popular and generate a lot of business and profits for the multisectored walt disney co last quarter the company division that includes parks operations brought in a record 7 42 billion in the third quarter up 36 for the same period a year ago however while overall revenues were up according to the company s most recent financial reporting the profit margins fell well short of projections per the wall street journal profit margins at disney s domestic parks and experiences business which also includes cruise ships fell by nearly 16 percentage points from the prior quarter to 14 8 well below analyst expectations of around 20 the journal noted that while it s typical for those margins to decline for the quarter that straddles the end of summer and beginning of the school year this year s slide was more significant than usual and could signal trouble ahead as a slowing economy and recession worries impact how families spend on recreation and entertainment the miss on the parks was a big surprise david goodman a senior analyst at columbia threadneedle investments the asset management arm of ameriprise financial and a large disney shareholder told the wall street journal the biggest issue is that as they ramp back up and things reopen there seems to be a mismatch between revenues and expenses goodman said thinking about next year for the parks even if demand now seems strong that s just today and with the market thinking about a possible recession there are a lot of unknowns disney s park profits bolster bigger bets disney has worked to pump up park profits by increasing basic admission fees as well as adding new pay to play services like the genie pass that allows entrants to skip long lines at popular park rides and attractions but it s also been hit with unexpected issues like hurricane ian that temporarily closed disney world in florida costing the company 65 million according to the wall street journal bigger investments in marketing and events also ate into profits over the last quarter while park profit margins were down and disney stock has slipped some 35 since the start of the year the company and its investors look to those revenues to offset some serious red ink being generated by other projects in the third quarter of this year the fourth quarter for disney s fiscal calendar the company added 12 1 million disney subscribers and 14 6 million total direct to consumer customers surpassing most analyst estimates and blowing away quarterly additions from netflix which gained just 2 4 million new subscribers in the quarter according to cnbc in spite of the surge in subscribers net operating losses in disney s streaming division which includes disney hulu and espn ballooned to 1 47 billion in the quarter per cnbc that s more than double the loss from a year ago which disney partially blamed on the lack of premier access content or theatrically released films for which disney charged an extra 30 to stream such as black widow and jungle cruise since its launch disney has reportedly amassed some 8 billion in losses disney said during its earnings call which came a few weeks before iger was reappointed to the company s chief executive position that it expected losses to ease in the coming quarters but the statement didn t keep the disappointing earnings report to drag disney stock down even further

cytodyn s former ceo indicted for securities fraud his misleading statements hurt patients even more than investors beginning in 2018 and through 2021 cytodyn and its former ceo nader pourhassan told investors repeatedly that a clinical trial had successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of an experimental treatment for hiv and that a completed marketing application had been submitted to the u s food and drug administration none of the statements made by pourhassan were true federal prosecutors in maryland said tuesday in an unsealed indictment that charged pourhassan with allegedly scheming to defraud cytodyn investors and personally profiting by selling shares of the company s stock advertisement also charged in the alleged securities fraud conspiracy was kazem kazempour ceo of amarex a private company that managed cytodyn s clinical trials and acted as the company s regulatory consultant with the fda the indictment alleges that these defendants conspired to defraud investors in order to line their own pockets said erek barron u s attorney for the district of maryland in a statement investors must be able to rely on the statements of biotech companies about their products executives who knowingly mislead investors must be held accountable by repeatedly lying about the development and regulatory status of cytodyn s hiv drug called leronlimab pourhassan artificially inflated the company s stock price and sold 15 8 million in cytodyn stock that netted him nearly 5 million in profits federal prosecutors alleged advertisement kazempour sold 420 000 worth of cytodyn stock for profits of more than 340 000 the government said pourhassan and kazempour were charged with multiple counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and if convicted they would face a maximum prison sentence of 20 years on each count i don t like to gloat about other people s misfortunes but i must admit to feeling vindicated about tuesday s indictments for years i have chronicled pourhassan s escapades as the ceo of cytodyn laying out in scrupulous details how statements he made about the company and its drug leronlimab were false or misleading pourhassan was singularly focused on pumping cytodyn s stock price for his personal gain probably more than any other biotech executive that i ve reported on in my 20 plus years covering the biotech industry in a glorious twist a civil lawsuit involving cytodyn and amarex filed last year actually revealed the alleged crimes that pourhassan and kazmepour were charged with today but even worse than the alleged financial crimes he committed pourhassan s actions adversely affected people suffering from catastrophic illnesses i feel bad for cytodyn shareholders who lost their investments because of the lies allegedly told by pourhassan but i feel even worse for the people with hiv cancer and covid 19 who were allegedly victimized by pourhassan so he could pocket millions of dollars
this year kbia and the missouri school of journalism have been involved with a reporting project called the news ambassadors two kbia reporters worked with a pair of reporters from columbia university in new york city for the last few months the idea was to look at two seemingly different communities moberly mo and flatbush a neighborhood in brooklyn in new york city the project involved community outreach including listening session events in both communities in october we wanted to find an issue to cover that is important to both communities that we might not be covering well enough now and see what we could learn by covering that issue in both communities at the same time here s what we found by the numbers these communities look starkly different flatbush has about 100 000 people and is majority black and moberly has 14 000 and is majority white flatbush is majority democrat and renters outnumber homeowners the opposite is true in moberly residents who attended the news ambassadors community meetings had more in common than you might think but one thing really stood out both places have serious problems with housing after a fiscal crisis in new york city in 1975 caribbean immigrants moved into flatbush apartments formerly occupied by white residents those immigrants took buildings in disrepair and worked together as a community to improve the neighborhood now wealthier people are gentrifying the neighborhood moberly had a crisis too as recently as 2015 the city was the target of corporate fraud which hit the city s credit score hard moberly was once a railroad hub so over its history it has experienced several ups and downs this time residents and community groups have sought creative solutions to this crisis in flatbush it takes the city you can t create affordability david newtown news ambassadors beverley road station and the 6 story apartments nearby in flatbush small quaint houses give way to six story brick apartment buildings ocean avenue is a busy shopping corridor filled with people and traffic we asked residents to describe their neighborhood to us hardcore community oriented said corazon valiente familial said tricia ben davies creative resilient said robert elstein honest said charlie rinehart jones resident pauline brown called the rent she paid back in 1996 beautiful back in the days for my rent was like 580 and now rents are like 18 00 1900 for a one bedroom brown said after inflation that original 1996 rent would be about 1100 in today s money people living in flatbush have to make the housing work somehow valiente said it s a constant struggle a lot of my neighbors have been pushed out that they couldn t afford to stay here we all kind of live packed into apartments and things like that because pooling our money together makes it affordable valiente said it s a general rule of thumb that you should spend no more than 30 of your monthly income on rent for the average income in flatbush 38 000 a person would want to spend no more than about a thousand dollars a month for rent but the median rent in flatbush for a one bedroom is more than double that david newtown news ambassadors the park west apartments at 232 e 18th street in flatbush this newer development is built higher than the surrounding apartments outsiders with well paying jobs move into the community to take advantage of lower rents gentrifying the neighborhood but there s high turnover yves vilus is the executive director of erasmus neighborhood federation a flatbush community group working in housing he said many new residents don t stay for long so because of that whenever a tenant moves out the landlord has the right to raise the rent vilus said low income families in new york city have options to live in rent stabilized or rent controlled housing public housing section 8 housing or other programs but even with all these options there s a severe shortage of available affordable housing and residents in flatbush struggle to find apartments that match their incomes anytime i see those listings for affordable housing that s not affordable for me at all valiente said so how can the housing crisis in flatbush be solved david newtown news ambassadors 150 martense street in flatbush in the early days people would actually take over the building clean it out and then fix it up with their own labor said andrew reicher the executive director of the urban homesteading assistance board uhab uhab supports new yorkers who want to take over their buildings as limited equity co ops where the residents own their building and are responsible for management and upkeep making their lives more affordable and stable but reicher said residents need lower tax rates or low interest government loans to afford these homes but it takes the city you can t create affordability reicher said to the city government s credit in early december mayor eric adams announced the get stuff built initiative the city aims to have 500 000 new homes built in the next decade to ease the affordable housing crisis half of these in the next year today we are saying yes to more housing yes to getting stuff built we are going to build faster we are going to build everywhere and we are going to build together adams said speaking at the event in december until the crisis eases residents in flatbush hope to be able to afford to stay in the community they love in moberly owning a home means owning its legacy jana rose schleis kbia a banner atop the moberly area chamber of commerce building echoes the sentiment of locals trying to bring moberly back to its heyday briana frieda and her 7 year old daughter delaney are presenting the 140 year old home their family is renovating in moberly it s covered in dust right now but you can see another layer of flooring here and then under that is another layer of the original hardwood briana said and then another layer and then another layer delaney piped in right yeah briana said laughing the historic home was what drew the friedas to the community it was built in a different world than the moberly of today when it was a railroad town with vibrant manufacturing and other industries most of that has disappeared but the houses remain jana rose schleis kbia the frieda family dustin briana and delaney pose outside their fixer upper they ve been restoring the 140 year old home in moberly mo upon seeing it for the first time briana frieda remembers saying there s so much potential it s beautiful it s historic walking in it just felt like it had a story had something different about it for me at least briana frieda said but investing in one of the town s derelict homes is not without major costs frieda recognizes it s not something everyone can take on they took out a construction loan on top of the mortgage we also had family members that helped us with the down payment and who have helped with the blood sweat and tears part of it briana frieda said census data shows 55 of moberly residents own homes but like the frieda s new home the housing stock is aging things aren t much better for renters according to 2021 census data the median household income in moberly is around 40 000 per year median gross rent in moberly over the last five years was 686 per month putting the typical moberly rent well below the 30 rule but that doesn t tell the whole story the town s poverty rate is over 21 and low income earners in moberly experience a similar problem to flatbush the demand for affordable rental properties is higher than the supply carla potts is the deputy director for housing development at northeast community action corporation i can t think of anything more frustrating than to get a section eight voucher and to be so close to you know having some help and then it just you can t use it potts said that s because they can t find a rental unit that qualifies potts said many of the people who do essential jobs in the community at the nearby walmart distribution center the hospital and schools are priced out of the market federal and state investment is most often done in urban areas where there s a denser population and the need is more acute housing development in communities like moberly only succeeds when local government organizations like potts s and the private sector work together housing isn t just a problem of people who don t have enough money housing is a problem for economic development housing is a problem for cities that want to grow potts said jana rose schleis kbia jerry swartz stands in one of his many restoration projects after completion swartz hopes the former clothing store can host a restaurant in the small community we re in dire need of that potts said bringing the business community to the table is essential one person trying to address this issue is jerry swartz it s a grand old building when i literally bought that building it was everything was wet in it and it was full of nothing but debris and things that tenants have left swartz said in a building in downtown moberly swartz grew up in moberly and remembers it thriving he runs an insurance company and in the 1980s started buying and renovating historic buildings in downtown moberly that were in disrepair it s a business for him but also a passion many of those swartz has renovated now include apartments we ve got a salon over here this is just kind of a warehouse this has got a common hall down the middle of it and both sides are going to be huge massive loft apartments they re going to be really cool swartz said along with about ten buildings downtown swartz has also restored multiple single family homes in the community he s not expecting anyone else to swoop in and solve moberly s housing challenges it ll be up to folks like him doing the work investing in moberly building by building we are making the city the community a better place swartz said jana rose schleis kbia jerry swartz has been renovating buildings in moberly since the 1980s he says the reid family approached him when looking for a buyer for the formerly family owned clothing store when complete the refurbished building will be able to host a restaurant on the first floor with loft style apartments above connecting some of the dots the news ambassadors david newtown played the stories for juan pablo garnham he s a researcher and journalist at the eviction lab at princeton university the eviction lab studies evictions throughout the u s to better understand poverty in america first gut reaction it s i m not surprised but it s still really really interesting to see how access to affordable housing is so difficult no matter where you are in the u s garnham said about flatbush and moberly garnham said there are some universal reasons why america is having a housing crisis well the supply is low you know and the rents have increased more than incomes and on top of that becoming a homeowner after the subprime mortgage crisis has become so much more difficult garnham said these issues have hit all of the u s hard in places like new york city garnham said buying a house is out of reach for many residents becoming a homeowner in new york city might have been always difficult or it s been difficult for a while but it was possible maybe 50 years ago garnham said new york city struggles with a lack of land garnham said the struggles in rural towns like moberly are different but struggles all the same obviously land is cheaper in rural areas but also there might be a lot of other costs involved like that you might not have in other sites including you know transportation having the people to build something a small city or a rural area might not be interesting for investors you know so that makes everything more difficult garnham said garnham said the way people think about housing in this country is too removed from the communities they re a part of a lot of times we see housing as a separate issue you know and instead of housing i think that we should talk about cities and we should talk about neighborhoods and building neighborhoods garnham said this was a special project by the news ambassadors you heard the reporters caoilinn goss and jana rose schleis in missouri and david newtown and trisha mukherjee in new york editors for the project were naomi starobin and ryan famuliner raye rawes was the project facilitator lorraine hess was the project coordinator and evelyn messinger was the executive producer special thanks to kathy kiely at the university of missouri sally herships at columbia university eleana tworek jene anne pangue and athena rees we also want to thank the people in moberly and flatbush that attended community events this fall to help come up with the topics we d be covering
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video it would be zelenskyy s first known trip outside ukraine since russia s invasion began in february washington ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy is preparing to visit washington on wednesday according to three ap sources in his first known trip outside the country since russia s invasion began in february two congressional sources and one person familiar with the matter confirmed plans for the visit they spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the highly sensitive nature of the trip they said zelenskyy s visit while expected could still be called off at the last minute due to security concerns the visit to washington is set to include an address to congress on capitol hill and a meeting with president joe biden it comes as lawmakers are set to vote on a year end spending package that includes about 45 billion in emergency assistance to ukraine and as the u s prepares to send patriot surface to air missiles to the country to help stave off russia s invasion the visit comes a day after zelenskyy made a daring and dangerous trip to what he called the hottest spot on the 1 300 kilometer 800 mile front line the city of bakhmut in ukraine s contested donetsk province where he praised ukrainian troops for their courage resilience and strength as artillery boomed in the background the ukrainian leader told the troops he passed through sloviansk kramatorsk and druzhkivka to reach bakhmut in an unannounced trip that appeared designed to show moscow s failure to capture the city and dishearten the russians trying to surround it bakhmut fortress our people unconquered by the enemy who with their bravery prove that we will endure and will not give up what s ours he wrote on his telegram channel thanking the troops for the courage resilience and strength shown in repelling the enemy attacks since may the occupiers have been trying to break our bakhmut but time goes by and bakhmut is already breaking not only the russian army but also the russian mercenaries who came to replace the wasted army of the occupiers he said russia s invasion which began feb 24 has lost momentum the illegally annexed provinces of donetsk kherson luhansk and zaporizhzhia remain fiercely contested capturing bakhmut would sever ukraine s supply lines and open a route for russian forces to press on toward cities that are key ukrainian strongholds in the donetsk province in a video released by his office from the bakhmut visit zelenskyy was handed a ukrainian flag and alluded to delivering it to u s leaders the guys handed over our beautiful ukrainian flag with their signatures for us to pass on zelenskyy said in the video we are not in an easy situation the enemy is increasing its army our people are braver and need more powerful weapons we will pass it on from the boys to the congress to the president of the united states we are grateful for their support but it is not enough it is a hint it is not enough the latest tranche of u s funding would be the biggest american infusion of assistance yet to ukraine above even biden s 37 billion emergency request and ensure that funding flows to the war effort for months to come on wednesday the u s was also set to announce that it will send 1 8 billion in military aid to ukraine in a major package that will for the first time include a patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for its fighter jets u s officials said the aid signals an expansion by the u s in the kinds of advanced weaponry it will send to ukraine to bolster its air defenses against what has been an increasing barrage of russian missiles in recent weeks the package will include about 1 billion in weapons from pentagon stocks and 800 million in funding through the ukraine security assistance initiative officials said the decision to send the patriot battery comes despite threats from russia s foreign ministry that the delivery of the advanced surface to air missile system would be considered a provocative step and that the patriot and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for moscow s military it s not clear exactly when the patriot would arrive on the front lines in ukraine since u s troops will have to train ukrainian forces on how to use the high tech system the training could take several weeks and is expected to be done in germany to date all training of ukraine s forces by the u s and its western allies has taken place in european countries also included in the package will be an undisclosed number of joint direct attack munitions kits or jdams the kits will be used to modify massive bombs by adding tail fins and precision navigation systems so that rather than being simply dropped from a fighter jet onto a target they can be released and guided to a target the visit comes at an important moment as the white house braces for greater resistance from a republican controlled house that s signaled it will put more scrutiny on aid for ukraine in the new congress gop leader kevin mccarthy has said his party s lawmakers will not write a blank check for ukraine biden and zelenskyy frequently have held phone calls in coordination with the white house announcing new tranches of military assistance for ukraine the calls have been mostly warm with biden praising ukraine for remaining steadfast against the russians and zelenskyy thanking the u s president for support house speaker nancy pelosi who visited zelenskyy earlier this year in kyiv encouraged lawmakers to be on hand for wednesday evening s session we are ending a very special session of the 117th congress with legislation that makes progress for the american people as well as support for our democracy pelosi wrote tuesday in a letter to colleagues please be present for a very special focus on democracy wednesday night they are fighting for democracy for all of us she said of ukrainians for his part russian president vladimir putin on tuesday hailed the courage and self denial of his forces in ukraine but he did so at a ceremony in an opulent and glittering hall at the kremlin in moscow not on the battlefield mercenaries from the wagner group a shadowy russian military contractor are reported to be leading the charge in bakhmut unverified videos on a popular russian social media platform showed the wagner group s leader yevgeny prigozhin standing near an artillery piece and saying he was ready to meet zelenskyy in bakhmut at the kremlin ceremony putin presented awards to the moscow appointed heads of the four illegally annexed regions of ukraine our country has often faced challenges and defended its sovereignty putin said now russia is again facing such a challenge soldiers officers and volunteers are showing outstanding examples of courage and self denial on the front line in a video address honoring russia s military and security agencies he praised the security personnel deployed to the four regions saying that people living there russian citizens count on being protected by you putin acknowledged the challenges faced by the security personnel yes it s difficult for you he said adding that the situation in the regions is extremely difficult british authorities meanwhile gave a bleak assessment of how the war is going for russia some 100 000 russian troops were dead injured or have deserted in the invasion u k defense secretary ben wallace said wallace didn t give a figure for ukrainian casualties but the u s military recently put the estimated number of ukrainian troops killed and wounded at about 100 000 losses in russia s military command have also taken a toll as has the destruction of equipment not one single operational commander then in place on feb 24 is in charge now wallace told lawmakers in the house of commons russia has lost significant numbers of generals and commanding officers russian capability has been severely hampered by the destruction of more than 4 500 armored and protected vehicles as well as more than 140 helicopters and fixed wing aircraft wallace said ukraine s counteroffensive has succeeded in recapturing large swaths of land after 300 days of war the u k ministry of defense tweeted ukraine has liberated about 54 of the maximum amount of extra territory russia seized in the invasion it didn t say what portion of ukrainian territory russia controlled at the peak of its gains russia now controls about 18 of internationally recognized areas of ukraine including those parts of the eastern donbas and the crimean peninsula seized in 2014 with the fighting in the east at a stalemate moscow has used missiles and drones to attack ukraine s power equipment hoping to leave people without electricity as freezing weather sets in life in the ukrainian capital took a minor but welcomed step toward normality with the reopening of two of kyiv s main subway stations for the first time since the war began the key hubs of maidan nezalezhnosti and khreschatyk like the capital s other underground stations have served as air raid shelters

newsletter how to la every weekday you ll get fresh community driven stories that catch you up with our independent local news subscribe california faces a projected deficit next year even if the u s avoids a recession despite the expected shortfall policymakers say they ll maintain spending on social programs though advocates are calling for more the legislative analyst s office recently said in its annual forecast that gov gavin newsom and the democratic party controlled legislature are facing a 24 billion projected budget deficit for the next fiscal year if the state enters a recession the outlook is even worse with revenues predicted to fall short by 30 billion to 50 billion the governor signed a record breaking 308 billion budget in june the legislative analyst attributes the projected shortfall to california s reliance on those whose incomes often ebb and flow with the price of stocks real estate and other investments those are the same people who get a lot of their income from financial investments said legislative analyst gabriel petek that volatility then gets transmitted directly to the state budget the governor will present a proposed budget in january and then a revision in may the budget which the legislature must approve will fund state government for the fiscal year beginning july 1 h d palmer spokesperson for the state department of finance declined to comment on whether social spending cuts might be proposed he did say however that the governor s priority was to not scale back programs that people have come to depend on or to begin new ones some program expansions in later fiscal years could be delayed if there isn t enough revenue to support them he said the goal is to avoid the kind of drastic program reductions enacted during the great recession that took years for the state to restore building reserves the state s democratic legislative leaders have said they are not inclined to cut recently expanded programs such as the extension of free health care to low income undocumented immigrants which began with older adults this year and is slated to open up to all ages in january 2024 the expansion is expected to cost more than 2 billion annually the budget is in a much stronger position than it was during the state s last fiscal crisis said phil ting the assembly budget committee chair from san francisco we have a significant amount of cash available both in terms of reserves but also in terms of liquidity ting said so this is a very different situation than the state faced in 2008 2009 where they were running out of cash the governor nevertheless has signaled he is being cautious newsom in october said he had vetoed 169 bills and saved taxpayers billions seventy five of those vetoes were directly budget related with many including boilerplate language that the state was facing lower than expected revenues and that it was important to remain disciplined when it comes to spending particularly spending that is ongoing among the bills vetoed by the governor earlier this year were proposals to expand government funded care for new mothers expand free transit programs for california students and create grants for graduate students in mental health who commit to working at certain california based nonprofits newsom whom voters elected to another four year term has used surpluses to pay down debts build reserves and provide direct payments to millions of californians recently moody s analytics rated california one of the states most prepared for a recession citing its reserves nevertheless california s budget enacted in june 2021 committed to 3 4 billion in new ongoing spending and is expected to grow to 12 billion in the 2025 budget year the budget enacted in june of this year committed an additional 2 3 billion expected to grow to nearly 5 billion by the 2026 budget year the legislative analyst s office said the state has 37 billion in specific reserve funds that includes about 23 billion in a rainy day fund voters agreed to strengthen in 2014 at the urging of then gov jerry brown the state also has 900 million in a reserve account for safety net programs the rest of those reserve funds are in school specific and general operating reserves but palmer noted the state can only draw down the rainy day fund by half in any year the legislative analyst s office has advised the legislature to slow down or pause program expansions before dipping into reserves ting s office contends the state has billions in unspent federal and state dollars in its coffers that could address a potential deficit using that money would avoid cuts to programs but delay other projects is it time to spend anti poverty advocates said in interviews they plan to continue pushing for program expansions arguing the precipice of a downturn is the time to bolster social spending not cut it nearly 30 of california residents live in or near poverty according to the public policy institute of california experts expect poverty rates to increase after the end of a boost in federal cash aid which came in 2021 in the form of an expanded child tax credit included in the american rescue plan act advocates are proposing that california mimic that federal expansion by opening up the state s young child tax credit currently a 1 000 a year credit for low income families with children under age 6 to include all children in low income households they estimate 1 million children live in families that would qualify at an additional cost of 700 million a year additional tax credits could make a difference to people like ivonne sonato vega a medical assistant in santa rosa last year she used some of the 4 000 in federal child tax credits on school supplies and clothes for the four children she and her boyfriend are raising she said with prices rising this year she was unable to save any of that subsidy if the credits were an annual payment she said it would allow her to plan for expenses maybe use it as a little savings account to draw on when the children grow out of their clothes or save it for a security deposit if the family needs to move it was kind of like a tease she said of the credit it was here and then not advocates said they also want the state to create an unemployment benefits program for undocumented immigrants and to include all low income immigrants regardless of immigration status in its food assistance program we know the projected budget shortfalls make it more challenging but the past few years highlighted why something like this is so important said sasha feldstein economic justice policy manager at the california immigrant policy center people who are excluded from our safety net have been the most adversely impacted from the covid 19 pandemic and are the most harmed during times of economic downturn lawmakers and newsom this year allocated money to expand the california food assistance program a state version of food stamps to include undocumented immigrants age 55 and older the benefits are expected to become available late next year newsom vetoed a bill that would have tested an unemployment benefits program for undocumented immigrants citing costs the makings of a budget problem the projected shortfall is the state s first major fiscal challenge since newsom s office predicted a 54 billion shortfall in may 2020 when the country was in the grips of the covid 19 pandemic after financial markets rebounded and the federal government provided unprecedented stimulus the anticipated shortfall resulted in surpluses the federal reserve began hiking interest rates in march 2022 to cool inflation then housing sales initial public stock offerings and stock markets fell all are important sources of personal income tax revenue in california personal income withholding fell even as the job market recovered over the last decade california has increasingly relied on some of the state s highest earners to fund its budget which among other things takes aim at poverty and some of the nation s starkest income inequality much of the state s general fund is paid for by its progressive personal income tax which voters in 2012 raised on the state s highest earners after brown warned of cuts to health and education in 2016 voters extended those higher income tax rates through 2030 while also allowing a temporary sales tax to expire the increases meant for education and healthcare spending have also paid for increased social safety net spending about 49 of the personal income tax paid in california in 2020 came from just 1 of tax filers according to the state s finance department and in the past decade taxes collected from the most volatile form of income capital gains have doubled making up a larger share of the state s revenue and tying the state s budget to particularly unstable economic cycles to address that voters approved changes to the state s rainy day fund in 2014 the changes serve as a check on spending directing california to capture additional dollars in reserve when capital gains tax receipts are high building reserves large enough for a state to ride through a recession is difficult said donald boyd a state finance expert at the university of albany in new york as a practical matter it is very hard to build a rainy day fund that s big enough to get you through a rainy season boyd said you need huge amounts of money to offset the effects of even a modest recession
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video it would be zelenskyy s first known trip outside ukraine since russia s invasion began in february washington ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy is preparing to visit washington on wednesday according to three ap sources in his first known trip outside the country since russia s invasion began in february two congressional sources and one person familiar with the matter confirmed plans for the visit they spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the highly sensitive nature of the trip they said zelenskyy s visit while expected could still be called off at the last minute due to security concerns the visit to washington is set to include an address to congress on capitol hill and a meeting with president joe biden it comes as lawmakers are set to vote on a year end spending package that includes about 45 billion in emergency assistance to ukraine and as the u s prepares to send patriot surface to air missiles to the country to help stave off russia s invasion the visit comes a day after zelenskyy made a daring and dangerous trip to what he called the hottest spot on the 1 300 kilometer 800 mile front line the city of bakhmut in ukraine s contested donetsk province where he praised ukrainian troops for their courage resilience and strength as artillery boomed in the background the ukrainian leader told the troops he passed through sloviansk kramatorsk and druzhkivka to reach bakhmut in an unannounced trip that appeared designed to show moscow s failure to capture the city and dishearten the russians trying to surround it bakhmut fortress our people unconquered by the enemy who with their bravery prove that we will endure and will not give up what s ours he wrote on his telegram channel thanking the troops for the courage resilience and strength shown in repelling the enemy attacks since may the occupiers have been trying to break our bakhmut but time goes by and bakhmut is already breaking not only the russian army but also the russian mercenaries who came to replace the wasted army of the occupiers he said russia s invasion which began feb 24 has lost momentum the illegally annexed provinces of donetsk kherson luhansk and zaporizhzhia remain fiercely contested capturing bakhmut would sever ukraine s supply lines and open a route for russian forces to press on toward cities that are key ukrainian strongholds in the donetsk province in a video released by his office from the bakhmut visit zelenskyy was handed a ukrainian flag and alluded to delivering it to u s leaders the guys handed over our beautiful ukrainian flag with their signatures for us to pass on zelenskyy said in the video we are not in an easy situation the enemy is increasing its army our people are braver and need more powerful weapons we will pass it on from the boys to the congress to the president of the united states we are grateful for their support but it is not enough it is a hint it is not enough the latest tranche of u s funding would be the biggest american infusion of assistance yet to ukraine above even biden s 37 billion emergency request and ensure that funding flows to the war effort for months to come on wednesday the u s was also set to announce that it will send 1 8 billion in military aid to ukraine in a major package that will for the first time include a patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for its fighter jets u s officials said the aid signals an expansion by the u s in the kinds of advanced weaponry it will send to ukraine to bolster its air defenses against what has been an increasing barrage of russian missiles in recent weeks the package will include about 1 billion in weapons from pentagon stocks and

it would be zelenskyy s first known trip outside ukraine since russia s invasion began in february example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy is preparing to visit washington on wednesday according to three ap sources in his first known trip outside the country since russia s invasion began in february two congressional sources and one person familiar with the matter confirmed plans for the visit they spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the highly sensitive nature of the trip they said zelenskyy s visit while expected could still be called off at the last minute due to security concerns the visit to washington is set to include an address to congress on capitol hill and a meeting with president joe biden it comes as lawmakers are set to vote on a year end spending package that includes about 45 billion in emergency assistance to ukraine and as the u s prepares to send patriot surface to air missiles to the country to help stave off russia s invasion the visit comes a day after zelenskyy made a daring and dangerous trip to what he called the hottest spot on the 1 300 kilometer 800 mile front line the city of bakhmut in ukraine s contested donetsk province where he praised ukrainian troops for their courage resilience and strength as artillery boomed in the background the ukrainian leader told the troops he passed through sloviansk kramatorsk and druzhkivka to reach bakhmut in an unannounced trip that appeared designed to show moscow s failure to capture the city and dishearten the russians trying to surround it bakhmut fortress our people unconquered by the enemy who with their bravery prove that we will endure and will not give up what s ours he wrote on his telegram channel thanking the troops for the courage resilience and strength shown in repelling the enemy attacks since may the occupiers have been trying to break our bakhmut but time goes by and bakhmut is already breaking not only the russian army but also the russian mercenaries who came to replace the wasted army of the occupiers he said russia s invasion which began feb 24 has lost momentum the illegally annexed provinces of donetsk kherson luhansk and zaporizhzhia remain fiercely contested capturing bakhmut would sever ukraine s supply lines and open a route for russian forces to press on toward cities that are key ukrainian strongholds in the donetsk province in a video released by his office from the bakhmut visit zelenskyy was handed a ukrainian flag and alluded to delivering it to u s leaders the guys handed over our beautiful ukrainian flag with their signatures for us to pass on zelenskyy said in the video we are not in an easy situation the enemy is increasing its army our people are braver and need more powerful weapons we will pass it on from the boys to the congress to the president of the united states we are grateful for their support but it
