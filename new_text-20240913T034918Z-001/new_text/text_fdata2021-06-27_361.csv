this article is more than 2 years old bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices have lurched back and forth over the last month with bitcoin now down around 50 from its april peak the bitcoin price rout was sparked by china s latest crackdown on bitcoin and crypto miners who use high powered computers to secure cryptocurrency blockchains and validate transactions in return for freshly created tokens now michael saylor the chief executive of business intelligence software company turned bitcoin accumulator microstrategy has warned china s expulsion of bitcoin and crypto miners could be a trillion dollar mistake sign up now for cryptocodex a free daily newsletter that explains the world of bitcoin with brevity arriving in your inbox at 7am edt every weekday more from forbes is this the surprise solution to tesla billionaire elon musk s bitcoin nightmare the bitcoin price has swung wildly over the last few weeks as china shuts down bitcoin and cryptocurrency miners in the country getty images i think given the bitcoin growth rate this will prove to be a trillion dollar mistake for china said saylor speaking on bloomberg tv and pointing to china s 50 bitcoin market share and bitcoin growing 100 year over year it s a tragedy for chinese miners it s a geopolitical mistake for china the country but i suppose they could afford to make a trillion dollar mistake the bitcoin price has been hit over recent weeks by china s latest bitcoin and crypto crackdown which along with elon musk s concerns over bitcoin s energy use has wiped over 1 trillion from the combined cryptocurrency market until recently china is thought to have contributed over 50 to bitcoin s mining capacity however authorities in the country last month began ordering bitcoin and cryptocurrency miners to shut down their operations according to state backed newspaper the global times 90 of bitcoin mines in china s sichuan province were shuttered last weekend sending the bitcoin price sharply lower it s a nuisance and a dislocation for bitcoin in the near term you can see the trading volatility said saylor a lot of chinese had to sell bitcoin under forced liquidations and with a timeframe because they had to get out of the country and all their loans got pulled so that s been a big opportunity for western investors the u s has emerged as one of the primary destinations for bitcoin miners fleeing china last week miami mayor francis suarez said he s working to lower the cost of electricity in order to entice bitcoin miners to make the move to florida it s a great windfall for north american bitcoin miners whose costs are the same and they re going to generate 50 or 75 more revenue for a while because the china business has been taken offline said saylor on monday microstrategy revealed it now owns more than 100 000 bitcoins after completing yet another bitcoin purchase this time spending just under 500 million on some 13 000 coins though saylor said he d have been willing to pay a lot more companies like mine bought bitcoin in the 30 000 range we d have paid double or even triple if it hadn t been for the china exodus so we got a benefit from that cryptocodex helping you understand the world of bitcoin and crypto every day more from forbes crypto price prediction is ethereum about to flip bitcoin the bitcoin price has fallen sharply over the last month as fears over a china crackdown continue to weigh on bitcoin and crypto investors coinbase despite bitcoin s price turmoil over recent weeks saylor is upbeat about bitcoin s prospects biden being elected president was good for bitcoin gary gensler taking over the was good for bitcoin and expects a long awaited u s bitcoin exchange traded fund to eventually be approved the new class of regulators are progressive and more enlightened on bitcoin said saylor pointing to a number of wall street banks that have recently rolled out bitcoin related products and the much hyped nasdaq debut of san francisco based bitcoin and crypto exchange coinbase which happened to be the top of the early 2021 bitcoin bull run while microstrategy s stock price has gone into freefall in recent months saylor says he d rather be winning with something different than sitting at 60 per share with no hope microstrategy s stock has soared since it first announced it had bought bitcoin in august last year with its shares up around 400 its stock peaked in february but has since halved you ve just got to be patient and look at the long term technology trend saylor added if you believe in then the next logical thing to get dematerialized is property on 5 billion mobile phones

a meeting at the white house to discuss how to squeeze coverage of what is arguably the 21st century s most pervasive health issue into the curriculums of us medical and nursing schools presumably he thought it would be important for emerging health professionals to be educated about the dire health implications of climate change the complicity of the american health care system which produces 8 10 per cent of us greenhouse gas emissions and the tremendous health co benefits of a rapid transition to clean sustainable energy however unlike the novel coronavirus which quickly acquired its rightful place in medical education by dint of its obvious urgency and immediacy climate change and all the other planetary derangements that term has come to stand in for have yet to be accorded more than token recognition within the curriculums of most medical schools in canada somehow our dangerous interference with the planet s life support systems has not inspired the needed sense of urgency

medical students during their pediatric rotation is not actually part of the pediatric curriculum it exists only because i m willing and insistent that isn t how things should be after all our

the impact of planetary derangement on human health would have become an integral part of medical school curriculums by now it s not brand new knowledge by any means but there are obstacles that seeming lack of urgency for one thing and lack of time and a certain lack of expertise about the issue amongst those who teach ironically much of the impetus for change is coming from medical learners themselves several years ago the canadian federation of medical students formed a subgroup called heart which conducted a national evaluation of medical school teaching about planetary health in 2019 not surprisingly they identified clear opportunities for improvement they ve also created an evidence based set of core competencies which provide a framework for developing curricula within medical schools nationwide we can only hope their efforts are taken seriously by those whose job it is to ensure that medical education remains accountable to the current and future needs of society after all

in may last year elon musk s spacex became the world s first private company to launch astronauts into space the successful mission aboard the crew dragon spacecraft was heralded a triumph in the us with commentators predicting a new and thrilling era of human space travel funded by private enterprise one commentator quipped that it would not be long before tom cruise was thrust into orbit to film a new movie top gun in orbit although there was a strong nationalistic undertone to crew dragon s triumph there is no doubt that the commercial space industry is now very much in growth mode stellar returns the commercial space industry is now very much in growth mode it is attracting billions of pounds of funding from venture capitalists and big corporations who see space as an exciting new frontier to be conquered and from which to make juicy profits it also presents exciting investment opportunities for long term investors although not as toy story s buzz lightyear would say in the realms of promising to infinity and beyond returns however enthusiastic experts are about space as an investment theme it s not without risk many of the companies are private not public and some will invariably fall by the wayside interest in space as an investment is not just being fuelled by a burgeoning market in space travel business sees exciting potential in the wider commercialisation of space through the use of constellations of satellites to help bring broadband to parts of the world currently not served and to drive forward future technologies such as artificial intelligence there is also interest in the development of reusable rockets supporting innovation in fields such as logistics and yes even asteroid mining these rocks are believed to be a rich potential source of gold diamonds and other vital metals and minerals the latest analysis from the us investment bank morgan stanley suggests that the global space industry could generate revenues of 1 1trillion 800billion a year by 2040 compared with 350billion currently it estimates that satellite broadband will represent at least 50 per cent of this projected growth with satellites that enable broadband internet service helping to drive down the cost of data just as demand explodes the demand for data is growing at an exponential rate says adam jonas an equity analyst at morgan stanley while the cost of access to space and by extension data is falling by an order of magnitude we believe the largest opportunity comes from providing internet access to under and un served parts of the world but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars the internet of things artificial intelligence virtual reality and video enthusiasm for space as a key investment theme now and in the future is infectious a number of asset managers including montanaro asset management and seraphim have jumped on board with new investment launches that have a strong space theme underpinning them exchange traded fund specialist hanetf has also just launched the procure space fund listed on the london stock exchange it invests in some 30 companies that generate a chunk of their revenues from space related businesses top holdings include us technology company trimble and north american satellite television company dish network it also has a holding in space tourism company virgin galactic founded by richard branson on friday virgin was granted a licence to fly customers to the edge of space hector mcneil co founder of hanetf believes the space economy is increasingly part of people s everyday lives the commercialisation of space is upon us he says satellite systems and technologies are a major growth market as the success of businesses such as uber and deliveroo demonstrates gps is central to their success just as satellites are vital for providing higher bandwidth and coverage in broadband and telecoms indeed the london stock exchange now uses satellites to regulate share trades and confirm the time that share transactions are executed montanaro a company that specialises in investing in smaller firms will this week launch a new fund global innovation which will invest a slice of its portfolio in firms providing services to support the growth of the space ecosystem guido dacie lombardo who will manage the fund believes the space industry is on the cusp of being a key technology related investment theme space as a concept is alluring to the imaginative investor he says but for much of history it has been the domain of government agencies such as the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in the us yet now space as an investment theme is becoming far more interesting as it broadens in scope dacie lombardo argues that major advances in the development of reusable rockets are rapidly bringing down the cost of accessing space indeed spacex s pioneering commercial launch of astronauts into space last year used a falcon 9 rocket that was successfully returned to earth he believes such rockets pioneered by the likes of amazon offshoot blue origin as well as spacex will allow exciting opportunities to piggy back off this technology montanaro s approach to space investment will not be gung ho it will steer clear of pure play space companies which dacie lombardo believes are still grappling with challenging cost curves and will require significant capital investment instead it will look to invest in support companies the likes of sitime listed on the nasdaq stock market in the us which sells its cutting edge silicon based timing chips to spacex because of their resilience in extreme environments those with a strong socially responsible approach to investing will be heartened by montanaro s stance on esg environmental social and governance issues it will not invest in companies involved in space technology earmarked for military use probably the boldest space related fund launch is that of investment trust seraphim space seraphim says it is the world s number one space tech investor and has backed more than 60 space oriented start up businesses over the past five years it is hoping to create a 250million investment trust with stakes in 19 companies worth just under 100million forming part of the portfolio from day one it has set itself an ambitious target of generating annual investment returns over the long term of 20 per cent retail investors can buy shares in the new trust via a wealth platform such as aj bell hargreaves lansdown or interactive investor or by completing a prospectus available at seraphim vc the minimum investment is 1 000 and the deadline is july 9 although investors will also be able to buy shares once the trust has launched mark boggett chief executive of seraphim believes space represents a multi decade growth story with two key drivers behind this

harvests according to first round production estimates by the ministry of agriculture and food security moafs malawi is expected to realize above average production of most food crops in the 2020 21 season production of maize the malawian main staple is estimated at 4 4 million metric tons this is 42 percent above the five year average and 29 percent above against an estimated total national requirement of 3 4 million metric tons this above average production is attributed to average to above average rainfall and increased access to seed and fertilisers through the government run affordable inputs program aip production is also expected to be higher than last year marking a second consecutive above average production year despite average to above average cumulative seasonal rainfall in most areas some southern and central areas experienced localised dry spells in january and february 2021 seasonal hunger trends this has reportedly affected crop development in parts of the southern nsanje and chikwawa districts in the lower shire livelihood zone and smaller parts of the southern balaka neno and thyolo districts and the central kasungu district although crop estimates suggests that worst affected nsanje and chikwawa districts are expected to realise near average production of rainfed maize which is harvested in the main season at the district level households in the areas impacted by dry spells mostly middle upland areas of nsanje and chikwawa where the climate is typically dryer are likely to harvest lower amounts overall while fews net previously expected that the national level first round production estimate for maize 4 4 million metric tons would be revised downward due to the dry spells increased production in other areas has likely compensated for the losses tobacco auction floors across the country kanengo and chinkhoma floors in central malawi limbe floors in southern malawi and mzuzu floors in northern malawi are opening in phases between april 20 and may 4 2021 according to estimates from the tobacco commission tc malawi is expected to produce around 122 million mt of tobacco in the 2020 21 season against an estimated buyer demand of 132 million mt estimates for 2020 21 production are 15 percent below last year and 25 percent below the five year average lower production this year is likely at least partially attributable to the fact that according to media reports some farmers were unable to grow tobacco this year due to insufficient income from production in the previous season the farmers likely grew alternative crops for example maize and soya but these crops do not earn as much income prices of maize grain decreased from february to march 2021 in line with typical seasonal trends before the harvest the price decreases are largely attributable to increasing market supply as traders released old stocks in anticipation of the coming harvest in addition decreasing market demand as households begin consuming own produced from the new harvest likely contributed to declining prices follow and subscribe nyasa tv sharing is caring

a construction site in new york city the u s on june 15 xinhua with the u s economy still reeling from the covid 19 pandemic and record unemployment real estate prices continue to skyrocket pricing thousands of house hunters out of the market in the u s and canada this may seem counterintuitive for an economy that is still recovering from recession is yet to reach 2019 gdp levels and saw unemployment peak at just over 14 percent in april 2020 the last time u s home prices raised this quickly it led to an ensuing crash that brought down the global economy this asset bubble is not restricted to the u s but is crossing borders and going global making housing or even renting unaffordable for manyâ especially those worst affected by the global pandemic in fact the rate of price increases has alarmed policy makers in both the u s and canada the dream of homeownership is out of reach for so many working people senate banking chair sherrod brown told u s news outlet politico recently rising home prices and flat wages mean that many families especially families of color may never be able to afford their first home according to world population review the typical value of u s homes was 269 039 as of january a 9 1 percent increase from january 2020 between 1999 and 2021 the median price has more than doubled canadian prime minister justin trudeau has also weighed into the topic recently in a statement saying that the cost of owning a home is too far out of reach for too many people in canada s largest cities noting it can take 280 months for an average family to save for a down payment in a place like toronto or vancouver yet real estate is not the only asset class that is being inflated both the nasdaq and s p 500 have increased by nearly 40 percent in the last 12 months despite unemployment near record highs in the u s the nasdaq increased by 39 51 percent in the last 12 months while the s p 500 rose 38 46 percent over the same period the source of the bubble the source of this asset bubble inflation is the federal reserve s fed policy of quantitative easing qe â a term economists use to describe printing money and using it to buy back domestic treasury bonds from banks and other financial institutions this in theory is designed to reduce the interest rate and encourage lenders to lend to industry or individuals to stimulate the real or productive economy in reality much of this free money as michael hudson financial analyst and president of the institute for the study of long term economic trends contends is instead used to speculate on assets both domestic and internationalâ particularly in emerging markets where the biggest and quickest gains can be made in essence qe disproportionately benefits those closest to the fed these asset bubbles show no sign of abating as the u s is expected to approve an addition 2 trillion in stimulus this year and the fed has said it won t take its foot off the pedal when it comes to pumping liquidity into the market money supply from the fed doubled during the financial crisis of 2008 from then on the economy continued to be buoyed up with periodic bouts of money printing before rocketing during the covid 19 pandemic with many of these dollars being spent abroad the central banks of the receiving countries keep them and pay the receiver in local currency but what can central banks around the world do with all these dollars as congress often blocks attempts to purchase u s companies and assets under the guise of national securityâ as with the chinese oil company cnooc s 18 5 billion bid for unocal in 2005â there is only really one option left to purchase u s treasury bonds to further underwrite u s debt all of this is made possible because of the u s dollar s unique status as the world s reserve currency aside from printing money ad infinitum this special status as global reserve currency gives the u s another ability namely to sanction countries or individuals that do not align with u s foreign policy objectives potentially it gives the u s the ability to essentially turn off the economies of countries that don t follow u s hegemony for whatever reason but it is this threat and the increasingly liberal use of unilateral sanctions that are leading some economies to attempt to de dollarize their economies and insulate them from economic bullying de dollarization one such country is russia on june 3 the kremlin announced its policy outline for de dollarization the plan to abandon the u s dollar was developed by the government in response to tougher u s sanctions finance minister anton siluanov announced plans to reduce the share of the dollar in the russian national wealth fund to zero i can only say that the de dollarization process is constant siluanov said expressing doubts about the reliability of the main reserve currency at a press conference at the st petersburg international economic forum according to him this process is taking place not only in russia but also in many countries we made a decision to withdraw from dollar assets completely replacing them with an increase in euros gold and other currencies the minister said according to him as the share of the dollar is reduced to zero the share of the euro will be 40 percent the yuan 30 percent gold 20 percent pounds and yen 5 percent each siluanov noted the replacement will take place rather quickly perhaps within a month even before the ministry of finance announcement the bank of russia carried out a large scale restructuring of its gold and foreign exchange reserves shifting about 100 billion in 2018 into euros yuan and yen added to this at the end of 2019 several european countries set up a new transaction channel designed to facilitate companies continuing to trade with iran despite u s sanctions after then president donald trump unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear agreement or the joint comprehensive plan of action set up by germany france and the uk the instrument in support of trade exchanges gives european companies the capacity to bypass the u s controlled swift banking systemâ a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions and one of the main tools of u s sanctions we re making clear that we didn t just talk about keeping the nuclear deal with iran alive but now we re creating a possibility to conduct business transactions german foreign minister heiko maas told reporters at the time in addition china launched its cross border interbank payment system cips in 2015 cips is a payment system which offers clearing and settlement services for participants in cross border yuan payments and trade at the start of the 21st century the idea of de dollarizing global trade seemed insurmountable but now it seems as if the covid 19 pandemic and america s response may be accelerating the process faster than many imagined possible

along with trondheim in norway limerick is one of two lighthouse cities piloting cityxchange which aims to revolutionise how cities make and use energy as the world wakes up to climate change realities limerick is becoming a lighthouse city according to rosie webb head of urban innovation at limerick city and county council in 2018 the city won 6 5 million in funding spread over five years as part of a new eu smart cities project in winning this grant limerick was deemed the first irish lighthouse smart city which would develop and test integrated innovative solutions at district scale and act as advisers for its region and other cities and regions across europe limerick is one of two eu lighthouse cities that have been selected for a major climate change pilot programme that will give a lead to the rest of europe on how to dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of urban areas webb said the eu cityxchange programme positive city exchange sees limerick along with trondheim in norway chosen to roll out a project that has the potential to revolutionise how we produce and use energy in european cities and towns the focus in limerick will be on the development of a community grid and the use of smart meters innovation in new energy sources including harnessing hydrokinetic energy and storage digital tools and citizen participation to create a positive energy district in limerick city centre these are just some of the innovative elements that this inter agency team are working on to combat climate issues and create a sustainable positive energy city webb said for alan dooley the cityxchange framework means that limerick will be able to deal with the very complex challenges we re about to face from a climate perspective dooley is head of digital strategy at limerick city and county council 21st century solutions limerick will have live data that we can leverage to accelerate the innovation at a citizen level and have a citizen driven solution this is about bringing 21st century solutions to a 21st century problem he said cityxchange limerick will create a framework for a stepped approach to the creation of a dpeb distributed positive energy block which can be replicated by any city the five participating buildings include gardens international limerick youth services limerick chamber of commerce limerick general post office and rooney auctioneers webb said all five buildings have been fitted with metres that feed into a monitoring platform to support a community grid they re all historic buildings this poses refurbishment challenges but we have been working with conservation energy upgrade experts to find the best models to make these buildings energy efficient a local innovation company gkinetics is demonstrating how much energy can be captured with a river turbine to contribute to the energy needs of the block at the heart of our work is looking at new kinds of community cooperation models to enable specific energy projects and in a wider sense looking at decarbonisation and how we can solve climate goals at the same time as accommodating a larger population webb said we have big challenges to tackle going forward but want to do that in conjunction with our citizens to start a cooperation that we can accelerate we picked the historic centre as we had been trying to activate this area and a recent assessment on vacant properties in the area found that there has been a 27 per cent reduction we used to have a tax incentive for the area that hadn t been taken up so well until we actively promoted it by setting up a one stop shop advice clinic it has surprised us that we have had that kind of impact already the project is all about solving some of the very complex problems we all face in our efforts to reduce our carbon footprints and legislation in this area according to dooley this is incredibly difficult to do when you have existing building stock and it is why it s crucial to have a citizen centred approach he said the innovation lab is a city centre space in the georgian innovation district where citizens students and volunteers can co design and co create solutions for better places spaces and communities supported by a digital platform having a shop front in the middle of the city where we will curate events initially is how we are going to interact with citizens to solve these problems dooley said we have a 3d twin of our city so we can bring in building owners who are thinking about upgrading their buildings we can bring them in and demonstrate what it would take in terms of retrofitting to give them a better return on their rental or make their building more energy efficient we would take the learnings out of every event and feed the knowledge back into a database this would allow us to curate the next set of events and continue on until we have a really robust digitally managed citizen feedback loop changing behaviours as dooley sees it changing citizen behaviour is not just about changing heating systems or putting in double glazing we want to teach people how to change their behaviour we are going to start slowly and try to bring everyone with us as i don t think we will be able to solve all of these very complex issues on our own dooley said it can be difficult to persuade someone that they need to spend 20 000 retrofitting their home but we can work to try and demonstrate collective value in taking these challenges on and debunk the myths surrounding some new technology innovations and ensure that people are making decisions around something like retrofitting proactively and in a fact based way as part of our innovate limerick arm we are building a digital collaboration centre where we ll partner with start ups and large companies to help those start ups get on the road if we make the data we are collecting publicly available as open data somebody out there in a university or even someone sitting in their home might get an idea about starting a company to deal with an energy issue in a nutshell the innovation lab is about open sourcing solutions for the energy crisis dooley said we want to evolve limerick city and county council into becoming an intelligent data driven council to unlock new opportunities and innovations with better actions and outcomes for our citizens cityxchange is going to help trigger that he said there s going to be a real acceleration of data required over the next decade and we might fall short in that ambition if yesterday s solutions prevail here in limerick city and county council there s a terrific leadership team and a group of people who are incredibly ambitious and insightful leveraging cityxchange is going to really accelerate our ability to take on the challenges to come
on wednesday the reserve bank of india released data on household savings for the third quarter of 2020 21 this covered the october december 2020 period which means the data captured the aftermath of first covid 19 wave in india and the economic disruptions that containment measures such as lockdowns caused the numbers are disappointing with a sharp dip in the net financial assets of households not only does this point to the economic hit the indian middle class has taken but it is also bad news for india s post covid economic recovery given that it might mean reduced spending as well as a lower corpus available for investment net financial assets have dropped the rbi tracks both household assets and liabilities assets include items such as bank deposits provident funds and mutual funds investments among others liabilities on the other hand are loans that a household has taken net assets therefore are total assets minus liabilities note that household here refers also to unregistered businesses whose assets and liabilities are not counted as part of private corporate data from the first quarter of 2020 21 april june to the third quarter october december net financial assets dropped from 21 of india s gross domestic product to just 8 2 after two consecutive quarters of decline total assets also dropped from 19 of gdp to 12 7 moving to mutual funds bank deposits went from 2 9 of gdp in the first quarter to 7 7 and then back to 3 the initial spike was partly due to the lockdown which cut discretionary spending the rbi has also reported a large number of fixed deposits being broken from january to march indicating a high level of financial distress among the indian middle class however there was a significant rise in investments in mutual funds which went up from 0 3 of the gdp in the second quarter of 2020 21 to 1 2 in the third quarter notably the mutual fund figure for the third quarter is significantly higher than the averages for 2019 20 0 2 and 2018 19 0 3 reflecting increased flows into the stock market driven both by good market performance as well as poor interest rates in traditional saving instruments such as fixed deposits loans fell in the third quarter total loans fell from 5 4 of gdp in the second quarter of 2020 21 to 4 6 in the third quarter since loans are often drivers of economic activity this is bad news this comes as the flow of loans in the first quarter was negative pointing to the complete cessation of economic activity during the national lockdown poor savings will hurt the economy savings are critical not only for individual households but also the economy as a whole since they provide capital for investment india has traditionally had a high rate of saving significantly above developed countries like the united states and comparable to developing economies such as brazil and south africa moreover the lion s share of india s savings are due to households with the corporate sector and the public sector being the other minor contributors in 2017 out of a total savings of 30 of the gdp 17 2 was due to households while still high at a global level household savings have taken a hit of late a 2019 national institute of public finance and policy paper blames this on the twin shocks of demonetisation and gst with respect to micro small and medium enterprises remember households here include unregistered small businesses to add to these is now of course the covid shock although india was not hit significantly hard during the first wave an unplanned lockdown ensured that india was the world s performing major economy in 2020 21 households are running down saving buffers to support consumption and a desire to rebuild saving could hold back spending even as the economy reopens warned credit rating agency s p global ratings on thursday the middle class is hit india s middle class benefited significantly post the 1991 liberal reforms however covid 19 has hit it hard apart from their assets dropping as seen in the rbi data for the third quarter the class itself seems to have shrunk research firm pew reported in march that the indian middle had shrunk by as much as a third moreover research from the centre for the monitoring of the indian economy has reported that middle class incomes were the most badly hit of any class due to the first wave

age 21 she has been making her mark in the fashion industry ever since with her vibrant and flowy colours and prints a lot of people didn t really take me seriously or tried to take advantage of me because i was so young but my parents and family were always very supportive of me she told sunday guardian teaming up with good mentors also helped she said as a muslim mohammed wears her hijab proudly and sees fashion design as a great form of self expression the caribbean academy of fashion design utt graduate said of her approach to designing i want women to feel liberated by the clothing i make i want them to feel powerful enough to escape the echoes of old narratives of what women should be i want women to look and feel unstoppable when they wear my clothes i believe women of all cultures and religions deserve the world of respect and i want people to feel motivated and inspired by the women i dress howe specialises in handmade fabric accessories which promote afro caribbean identity with traditional channels of revenue on the decline with the onset of the pandemic she leaned on her years of experience to survive and ended up introducing face masks waist bags handmade journals and fabric covered diaries and notebooks to her brand she also collaborated with others in her field and hosted sales of past collections she said as sunday guardian learnt in a q a with the innovative women being a creative comes in quite handy in a pandemic that has impacted industries across the economy 1 what is the inspiration for your latest collection pieces afiya bishop of loud by afiya my inspiration for the new collection was plants and flowers because i m home so much it s making me pay attention to my natural surroundings i opened a home store so i also have plants there they are refreshing they calm you i tried to tie that in with the caribbean lifestyle everything that we do we do with some sultry flair i design for the woman on the go that woman who has to get everything done but still looks fabulous doing it my inspiration as well is always how to be sexy without revealing it all azizah mohammed of azizah when i create a collection i enjoy telling a narrative for me design is about creating a story using fabrics colours textures and silhouettes as my characters and plot the collection reclaimed focuses on nature reclaiming earth and humans reclaiming their humanity thus the colour story and textures displayed in the collection is inspired by nature and the silhouettes of the collection are inspired by the strength and versatility of being human natalie howe owner and creative director of dé collette té inspiration comes in so many forms sometimes i wake up and after my morning devotion i am just divinely inspired to create it s a beautiful uninhibited flow of movement resulting in product creation as the owner of a lifestyle brand that is primarily an extension of who i am i draw inspiration from my experiences mood and the energy emanating from colours textures and patterns that are in front of me the brand primarily produces fabric accessories with an afro caribbean vibe it is built to inspire positivity around our identity drawing from the colour and vibrancy of our caribbean people climate and culture and the patterns and fabrics from our african heritage 2 what major challenges have you faced are currently facing during this pandemic afiya bishop of loud by afiya i was travelling less and going out less so i had to really push myself to become inspired to create anything new but it had a positive effect on me it made me dig deep into the management side of the business i started to do some online courses and joined some mentorship programmes which have really helped me as well to know that i am not in this alone everybody is facing some sort of struggle at this time this really helped us to push our businesses to the next level even though we re in a pandemic azizah mohammed of azizah creating a collection during a pandemic has its pros and cons more cons than pros definitely it has been difficult to access supplies during this time however being forced to manoeuvre through these shortcomings to complete my collection inspired my creativity to utilise different methods in design natalie howe owner and creative director of dé collette té the fashion industry suffered immensely as the pandemic forced people to stay indoors and not gather they therefore had no reason to dress up or wear accessories which affected how they purchased we saw the decline of attendance to artisan markets and retail locations until these activities were totally restricted there was a great deal of challenge to source raw materials locally and internationally as suppliers adopted irregular working hours were closed and others that rely on imports were out of stock 3 any high points creating or bringing your collection work in general to fruition in these covid times afiya bishop of loud by afiya it forces you to do things the proper way you really have to watch how you re spending this has made me see what the business is missing in terms of management and organisation it forces you to become more creative but also see the functional parts of the creativity you always have to watch what the market wants and not do what you as the designer or business owner wants there are lots of new markets opening up where i m seeing that the style of clothing is not so dressy but more loungewear azizah mohammed of azizah having to produce and market a collection during a pandemic i have noticed a growing trend in virtual fashion shows and virtual launches personally i think these virtual shows are a great way to reach a wider market and it s a great way to showcase caribbean creativity to the world natalie howe owner and creative director of dé collette té the pandemic presented an opportunity to think outside the box it became an opportunity to strategically pivot the brand in such a way that the target audience stays interested while also looking at the back end of things it created an atmosphere to look closely at how i do things and work more on the business rather than in the business a few high points include increased e commerce traffic through the social media pages and e commerce site the addition of new products and tapping into the regional and international market by the introduction of international shipping through dhl 4 what are some lessons you learnt during this time afiya bishop of loud by afiya i have learnt to really stay calm during the chaos take my time to make decisions always stay on top of my bookkeeping always try to make buying easy for clients azizah mohammed of azizah a major lesson that i learnt during this time is that self care is not self indulgence not only does self care have positive outcomes for you but it also sets an example for younger generations as something to establish and maintain for your entire life natalie howe owner and creative director of dé collette té i learned that we exist in a very dynamic world how we adapt to the changing environment is the bane of our existence we must learn to draw our inspiration from powers beyond ourselves staying positive in the changing environment is crucial and affects our ability to think outside the box howe plans to add a few more products to her line increase brand awareness and manufacture and export a range of products on a large scale azizah the brand will launch its new collection unfiltered romance on august 7 2021 the collection seeks to celebrate women showing femininity as a strength rather than a weakness

a construction site in new york city the u s on june 15 xinhua with the u s economy still reeling from the covid 19 pandemic and record unemployment real estate prices continue to skyrocket pricing thousands of house hunters out of the market in the u s and canada this may seem counterintuitive for an economy that is still recovering from recession is yet to reach 2019 gdp levels and saw unemployment peak at just over 14 percent in april 2020 the last time u s home prices raised this quickly it led to an ensuing crash that brought down the global economy this asset bubble is not restricted to the u s but is crossing borders and going global making housing or even renting unaffordable for manyâ especially those worst affected by the global pandemic in fact the rate of price increases has alarmed policy makers in both the u s and canada the dream of homeownership is out of reach for so many working people senate banking chair sherrod brown told u s news outlet politico recently rising home prices and flat wages mean that many families especially families of color may never be able to afford their first home according to world population review the typical value of u s homes was 269 039 as of january a 9 1 percent increase from january 2020 between 1999 and 2021 the median price has more than doubled canadian prime minister justin trudeau has also weighed into the topic recently in a statement saying that the cost of owning a home is too far out of reach for too many people in canada s largest cities noting it can take 280 months for an average family to save for a down payment in a place like toronto or vancouver yet real estate is not the only asset class that is being inflated both the nasdaq and s p 500 have increased by nearly 40 percent in the last 12 months despite unemployment near record highs in the u s the nasdaq increased by 39 51 percent in the last 12 months while the s p 500 rose 38 46 percent over the same period the source of the bubble the source of this asset bubble inflation is the federal reserve s fed policy of quantitative easing qe â a term economists use to describe printing money and using it to buy back domestic treasury bonds from banks and other financial institutions this in theory is designed to reduce the interest rate and encourage lenders to lend to industry or individuals to stimulate the real or productive economy in reality much of this free money as michael hudson financial analyst and president of the institute for the study of long term economic trends contends is instead used to speculate on assets both domestic and internationalâ particularly in emerging markets where the biggest and quickest gains can be made in essence qe disproportionately benefits those closest to the fed these asset bubbles show no sign of abating as the u s is expected to approve an addition 2 trillion in stimulus this year and the fed has said it won t take its foot off the pedal when it comes to pumping liquidity into the market money supply from the fed doubled during the financial crisis of 2008 from then on the economy continued to be buoyed up with periodic bouts of money printing before rocketing during the covid 19 pandemic with many of these dollars being spent abroad the central banks of the receiving countries keep them and pay the receiver in local currency but what can central banks around the world do with all these dollars as congress often blocks attempts to purchase u s companies and assets under the guise of national securityâ as with the chinese oil company cnooc s 18 5 billion bid for unocal in 2005â there is only really one option left to purchase u s treasury bonds to further underwrite u s debt all of this is made possible because of the u s dollar s unique status as the world s reserve currency aside from printing money ad infinitum this special status as global reserve currency gives the u s another ability namely to sanction countries or individuals that do not align with u s foreign policy objectives potentially it gives the u s the ability to essentially turn off the economies of countries that don t follow u s hegemony for whatever reason but it is this threat and the increasingly liberal use of unilateral sanctions that are leading some economies to attempt to de dollarize their economies and insulate them from economic bullying de dollarization one such country is russia on june 3 the kremlin announced its policy outline for de dollarization the plan to abandon the u s dollar was developed by the government in response to tougher u s sanctions finance minister anton siluanov announced plans to reduce the share of the dollar in the russian national wealth fund to zero i can only say that the de dollarization process is constant siluanov said expressing doubts about the reliability of the main reserve currency at a press conference at the st petersburg international economic forum according to him this process is taking place not only in russia but also in many countries we made a decision to withdraw from dollar assets completely replacing them with an increase in euros gold and other currencies the minister said according to him as the share of the dollar is reduced to zero the share of the euro will be 40 percent the yuan 30 percent gold 20 percent pounds and yen 5 percent each siluanov noted the replacement will take place rather quickly perhaps within a month even before the ministry of finance announcement the bank of russia carried out a large scale restructuring of its gold and foreign exchange reserves shifting about 100 billion in 2018 into euros yuan and yen added to this at the end of 2019 several european countries set up a new transaction channel designed to facilitate companies continuing to trade with iran despite u s sanctions after then president donald trump unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear agreement or the joint comprehensive plan of action set up by germany france and the uk the instrument in support of trade exchanges gives european companies the capacity to bypass the u s controlled swift banking systemâ a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions and one of the main tools of u s sanctions we re making clear that we didn t just talk about keeping the nuclear deal with iran alive but now we re creating a possibility to conduct business transactions german foreign minister heiko maas told reporters at the time in addition china launched its cross border interbank payment system cips in 2015 cips is a payment system which offers clearing and settlement services for participants in cross border yuan payments and trade at the start of the 21st century the idea of de dollarizing global trade seemed insurmountable but now it seems as if the covid 19 pandemic and america s response may be accelerating the process faster than many imagined possible
insulet corporation nasdaq podd insulet or the company the global leader in tubeless insulin pump technology with its omnipod brand of products today announced promising results from its latest pivotal trial for the omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system omnipod 5 in very young children omnipod 5 the world s first tubeless wearable automated insulin delivery aid system that continuously adapts insulin delivery based on glucose levels and trends significantly improved time in range and reduced hba1c in children aged 2 through 5 9 years with type 1 diabetes these pivotal study data from the preschool age group were presented at the american diabetes association ada virtual 81st scientific sessions managing type 1 diabetes in very young children is particularly challenging due to their unpredictable eating patterns erratic physical activity and an increased fear of hypoglycemia from caregivers since these patients often cannot self treat or verbalize their symptoms said dr trang ly mbbs fracp phd insulet senior vice president and medical director omnipod 5 has tremendous potential to improve outcomes and ease of use for our youngest patients and we are delighted to share these pivotal trial results omnipod 5 preschool pivotal study overview insulet enrolled a group of 80 preschool aged children across 10 u s sites for this study the participants who were between 2 and 5 9 years of age with an hba1c of under 10 0 used omnipod 5 at home for a period of 3 months after a 14 day period using their standard therapy which included either pump therapy or multiple daily injections mdi the children were unrestricted in eating and exercise throughout the study the study showed an overall reduction in hba1c from an average of 7 4 to 6 9 and a significant increase in time in range 70 180 mg dl from an average of 57 2 to 68 1 or an additional 2 6 hours per day median time in hypoglycemia 70 mg dl was reduced from 2 2 to 1 9 overall in addition parents and caregivers of study participants reported improved sleep quality as assessed by the pittsburgh sleep quality index psqi 1 a questionnaire considered to be the gold standard in measuring subjective sleep quality parents and caregivers reporting very good or fairly good sleep increased from 65 at baseline to 90 at the end of the study these results are impressive not only for our youngest patients but also for their families said dr jennifer sherr principal investigator and associate professor yale university school of medicine diabetes is a team sport all members of the family are impacted often with far reaching consequences caregivers often have poor sleep quality as they strive for safety with ensuing fatigue that affects family dynamics these results show that omnipod 5 can have a positive impact on the entire family it is also noteworthy that 100 of the preschool pivotal trial participants opted to continue using omnipod 5 in a 12 month extension phase which demonstrates their overall satisfaction with the system and the clinical outcomes achieved additional omnipod 5 data presented at ada insulet also shared additional results from the omnipod 5 pivotal study in people aged 6 through 70 years with type 1 diabetes including clinical outcomes after transitioning from mdi extension study results with 6 months of system use and quality of life and user satisfaction data transition from mdi to omnipod 5 improves hba1c the 33 participants in the pivotal trial transitioning from mdi to omnipod 5 achieved significant improvement in hba1c children 7 73 to 6 74 adolescents and adults 7 57 to 6 97 and time in range children 52 2 to 68 9 adolescents and adults 60 4 to 72 3 after 3 months of use these results support the feasibility of transitioning directly from mdi to automated insulin delivery with omnipod 5 improved glycemic outcomes over 6 months with omnipod 5 a total of 224 pivotal study participants continuing use of omnipod 5 in an extension study demonstrated sustained improvements in hba1c over a total of 6 months of system use pediatric results decreased from an average of 7 7 at baseline to 6 9 at 6 months and the adolescent and adult cohort decreased from an average of 7 2 to 6 7 the extension study also revealed sustained improvements in time in range with minimal time below range adults adolescents and caregivers report improved system usability satisfaction and quality of life with omnipod 5 equally as important as the glycemic outcomes are the results describing omnipod 5 usability user satisfaction and impact on quality of life from the pivotal trial users reported significantly improved scores with the system usability scale following 3 months of omnipod 5 use with a mean baseline score of 75 9 79 4 and 77 5 out of a maximum of 100 to a final score of 83 8 86 3 and 89 0 for adults teens and caregivers of children respectively these results demonstrate that users perceived omnipod 5 to be a more usable product compared to their prior therapy adults and caregivers of teens and children also reported increased satisfaction with their treatment as measured by the insulin delivery satisfaction survey and the diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire suggesting that omnipod 5 may alleviate some of the burdens associated with existing treatment options for type 1 diabetes both for adults and caregivers of younger users furthermore omnipod 5 led to significant improvements in quality of life measures including reductions in diabetes related distress across all groups and improved hypoglycemic confidence among adults and caregivers of children as indicated by these outcomes reduced diabetes distress and improved quality of life are key benefits of using the omnipod 5 aid system that are complementary to the glycemic benefits achieved omnipod system and omnipod dash improve clinical outcomes in children and adults living with type 1 diabetes insulet also presented data

when lawmakers voted this spring to legalize marijuana in virginia allowing households to grow up to four plants starting july 1 customers began flooding into local hydroponic and gardening shops it s a moment for which the owners have been patiently waiting we ve seen a ton of new people coming out of the woodwork saying i ve always wanted to do this but i didn t want to do it while it was illegal but now i want to do it because it s fun so many people smoke weed that we know and love and we just don t talk about it and now we can talk about it said tommy bryant co owner of blue ridge hydroponics in roanoke at times bryant said it s been a struggle to keep the business he purchased in 2018 with his brother jeremy poe open bryant said they thought about closing on more than one occasion finally i think it s been worth it to stay open and we re glad we did for us and for the community he said bryant said he s gathered that about a third of the store s customers were already growing cannabis with the remaining two thirds split between produce and hemp though the latter has been tapering off but the breakdown has begun to change the past three months have been a slow ramp up to be about 90 people are growing so that they can grow their own supply he said blue ridge hydroponics has hired four additional part time staff members to prepare for the new wave of customers the store has also been ordering stock more frequently bryant said they used to order from suppliers once or twice a month but now it s up to once or twice a week it s the green rush we re in the wild west he said it s crazy we love it though blue ridge hydroponics saw a need for education and is hosting classes on how to grow cannabis in partnership with kief cultivation services we ve been teaching people a long time just the growing process in general that s what we do bryant said that s why people choose to come into a local store and not just click online you don t get taught there s youtube but you can t ask them a question paul witt is the owner of kief cultivation services which offers installations of equipment and consultations on growing cannabis he ll be leading the classes at blue ridge hydroponics which he described as a 101 for somebody if you have no idea what you re doing the first class will be held july 1 david rash president of groundworks garden and hydroponic supply co in christiansburg said he watched the vote to legalize marijuana live on his computer in the store he about jumped out of his chair when it was approved folks started coming in almost immediately getting ready for july and it s just increased exponentially since then rash said sales at his store have increased by 100 to 120 rash said estimating that he d match all of last year s sales before july 1 these days when a new customer comes in wanting to get into gardening rash said he starts with a question is this a now garden or is this a july 1 garden usually it s a july 1 garden in which case rash gets them the supplies they ll need to grow indoors or outdoors but he warns them not to get started until then rash said there s diversity among the customers interested in growing cannabis at home it s people that have been waiting their entire lives to be able to put a plant in their yard that they have never been able to grow before i ve got people in their 70s and 80s coming in that are excited about it he said i ve got mid 20s kids coming in that are excited to learn and get into it the younger crowd is more interested in using hydroponic systems rash said while many of the older customers are experienced gardeners who simply plan to put their plants between the tomatoes and the squash he said being in a more rural area where many people have access to land it makes sense that outdoor growing would be a popular option rash said he s not naive and recognizes that some of his customers are probably already growing cannabis but he said he has never promoted it or helped guide people through problems they might encounter with growing every now and again somebody would come in with leaves and throw them on my desk and be like what s wrong with my plant i d be like man i can t have that in here you ve got to get that out of here and i m sorry i can t help you rash said rash has been in the process of moving groundworks into a new larger space in the same shopping center more than tripling its square footage the new location will have a learning center where he plans to offer classes on the cultivation of cannabis the range of questions on this plant is just staggering rash said it s kind of my job to learn how to grow this plant and be able to teach that to people the expansion was not entirely motivated by the legalization of marijuana rash said the business was growing such that it needed more space but the change in the law provided extra justification for the decision he plans to be in the new space by july 1 marking the occasion with a food truck dj and raffles he didn t feel the need to go too big i think a lot of people probably have other plans for that day other than going shopping he said

things change drastically their lives will increasingly be defined by dangerous global heating melting ice and permafrost sea level rise unprecedented fires droughts and storms acidified and deadened

the impact of planetary derangement on human health would have become an integral part of medical school curriculums by now it s not brand new knowledge by any means but there are obstacles that seeming lack of urgency for one thing and lack of time and a certain lack of expertise about the issue amongst those who teach ironically much of the impetus for change is coming from medical learners themselves several years ago the canadian federation of medical students formed a subgroup called heart which conducted a national evaluation of medical school teaching about planetary health in 2019 not surprisingly they identified clear opportunities for improvement they ve also created an evidence based set of core competencies which provide a framework for developing curricula within medical schools nationwide we can only hope their efforts are taken seriously by those whose job it is to ensure that medical education remains accountable to the current and future needs of society after all

targeted news service washington june 26 the government accountability office has issued a report gao 21 327 entitled retirement savings federal workers portfolios should be evaluated for possible financial risks related to climate change the report was sent to sen maggie hassan d new hampshire chairman of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs subcommittee on emerging threats and spending oversight and sen jeff merkley d oregon on june 24 2021 here are excerpts of summaries associated with the report what gao found retirement plans investments including those of the thrift savings plan tsp for federal employees could be exposed to financial risks from climate change according to gao s literature review and interviews with stakeholders knowledgeable about climate change and financial markets stakeholders said climate related events from natural disasters to changes in government policy are expected to impact much of the economy and thereby investment returns see figure retirement plans can assess their exposure to these risks by analyzing the potential financial performance of holdings in their portfolios under projected climate change scenarios gao reviewed retirement plans in the united kingdom japan and sweden that had taken steps to incorporate climate change risks into their plan management officials from these plans described using engagement such as outreach to corporate boards to encourage companies in which they invest to address their financial risks from climate change officials had taken other steps as well such as incorporating climate change as a financial risk into their policies and practices officials communicate information on climate related investment risks through public disclosures and reports the agency that oversees tsp the federal retirement thrift investment board frtib has not taken steps to assess the risks to tsp s investments from climate change as part of its process for evaluating investment options officials told us that they use a passive investment strategy and do not focus on risks to a specific industry or company frtib is required by statute to invest tsp s funds passively however it has previously identified and addressed investment risks for example in the 1990s frtib reviewed its investment policies and recommended adding an international equities fund and a small and medium capitalization stock fund both passively managed to incorporate classes of assets that it determined were missing from tsp s investment mix stakeholders in the financial sector including an advisory panel to a federal financial regulator have stated that it is important to consider the investment risks from climate change evaluating such risks is also consistent with gao s disaster resilience framework taking action to understand the financial risks that climate change poses to the tsp would enhance frtib s risk management and help it protect the retirement savings of federal workers why gao did this study climate change is expected to have widespread economic impacts and pose risks to investments held by retirement plans including the federal government s tsp as of november 2020 tsp had 6 million active and retired federal employee participants and nearly 700 billion in assets gao was asked to examine how the agency that oversees tsp has addressed its exposure to such risks this report examines 1 what is known about retirement plans exposure to climate change related investment risks 2 what comparable retirement plans in other countries have done to address risks from climate change and how they communicate this information to the public and 3 what steps frtib has taken to address investment risks from climate change gao reviewed relevant literature and interviewed representatives from investment consulting firms and other stakeholders knowledgeable about climate change and its possible financial impacts gao reviewed documents and interviewed officials from selected retirement plans for public and private sector employees in the united kingdom japan and sweden identified as examples of plans that are addressing climate risks gao also reviewed tsp documents and interviewed frtib officials what gao recommends gao recommends that frtib evaluate tsp s investment offerings in light of risks related to climate change frtib did not indicate whether it agreed or disagreed with the recommendation and stated that it subscribes to a strict indexing discipline and efficient market theory may 25 2021 to the honorable margaret hassan chair subcommittee on emerging threats and spending oversight committee on homeland security and governmental affairs united states senate the honorable jeffrey merkley united states senate climate change including rising temperatures and sea levels is expected to have widespread economic impacts increasingly disrupting and damaging critical infrastructure and property labor productivity and the general welfare in communities in 2018 the united states global change research program s usgcrp fourth national climate assessment stated that under a business as usual scenario climate change is expected to cause growing losses to u s infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over the 21st century 1 domestic and global economies are vulnerable to climate change s risks to financial investments including those held by retirement plans retirement plans manage investments over long time horizons and the economic effects of climate change could negatively affect their returns and thereby the financial health of retirees the thrift savings plan tsp serves 6 million active and retired participants which includes federal employees and members of the uniformed services and is the largest public retirement plan in the united states and the largest defined contribution plan in the world 2 a number of large retirement plans abroad have adopted investment strategies that take into account investment risks from climate change however less is known about the extent to which tsp and most u s retirement plans are exposed to investment risks from climate change and the extent to which tsp has assessed its exposure and implemented strategies to help address any risks you asked us to review how the federal agency charged with overseeing tsp the federal retirement thrift investment board frtib is considering investment risks posed by climate change in this report we examine 1 what is known about retirement plans exposure to investment risks associated with climate change 2 what have comparable retirement plans in other countries done to address risks from climate change and how do they communicate this information to the public and 3 what steps if any has frtib taken to address investment risks from climate change to examine how climate change could expose retirement plans to investment risks we reviewed relevant literature published by experts knowledgeable about climate change and its impacts on the global economy these included reports that assessed the impact of climate change on a specific retirement plan such as the new york state common retirement fund or a specific segment of the economy such as the companies represented by standard poor s 500 s p500 we interviewed representatives from public retirement plans investment consulting firms and other stakeholders knowledgeable about climate change and its economic impact to gain their views on the nature scope and magnitude of the investment risks related to climate change to examine the actions of retirement plans in other countries we selected three retirement plans that have each taken action to assess and address investment risks from climate change specifically we selected the united kingdom s national employment savings trust nest japan s government pension investment fund gpif and sweden s ap7 to examine how they incorporate climate risks in their investment strategies and communications 3 these plans share certain key characteristics with tsp such as using a long term passive investment strategy 4 for each plan we reviewed publicly available climate related disclosures plan documents and any climate risk assessments we also conducted semi structured interviews with plan representatives to learn about their experiences with incorporating climate risk into their portfolio what options they considered how they monitor risk and returns and how this information is publicly communicated we note that while a particular strategy may have been successful in one or more of the countries included in our review which may have significantly different cultures histories and legal systems it does not necessarily indicate that it would be successful in the united states to determine what steps frtib has taken to address the impact of climate change on tsp we reviewed tsp s five core funds and the federal law that authorizes and provides for the structure of each of the funds we also reviewed frtib documents such as annual reports its proxy voting policies for fund managers minutes from board meetings and reports written by an investment consultant we interviewed frtib officials representatives of tsp s primary asset manager blackrock and an investment consultant hired to review tsp s investment offerings we conducted this performance audit from october 2019 to may 2021 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives see footnotes here conclusions investment risks associated with climate change are expected to impact the global economy and cause unprecedented disruption to the financial markets and investors including retirement plans are considering how their portfolios may be exposed to these risks passive investment strategies like those used by tsp are generally seen as providing the important benefits of broad diversification and low costs leading to greater risk adjusted returns when compared to active investment strategies however even passive investment strategies are exposed to financial risks from climate change as the impacts are expected to be widespread across all economic sectors climate and financial experts urge passive investors and others to consider the unique and systemic risks posed by climate change as noted by the market risk advisory committee of the u s commodity futures trading commission these risks may not be adequately reflected in current market values which increases the likelihood of systemic shocks similarly the federal reserve has reported that this mispricing of assets poses a risk of downward price shocks and could thereby make climate change a risk to stability of the financial system in addition the market risk advisory committee of the u s commodity futures trading commission reported that climate change over time will likely touch virtually every sector and region of the country moreover selected retirement plans in other countries are assessing the impacts of climate change on their portfolios and have leveraged their knowledge to develop strategies for addressing these risks as part of their passive investment approach in managing the tsp the frtib has not explicitly assessed the potential financial impact of climate change on the 700 billion in assets it manages for 6 million active and retired federal workers frtib is subject to requirements different than those for the plans we reviewed in other countries which affect what actions it may take however frtib has a process to understand risks and has previously undertaken efforts to address risks including consideration of climate change as part of this process would provide frtib more complete information about potential risks relevant to its passive investment approach taking action to understand the financial risks that climate change poses to the tsp is a useful first step that would help frtib be better positioned to consider as part of its ongoing oversight activities if any changes are needed to help ensure that the retirement savings of federal workers are protected recommendations for executive action the executive director of the federal retirement thrift investment board to better inform the board s ongoing oversight activities should evaluate tsp s investment offerings in light of risks related to climate change agency comments and our evaluation we provided a draft of this report to frtib for review and comment in written comments reproduced in appendix ii frtib did not indicate whether it agreed or disagreed with our recommendation frtib noted that it subscribes to a strict indexing discipline and that the efficient market theory concludes that the market is pricing all risks into its valuation on an on going basis frtib stated that its next investment consultant review is planned for fiscal year 2022 and that it would review any recommended changes to its fund offerings at that time frtib further stated that it would examine any recommendations made by the u s securities exchange commission and the federal stability oversight commission on climate change related risks and determine whether and how to apply those lessons to the tsp frtib also stated that it disagreed with a statement in our draft report that it did not currently have any knowledge of the potential financial impact of climate change on tsp assets we removed this characterization from the report gao recognizes that frtib has an established process for evaluating tsp s investment options and utilizes an investment consultant to conduct a review while the most recent investment consultant review in 2017 did not include any consideration of climate related risks its next review in 2022 is an opportunity for frtib to conduct a focused evaluation of these risks and clarify what additional steps if any are needed given the systemic and unprecedented risk that climate change is expected to have on global financial markets gao continues to believe that it is important for frtib to evaluate tsp s investment offerings for these risks while ftrib stated that its upcoming mutual fund window would provide tsp participants with an opportunity to invest beyond the five core funds the mutual fund window does not address the potential climate change related risks to tsp s core investment funds examining climate change related risks facing tsp s 700 billion in assets under management would provide frtib with a greater understanding of its potential exposure to these risks and enable it to decide if any further actions are necessary to protect the retirement savings of over 6 million federal workers the text of the gao report is available at

principles values and institutions of democracy and open societies while strengthening the institutions laws and norms that sustain international cooperation biden then flew to brussels where he had talks with both nato and eu officials at nato headquarters he stated that the alliance needs to prove to the world and to our own people that democracy can still prevail against the challenges of our time and deliver for the needs of our people in geneva biden met with russian president vladimir putin there were some encouraging signs both sides agreed to return ambassadors to moscow and washington respectively both agreed that a new cold war would be undesirable and that talks on nuclear arms controls should resume that being said there were other areas of profound disagreement not least over the situation in ukraine and the fate of alexei navalny biden warned of devastating consequences if navalny were to die in prison meanwhile president putin dismissed suggestions of russian orchestration of cyberattacks overall biden s trip signified a new tone in us foreign policy the president himself is more approachable and affable than his predecessor despite this we should look at this tour through a critical lens it was undoubtedly an opportunity for biden to present a charm offensive in many ways it was a public relations coup in a europe already infatuated with the president and his persona nonetheless geopolitics is far more complex than this it remains to be seen whether european objectives and american objectives can be met europe must chart its course independent of us interests though some of these interests may converge meanwhile within the european union the conference for the future of europe has been launched to engage citizens in a discussion over what sort of union they wish to see in the future the official description claims to provide a new public forum for an open inclusive and transparent debate with citizens around a number of key priorities and challenges the president of the european commission ursula von der leyen says that it is only together that we can build our union of tomorrow this initiative is laudable and prescient mainly as the union is taking stock of the way forward following the covid 19 pandemic it remains to be seen whether european objectives and american objectives can be met andre debattista nonetheless as with other initiatives there are two main dangers firstly that this becomes a simple talking shop with no tangible outcomes secondly that only one viewpoint is expressed thus creating a greater chasm between institutions and the public true deliberative democracy will also require an engagement with those whose perspectives are radically different outside the confines of europe there are also some signs of challenges to come benjamin netanyahu s tenure has been brought to an abrupt end and a new coalition is now in office the rotation government will see naftali bennett serving as prime minister until 2023 at which point yair lapid will replace him until 2025 the new coalition was narrowly confirmed in the knesset with 60 votes in favour and 59 votes against this coalition brings together several differing position bennett s party is a national conservative zionist party lapid s party is somewhat committed to liberalism and the two state solution the coalition also includes members of the united arab list whether such a coalition will be successful remains to be seen in iran chief justice ebrahim raisi won the elections with a staggering 62 per cent of the vote in the first round known to be close to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei he already signalled a change in tone in iranian foreign policy in his first post victory press conference he seemed receptive to reviving the 2015 nuclear deal on the proviso that they guarantee national interest nonetheless he signalled that iran s ballistic missile programme was not up for debate raisi s electoral victory does little to reassure an uneasy west he has been singled out and sanctioned for human rights abuses in the past and he is responsible for signing off the execution of political prisoners in 1988 he remains unapologetic about this on the grounds of national interest nonetheless turnout was at a record low of 49 per cent following the decision to boycott elections by some dissidents and reformists who argued there was no credible contest following the disqualification of some prominent candidates these developments demonstrate a slow but steady recalibration in world politics on the one hand the west seems to want to bounce back and unite to tackle many issues on the other hand it seems directionless in how it should act this posits a serious problem while summitry and dialogue are essential they also necessitate a clear vision and direction once the pandemic is over the international scenario will be altered in unrecognisable ways and the west will have to deal with the challenges it has been putting off for far too long andré debattista political scientist
there were some high profile cyber breaches during the covid 19 pandemic like children s zoom classes being interrupted by adult material or video meetings that were hijacked by pranksters we will explore the problems that arose during the pandemic and how you can protect yourself from these risks increase in security risks and criminal activity as more people were restricted to working from home the level of network security was obviously much lower than office networks giving criminals and malevolent actors opportunities to strike a report by cyber experts reported that there were as many as 4 000 cyber attacks a day since the pandemic started your website is in the public domain and can often be targeted so one of the easiest ways to ensure it is suitably protected is to have secure hosting with a recognized it provider even if you use free website hosting from companies like wix there is no need to worry they are usually completely secure as well it is not only bad actors looking to profit from ransomware or spam but some attacks took on a political angle another less obvious example would be the alleged voter fraud in the many elections around the world like in the usa where mail in voting became necessary for so many voters and opened up the risk of duplication or fraudulent votes the world health organization who was the target of many data breaches including 450 email addresses that were leaked and made public in april 2020 overall they put an increase in cyberattacks at 400 this has led industry commentators to coin the phrase cyber pandemic in reference to the global covid pandemic big brother it is not only the increase in criminal activity that should alarm us but also the rise in surveillance from national authorities governments are using the pandemic as validation for upping the big brother surveillance on its citizens nation states are imposing tracking apps and monitoring software on the public in what they argue is necessary to monitor and control the outbreaks of disease many organizations including freedom house who act as a watchdog for digital and online rights claim that our liberties have been seriously reduced by governments since the beginning of the pandemic types of attacks types of security risks include data breaches and ransomware ransomware is an activity criminals use to hijack data or a network and ask the victim to pay a ransom for it to be returned or destroyed clearly the data involved can be sensitive and most commonly will include emails the contact information of customers or partners which if made public would embarrass the victim if not cause financial harm data breaches are common because businesses do not protect their data securely enough it could be your customer delivery addresses phone numbers or payment details but having vulnerabilities in your website hosting or database software can lead to holes that can be exploited so these attacks have become more frequent and more widespread targeting businesses but even non profit organizations like hospitals and schools there is a lot of significant cyber attacks reported on the site of the csis that makes worrying reading including an attack on the irish health service in may 2021 by a russian cyber crime group us defense contractors were targeted by hackers who discovered vulnerabilities in the vpn s they were using and an email server belonging to the us state department was compromised resulting in thousands of confidential emails being stolen in march 2021 things your organization can do now we have talked about hosting but what other actions can you take now to mitigate the rising risk from cyber attacks and breaches first has to be a thorough review and check on where vulnerabilities or data exist in your organization once identified fixes and security software can be added to guard these most vulnerable points attackers will always look for the path of least resistance so they will always target the weak points in your network and move on if they see too many levels of security having a clear security policy and data policy are simple things your it department or administrators can create these need to be shared with all staff especially those working remotely so simple things like password protecting data sheets and encrypting emails are processes that everyone in the business follows have secure networks in place that individuals can connect to for transmitting data and downloading information needed to do their work having local data storage and clients just increases the number of vulnerabilities get some more tips here conclusion it is true technology like vpns cloud and virtual networks have been important in keeping businesses going during the pandemic and have probably led to permanent shifts in how we operate however with so much information and data moving online comes the greater threat of that channel being compromised it could be something as innocent as lost data or mistyped email addresses but the threat of bad actors is also growing and very harmful and measures have to be taken to protect your organization

this is attested to by thousands of uploaded pictures showing various arts and crafts and countless loaves of sourdough bread but a sellafield contractor has used the extra time presented to him by the pandemic in an altogether different way robert roberts known to some as two bob used his time at home to spend more time on investment platform etoro founded in 2007 with the vision of opening up the global markets so that everyone can trade and invest in a simple and transparent way the company say the platform empowers people to grow their knowledge and wealth as part of a global community of successful investors bob who lives in gosforth isn t the only one who has put some time into the company the israeli social trading company s value tripled from 800 million in 2018 to 2 5 billion in 2020 following a surge of new users during the pandemic it now has over 20 million traders registered the 59 year old has been using the platform for the last few years and was full of praise for the way in which it makes trading everything from stocks to cryptocurrency accessible to all he said i ve been using etoro since 2017 i was driving in my car listening to the radio and there was a debate about crypto the etoro representative gave a really robust and solid answer about security and i thought that allayed any fears i was quite impressed i downloaded the app and started i found it easy since then i ve got a couple of other apps that i use and compared to etoro i don t like them i saw it as an opportunity to make some money some easy money so far my experience has been excellent i get calls from the company it s nice to know there s a human element of course the pandemic has brought some major changes to the world s markets etoro isn t the only company that has seen wild fluctuations in its value the differences in the habits of the public compared to the pre covid world have seen some stock prices go up and others go down and for investors like bob this has meant more opportunities he is quick to stress that he is not a professional and his experiences should not be taken as a guaranteed way to make money but he also explained his reasoning behind his choices bob continued i look at what the stock were pre pandemic and what they are now there was a huge bounce back and some are struggling i applied my common sense i m currently riding the crest of that wave and for the most part it s been pretty successful they don t always go right but i have stop losses in place it s really easy to do a stop loss is a risk management tool which aims to protect users investments it instructs the system to automatically close a trade at a specific rate for example if the price is going against the trader to prevent further losses bob continued my missus actually decided she was going to start up i m prepared to roll with ups and downs a bit more i like taking risks but she s more nervous so she s going to invest in a much more cautious way than i do one that i have an awful lot of money in at the moment is oil particularly the american oil market which is quite suppressed i know renewables are being pushed hard but there s still a big gap oil is going to have a little more of a high before it declines of course even with stop losses in place no investment is guaranteed to be risk free etoro go to great lengths to protect their users but maintain that the platform is not a get rich quick scheme a spokesman for the company said it s important to note that all investment carries risk and we urge our users to think long term and remember the basics tenets of investing define your risk understand what you are investing in and never invest more than you can afford to lose anyone who registers with etoro must complete a combined appropriateness and suitability test before joining the platform this assesses an individual s attitude to risk understanding of the financial markets and specific instruments an appropriateness pass is not required to invest in stocks or real crypto however clients whose results suggest they do not appropriately understand the products or the risks involved will have their access to higher risk instruments including cfds leverage and copy trading limited however etoro remains committed to opening up the financial markets to as many people as possible bob added i m amazed more people don t do it with interest rates as they are now it s just rock bottom you put 100 in the bank and you get 1 extra by the end of the year i ve been a contractor i m cash rich it s not just sat in some pension account what s the point i m letting the banks make the money i do enjoy it there s definitely a thrill to seeing things go up because you haven t had to lift a finger some of it is knowing and believing it wil come good there are many options for traders on etoro some like bob stick mainly to stocks while there is the option to trade cryptocurrencies like the much publicised bitcoin bob revealed he prefers to stay clear everyone wants to make massive money he said some people can a lot of people made a huge amount of money at the last crypto boom i was quite happy for them to make that money and take those risks i think it s completely out of your control i bought some early on and it had a bit of a boom then but i lost patience in the end i m quite happy to stick with trading stocks i learnt the hard way it s completely wild when i apply some reasoning it might be flawed but it s mine i live and die by the sword but crypto is completely wild nobody can move the market unless you re someone like elon musk while the pandemic has been tough for most bob has enjoyed some success thanks to his etoro career something he admits has made him feel guilty he added most of the money i ve made has been in the last year i feel terrible because i ve had a cracking year i feel guilty i really do because i know people have been ill and suffered but we haven t and i ve done well etoro a quick how to trading platforms like etoro might look daunting initially but the company s desire to bring trading and financial markets to the masses means it is one of the easiest to use to start new users will need to sign up with an email address once they ve followed the link in the confirmation email they re ready to start trading in order to begin trading you ll need some cash in your account which can be done by using the deposit funds button and you re good to go the trade markets button allows you to choose the different trading markets available on the platform where you can open a position on a particular stock or cryptocurrency it is also wise to take advantage of etoro s stop loss system which will automatically remove you from a particular position if you lose too

with oil prices rising to levels not seen in over two years us shale bouncing off one of its worst ever years could be looking at record profits in 2021 oil execs and producers are historically pretty good at making money oil is a roller coaster of an economic sector based on a boom and bust model bankruptcy and insolvency are not uncommon occurrences out in the oil field but even in the lean times there are plenty of industry insiders making a buck even as their own company goes down in flames this was even the case in last year s historic oil crash when companies across the west texas permian basin went belly up on the heels of black april when oil prices actually went negative in a global first due to a drop in oil demand spurred by the spread of the novel coronavirus the leaders of opec started to talk strategy these talks turned into disagreement and then an all out oil price war between the leading members of russia and saudi arabia flooding the market with excess crude oil supply and putting oil storage at such a premium that owning it became a liability and that is how on april 20 2020 the west texas intermediate crude benchmark plummeted 306 or 55 90 to a finish at a jaw dropping 37 63 below zero per barrel also on rt com iraq says 150 billion in oil money stolen from country since us invasion in 2003 but even then in the wake of the oil price apocalypse shale execs managed to make off with millions even as their companies folded on july 7 the board of directors at texas fracking sand supplier hi crush granted nearly 3 million in bonuses to four top executives including 1 35 million for ceo and founder robert rasmus reuters reported in an expose published last august five days later the company declared bankruptcy while the timing of the payout was decidedly egregious it was far from outside the norm for the sector according to the damning report it was just the latest in a series of board decisions that allowed the oilfield supplier s top executives and founders to rake in tens of millions of dollars as shareholders saw the stock price plummet to pennies and now around the globe publicly traded independent oil producers are set to make record profits in 2021 this doesn t come as a total shock considering that oil prices have seen an incredible rebound over the course of this year oil prices have not only recovered to pre pandemic levels but they re also at their highest mark in over two years thanks to tightening supply spurred by people getting back on the road in a big way opec staying the course in terms of promised production caps and a retreating us dollar value what s really unbelievable about this year s projected oil producer payouts however is not just that they ll be high but that they ll shatter the ceiling and set an all time record they ll be 37 billion higher than in 2008 when oil prices hit an all time high around 150 a barrel of crude also on rt com chinese drillers announce two massive oil gas discoveries in northwest china overall the combined free cash flow from the oil production sector is expected to balloon to a whopping never before seen 348 billion blowing past 2008 s then record of 311 billion key to the turnaround is us shale with the industry expected to reverse years of losses in 2021 and make super profits of nearly 60 billion of free cash flow before hedges bloomberg reported this week rebounding oil prices are only part of the story also lining the pockets of oil producers is a new trend amongst oil executives who are atypically bound and determined to constrain capital spending this is the opposite of previous cycles when crude rallies prompted companies to spend heavily on exploration and production in search of fresh supplies bloomberg notes all of this is to say that there are major liquid assets sloshing around in the oil sector the amount of money flowing around the sector could also lead to a new spree of mergers and acquisitions analysts have pointed out now it just remains to be seen whether execs can stay disciplined and stick to the plan instead of ramping up output in response to high oil prices which could hit 100 in the near future this article was originally published on oilprice com
one of the historical aspects that rum shares with scotch is blending according to more knowledgeable rum geeks there were no rum brands from the 1600s until the mid 1800 bacardi became the first to appear in the 1860s most sugar estates in the caribbean had distilleries in them from which they d sell their rum to merchants and or blenders in the case of british caribbean islands a lot of the rum would end up with the navy some examples of rum merchants are martin doorlys and frederick myers this is pretty similar to the history of scotch wherein merchants would buy single malt and grain whisky from distilleries and then bottle the blends under their own brands the legacies of those blenders are still alive today with brands like dewar s and johnnie walker around glenfiddich was the first single malt distillery to bottle and sell their own whisky in the 1960s in any case this practice of buying rum from distilleries is still very alive today in fact before this rum boom caribbean rum distilleries kept themselves afloat by bottling and selling rum in their local market or they sold rum in bulk to brokers and blenders the rum boom has brought new life mostly to old caribbean rum distilleries previously dormant and or sparingly active distilleries like long pond and hampden have recently ramped up production foursquare distillery while active since they started in the nineties has been investing in new equipment distilleries like worthy park have even been encouraged enough to start bottling their own rum this is something in spite of their long existence that they ve never done in addition to all of these steps some distilleries have even stopped selling aged stock to brokers rum distilleries slowly getting more recognition has brought up a conundrum for the independent bottlers ibs similar to the scotch industry some distilleries don t let ibs use their names this is partly because they want to keep a certain image in terms of the profile of their product sometimes it results in an ib purchasing a distillate that doesn t conform to a distillery s usual profile companies probably also don t want the regular consumer to identify an ib s bottling as their own of course this isn t a comprehensive list as to why others don t want ibs to use their names just a few ideas as to why it was brought up in this video that rum distilleries partially owe the recognition they enjoy now to the ibs who have bottled them this is a view i endorse my first taste of hampden rum was through habitation velier s 2010 lrok release demerara rum wouldn t be as famous as it is now if it weren t for the now legendary velier bottlings that were initially bottled in the late nineties without them i wouldn t have had the confidence to buy their respective distillery bottlings this prompted the owner of compagnie des indes cdi florent beuchet to say in the video that he considers it unfair that bottlers like him are being restricted from using certain distillery names which makes sense to me why handicap someone who helped you become better known after all when not allowed to use distillery names bottlers like cdi and sbs now resort to placing the rum s vintage and country of origin on the label if possible they will add clues such as still type and or distillery marque discussions like this have led to the question of whether are independent bottlers really in dependent or should they be called dependent bottlers yes they are free to do what they want with the rum they purchase they can spice or blend or age it in whatever cask they want for however long but without access to their spirit of choice what will they sell one example is st lucia distillers sld from st lucia obviously but good to confirm who has stopped selling stock to brokers and blenders previously one could only get high proof single cask bottlings from them via brands like hamilton now sld is offering single casks themselves if certain distilleries don t allow their names to be used how does that affect the value of the ib s product if you think about it an ib can age a spirit in whatever cask s and for any length but the ib is at the mercy of the source when it comes to the distillate s quality casks cannot make shit distillate into gold doesn t this make them dependent on the distilleries and thus dependent bottlers compagnies des indes cdi is a brand i ve only touched on once in the past they re one of my favorite indy rum bottlers so upon noticing this topic i immediately started working on this article the first time i saw their product was in japan in 2018 being completely unaware of them i searched the web for reviews i found some along with this article written by the lone caner so far my experience with them is few as i only own a few bottles and some sample bottles they re luckily available in japan and singapore which has made it easier for me to source them as far as i know they have no distribution in america apologies to the us based readers as mentioned above cdi is owned by florent beuchet according to this article he comes from a family of wine growers which shows us that alcohol is in his blood being a french based company they re more available and better known in the eu he said that he started swooning over rums when he worked as brand manager for banks rum in nyc for those who don t know what banks is it s a rum brand that is partially owned and represented by jim meehan the brand was initially independent but is mainly owned by bacardi now they source and blend rum from different countries like guyana jamaica trinidad and indonesia upon seeing the beauty of rum he decided to launch his own brand when he returned to the eu it s likely that being surrounded by bartenders who crafted great rum cocktails also had a huge impact he formed cdi in 2014 the bulk of his inventory comes from holland most likely e a scheer in amsterdam and uk most likely main rum in liverpool what caught and keeps the attention of rum geeks is his refusal to sweeten any of his rums according to the lone caner he has no patience for rum with solera age statements aka fake age statements transparency honesty and not sweetening rum may be common these days but back in 2014 a lot of rum brands were less transparent or straight up denied sweetening their rum plenty of rum brands are still in denial of their shenanigans safe to say he shares the same beliefs with richard seale and luca gargano aside from not cutting corners and selling honest rum cdi is known for the single cask releases although there are some groans some of these single casks are diluted nevertheless the few i ve tried from him have been good to great he seems to have a particular fondness for the danish market since he only bottles special releases for them i remember cdi bottling some new yarmouth jamaican rum a couple of years ago this caused a commotion in a good way as new yarmouth rarely gets bottled as a single distillery in case you re wondering why it s appleton s lesser known sister distillery said to produce the wray nephew rums they re not all single casks they bottle their own blends too some of what i know of are the boulet de canon series which are finished in ex peated scotch casks there s also a caraibes blend and a 5 year jamaica blend none of which i ve tried yet one of the rum from my collection which i consider very interesting is this 18 year old guyanese from the now closed uitvlugt distillery don t worry all the stills in it were moved to the diamond distillery aside from the age it is a single cask aged in ex armagnac casks how often does one come across any spirit aged ex armagnac casks according to cdi s website the rum was distilled from the four column metal savalle still it is bottled at 45 compagnie des indes guyana uitvlugt 18 year review distilled nov 1997 bottled april 2016 cask mga4 color gold on the nose medium and lasting aromas of licorice anise cloves allspice rotten bananas browned apples tea nutmegs and toffee with bits of dark chocolate at the end are light aromas of tepache lanzones peel kombucha raw ginger paint thinner and lemon peel oils some pepperiness goes in between the aromas at random points in the mouth this is very similar to the nose but the notes are in a different order there are medium tastes of tea tepache kombucha toffee rotten bananas nutmeg lanzones peel browned apples licorice anise cloves and allspice in between are very short bursts of unpeeled ginger banana peel and paint thinner at the end are just as intense tastes of chinese medicine root sarsaparilla and bayleaf conclusions this is a complex and full bodied rum it gives off a lot of unique flavors you won t get from other rum producing countries sadly i don t have experience with savalle distillate so i can t pinpoint which flavor comes from distillate or which come from the cask influence if you re looking to explore more rum this is a great rum bottler to follow he only focuses on bottling rum which is unlike ibs like smws kill golden devil and berry bros who focus on whisky another good point is the prices are reasonable i remember finding this in japan for about 90 18 year old rum aged in an uncommon cask for that price sounds like a steal no score 7 10

maurie backman the motley fool there s a reason so many buyers have struggled to buy a home this year housing inventory has been extremely limited and the few homes that have been up for sale have also been the subject of much competition as such buyers have been frequently getting outbid on homes they otherwise would ve been in a strong position to buy but things may be improving in that regard in may housing inventory rose 3 9 compared to april according to zillow that represents the first monthly increase since july of 2020 what s more inventory was up in may compared to april in 43 of the country s largest markets at the same time housing inventory is still down 31 2 from the previous may on a national level and if new listings don t pick up this summer a lot of buyers may be forced to put their homeownership plans on hold it s still a tough time to buy low mortgage rates have created a surge in buyer demand but even with may s uptick in listings there still aren t enough homes for purchase to meet demand that s causing buyers to duke it out over properties land in bidding wars and drive home prices higher normally housing inventory peaks during the spring and that may have indeed happened in may albeit at a very modest level but if inventory doesn t increase this summer then unfortunately 2021 may end up being a wash for prospective buyers on a limited budget though many people won t shy away from listing a home during the fall once the winter months hit selling becomes a tougher prospect not only can weather interrupt scheduled open houses and showings but often homes don t show as nicely in the winter at least not in areas that tend to see harsh conditions after all if one of a home s key selling points is its park like backyard with a swimming pool it s hard to highlight that feature when the ground s covered in snow and the pool has to be covered up remodeling projects put on hold lumber price roller coaster forces americans to delay costly renovations as such while housing inventory could still pick up over the next few months even more so than it did in may that might not happen and if so buyers who are frustrated with today s market may want to make the decision to sit tight until the spring of 2022 and resume their home searches then at that point between progress on the coronavirus front and an economy that could be in better shape than it is today there will hopefully be a lot more inventory to choose from and more inventory could easily lead to lower home prices plus mortgage rates are likely to stay low for quite some time so buying in 2022 won t necessarily mean getting stuck with a higher interest rate on a home loan the fact that the number of homes for sale rose in may is encouraging but we re still looking at a major shortage of homes to buy and until more listings hit prospective buyers may continue to spin their wheels a historic opportunity to potentially save thousands on your mortgage offer from the motley fool chances are interest rates won t stay put at multi decade lows for much longer that s why taking action today is crucial whether you re wanting to refinance and cut your mortgage payment or you re ready to pull the trigger on a new home purchase our expert recommends this company to find a low rate and in fact he used them himself to refi twice click here to learn more and see your rate we re firm believers in the golden rule which is why editorial opinions are ours alone and have not been previously reviewed approved or endorsed by included advertisers the ascent does not cover all offers on the market editorial content from the ascent is separate from the motley fool editorial content and is created by a different analyst team maurie backman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares of and recommends zillow group a shares and zillow group c shares the motley fool has a disclosure policy the motley fool is a usa today content partner offering financial news analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives its content is produced independently of usa today
an important apology in the cancel culture war was issued on june 23 2021 the royal academy of arts apologized to the artist jess de wahls for removing her work from its gift shop because in 2019 in a blog she said humans cannot change sex the academy stated that it had no right to judge her views on our social media this betrayed our most important core value the protection of free speech the statement was an implicit rejection of identity politics when it goes to the extreme and privileges one set of opinions over others the r a three days earlier had declared that it never knowingly supports artists who act in conflict with its values of diversity and inclusion and that it would no longer stock the work of wahls it now will do so the issue goes far beyond the question of whether the r a gift shop should or not sell embroidery patches that wahls makes or the acceptance of the persona of wahls herself a hairdresser by trade who has been making feminist textiles since she came from east berlin to london in 2004 it is a fundamental issue of free speech and a refutation of cancel culture when it curtails principles of free speech the endeavor to protect free speech is sometimes strained the national gallery of art in washington d c and the tate modern museum in london postponed their philip guston exhibition because of his depictions of ku klux klan figures that might offend some visitors who would not be aware of his intention to show them as evil the tate and other museums which were to mount the exhibition issued a statement that the postponement was due to the racial justice movement that started in the u s the scottish opera withdrew its nomination of its production of john adams s opera nixon in china for an award after criticism of the use of yellow makeup for singers playing chinese characters these issues are symptomatic of the extremes in the ongoing cancel culture war in the u k and the u s and raise difficult questions central is the problem of whether artists intellectuals or writers should be judged or honored according to the quality of their creativity or by their personality or opinions picasso who drew pornographic pictures of a 13 year old girl caravaggio was a dangerous aggressive man gauguin was a reported pedophile who reportedly had sexual relations with young girls and eric gill artist and sculptor sexually abused his daughters and was an associate of the r a several prominent artists have recently faced problems because of some act or opinion in june 2020 the successful novelist j k rowling was confronted with online calls for her books to be burnt and she was threatened with violence because she had posted controversial tweets about transgenderism in similar fashion the nigerian novelist chimamanda adichie ngozi who won the orange prize for fiction in 2007 sparked controversy and faced a backlash for her views on men who call themselves women she also held that social media are being used for ideological warfare rather than as a place for communication and understanding both prominent writers illustrate that freedom of expression is central to art and culture and must be protected obviously there are problems debate can create empathy but it can also cause hurt and outrage the debate on free speech continues the issue was considered by the u s supreme court on june 3 2021 in a case of protection of student speech on social media a student aged 14 who did not make her varsity cheer squad posted a vulgar message f school f softball etc her high school banned her from the team for a year the court found by an 8 1 decision that the mahanoy area high school s decision to ban the student from the cheerleader squad had gone too far though it admitted that a school has the ability to regulate some off campus speech in this case the court held that the interests of the school in regulating the off campus speech were insufficient to overcome the student s rights to free expression and that the school s authority to regulate students speech is highly limited in off campus settings at the same time the court did not issue a broad first amendment rule on a school s need to control off campus speech justice stephen g breyer for the majority wrote america s public schools are the nurseries of democracy epresentative democracy only works if we protect the marketplace of ideas the bronze statue of theodore roosevelt which has sat since 1940 at the central park west entrance of the american museum of natural history in new york and which has been defaced twice as racist has been removed the statue depicts the president of the u s on horseback with an american indian and an african man flanking the horse officials of the museum which is on city owned property requested that the statue be moved because it explicitly depicts black and indigenous people as subjugated and racially inferior theodore roosevelt had long been associated with the museum and his father was one of its founders but the statue was removed also in part because of his support of eugenics when will cancel culture stop its extreme actions theodore roosevelt was the 26th president of the u s and his face is depicted on mount rushmore alongside washington jefferson and lincoln he was a complex figure a progressive liberal in economic policy a conservationist who set up america s first national parks a foreign policy internationalist and a colonialist explorer but he has been cast in a new light as a result of antiracism protests following the killing of george floyd the influence of those anti racism protests has led to curious developments in the academic and intellectual worlds cornell university has launched an astronomy course black holes race and the cosmos to discuss and prove a connection between scientific terms and racial blackness this involves studying the fundamentals of astronomy through readings in black studies artists and fiction writers and exploring what artists of color gain from turning identity politics towards cosmological reflection the term black hole the concept predicted by einstein in 1916 was first used by john a wheeler in 1967 to describe light swallowing space masses the issue now for cornell studies is whether there is a connection between the cosmos and cosmological themes and the idea of racial blackness cornell is interested in decolonizing its curriculum as have other u s universities which have introduced literature written by non white people as at yale which changed its curriculum to include contributions of women non white people and people who reject sexual attraction to the opposite sex more widespread danger is a classroom curriculum that connects mathematics with advocacy of critical race theory educators in some u s states are at odds over a program dismantling racism in mathematics which states that teachers should not push students to find correct answers to math problems because this promotes white supremacy it is in essence a part of instruction in critical race theory that racism against minorities is embedded in every aspect of life including math the program has a workbook funded by a 1 million grant from the gates foundation which asserts that the u s educational system reinforces the dominant power structures of white colonizers the workbook continues declaring that the concept of mathematics being purely objective is unequivocally false and that upholding the idea that there are always right and wrong answers perpetuates objectivity asking students to find the correct answer for math problems is inherently harmful for minorities at the core are the implicit messages that black students are bad at math so protect them from learning it and that pushing students to solve math problems promotes white supremacy the battle over cancel culture remains in politics and society image tom hilton via flickr cc by 2 0 to comment you can find the mewe post for

london bloomberg companies are racing to public markets like never before cashing in on record high stock prices an all time high of almost us 350 billion s 469 9 billion has been raised in initial public offerings ipos in the first six months of this year according to data compiled by bloomberg surpassing the previous peak of us 282 billion from the second half of last year and enriching entrepreneurs and bankers alike when the rush for ipos kicked off last year stay at home technology dominated the scene seizing on investor interest in anything digital while special purpose acquisition companies spacs also flooded the market this year with stocks continuing to push skyward the trend has broadened to include renewable energy companies and online retailers everyone from swedish oat milk company oatly group to bootmaker dr martens sold shares this year still tech accounts for a big chunk of the deals didi global will rank among the biggest united states ipos of the past decade if the chinese ride hailing giant carries through with plans to sell as much as us 4 billion in stock the markets from new york to hong kong were on fire in the first half of this year and have left even the late 90s dotcom boom era in the rear view mirror said mr aaron arth head of the financing group at goldman sachs in asia ex japan the boom has been fuelled by a torrent of cash that central banks have pumped into the economy and the rise of individual investors who are eager to buy a piece of their favourite companies it has delivered a windfall for investment banks around the world who reap the rewards from underwriting and advisory fees citigroup and goldman sachs are leading the global league tables for ipos this year with so many companies rushing to market the industry is starting to look saturated investors say they can afford to be picky and are increasingly reluctant to pay steep valuations demanded by the fast growing companies that populate the ipo market as a result a number of high profile stocks have stumbled in their trading debuts this year and some companies are getting spooked food delivery start up deliveroo plunged 26 per cent on its first day of trading in london while oscar health the insurance start up co founded by mr josh kushner has fallen 40 per cent since joining the new york market russia s nord gold last tuesday june 22 pulled its ipo citing market uncertainty and swings in the gold price while genworth financial last month postponed a us offering for its enact holdings mortgage insurance unit and last friday hong kong traded geely automobile holdings withdrew its application for a listing in shanghai there has been a certain level of exhaustion among investors and increased selectivity said mr saadi soudavar co head of equity capital markets for europe the middle east and africa at deutsche bank it s a record year after all so they can have their pick among the multiple transactions coming their way investor appetite for one type of listing has already faded spacs accounted for almost half the proceeds raised in the ipo market in the first quarter but their share shrunk to about 13 per cent this quarter an index that tracks spac listings has dropped 23 per cent from a february high the poor performance along with tougher regulatory scrutiny has been a blow to market sentiment us officials have cautioned individual investors against celebrity endorsed cash shells and are scrutinising accounting practices still as long as the stock market is rising the flow of ipos is unlikely to dry up and total proceeds this year are on track to eclipse the record of us 420 1 billion set in 2007 the ipo boom will likely continue for the next six to 12 months said mr rob leach european head of equity capital markets at jefferies financial group trading app robinhood markets has a us offering in the works while cloud storage company ovhcloud plans to list in france and volvo cars is considering an ipo in sweden there is a degree of uncertainty about how long the party will keep going but we expect to see a very busy third quarter with a big pipeline of companies lining up to list after the summer said deutsche bank s mr soudavar
market rallies to all time highs well that was undoubtedly an exciting bought of volatility we reviewed our signals and the sell off well not only did the highs not stick but the 50 dma failed during friday s sell off the market closing at its lows suggests we could see some more selling early next week the good news if you want to call it that is that the sell signal is moving quickly through its cycle such suggests that selling pressure may remain limited and may resolve itself by the end of june well this week the market not only got off the mat but rallied back to new highs just barely as shown below while the rally did get the bulls motivated the declining money flows grey histogram chart suggest the rally is unlikely to stick with the market back to 2 standard deviations above the 50 dma conviction weak and investors extremely bullish the market remains set up for more consolidation or correction in the week ahead the weekly chart confirms the same our previous discussions warned that if the daily and weekly sell signals align such often coincides with more corrective rather than consolidative actions if the daily signal triggers a buy next week such would indicate a limit to the upside and more consolidation i got a few emails this week asking if i still think a 5 10 correction is possible the short answer is yes however it is not a guarantee that such will happen if you notice in the weekly chart above the market can consolidate over an extended period and reduce the sell signal a correction makes it happen faster it is also worth noting that corrections can come after sell signals are triggered thus they are not always immediately correlated sell signal conundrum as we have laid out repeatedly over the last few weeks there are several important points concerning technical analysis technical analysis is not always 100 accurate we look for our indicators to be correct about 70 of the time providing better risk management signals do not mean to be all in or all out of the market as discussed we reduced risk previously but still maintain a healthy exposure to markets just because the correction didn t happen immediately doesn t mean it won t the last point i expand on in our latest 3 minutes video there are two other reasons we are cautious of this past week s rally volume was lacking and seasonality is still at play the implications are that we may see a downdraft of some significance in the near term not a lot of new upside in the months ahead and a potentially bigger decline as we head into mid to late october is that how it will play out sorry folks climate not weather remember the stock market could easily rally to nominal new highs in the month ahead however do also note in the chart below that the index has tracked its annual season fairly closely in terms of the trend and to a much greater magnitude so far in 2021 will this continue same answer as the question above sentiment trader that view supports our current thesis of remaining slightly underweight equities for now the market is likely to rally a bit from here for two reasons end of the quarter window dressing by portfolio managers the first two weeks of july tend to be seasonally strong before weakness reasserts itself we suggest remaining a little cautious but not overly defensive for now bullishness is back one thing about the market is the rather extraordinary amount of bullish exuberance that exuberance often gets visualized for example by record margin debt levels however some other non mainstream indicators show the same for example a new survey from natixis shows a clear example of at work wealthy americans are pretty optimistic about their long term investment returns expecting to earn average annual returns of 17 5 above inflation from their portfolios that s according to a new survey from natixis that surveyed households that have over 100 000 in investable assets in march and april of 2021 of course with inflation running roughly 5 in the second quarter such suggests that investors are looking for more than 20 from the stock market by year end but it isn t just recency bias it is also the driven by the belief the fed will continue to support markets indefinitely the bespoke irrational exuberance indicator subtracts the valuation confidence from the one year confidence survey data this reading has exploded higher recently for both institutional and individual investors when the reading is positive it means confidence that the market will be higher one year from now is higher than confidence in the valuation of the market the opposite is the case when the reading is in negative territory bespoke the key takeaway is that investors simultaneously believe the market is over valued but likely to keep climbing why because the fed has investor s backs of course we would be remiss not to look at the level of household equity ownership as a percentage of their disposable personal income the current deviation from the long term exponential growth trend rivals every previous bubble in history yes this time could be different but unfortunately it just usually isn t

donald trump says we will make america great again in ohio rally donald trump says we will make america great again in ohio rally trump was back in his element in front of a mass crowd in ohio as he made plenty of dubious claims while leaving open the possibility that he may run for president again in 2024 donald trump s 7 most ludicrous moments at first revenge tour rally after defeat seven months after losing the us presidential election donald trump has made a return to the grand stage with a rally to kick off his so called revenge tour stepping out in front of a crowd of thousands in ohio he was quick to launch an attack on joe biden and pushed for republicans to take back control of congress next year it was the first time trump has talked to a major rally since he was forced out of office and he had lost none of his stubbornness once again falsely claiming his defeat last november was down to fraud trump remains in denial over the result despite never having been able to show evidence of any illegal activity the end of his first term in office was marred by his refusal to accept the result and the deadly attack by his supporters on the us capitol on january 6 image reuters reuters with america easing its covid restrictions trump was able to hold a mass rally dubbed the revenge tour as he hits back at the democrats who beat him and the republicans who he feels didn t do enough to get him back into office here are seven of the most outlandish moments at his first event 1 trump says he s going to win third election despite losing the second the 75 year old billionaire is still pushing the lie that he won the 2020 election and is likely to continue to do so as it helps rally his most dedicated supporters he has yet to confirm that he intends to run again in 2024 but he s repeatedly teased it since he was voted out of office last november we won the election twice and it s possible we ll have to win it a third time he told the ohio crowd it s possible image amy harris rex shutterstock amy harris rex shutterstock 2 reads a poem about a snake to moan about immigration it was not surprising that trump raised the question of immigration at the rally and criticised what biden has done so far cracking down on immigration was a key policy area during his first term which included his plan to build a wall along the border with mexico he has been reading the snake poem at various events since he first campaigned for office from a song by al wilson about a woman who foolishly embraces a predator for trump it is a metaphor for the dangers of immigration and he wheeled it out again for his comeback rally image afp via getty images afp via getty images 3 slams us military as woke then celebrates relationship with putin trump has never shied away from criticising his own army and now he s no longer commander in chief little has changed during the rally he launched a rant against supposedly woke generals in a comment likely directed at mark milley the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of the us military who recently defended anti racist education in the armed forces but in the same speech trump also made sure to praise vladimir putin the russian president joe biden recently dubbed a killer it s not a bad thing to have a good relationship with putin he told the crowd i get along with everyone eventually sometimes it just takes a little longer image reuters reuters 4 praises laughing stock lawyer rudy giuliani just as his legal license is stripped trump s former lawyer giuliani was humiliated again earlier this month when his licence to practice law was suspended in new york after making demonstrably false and misleading statements the former mayor of new york has seen a spectacular fall from grace repeatedly pushing trump s stolen election lie and even appearing in a deeply embarrassing scene in the second borat movie but trump has not given up on his pal and claimed he was being hounded by political opponents i m helping a lot of people get into office and we re fighting the deep state and we re fighting radical left trump told his supporters they re after me they re after rudy they re after you probably they re after anybody image getty images getty images 5 boasts he would have solved israel palestine conflict despite 4 years of empty promises hundreds of lives were lost during the latest clashes in the troubled middle eastern region last month israel fired missiles into gaza while rockets were shot into tel aviv as the violence escalated but trump thinks he could have solved the decades old situation himself if i was there we d have it totally wrapped up trump told the ohio crowd joe biden is squandering all of this hard earned respect that we had or had bowing down to america s enemies and embarrassing our country on the world stage during his four years in office trump repeatedly claimed he was working on a peace plan for long divided region but like many of his boasts it came to nothing image reuters reuters 6 finally admits the space force was widely mocked trump has admitted that many sniggered at his us space force as he stirred up the crowd but he believes he has had the last laugh he officially launched the new military service which falls under the us air force and said space was the world s newest war fighting domain he told the ohio rally russia s up there big league china s up there big league we ve overtaken them in space image the washington post via getty images the washington post via getty images 7 rants about biden destroying us but majority of americans think otherwise during his speech trump blamed his successor for everything from rising crime and weaker police to illegal aliens overwhelming the southern border and the economy joe biden is destroying our nation right before our very own eyes trump seethed it would seem though that the majority of americans think biden is doing a better job than the last president at least so far six months into the job biden has a 56 percent approval rating amongst the us public while trump never got above 49 per cent during his one term in office
people across the united states were abuzz with talk of the portland graham riot in the summer of 1834 a time when vegetarian ideas were in vogue locally the agitation as headlines in boston philadelphia and albany called it was a violent mob that attacked the temple street chapel where celebrity vegetarian lecturer sylvester graham was giving his popular course on the science of human life newspapers here and across the country had much to say about the riot but were left to wonder at its cause was it graham s advice to eat whole wheat bread and skip animal based foods or was it something else something unprintable curiously few if any maine historians have examined the riot however scholars in other disciplines have explored its causes and implications while historical news reports reveal fascinating details graham s 1834 visit to maine exposes widespread sympathy for vegetarianism in portland and brunswick reveals the launch of maine s first commercial health food products and highlights local women s rights concerns the boston saturday morning transcript s july 5 1834 newspaper printed a letter from a portland correspondent who reported that graham s private lectures to married ladies have caused so much excitement that he will probably be unable to continue his course of essays on diet a mob broke up his lecture last evening and made some considerable disturbance by the summer of 1834 graham had been delivering his food reform lectures across the northeast for years an impassioned speaker graham attracted large audiences and the crusading minister became an overnight sensation andrew f smith who teaches food studies at the new school in new york wrote in eating history graham began his portland lectures on june 5 and continued throughout the month advertisement last year i wrote about rev henry aiken worcester who after attending graham s portland lectures penned a letter remarking on the widespread adoption of graham s principles in portland including among the city s doctors since then wheaton college history professor jonathan d riddle informed me of a july 22 1834 letter signed by nine members of the portland medical association giving their full support to graham s diet and general regimen the letter from the maine doctors was reprinted in newspapers and appeared in graham s 1835 a defence of the graham system of living the month before giving his course in portland graham delivered the same lectures at brunswick s congregational church where the lecture series was chaired by none other than maine s sitting governor robert dunlap a brunswick resident more than 300 people attended the brunswick course and from their ranks a committee made up of three professors three doctors two attorneys and a general drafted resolutions supporting graham s principles which they said if widely adopted would lead to the highest earthly welfare of the human family graham s visit to maine was championed by dr reuben d mussey who from 1831 to 1835 was the anatomy and surgery professor at the medical school of maine part of the bowdoin college campus from 1820 to 1920 mussey was a grahamite who in 1850 would become a founding member of the american vegetarian society and the fourth president of the american medical association prof mussey was known for converting students to the vegetable diet graham the food influencer the history of brunswick topsham and harpswell maine written in 1878 mentions the influence of graham s lectures on the people of brunswick stating the doctor was an attractive lecturer and his theory gained many adherents the meat market ran low and butchers feared for their calling some really feared that their occupation was gone in addition to urging people to avoid animal based foods graham told people to shun alcohol and all stimulants including spices coffee tea chocolate tobacco and opium he urged them to eat vegetables and whole wheat bread and to drink pure water by 1834 whole grain flour was known as graham flour and the bread made from it was called graham bread advertisement beginning on june 24 allen s bakery on willow street began running ads to let readers know it had graham bread constantly on hand and for sale cheap on june 27 baker john pearson alerted readers in his own ad that he sold graham bread at his casco street bake house too on july 9 the blake howe bakery ran an ad stating we manufacture the bread recommended by dr graham of good stock brought from new york expressly for the purpose as the summer wore on merchant john cox who did business on the central wharf advertised that the steamer macdonough would arrive aug 18 with 10 barrels of graham flour but not all merchants welcomed graham s presence in portland within graham s unpublished handwritten lecture notes housed at the american antiquarian society in worcester massachusetts he writes a woman keeping a confectionary shop in portland told dr j w mighels that if she should meet graham in the street and had a pistol she would shoot him for he had damaged her more than a hundred dollars by his lectures graham counseled against eating sugar which dr mighels as one of the nine doctors who signed the letter endorsing graham would know the reported drop in demand for meat in brunswick and sweets in portland combined with the ads for graham bread mark the start of maine s commercial health food market natural food expert joe dobrow writes in his 2014 chronicle of the health food industry natural prophets that new england had a long history in health foods starting with sylvester graham a minister who came from a family of doctors graham was well known for his love of wholewheat bread and his vegetarian physiology message he also lectured on sexual physiology which proved more provocative than counseling people to eat bran bread graham s temperate philosophy extended to sex and treated men and women equally he argued in favor of extreme sexual restraint for both men and women at a time when a sexual double standard prevailed women lacked basic rights and men wielded tremendous power over women s lives and bodies graham delivered his lecture on sexual physiology to male only crowds without problem but as historian april r haynes writes in riotous flesh graham s lecture on chastity became inflammatory when delivered to women because it insisted that all bodies were subject to the same set of god given laws of life and health in this way reform physiology minimized the significance of physical differences such as sex and implicitly skin color rioters perceived graham s sexual universalism as challenging the basic hierarchies of gender and race that limited and defined jacksonian democracy despite the speculation of some newspapers it wasn t graham s advice to eat wheat bread and vegetables that created the agitation in portland instead it was graham s lecture to mothers with its radical equal rights message that summoned the portland mob according to haynes advertisement anti graham mob on jan 10 1870 the eastern argus newspaper in portland published a lengthy front page story about wholesome bread which it said should be made from whole wheat without sour milk or lard the author under the pen name agricola latin for farmer observes that 36 years after graham s lectures graham bread was now in general use agricola then recalls graham s visit stating these lectures to the women excited the wrath of some of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens and the excitement culminated in a mob which one evening surrounded temple st church the street was full of people and the excitement ran high brickbars were hurled through the windows shouts went up outside and the woman shrieked inside the church the lecture was broken up and graham was compelled to leave the church in disguise and seek a place of refuge from the mob it was a disgraceful affair and some men seemed to be almost crazy during graham s visit the june 13 1834 eastern argus praised his lectures as worthy to be attended by all who can afford the expense in contrast historian haynes calls the portland daily advertiser active in drumming up hostility against graham we see the first hints of this in the june 17 newspaper where a letter writer named simplex latin for simple writes that graham had been lavished with over strained praise and instead deserves reprehension however even simplex concedes graham is rather a personable man and has a good voice the newspaper also promoted a comedic evening planned for june 30 titled the yankee at home where performer mr g h hill would recite a new yankee story called aunt nabby s love of graham bread and the starved rats but most strikingly the portland daily advertiser ran a notice for an anti graham lecture scheduled for 8 p m on june 27 at portland city hall located where monument square is today and just around the corner from the temple street chapel which sat roughly where the entrance to the nickelodeon movie theater parking garage is today one detail about the 1834 graham riot that remains elusive is its precise date however it seems probable that the initial riot took place on june 27 the same night a hostile crowd gathered nearby haynes documents that mobs prevented graham from lecturing the following night and when he returned a month later advertisement further evidence that june 27 could be the night of the initial riot comes from the date attached to seven resolutions praising graham and the correctness of his lectures that were adopted unanimously by 160 women who attended his lecture to mothers in portland in a bold move for the time five prominent local women attached their names to the document which expressed regret over the misrepresentations so freely disseminated by individuals from whom we had a right to expect better things the july 22 1834 alexandria gazette in virginia reports the women s resolutions are highly complimentary to mr graham while both local and national newspapers reported on the riot its cause remained unclear and open to interpretation for instance the new york commercial advertiser which was quoted in several other newspapers stated that if mr graham has been instructing the wives and mothers of portland to cram any of his bread down the throats of their husbands and children we don t wonder at the excitement graham who published widely never printed his lecture to mothers and no copy remains however haynes documents that in the lecture graham taught reproductive anatomy counseled marital sex for procreation only and condemned masturbation all topics he commonly spoke about at the time on june 26 1834 the christian mirror a congregational newspaper printed a letter from helen of brunswick who praises graham s lectures noting that even here in new england this moral eden of the world we fear there is scarcely a village which is not contaminated by the lewd conduct of some pests they deserve not the name of men helen s statement though veiled likely speaks to sexual violence harassment and gender based power imbalances the nature of graham s lectures and the audiences exposed masculine fears of women empowered by knowledge of their own bodies historian adam d shprintzen writes in the vegetarian crusade on the very last page of graham s 350 page lecture notes he lists five portland men under the heading the character of those men who got up a mob against me in portland june 1834 according to common and accredited report he names names and then outlines each man s character including such observations as a rich man an infamous whore master having a wife and child he is said and believed to have seduced two girls last winter and a violent andrew jackson man a bitter opposer of the temperance cause and is generally considered an atheist another portland rioter graham writes was a white man reputed to have fathered a child out of wedlock with a black woman haynes finds no evidence of the child but notes graham s depictions of the other alleged conspirators can be confirmed turns out sylvester graham was a threat not only to the culturally accepted practice of eating animals but more provocatively to gendered social norms according to haynes in reaction a group of almost crazy men incited the 1834 graham riot to reinforce and maintain the existing social hierarchy one final note of interest here at the start of the 2021 tourist season back in 1834 newspapers in providence and boston were among those that reprinted a story from the new york times citing mr graham the cold water lecturer among a short list of entertainments in maine that summer that prove down easters are becoming a famous people for amusements and exhibitions not only did graham stoke the smoldering local interest in vegetarianism his eventful 1834 visit helped cultivate maine s early vacationland image avery yale kamila is a food writer who lives in portland

with oil prices rising to levels not seen in over two years us shale bouncing off one of its worst ever years could be looking at record profits in 2021 oil execs and producers are historically pretty good at making money oil is a roller coaster of an economic sector based on a boom and bust model bankruptcy and insolvency are not uncommon occurrences out in the oil field but even in the lean times there are plenty of industry insiders making a buck even as their own company goes down in flames this was even the case in last year s historic oil crash when companies across the west texas permian basin went belly up on the heels of black april when oil prices actually went negative in a global first due to a drop in oil demand spurred by the spread of the novel coronavirus the leaders of opec started to talk strategy these talks turned into disagreement and then an all out oil price war between the leading members of russia and saudi arabia flooding the market with excess crude oil supply and putting oil storage at such a premium that owning it became a liability and that is how on april 20 2020 the west texas intermediate crude benchmark plummeted 306 or 55 90 to a finish at a jaw dropping 37 63 below zero per barrel but even then in the wake of the oil price apocalypse shale execs managed to make off with millions even as their companies folded on july 7 the board of directors at texas fracking sand supplier hi crush granted nearly 3 million in bonuses to four top executives including 1 35 million for ceo and founder robert rasmus reuters reported in an expose published last august five days later the company declared bankruptcy while the timing of the payout was decidedly egregious it was far from outside the norm for the sector according to the damning report it was just the latest in a series of board decisions that allowed the oilfield supplier s top executives and founders to rake in tens of millions of dollars as shareholders saw the stock price plummet to pennies and now around the globe publicly traded independent oil producers are set to make record profits in 2021 this doesn t come as a total shock considering that oil prices have seen an incredible rebound over the course of this year oil prices have not only recovered to pre pandemic levels but they re also at their highest mark in over two years thanks to tightening supply spurred by people getting back on the road in a big way opec staying the course in terms of promised production caps and a retreating us dollar value what s really unbelievable about this year s projected oil producer payouts however is not just that they ll be high but that they ll shatter the ceiling and set an all time record they ll be 37 billion higher than in 2008 when oil prices hit an all time high around 150 a barrel of crude overall the combined free cash flow from the oil production sector is expected to balloon to a whopping never before seen 348 billion blowing past 2008 s then record of 311 billion key to the turnaround is us shale with the industry expected to reverse years of losses in 2021 and make super profits of nearly 60 billion of free cash flow before hedges bloomberg reported this week rebounding oil prices are only part of the story also lining the pockets of oil producers is a new trend amongst oil executives who are atypically bound and determined to constrain capital spending this is the opposite of previous cycles when crude rallies prompted companies to spend heavily on exploration and production in search of fresh supplies bloomberg notes all of this is to say that there are major liquid assets sloshing around in the oil sector the amount of money flowing around the sector could also lead to a new spree of mergers and acquisitions analysts have pointed out now it just remains to be seen whether execs can stay disciplined and stick to the plan instead of ramping up output in response to high oil prices which could hit 100 in the near future this article was originally published on oilprice com rt com
the great rotation we have witnessed since the vaccine announcement last november has helped active fund managers to benefit greatly thanks to their stock picking abilities combined with a disciplined approach to valuation the question remains where can we go from here throughout the last decade active managers faced various major headwinds with one of the most prominent being the unprecedented levels of market concentration in fact this factor along with the rise of passively managed funds is one of the main contributors that led the active fund management industry to face disruptions the onset of the pandemic drastically increased these headwinds to historic levels with regard to market concentration if a manager did not hold exposures to the largest tech names in 2020 one would likely been left behind a limited number of shares driving markets creates a difficult environment even for skilled stock pickers in this case it was especially difficult for managers to outperform with any kind of valuation discipline the accompanying chart shows just how concentrated markets became in 2020 even surpassing the concentration faced during the dot com bubble in the early 2000s since the first news of effective covid vaccines came out concentration has fallen although still at a historically high level additionally we see increasing scrutiny from seve ral governments challenging the dominance and monopolistic power of these mega cap tech firms it is believed that this gives active managers an increasingly favourable opportunity to generate excess returns through stock selection as the breadth of stocks outperforming their benchmarks increases much like the market concentration trends in cross sectional volatility and cross sectional correlations show encouraging signs for active managers as correlations fall the breadth of idiosyncratic opportunities increases an environment where cross sectional correlations are falling and cross sectional volatility is rising would be the ideal scenario for active managers the early 2000s is a great example with an extended period of low correlations and higher volatility that proved to be a highly effective stock picking environment fast forwarding to 2021 the gradual return to normalcy has driven both these measures back to a tailwind for active managers with governments aforementioned scrutiny on mega cap tech renewed commitment to supportive fiscal policy and central banks pledging to remain accommodative for the foreseeable future this trend is expected to continue correlations were at an all time high between 2017 2020 which coincides with a par ticu larly challenging period for active managers the recent drop in correlations reflects a market coming out of crisis mode and a return to bottom up drivers of stock performance americans are sitting on an estimated 2 2 trillion in excess savings the trend in cross sectional volatility is also on a positive trajectory enhancing return opportunities a key driver for the weakening fortunes of active managers in the late 2010s and resurgence in the covid recovery has been interest rates source herfindahl hirschman index as of march 31 2021 source factset msci consensus has been that for active management s fortunes to turn interest rates don t need to rise they just need to stop falling as economies continue to reopen and spending ramps up inflation has become a concern in fact april s month over month consumer price index inflation increase in the us was the steepest since 1981 us 10 year treasury yields have risen off all time lows in 2020 and americans are sitting on an estimated 2 2 trillion in excess savings supply shortages have spread from construction and lumber to tech nology and semiconductors these effects have and will likely continue to feed short term inflation concerns which have already resulted in rising 10 year treasury yields in the us this new environment has had a direct impact on tech names as growth companies that rely on longer duration earnings are disproportionately impacted by higher discount rates even if this short term inflationary spike proves temporary the economic recovery is underway and expected to be prolonged given the strength of consumer balance sheets in other words without another unpredictable deflationary shock interest rates are not expected to drop opportunities become more pronounced when coming from extreme starting points valuation spreads fiscal monetary policy and market concentration are all coming off historically elevated levels these factors combined with falling correlations and higher than average volatility contribute to the belief that the active management environment has dramatically improved and

in centralised finance we distrust growing distrust in central banks and centralised finance was the driving force behind the creation of bitcoin after the financial collapse of 2008 the situation has become even more dire since then the meteoric rise in price of bitcoin is testament to this the more people that buy and hold bitcoin the more freedom people will have el salvador clashes with imf el salvador recently reported that they will make bitcoin legal tender in consequence the imf which provides loans and grants to countries essentially the federal reserve bank for the world is going after el salvador by giving them a warning about making bitcoin legal tender on the surface the imf says el salvador s decision raises a number of macroeconomic financial and legal issues that require very careful analysis since they claim crypto assets can pose significant risks therefore effective regulatory measures are very important when dealing with them in reality the imf is running scared of eventually being made redundant if the imf does not get its way they can then decide to curtail relief packages sent to el salvador and any other country that chooses this path in reality the imf and world bank are concerned countries could break free of the need for their existence as other countries pile on such as argentina brazil mexico columbia paraguay and panama while bitcoin s value continues to exponentially rise over time despite two 94 per cent corrections and multiple corrections between 80 and 90 per cent since 2010 these are countries where millions have suffered massive loss of buying power from their often plummeting currencies many remain unbanked their respective economies are unstable even india is now doing a 180 by considering bitcoin as an asset class of its own within their financial system which could make it exempt from india s ban on doing business with cryptocurrencies as with india both russia and china have banned various aspects of bitcoin over the last decade but then had no choice but to lift some of their bans esg connected to the imf s warning both the imf and world bank are pushing the esg initiative esg stands for environmental social and governance esg focuses on environmental concerns such as global warming many banks and institutions are supportive of esg including blackrock merrill lynch jp morgan and bank of america because it indirectly gives them more control over the flow of money esg scores are kept on individuals which can affect one s credit rating which then impacts the odds of an individual getting a loan or a mortgage the esg score of an individual or company may drop if bitcoin is bought companies with low esg scores can also be penalised with higher interest rates on loans due to lower credit ratings various research papers have studied the effect of environmental social and governance esg performance on credit ratings it comes as no surprise that bank of america does not allow their customers to buy bitcoin while merrill lynch s edge the firm s digital investment service adds esg scores to its client dashboard billionaire chamath palihapitiya who believes in climate change said esg is a fraud as it does little to contribute to reducing emissions but instead could enable major companies to borrow at negative rates of interest if their esg rating is sufficiently high ultimately esg scores could be used to try to curtail the buying of bitcoin nevertheless shark tank s kevin o leary expects a flood of institutional money into bitcoin when esg standards are met while this makes sense it could take a number of weeks or months to reach this point an eternity when it comes to the breakneck speeds of the cryptospace so in the meantime the various headwinds bitcoin faces could pressure its price so it could trade sideways retest lows or even break below recent lows around 30 000 the world has seen how governments controlled the movement of individuals across most countries when covid hit what would stop governments from using esg as a form of control against bitcoin the basel committee on banking supervision released a report that cited risks including market and credit risk fraud hacking money laundering and terrorist financing bitcoin s metaversal anti fragility versus fud the esg is not bitcoin friendly as they subscribe to the wrongheaded belief about bitcoin s energy consumption bitcoin has mistakenly been accused of using too much energy to mine yet no one talks about the far greater amount of energy it takes to mine gold or put up christmas lights or operate the outdated legacy banking system i discuss the whole matter here but wrongheaded views by who i call the flat earthers are as old as the hills and affect legislation we have seen this countless times two examples of many were witch hunt crimes such as the red scare in the 1950s which destroyed the careers of many and reefer madness in the 1960s which made marijuana the devil s drug and spawned many anti drug laws most recently covid misinformation and disinformation was used to lockdown much of the planet so bitcoin s energy consumption could be used as a way to curtail institutional investment in bitcoin esg g 7 world bank basel committee and fincen together with big institutions who slow their buying of bitcoin due to energy consumption issues could create a perfect storm bitcoin retesting or undercutting prior lows of 30 000 could occur but due to its robust sustained tailwinds this would be a significant buy point indeed bitcoin s on and off chain metrics are strongly bullish along with a number of major technical indicators signalling deeply oversold or critical bottoms many of which i have cited in prior reports nevertheless i have always advised selling on price volume action depending on one s time frame fundamentals be damned metrics help light the way as they so far have been good at identifying whether the bull market is over or not with bitcoin i use technicals over longer time frames to avoid getting whipsawed in the year 2000 stock fundamentals looked as good as could be but march 2000 was a clear sell signal i had no idea the big dot com bull was over until later in 2000 and found myself making nearly no trades over the next three years while the worst bear market in the history of the nasdaq unfolded of course when it comes to buying i have also always said i buy based on both technicals and fundamentals and when it comes to crypto making use of on and off chain metrics to gauge the size of your exposure to cryptocurrencies we are currently rhyming with the three major corrections exceeding 50 per cent in bitcoin that occurred during bull markets since 2012 mid 2013 mid 2017 and march 2020 metrics overall remain bullish as they did in those prior corrections early 2018 was different in that my metrics gave a major sell signal in jan 2018 the first such signal since early 2014 since the major buy signal in mar 2019 issued by my metrics i have yet to see evidence of a major sell signal michael saylor received 1 6 billion in recent offers from vcs and hedge funds as they want to accumulate bitcoin so microstrategy is increasing its position in bitcoin by at least 1 billion as for saylor being forced to sell btc as its price drops this link clears up this fud despite this and other matters of fasb accounting many still cling to their mistaken notions when it comes to bitcoin it s like 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 all over again and reminds me of leftists who go cognitively dissonant when it comes to understanding and accepting higher order effects from the covid lockdowns since early 2020 but instead resort to ad hominem attacks including well if you don t understand my point you re not

as stony coral disease carved a catastrophic path along florida s reef tract and parts of the caribbean decimating the boulder corals that help build reefs scientists raced to collect healthy corals before the disease struck and untangle genetics to breed more resilient offspring now they are working on another piece of the puzzle determining whether the corals can survive in the disease s wake there s concern that if there s disease out there where are we going to plant these corals that may get the disease or expose those wild colonies to disease said martine d alessandro a university of miami researcher at the rosenstiel school of marine and atmospheric science working on the project the idea is to see what happens when we plant these corals if disease does become introduced or if the corals we plant are more susceptible over two days in may teams of university and nonprofit scientists led by the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission and florida department of environmental protection planted more than 1 100 colonies including mountainous star coral knobby brain coral and great star coral onto reefs at two dozen sites from martin county to the keys understanding where and when it is safe to start out planting species that are susceptible to stony coral tissue loss disease again is a major first step in restoring the resilience of florida s coral reef said fdep deputy secretary adam blalock in a statement calling the project the first of its kind since it was first detected off virginia key in 2014 stony coral disease has spread across florida s reef tract the only barrier reef in north america it s since spread to caribbean and bahamian reefs becoming one of the most severe coral diseases on record in may it reached the dry tortugas a remote protected area with little ship traffic that scientists had hoped would escape an infection scientists are still trying to determine how the disease spreads but suspect ballast water from ships may move it around courtesy andy bruckner the pace and scale of the outbreak has lead to an international rescue effort and fast paced research on how to better protect reefs under increasing pressure from pollution and warming oceans fueled by climate change leading up to the reef wide plantings d alessandro said the team exchanged more than 6 000 corals tended to in labs many were rescued before they could be infected with the disease with the goal of using them to rebuild reefs no easy task for coral colonies that can sometimes grow larger than seven feet the largest colony of mountainous star coral nicknamed big momma and located off hollywood was the size of a compact car and at least 300 years old having survived centuries of hurricanes and the transformation of florida s coast from sleepy dune and mangrove lined beaches to condo canyons stony coral disease the national oceanic and atmospheric administration reported killed it in just a few months new techniques developed by the mote marine lab have allowed researchers to fragment coral that helped make the rescue possible d alessandro said they re so big and bulky it was just challenging to transport them around you would only be able to plant one large colony at a time she said by cutting them down to about one inch squares scientists are able to build up stocks in labs continuing to fragment the colonies as they grow the technique tripled growth rates d alessandro said those fragments are then cemented to reefs where they can continue to grow carly dennison these boulder coral were removed from the dry tortugas before the disease hit and were sent to zoos and aquariums to be used later to rebuild reefs the race to rebuild reefs has also put pressure on labs to become creative turning them into construction zones i didn t even know the name of half the tools we have before i started working with this lab d alessandro said we buy a lot of strange things like cooking ware we buy pastry bags to hold cement we buy farming equipment to track our corals so we buy all sorts of bizarre things the newly planted corals will be monitored monthly until july 2022 to see how they fare and whether they help lure back fish and other wildlife reefs need to survive sites were chosen because they had been used in the past or provided the best opportunity for coral to survive d alessandro said the idea of this project is making sure that it s safe to add corals rather than adding corals to a system that s got active disease she said if the disease does return she said scientists will be closely watching how they respond and looking for species that may show signs of being more tolerant copyright 2021 wlrn 91 3 fm

get the inside scoop on today s biggest stories in markets tech and business delivered daily read preview like a painter s brush a ballerina s pointe shoe is her most important piece of equipment pointe shoes extend a dancer s range of movement and allow them to stay suspended in the air and move more quickly across the stage since their invention in italy in the 1800s they ve come to define ballet as we know it at popular pointe shoe maker freed of london which works with ballerinas at some of the most renowned ballet companies in the world including the royal ballet in london and american ballet theater in new york city there are 24 artisans dedicated to crafting handmade shoes for ballerinas at every level while there are many different companies that produce shoes freed is renowned for its dedication to customization a tradition that can be traced back to the company s founding in 1929 by cobbler frederick freed and his wife dora this story is available exclusively to business insider subscribers become an insider and start reading now custom shoes are typically worn by professional dancers and paid for by the companies with whom they dance costing about 100 a pair companies make substantial investments in these essential instruments advertisement pointe shoes freed of london at the royal ballet the annual shoe budget exceeds 350 000 and some dancers can go through up to three pairs a day the company told insider american ballet theater reported that each female dancer is allotted 10 pairs of pointe shoes a week equaling about 3 600 pairs each year central to the freed s practices are the 24 shoemakers themselves specially trained to build a pointe shoe from scratch here s a look at what their jobs are like on a day to day basis the career of a shoemaker the makers create both stock and custom shoes averaging about 30 pairs a day and are paid per piece pointe shoes freed of london many of them are known to the dancers by just a single letter or symbol a bell or fish for example that indicates their handiwork while a dancer will usually try out several makers at first they grow attached to one specific maker over time who fulfills their custom orders advertisement the training for the role is mostly done on the job prospective makers apprentice with freed and are taught the basics of shoemaking at first very little of what they produce is usable but some take to the job with ease it came naturally to me taksim eratli who s known as the anchor maker and been with freed for 18 years told insider i would say it took me about six to eight months to master the making still it s a while until the new hires are entrusted to fill custom orders as they learn we put them next to other very experienced makers so they can mentor them and are on hand to say what s good or what s bad sophie simpson a senior manager of sales and pointe shoe fitter who s been with freed since 1998 told insider related stories there are innumerable customizations that a dancer can specify for their shoe freed can change the strength of the insole the sides the strength of the block the stiff cup that encases the toes and allows dancers to rise en pointe the length of the back and more as the shoe is meant to support a dancer s foot customization isn t just for fit but also for injury prevention advertisement many of the makers once trained stay at freed for the rest of their careers sometimes upwards of 30 or 40 years because the shoes themselves and the way they re made are so specific to each dancer makers become critical to a dancer s career as well having a comfortable shoe can make or break a performance brittany pollack a soloist with new york city ballet told insider when i m onstage the last thing i want to worry about is how my shoes are feeling the assembly process the first essential step in the shoemaking process is a fitting the fitters work out the length and width of a dancer s foot and then select a maker that can naturally produce the type of shoe that fits their needs all the makers follow the same system simpson said but there is a slight difference because the shoes are made by hand simpson compares this to variations in handwriting the words can be the same but the way writing looks on the page will differ from person to person advertisement if one maker retires it can be disappointing news for a dancer pollack who had used the same maker since first joining new york city ballet in 2006 was recently told that bell her maker had retired i probably tried about 10 different makers over a period of a few months to find what pair would work best for me she said finally pollack found a replacement the diamond maker when i first put those shoes on i knew right away that they felt right she said the day starts early at the company s london factory i get up at 4 30 a m and i m at work by 6 30 a m eratli said my finishing may vary but i m usually done by 2 45 or 3 p m all of the work is planned often months in advance the factory is high energy throughout the workday which eratli finds enjoyable it s where all the magic happens eratli said advertisement the makers build the shoes inside out in layers beginning with the outer sole the sole is staple gunned or tacked together and then covered in the satin fabric and canvas lining an extra pocket is left at the top where the maker will build the block the block according to eratli is the most difficult element of the shoemaking process it can be made in a variety of ways using fabric pieces papers sacking or other materials that determine its strength the pointe shoe assembly process freed of london halfway through the assembly process the shoe is tied down and sent to the stitching area up until this point the shoe remains inside out once the sole is stitched on the shoe returns to the maker where it s turned the right way out the process is completed by shaping the block with a rounded hammer once the shoe is shaped it s baked overnight in the factory s industrial oven changing with the times while the shoemaking process is steeped in tradition as the times change so does freed the company often speaks with dance medics rehabilitation and physical therapy teams and other experts to improve upon the safety of the shoe we re renowned for being as healthy for a dancer as a pointe shoe can be simpson said the company has begun to make pointe shoes for men which are typically much bigger and stronger at the toe as more male dancers gravitate to pointe work advertisement they also create shoes in a variety of colors for special occasions or for different skin tones this is a divergence from freed s signature peachy pink that famous choreographer george balanchine first fell in love with and which no other shoe company can use new pointe shoe colors freed of london now as ballet reckons with its history of exclusion and more dancers of color are represented in the professional world there s a need for shoes that reflect the diversity onstage freed coordinates colors to replicate what was meant to be achieved with the ballet pink not necessarily to match skin

kathy l davis special to the state journal register on december 31 2019 i retired from the illinois department of veterans affairs i began to enjoy my retirement in january 2020 well at least i thought i was the covid 19 pandemic was just starting then in march 2020 the united states shut down everyone started running to the stores to stock up on the most important items we usually sparingly purchase hand sanitizer and disinfectant spray stores started running out the hand soap paper towels and toilet paper were running out food and other grocery items were sparse more coronavirus fears spark panic buying as months went by i found myself getting up as early as 5 a m to run to stores throughout springfield looking for items i listed above sometimes i got lucky and sometimes i did not some stores only allowed you to get one item of each it was like the employees were on police patrol guarding how many you were trying to get so i said okay i am going to go back and forth and put my purchase in the car and go back to get more when i got a certain amount i started contacting family and friends to see if they had the items some did and most did not going back to my retirement things were at a standstill no vacation trips and no visiting people out of town and no retirement party no big backyard parties everything was very limited i remember being in the store and someone coughed and sneezed and everyone froze i could not believe it when easter came it was very quiet i started to think how long are we going to be like this we have to wear masks stores limited the number of people to enter i found myself standing outside in the rain at times during the month of may 2020 i had a small gathering for my birthday everyone had to wear masks and sanitize hands i limited myself being around people and the number of people in attendance well the numbers started going up with people catching covid as well as dying i could not believe my eyes i constantly had my eyes glued to cnn then all the other stuff start happening with police which i do not wish to go into but just to mention it was during the pandemic my lord my life changed confined to home or my friends homes we all were comfortable around each other we would keep our circle very small so it was the normal thing as months went by while they were trying to find a cure for the covid 19 november i normally have family over and we have a blessed good time well not this year everyone decided to stay home i decided i would do something different i fed several of my senior friends as well as other friends i cooked a big meal like i always did and had them come by and pick up to go plates everyone was so grateful for what i did on this day i was blessed to be retired and able to serve over 12 people on thanksgiving in november i was to have scopic surgery on my knee and was told i had to take a covid test well it came back positive and i could not believe i got it i did everything i was supposed to do to protect myself and my family and to this day i have no idea where i got it from i then told my children and their family to get tested everyone came back negative except my granddaughter who is 10 years old man she took it hard i felt bad because i may have given it to her she had been hanging out with me a lot since school shut down this pushed my surgery back to december 17 which did happen and was very successful christmas came and it was small but blessed in 2021 i lost an uncle several friends and a mentor i received my first covid vaccine on february 23 2021 and the second one on march 23 2021 i received the moderna vaccine after the first shot i had side effects headache and chills and was very tired following the second one i had to go to the er because my blood pressure was 177 over 120 thank god i am here today in april 2021 i received a call inviting me to be a health ambassador for faith coalition for the common good i would go out in the community to reach people of color mainly and others to educate them about getting the covid shot the job consisted of doing a survey with people that had not yet had the vaccine and to find out why more covid 19 vaccine hesitancy fuels steady stream of new local cases at the same time i was being trained for this special task i was in the process of setting up a community partner vaccine clinic at pleasant grove baptist church to which i belong so this was right on time i want to thank erin conley my alderwomen for mentioning the idph community partner vaccine clinic what was so special is that the month of april was national minority health month i had the first clinic on may 1 2021 as ambassador for faith coalition we were responsible to get 50 surveys out of the 50 surveys i was able to get 24 vaccinated praise god the second vaccine was administered on may 22 2021 for those that received their first vaccine as i was watching tv it was mentioned that over 1 5 million people never returned to get their second vaccine i decided to add to the flyer that if you missed your 2nd dose of vaccine to come and get it at the pop up clinic on this same day as i spoke to people one on one as i was doing the survey with them it truly touched my heart people lost jobs loved ones housing had to work double shifts due to covid spread and more i can go on and on i feel i have made a difference for the 24 that were vaccinated i took this special task very seriously because it affected me and i was not alone i want to thank organizer tyshianna bankhead for leading this task as well as the faith coalition i really enjoyed doing this task and will do it again in a heartbeat so this is me being affected by covid kathy l davis is health ambassador for faith coalition for the common good for more information about the faith coalition for the common good fccg2208 gmail com or phone 217 544 2297

the legality of cannabis differs greatly in the u s depending on where you live america is seeing green and i m not just talking about the huge gains in investors portfolios we re witnessing a cannabis revolution in the u s that s picking up steam at an extraordinary pace which could very well allow marijuana to be one of the fastest growing industries of the 2020s this revolution starts with americans across the country according to national pollster gallup an all time record 68 of respondents wanted to see cannabis legalized nationally in its 2020 survey that s up from 66 in the previous two years and it effectively doubles the support for legalization witnessed two decades earlier however whether you can buy cannabis products or not depends on where you live or where you re shopping here s an all encompassing rundown of where each of the 50 states currently stands on marijuana these states have legalized the consumption and sale of adult use weed along with medical pot there are currently 18 states whose residents have voted to legalize adult use cannabis or whose legislature passed a bill to green light its consumption and or sale but as of june 23 2020 only 11 of those 18 recreationally legalized states had operational dispensaries selling adult use cannabis these 11 states are in alphabetical order alaska arizona california colorado illinois maine massachusetts michigan nevada oregon washington most of these 11 states are long established markets with washington and colorado commencing adult use sales in 2014 followed by oregon in 2015 alaska in 2016 nevada in 2017 and california and massachusetts in 2018 california is the largest cannabis market in the world by annual sales with 4 4 billion in weed revenue in 2020 this comprised about 27 of legal cannabis sales in the u s last year these states have ok d recreational and medical pot but adult use sales haven t yet begun while the aforementioned 11 states are raking in the recreational cannabis revenue seven states are waiting in the wings for their chance to begin ringing the register these states are again in alphabetical order connecticut montana new jersey new mexico new york vermont virginia since the november election we ve witnessed a rash of legalizations new jersey new york new mexico virginia and connecticut have all signed legislation to make recreational marijuana legal over the past four months however it could still be a while before sales commence in these states for montanans jan 1 2022 is the day they ll be given a green light to purchase recreational weed meanwhile virginians look like they ll be waiting until jan 1 2024 to buy adult use cannabis products still the wait is even longer for vermonters even though consumption was legalized back in july 2018 retail sales aren t expected to begin until october 2022 at the earliest adult use pot is illegal in these states but medical marijuana has a green light in addition to the 18 states that have ok d recreational marijuana there are another 18 states that allow physicians to prescribe cannabis to patients keep in mind that the qualifications for medical cannabis approval can vary by legalized state though recreational pot is a no go medical access to marijuana is ongoing in these states listed in alphabetical order alabama arkansas delaware florida hawaii louisiana maryland minnesota missouri new hampshire north dakota ohio oklahoma pennsylvania rhode island south dakota utah west virginia arguably the biggest surprise on this list might be south dakota even though residents voted to legalize medical and recreational weed in the november election via two separate measures the state s supreme court struck down the adult use weed amendment likewise you ll note that mississippi no longer appears in this section as a result of its supreme court overturning the voter approved initiative 65 which legalized access to medical cannabis for select patients even though the customer pool for medical weed is smaller than adult use cannabis some states can still be huge moneymakers by 2024 florida is projected to bring in the third highest annual pot sales in the u s recreational and medical marijuana are entirely illegal in these states finally there are 14 remaining states that have neither legalized recreational cannabis nor medical marijuana in alphabetical order these states are georgia idaho indiana iowa kansas kentucky mississippi nebraska north carolina south carolina tennessee texas wisconsin wyoming these 14 states typically have two things in common to begin with they re often headed by republican lawmakers according to gallup s 2020 poll just 48 of self identified republicans favored the idea of legalizing cannabis nationally that compares to 83 of self identified democrats the other commonality is that many of these states lack the initiative and referendum process in simpler terms it means that residents have to rely on their state s legislature to initiate change on the cannabis front with republicans in control in many of these states the impetus to incite cannabis reform just isn t there cannabis stocks are going to see green with nearly three quarters of the country now legalized in some capacity we ve hit the point where federal cannabis reform is no longer necessary for marijuana stocks to thrive as long as the federal government allows states to establish their own laws and regulate their own pot industry multistate operators mso have a very good chance of cashing in on the cannabis boom the easiest way for investors to get rich from cannabis is to focus on msos that are at or near recurring profitability as well as those that have clearly defined or unique growth strategies for example trulieve cannabis tcnnf 2 97 checks all the appropriate boxes it s delivered 13 consecutive profitable quarters and offers one of the most unique growth strategies of trulieve s 91 operating dispensaries as of june 23 2021 85 of them were located in florida by saturating the sunshine state trulieve has been able to effectively build up its brand without breaking the bank with marketing costs planet 13 holdings plnh f is another mso that should check all applicable boxes while not profitable yet planet 13 rapidly rising sales have it on the cusp of recurring profitability the crazy thing is it has only one operating dispensary at the moment albeit it s a doozy the superstore in las vegas nevada spans 112 000 square feet and features an events center consumer facing processing center a café and abundant selling space in other words planet 13 has become a go to destination for cannabis tourists by later this year it ll have a second large store open in santa ana california the point is this the arrow for pot stocks is pointing higher with every new state level legalization in the u s

the oracle of omaha might not like robinhood but he definitely likes several robinhood stocks warren buffett clearly doesn t like the robinhood trading platform very much at berkshire hathaway s brk a 1 27 brk b 1 35 annual shareholder meeting in may the famous investor said that robinhood has become a very significant part of the casino aspect the casino group that has joined into the stock market in the last year or year and a half that doesn t mean that buffett doesn t see eye to eye with robinhood investors at times though several of the stocks most widely held by investors on the no commission trading platform are also in berkshire s portfolio here are buffett s three favorite robinhood stocks based on the size of berkshire s stake in each stock apple the second most popular stock on robinhood is literally the apple aapl 1 11 of buffett s eye apple is by far the largest holding in berkshire s equity portfolio last year buffett said that apple was probably the best business i know in the world why does the legendary investor like apple so much for one thing buffett has always preferred businesses that generate high margins and return on equity at berkshire s latest shareholder meeting he listed apple first as one of a handful of terrific examples of such businesses the oracle of omaha also likes that apple markets sticky products this is a reference to the company s ability to retain customers in its ecosystem built around the iphone companies such as apple that have loyal customer bases also tend to have strong pricing power it seems likely that buffett and robinhood investors will be proven right about prizing apple stock so highly the increased adoption of 5g networks should continue to fuel higher iphone sales apple s focus on augmented reality ar apps and devices could also pay off handsomely over the next few years bank of america bank of america bac 2 86 is without question the most popular bank stock among robinhood investors it s also clearly buffett s favorite bank stock ranking behind only apple as the largest position in berkshire s portfolio buffett has long liked bank stocks in general in large part because of their ability to deliver a strong return on equity however over the last few quarters he has significantly trimmed berkshire s stakes in bank stocks with the notable exception of bank of america boa there are probably three key reasons why buffett remains such a big fan of boa he respects the company s management team led by ceo brian moynihan buffett likely thinks that boa will continue to generate increasing profits he also almost certainly views the big bank s strong capitalization as a major plus those three attributes could very well translate to solid gains for buffett and for many robinhood investors the federal reserve board has already indicated that interest rate increases will be on the way in the not too distant future bank of america ranks as one of the top stocks set to benefit from these coming rate hikes coca cola coca cola ko 1 34 might be a somewhat surprising member of robinhood s top 100 most popular stocks the beverage giant hasn t delivered impressive returns in recent years however there s no surprise whatsoever that coca cola is a buffett favorite the stock ranks as berkshire s fourth largest holding buffett thinks so highly of coke primarily because of the company s strong moat the coca cola brand he understands that most customers won t go for a rival product even if it s priced lower of course buffett also knows that the best businesses are built to last coca cola founded in 1892 has been the world s leading soft drink maker for longer than most people have been alive coca cola stock might not deliver the biggest returns for buffett or robinhood investors going forward however it s still a solid pick and remains a dividend investor s dream buffett who has publicly stated that he drinks five of the company s soft drinks each day will probably have a coke and a smile for years to come as those dividends flow in

last year the times reporter sarah reese provided great investigative insight into the toxic coal ash present in northwest indiana unfortunately this issue has not been resolved and still poses a threat coal ash is a byproduct of coal combustion this ash consists of a startling concoction of carcinogenic chemicals which include mercury cadmium and arsenic it is so potent that it cannot be put into our air and must be injected into an artificial pond to create a toxic slurry unfortunately this slurry leaches into our waterways and seeps into the ground tragically poisoning the water we drink indiana state legislators ignored both bills on removing coal ash from the floodplain in indiana leaving this contamination to continue leaking into the groundwater rivers streams and lake michigan thankfully legislation introduced to congress would work to strengthen preventative measures to this potentially catastrophic problem this bill is called the ensuring of safe disposal of coal ash act i urge rep mrvan sens braun and young to support this legislation that takes the proper steps to ensure that utilities oversee a safe and complete closure of toxic coal ash waste pits blake gardiner munster

these three dividend stocks will provide financial peace of mind during retirement a retirement portfolio should be built on a foundation of strong stocks and fixed income assets across a variety of industries but one of the most important aspects of a great retirement stock is that it pays a dividend because those payments will help your portfolio thrive during periods of market turbulence in order to help you find stocks that will help you breeze through retirement financially three motley fool contributors are recommending three dividend paying stocks that can be solid additions to your retirement portfolio a powerful payer for your portfolio eric volkman consolidated edison one of the sturdiest dividend stocks on the scene is consolidated edison ed 2 46 the long standing utility that supplies power and natural gas to new york city and its environs dividend raises from con ed as new yorkers like to call it are so reliable the company is a dividend aristocrat one of only a clutch of s p 500 index stocks that have lifted their payouts at least once annually for a minimum of 25 years in a row in fact before long con ed will join an even more exclusive club that of the dividend kings these are the companies have done the once per year minimum raise thing for at least 50 years just now the company s streak stands at 47 con ed has the ahem power to keep upping the payout because it supplies a voracious market that s never satisfied new york city is famously a 24 hour municipality and con ed is a major part of keeping those lights on as a utility in a rather heavily regulated environment its revenue around 12 billion and change annually doesn t shift around much yet the company can and does take advantage of efficiencies which in good times help boost profitability even in bad times it manages to earn plenty of coin for example despite the steep challenge of the coronavirus pandemic last year in which many individual and business customers left the crowded city in hopes of escaping infection con ed landed well in the black on the bottom line at just over 1 1 billion new york city is already emerging from its coronavirus bunker and con ed should benefit commensurately recently the company guided for 4 to 6 annual growth across the coming half decade which is an impressive rate for the typically slow burn utility sector con ed also has a bright future ahead of it as a major producer of renewable energy specifically solar the demand for which will only increase in a world going ever greener nobody finds utilities to be an exciting investment and the coronavirus slump made some investors give up on con ed as a result the company s share price has dipped and its dividend yield has risen in fact with the latter at a relatively chunky 4 2 the stock is one of the top 10 highest yielders among the dividend aristocrats sure 4 plus is a nice haul for anyone looking for a good income stream and given con ed s rock solid business and its ideal position from which to take advantage of new york city s latest comeback we can expect some happy growth in both fundamentals and share price once bitten twice shy can create a great opportunity chuck saletta kinder morgan energy pipeline giant kinder morgan kmi 1 14 currently offers investors a nearly 6 yield even better it offers that yield after completing a massive transformation that started when it was forced to cut its dividend in late 2015 to protect its balance sheet that s important to understand because it means the kinder morgan of today is a much stronger company than it was prior to its dividend cut today s dividend is much more sustainable and while its dividend growth rate has recently dropped below expectations its cash flow and thus dividend coverage remains strong with natural gas and oil usage projected to remain steady or increase over the next several decades it s likely that its pipelines will remain in demand for a long time to come as a retiree looking for dividends that should matter a great deal after all when a dividend gets cut the company s stock often falls too once retired you no longer have a paycheck to rely on to cover your costs or replenish your investments if they evaporate as a result having a good reason to believe your dividend stream can continue should be of paramount importance since a cut could decimate both your income and your nest egg if even that s not enough to make kinder morgan look like an attractive dividend stock to consider there s another key reason generally speaking it s both politically difficult and economically expensive to build new pipeline capacity that helps protect operators like kinder morgan that already have a large number of existing pipelines in their networks put it all together and kinder morgan has a decently high yield that looks well covered by cash flows a healthier balance sheet than it did before good reason to believe its business will remain in demand for decades some level of built in protection against new competitors with a combination like that retirees looking for dividends could do far worse than considering this pipeline giant the best dividend stock not currently paying a dividend barbara eisner bayer walt disney i m going out on a limb here by recommending a dividend stock that s not currently paying a dividend but its strong growth prospects and history of stability trumps that fact when you were little you probably were in love with walt disney dis 0 66 and its universe of characters films and tv shows and if you re a parent or grandparent your children and grandchildren probably are in love with them too you may not love mickey mouse in particular but there must be some cartoon character or superhero who you adore and is brought to life under disney s monstrous ecosystem yes disney suffered immensely during the pandemic as it had to close down its theme parks and cruise ships fiscal year 2020 showed the worst results ever and yet the stock roared 73 7 higher from april 2020 to april 2021 in 2019 before the pandemic hit more than 178 million people visited disney parks worldwide and those people were dropping a whole lot of moola into the company s coffers the parks are now reopening and disney is raising prices and if you must take the kids to disney and of course you must you re going to pay higher prices which means even more money for the media company consumers may not like the higher costs but when the kids are screaming to try the new rides and get pictures with ariel is price really an issue the company s future extends beyond its theme parks and cruise ships disney is a content creation machine and a media juggernaut that plans to release 100 new titles a year for the next several years when it launched its streaming service disney in november 2019 it beat all estimates for subscribers and it s only beginning to open up the service globally clearly disney saved the company during the pandemic and already claims more than 100 million subscribers but streaming is going to play a huge part in its future according to digital tv research revenue from online media properties is anticipated to double between 2019 and 2025 and disney is right there on the front lines to take advantage of that growth to put the icing on the cake disney has been a traditionally good dividend payer and had a history of increasing dividends however during the pandemic it temporarily suspended its dividend which saved the company a whopping 3 2 billion management has stated that it plans to begin paying dividends again soon and there s no reason to doubt that in the meantime investors who were upset by the lack of dividend payment were calmed by that increase of 73 7 in the stock price so even though there s no current dividend disney gets my vote as one of the best dividend stocks to add to your portfolio management s decision turned out to be a brilliant one for the company and bold leadership is one of the things i look for when selecting a stock for my senior years disney has been around since 1923 and has only grown bigger and better the company is here to stay and no slowdown in growth is in sight and that s why even though the dividend is on temporary hiatus it s one of the best stocks you can buy for your retirement portfolio

by barani krishnan investing com the oil bull is unhinged as much as the crude bear was 15 months ago back then it was to drive the market down as much as possible and that did happen taking it to minus 40 per barrel for u s crude now of course it is to take it the other way and that has happened too with the market rising more than 50 on the year to just shy of 75 a barrel on friday that said neither super low nor super high oil prices are good for the world dirt cheap oil prices can destroy economies that depend almost entirely on the so called black gold commodity think not just of saudi arabia and russia here or the combined forces of the 23 nations under opec think also of the united states which has always been an oil producer while being the no 1 consumer as well the u s was never a part of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries cartel led by the saudis yet until last year s coronavirus outbreak it was also the world s top producer thanks to the shale oil and fracking boom the pandemic devastated the coffers of countries that produced oil it also severely disrupted the finances of companies involved in almost every aspect of upstream and downstream work in the industry most importantly it brought to a complete halt investments in e p or exploration and production that s vital to the security of future oil and gas supplies the freeze on e p can have untold ramifications for the world once the low demand period for oil ends and high or even regular consumption kicks in for one production cannot be ramped up overnight given the gestation period between exploration and when first oil is struck also the hangover from low oil prices can slow the transition to drill baby drill this is what is happening now in the permian the largest u s shale oil basin shale drillers burnt again and again from overproduction refuse to go back to their old ways even if they wished their shareholders would not allow it punishing them with severe share price corrections each time they utter higher output plans thus u s production is stuck at 11 million barrels daily unable to rise meaningfully let alone return to the pre pandemic world record of 13 million finally the biden administration s goal of expanding green renewable energies over fossil fuels has contributed to the perfect storm against higher oil and gas production while output cannot grow quickly enough demand is just starting to explode with the u s national vaccination rate against the covid 19 nearing 50 and social distancing and other pandemic protocols discarded in almost every of its 50 states americans are rediscovering their wanderlust and boosting gasoline consumption in the process u s airport security is clearing up to 2 million people a day the first time since march 2020 meaning flights and demand for jet fuel are spiking too the price of oil rising week after week new york traded wti has risen a net 17 over the past five weeks and london s brent s 15 exacts a greater toll on the world than the negative impact of it falling why because oil is the commodity that literally moves the world and when it rises the cost of everything else goes up leading to worldwide inflation history has shown that high oil prices don t recycle well through the economy and spikes in oil prices tend to be associated with recessions the paris based international energy agency which looks after the interest of western oil importing nations has urged opec to start tapping its spare production capacity to bolster supply major consumers such as india the third largest oil importer have been imploring saudi arabia for months to raise production in the u s the world s largest destination for oil pump prices of are already at 7 year highs above 3 per gallon even saudi oil minister abdulaziz bin salman surprised many by acknowledging on thursday that crude prices may have risen too much too fast we have a role in taming and containing inflation by making sure that this market doesn t get out of hand he said on thursday a week before the upcoming opec meeting on july 1 one only wonders if he s sincere with his worry over global inflation and will increase the group s output by at least 500 000 barrels per day in august for its third hike since the start of this year oil bulls in the meantime are pressing ahead reveling in iran s missing this week of a deadline to renew its temporary atomic monitoring pact with international inspectors the review is key for ensuring tehran gets an agreement with global powers to remove u s sanctions on its oil exports data on friday also showed crude stockpiles in china at february lows meaning the world s second largest oil importer would probably have to stock up more to the delight of oil bulls much will depend on whether the saudi oil minister alternatively referred to as abs by his initials will allow an opec output hike large enough to cool the market since he came to office a little less than two years ago each abs chaired meeting of the oil cartel began with calls for significantly higher production quotas he deftly shot each one down reminding the output hawks in the group that there s something else more important the price of oil itself and of course demand and market share as a result of abs efforts compliance to saudi led production cuts in opec a group often known for overpromising and under delivering has reached an unbelievable 122 the additional 22 means they are over delivering by that much now though a huge portion of the total cuts come from just one source saudi arabia itself abs determination in holding onto cuts opec is still withholding almost 6 million barrels of its daily capacity from the market is evident from the mantra he recites each time he s asked whether he s happy about oil demand i will believe it when i see it yes despite global inventories back at five year seasonal trends despite the market virtually draining all the excess supply from the covid triggered glut despite u s drillers pumping 2 million barrels less per day now than before the pandemic and despite a barrel trading three times higher today than 15 months ago the saudi minister is still not convinced about oil demand counting on the saudi minister to help reduce oil prices meaningfully while his actual job is to do the opposite is akin to giving a fox responsibility over a barn of chickens but the world has no other choice for now as long only speculators in oil will not stop what they are doing goldman sachs estimates the market is running a deficit of 3 million barrels a day and has predicted a brent price of 80 next not to be outdone bank of america has forecast 100 a barrel which has become the latest clarion call for bulls these wall street trading behemoths are responsible as much for the inflation in oil by repeatedly egging the market toward their forecasts with cherry picked research that help their calls to become self fulfilling prophecies some are blaming the federal reserve for the mess saying its penchant for printing its way out of any crisis with indiscriminate stimulus and bloating of money supply is finally catching up with the u s central bank perhaps but the covid crisis was an extraordinary contingency that demanded extraordinary responses some of the voices critical of the fed are saying that hedging in oil is one of the best strategies for investors now as their portfolios will be shielded from dollar devaluation by a solid commodity i ll say there s an even better commodity built for that gold higher gold prices do not hurt the global economy the way oil prices do at some point consumers are going to lose their patience with soaring oil prices under extreme circumstances humanity finds extreme solutions the pandemic was a textbook example with world oil demand grinding to a virtual halt bringing opec to its knees a year from now if 50 of the working population goes back to telecommuting because of high oil prices what do you think will happen to the market also to the imbeciles calling for 200 oil remember what 147 did to the global economy in 2008 perhaps their rationale is i m going for the kill now to hell with what happens tomorrow this reminds me of a classic scene from the 70s saturday night fever when protagonist tony played by travolta expresses his dismay with his boss for refusing his plea for an advance with the senior man saying he was acting out of conscience for his young employee s future oh the future tony howls no tony you can t the future his boss replies the future s you it catches up with you and it s you don t with consumers oil bulls oil price roundup new york traded the benchmark for u s oil soared to as high as 74 25 per

the yellow metal through its travails of the past six months since january gold has been on a tough ride that actually began in august last year when it came off record highs above 2 000 and meandered for a few months before stumbling into a systemic decay from november when the first breakthroughs in covid 19 vaccine efficiencies were announced at one point gold raked a near 11 month bottom at under 1 674 lately gold also hasn t lived up to its billing as a hedge against inflation or the best store of value in times of financial or political troubles the key u s inflation gauge monitored by the federal reserve rose for a third month in a row in may while personal income and consumer sentiment fell according to data that demonstrated growing price pressures against weaker buying from

aj willingham cnn there are some things that cannot be properly explained within the lines of your average news website ice planet barbarians is one of those things the science fiction romance series chronicles a band of human women stranded on you guessed it an ice planet along with the hunky blue aliens who love them and the many many unprintable things they do to each other and despite the first installment being written more than five years ago ice planet barbarians books have been flooding amazon s bestseller lists since may they re topping the sci fi charts and have caused a frenzy on social media bookstores have even made special orders to stock some of the 22 main titles in all of their barbaric bare chested glory thank booktok the network of book lovers on tiktok who can catapult books like ice planet barbarians from comfortable niche obscurity to overnight fame with a single viral video how it started if there s one reader to blame for the current ice planet barbarians moment it s emma carter the 22 year old has a familiar story furloughed at the beginning of the pandemic she moved in with her parents in kansas city kansas and dove headfirst into tiktok posting bookish fandom content like sarah j maas series reviews spicy book recommendations and thirst traps of the movie dads from twilight on may 22 carter filmed herself casually making an iced coffee and extolling the virtues of a at the time relatively obscure series watch it here for posterity but be warned there is colorful language whether it was her praise of author ruby dixon s sweet and weirdly complex storytelling the promise of males who are simps and treat their women right or the more uh anatomical aspects ridges knobs something about ice planet barbarians struck a chord over the next few weeks ipb books started popping up on amazon s sci fi and romance bestseller lists occasionally even taking the top spots the first few books in the series have also cracked amazon s overall kindle bestseller list booktok readers are having a ball posting memes and reviews sometimes appearing truly vexed that their casual curiosity about good old fashioned alien erotica coalesced into actual enjoyment carter who has been tagged in an exhausting number of these videos is pretty thrilled i love it it s a testament to the internet and this camaraderie of readers on tiktok she tells cnn there s no shame when you read some people may look at the shirtless men on the covers and think this is the most outlandish disgusting thing you can read but all it took was one person saying with their whole chest i like these books and then all of a sudden other people are reading it they re liking it they re saying oh this is really good too note carter stresses that the ipb series is most definitely 18 and some books contain sensitive content how it s going for a time author ruby dixon was minding her business blissfully unaware that vast swaths of the internet had succumbed to her ice planet barbarians ouvre her first clue was a spike in sales on the amazon kindle store she didn t think too much of it ipb already had a healthy fan base on facebook and benefited from the occasional social shoutout then her mom called did you know you re trending on tiktok she said it s been both amazing and terrifying dixon tells cnn dixon is a private person and tries to avoid getting too far into the social media fray but she loves seeing the creativity and enthusiasm of new ipb fans everyone has been so kind and lovely she says is a totally different vibe than the traditional reviews that books get readers love making fan art they love discussing books and getting their friends to read things it s such a strong creative community dixon is staggeringly prolific she estimates she s written more than 150 books including novellas since 2003 and tries to write between 4 000 and 6 000 words a day she started writing ice planet barbarians for a simple reason a series about virile yet gentlemanly aliens didn t exist yet and maybe it should as a romance and sci fi lover dixon wanted the genres to meet in a very specific way less dark and broody perhaps more humor and babies she has written a whole series of spinoff ipb novellas with titles like ice ice baby and the barbarian before christmas i like a softer happier story i like found family type stories i like a community with a lot of characters so you can feel you get to know everyone she says not every book has to be a pulitzer winning thinkpiece i ve always read escapist happy fiction so that s what i want to write period for those wondering how on earth dixon pitched a huge series about baby crazy barbarians with horns and tails and magical mating parasites she didn t have to the series is self published the power of booktok it isn t unusual for authors to get huge unexpected boosts from tiktokers discovering their work the video sharing app is a powerful platform with intersecting pockets of interest fantasy romance and young adult novels enjoy especially large booktok followings the a court of thrones and roses and throne of glass series by sarah j maas the shadow and bone series by leigh bardugo emotional romances like it ends with us by colleen hoover the song of achilles an award winning romantic retelling of the iliad written by madeline miller and published in 2011 has also enjoyed a recent resurgence thanks to tiktok s enthusiasm the booktok effect is so potent stores like barnes noble keep lists of books that have gone viral on the app holly root of root literary dixon s agent says agencies want to find ways to use the magic of booktok for advertising but right now moments like the ice planet barbarians craze are pure unplanned serendipity any time people are finding something to read that brings them joy and telling other readers about it that s a win and there s a lot of that on booktok she says no thoughts just aliens ice planet barbarians is escapist fiction where concerns about sexual politics interstellar travel and human anatomy are checked at the spaceship door but if you wanted to read deeper into it well you could carter and the series other champions point out the books cover a lot of material that is decidedly not light reading a sexual assault survivor heals and prevails families contend with loss and generational trauma people of all shapes sizes and abilities are shown they are worthy of love and desire dixon says she makes sure to include underrepresented themes like male virginity anyone who bothers to open a romance book of any kind knows the genre is much more than empty headed sex but even if it wasn t who cares there are a lot of conversations in the booktok community about misogyny and snobbery when it comes to books like these carter says this is literally a sci fi book written for the female gaze so what if it s not highbrow literature women can rage against the patriarchy in their real lives and then read about a fun fantasy world and be smart and complex enough to know the difference we ve got to stop demonizing things that women like she says for dixon it can be hard to garner respect as a sci fi romance author one time she says a boss asked her if she tried some of the things in ice planet barbarians on her husband and i wondered do people ask crime writers that luckily attitudes toward romance and erotica seem to be changing as more groups of smart well read people gather in spaces like tiktok often they are young women nursing the twilight and harry potter obsessions of their youth or sharing fan fiction recommendations no matter how obscene or bizarre they may be compared to the recesses of gen z creative writing engines like wattpad and ao3 or certain sections of the amazon kindle store for that matter a little human on alien loving is nothing to clutch your pearls over there is a shift in the culture from when i was younger when you may have read things like fan fiction but you didn t tell your friends about it carter says now as adults we re discovering adult fiction and there is no shame anymore as there shouldn t be you can truly read whatever you want as an adult after all life is hard love is hard some days getting blasted out of the solar system to a planet full of 7 foot tall aliens with glowing soul tapeworms promising to love you unconditionally just doesn t sound so bad the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

these value stocks have strong fundamentals that make them worth buying even into a market downturn row upon row of green continues to paint the pages of stock sites and apps the three major indexes the s p 500 dow jones industrial average and nasdaq composite are at or near all time highs there are plenty of reasons the good times could keep on rolling but eventually a stock market crash will come with that in mind we asked some of our motley fool contributors which dividend stocks are worth buying even if the market crashes they chose brookfield renewable bepc 4 65 chevron cvx 0 41 and union pacific unp 1 64 your one stop clean energy dividend source scott levine brookfield renewable from luxury vehicles to heavy duty trucks each day last summer felt like another electric vehicle ev company was hitching a ride with a special purpose acquisition company spac to hit the public markets with so much attention on evs other areas of the renewable energy sector might have fallen in popularity therein lies an opportunity for savvy investors especially those wary of a steep market downturn brookfield renewable provides a simple approach to gaining exposure to the clean energy industry an approach that also offers investors the chance to get paid handsomely for going green a global leader in renewable energy brookfield renewable has nearly 60 billion in assets under management in addition to 8 gigawatts gw of hydropower projects the company operates a variety of other renewable energy projects including solar wind energy storage and distributed generation representing a total portfolio of 21 gw because brookfield renewable enters into long term power purchase agreements ppas with these projects the company has good insight into future cash flows

executing plans to ensure the company s growth currently brookfield renewable provides investors with an enticing forward dividend yield north of 3 and management aims to increase its payout in a recent investor presentation for example management reaffirmed its long stated target of increasing its annual distribution 5 to 9 and with the company s investment grade balance sheet which s p global ratings assigns as bbb investors can rest easy knowing that the company is in sound financial health a good thing when the market crashes a 5 dividend yield that s worth the risk daniel foelber chevron chevron is one of the rare energy dividend aristocrats despite booms and busts in the oil and gas market it has been able to boost its annual payout for over 30 consecutive years this consistency is due in part to the strength of its balance sheet which continues to be arguably the best of the oil majors like its peers chevron had a rough 2020 but things are looking better so far this year the price of west texas intermediate crude passed 70 per barrel for the first time in over three years which will help chevron s margins for better or worse chevron stock tends to march to the beat of oil and gas prices rather than if the market is rising or falling the oil giant has rebounded nicely from its covid 19 low and is up over 25 year to date handily outperforming the broader indexes the expected uptick in earnings due to higher commodity prices is likely baked into its stock price chevron did an impressive job slashing its spending and reducing its production costs which has allowed it to return positive free cash flow at lower oil prices given this operational advantage a track record for strong financials and consistent dividend raises chevron is an oil stock worth buying before a market crash union pacific lee samaha union pacific it s impossible to predict when a market crash will happen but when it does the likelihood is that most stocks will decline however what you can do is buy stocks that you are willing to hold through a market decline because they are likely to emerge from a slowdown in good shape it also helps if they pay a dividend while you wait for better days to come in this context a railroad specifically union pacific is a great option railroads are the veins and arteries of the u s industrial economy so if you believe in long term economic growth then you think railroads will see revenue growth moreover they own their infrastructure meaning they have strong market positions in addition they operate as effective oligopolies for example union pacific and bnsf dominate the west coast and norfolk southern and csx do the same in the east union pacific currently pays a well covered dividend of nearly 2 and management is implementing an ongoing set of initiatives designed to improve profitability over the long term so all told even when there s a market crash likely caused by an economic slowdown you can be confident that union pacific will emerge from it in good shape when the recovery comes
