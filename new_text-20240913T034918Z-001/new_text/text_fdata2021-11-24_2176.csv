price inflation is affecting everything from entertainment and electronics to things like food and clothing according to reader s digest a shortage of shipping containers a labor crisis shortages of raw materials and even climate change are to blame for this you may have heard of the microchip shortage when the pandemic first began factories that manufacture microchips for electronics and vehicles shut down while orders continued to come in these factories are still playing catch up and struggling to meet demand gas prices rose 42 7 in the last year the pandemic shutting things down for a while and the resurgent demand for oil after lockdowns cop producers off guard and they raised prices to compensate for low supply clothing prices rose 4 2 in august this is due in part to former president trump s trade policies with china making the price of cotton rise according to npr airfare and hotel prices are on the rise as more americans are encouraged to get vaccinated and we ll start traveling again advertisement president biden aims to do what presidents often can t beat inflation share copy link copy lbj tried jawboning richard nixon issued a presidential edict the ford administration printed buttons exhorting americans to whip inflation now over the years american presidents have tried and mostly floundered in their efforts to quell the economic and political menace of consumer inflation now president joe biden is giving it a shot confronting a spike in gasoline and other consumer prices that s bedeviling american households biden on tuesday ordered the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the u s strategic petroleum reserve the move done in coordination with several other major nations is intended to contain energy costs oil markets having anticipated the move were unimpressed with the details oil prices actually rose on the news it was just the latest step biden has taken to show he is doing everything he can to combat inflation as gasoline and food prices in particular have imposed a growing burden on american households on monday he announced that he would reappoint jerome powell as chair of the federal reserve a move meant in part to reassure financial markets that washington is serious about containing consumer prices last month he announced a deal to ease supply backlogs at the port of los angeles by extending operations there to 24 hours a day seven days a week yet none of the president s actions is considered likely to make a meaningful dent in surging prices anytime soon i don t think the president has many levers to pull to bring down the rate of inflation any time soon said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the things he is doing are positive and there s no downside to them but they are on the margins they re not going to move the dial very much inflation is always a tough foe made even more complicated by the unusual recovery from the pandemic recession with shortages of supplies and workers and shipping bottlenecks forcing up prices what is happening to consumer prices the government s consumer price index skyrocketed 6 2 in the 12 months that ended in october the sharpest such jump since 1990 coming after nearly four decades of more or less stable prices the cpi news represents a once in a generation uptick in inflation said sarah binder a george washington university political scientist who studies the fed the problem is pretty stark because it s something that voters notice it s hard to escape the impact of a spike in inflation on your daily life whether it s buying milk or buying gas the average price of regular gasoline has shot up to 3 40 a gallon from 2 11 a year ago according to aaa compounding the pain and heightening the pressure on biden inflation has been outpacing americans income adjusted for price increases average hourly wages were actually down 1 2 last month compared with a year earlier inflation is painful and it s always political said diane swonk chief economist at the accounting and consulting firm grant thornton what s behind the price spike it s partly the consequence of very good news the world economy and america s in particular rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from last year s brief but intense recession it was a result of super low interest rates massive government spending and eventually the broad rollout of vaccines that allowed more of the economy to reopen the swiftness of the rebound caught businesses off guard a year and a half ago they were bracing for the worst laying off workers letting shelves and warehouses go bare reducing investment and factory output and energy companies did the same they cut production of oil and gas as demand for transportation fuels plummeted once demand came roaring back they were unprepared they found themselves scrambling to call back workers and buy enough to fill customer orders ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic countries competed over boatloads of overpriced liquid natural gas periodic covid 19 outbreaks shut down asian ports and factories global supply chains broke down as costs rose many businesses found that they could pass the burden along to consumers in the form of higher prices in the meantime many families had banked their government relief checks and built up their savings some critics also blamed biden s 1 9 trillion emergency aid package for overheating the economy and contributing to inflation pressures economists are divided over how long the inflation spike will last gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial predicts that inflationary pressures will ease as supply chains sort themselves out i expect to see inflation slow in 2022 he said what can presidents do the white house has limited tools for reversing higher prices that task belongs more to the fed which can raise borrowing costs to cool a sizzling economy during the 1960s and 1970s though presidents increasingly felt pressure to do something about inflation because it had become a serious political threat president lyndon johnson tried to persuade companies to forgo price increases and labor unions to limit wage demands a practice known as jawboning when bethlehem steel raised steel prices in 1965 johnson criticized its executives as unpatriotic and they backed down according to robert samuelson s book the great inflation and its aftermath when egg prices rose in 1966 johnson ordered america s surgeon general to highlight the health hazards of cholesterol in eggs with the intent of lowering egg sales and therefore prices nixon imposed wage and price controls in 1971 and 1973 which briefly stifled inflation only to see prices soar once the controls were lifted gerald ford s whip inflation now program encouraged americans to grow their own vegetables reduce their food waste and consume less americans responded mostly by mocking the program some wore the president s win buttons upside down explaining that the resulting nim stood for no immediate miracles what has biden done biden last week signed into a law a 1 trillion public works program which pours money into fixing roads bridges and ports potentially easing the supply chain backlogs that have contributed to rising prices untangling shipping bottlenecks would be doubly helpful it would ease inflationary pressures and boost the economy by increasing the flow of goods to customers last week biden sent a letter to the federal trade commission asking the ftc chair to consider investigating whether higher gasoline prices were the result of illegal conduct the white house is also stepping up anti trust enforcement of the meatpacking industry seeking to increase competition and drive down meat prices his decision to re nominate powell to lead the fed was meant in part to reassure the financial markets of washington s resolve to prevent consumer prices from spiraling out of his control the other likely contender for the job lael brainard a member of the fed s board of governors was perceived as less hawkish toward inflation why did biden tap the strategic petroleum reserve tuesday the idea was that by putting more oil on the market prices would fall that hasn t happened but depending on what happens in the rest of the world there s still a chance it could work america s petroleum reserve holds about 605 million barrels of oil in underground caves in texas and louisiana it was designed in the 1970s in response to the arab oil embargo to store oil in case there was a supply disruption or emergency but the dynamics of the global oil industry changed dramatically in recent years and now the u s exports more oil than it imports the 50 million barrels that biden promised to release will likely be sold slowly at a rate of about 1 million barrels per day meaning that the new influx of oil could last about two months adding even a small amount of oil to the market can tip it into surplus and potentially lower the price said jim burkhard of ihs markit the immediate price reaction is not the final judgment on the effectiveness of this of the effort he added it will really be in the months ahead ___ ap economics writer martin crutsinger contributed to this report
cvs walgreens and walmart pharmacies recklessly distributed massive amounts of pain pills in two ohio counties a federal jury said tuesday in a verdict that could set the tone for u s city and county governments that want to hold pharmacies accountable for their roles in the opioid crisis lake and trumbull counties blamed the three chain pharmacies for not stopping the flood of pills that caused hundreds of overdose deaths and cost each of the two counties about 1 billion their attorney said how much the pharmacies must pay in damages will be decided in the spring by a federal judge it was the first time pharmacy companies had completed a trial to defend themselves in a drug crisis that has killed a half million americans over the past two decades the counties were able to convince the jury that the pharmacies played an outsized role in creating a public nuisance in the way they dispensed pain medication into their communities the law requires pharmacies to be diligent in dealing drugs this case should be a wake up call that failure will not be accepted said mark lanier an attorney for the counties the jury sounded a bell that should be heard through all pharmacies in america lanier said attorneys for the three pharmacy chains maintained they had policies to stem the flow of pills when their pharmacists had any concerns and would notify authorities about suspicious orders from doctors they also said it was the doctors who controlled how many pills were being prescribed for legitimate medical needs spokespeople for cvshealth and walgreen co said the companies disagree with the verdict and will appeal as plaintiffs own experts testified many factors have contributed to the opioid abuse issue and solving this problem will require involvement from all stakeholders in our health care system and all members of our community cvs spokesperson mike deangelis said in a statement walgreen spokesperson fraser engerman said the company believes the court erred in allowing the case to go before a jury on a flawed legal theory that is inconsistent with ohio law as we have said throughout this process we never manufactured or marketed opioids nor did we distribute them to the pill mills and internet pharmacies that fueled this crisis engerman said in a statement the plaintiffs attempt to resolve the opioid crisis with an unprecedented expansion of public nuisance law is misguided and unsustainable two other chains rite aid and giant eagle already had settled lawsuits with the two ohio counties lanier said during the trial that the pharmacies were attempting to blame everyone but themselves the opioid crisis has overwhelmed courts social services agencies and law enforcement in ohio s blue collar corner east of cleveland leaving behind heartbroken families and babies born to addicted mothers lanier told jurors roughly 80 million prescription painkillers were dispensed in trumbull county alone between 2012 and 2016 equivalent to 400 for every resident in lake county some 61 million pills were distributed during that period the rise in physicians prescribing pain medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone came at a time when medical groups began recognizing that patients have the right to be treated for pain kaspar stoffelmayr an attorney for walgreens said at the opening of the trial the problem he said was that pharmaceutical manufacturers tricked doctors into writing way too many pills the counties said pharmacies should be the last line of defense to prevent the pills from getting into the wrong hands they didn t hire enough pharmacists and technicians or train them to stop that from happening and failed to implement systems that could flag suspicious orders lanier said the trial before u s district judge dan polster in cleveland was part of a broader constellation of federal opioid lawsuits about 3 000 in all that have been consolidated under the judge s supervision other cases are moving ahead in state courts kevin roy chief public policy officer at shatterproof an organization that advocates for solutions to addiction said the verdict could lead pharmacies to follow the path of major distribution companies and some drugmakers that have reached nationwide settlements of opioid cases worth billions so far no pharmacy has reached a nationwide settlement it s a signal that the public at least in select places feels that there s been exposure and needs to be remedied roy said the committee of lawyers for the local governments suing the drug industry in federal courts called tuesday s verdict a milestone victory for decades pharmacy chains have watched as the pills flowing out of their doors cause harm and failed to take action as required by law the plaintiffs executive committee said in a statement instead these companies responded by opening up more locations flooding communities with pills and facilitating the flow of opioids into an illegal secondary market the judgment today against walmart walgreens and cvs represents the overdue reckoning for their complicity in creating a public nuisance the government claims against drugmakers distributors and pharmacies hinge on state and local public nuisance laws roy noted that courts have not been consistent on whether those laws apply to such cases there s been a variety of different decisions lately that should give us reason to be cautious about what this really means in the grand scheme he said two recent rulings have gone against the theory and more cases are heading toward rulings trials against drugmakers in new york and distribution companies in washington state are underway now a trial of claims against distribution companies in west virginia has wrapped up but the judge has not yet given a verdict earlier in november a california judge ruled in favor of top drug manufacturers in a lawsuit with three counties and the city of oakland the judge said the governments hadn t proven that the pharmaceutical companies used deceptive marketing to increase unnecessary opioid prescriptions and create a public nuisance also in november oklahoma s supreme court overturned a 2019 judgment for 465 million in a suit brought by the state against drugmaker johnson johnson other lawsuits have resulted in big settlements or proposed settlements before trials were completed the jury s decision in cleveland had little effect on the stock of cvs walgreens and walmart shares of all three companies rose tuesday shares of cvs and walgreens are up by 36 and 19 this year respectively associated press writer geoff mulvihill in cherry hill new jersey contributed to this report

consumers who listen long enough begin to assume there is a shortage of everything merely being reminded of product scarcity or being told that they must do their holiday shopping early due to supply chain related shortages makes consumers more likely to act in their own selfish interests according to virginia tech marketing professor and consumer behavior expert shilpa madan electronics furniture appliances turkeys pies christmas trees even champagne for new year s eve it s all backordered and held up in the supply chain or so we hear resource scarcity of any kind including the products that consumers may want to buy is shown to foster a competitive mindset prompting them to keep their own interests front and center said madan an assistant professor of marketing in virginia tech s pamplin college of business simply put research shows that such scarce deals can even result in consumer aggression this is because deals that limit product quantities inherently pit consumers against each other and lead them to see others as competitive threats blocking their access to coveted goods madan offers advice to those trying not to panic shop

the white house south court auditorium 2 21 p m est the president good afternoon this week millions of americans including some of the people in this room are likely to be hitting the road reuniting with their loved ones in cities and towns all across america to celebrate thanksgiving as they do i want to take a moment to talk about the economy both the progress we ve made and the challenges we remain that we have to face we ve made historic progress over the last 10 months unemployment is down to 4 6 percent two years faster than everyone expected when we started at this job it was over 14 percent wages are rising disposable income is up more people are starting small businesses than ever before and our economy has created a record 5 6 million jobs since i became president on january 20th there s a lot we can be proud of and a lot we can build on for the future but we still face challenges in our economy disruptions related to the pandemic have caused challenges in our supply chain which have sparked concern about shortages and contributed to higher prices moms and dads are worried asking will there be enough food we can afford to buy for the holidays will we be able to get christmas presents to the kids on time and if so will they cost me an arm and a leg i told you before that we are going to take action on these problems and that s exactly what we re doing it starts with my port action plan a proactive three month effort to invest in our ports and relieve bottlenecks forty percent of the goods for example that come into this country on the west coast come through two ports los angeles and long beach to help ease the congestion at these ports i brought together labor and management and asked them to step up and cooperate to move from operating the ports at 40 hours a week at those ports to 24 hours a day 7 days a week and i provided the resources to other key ports including savannah georgia and on the east coast on the east coast and to help reduce congestion and undo the damage caused by covid we also met with the ceos of walmart target home depot tj maxx and others those retailers large retailers and others agreed to move products more quickly stock their shelves more quickly and by the way you may have heard the ceo of walmart yesterday on the steps we ve taken he said and i quote the combination of private enterprise and government working together has been really successful he went on to say all the way through the supply chain there s a lot of innovation because of the actions we ve taken things have begun to change end of quote in the past three weeks the number of containers sitting on docks blocking movement are down by 33 percent shipping prices are down 25 percent more goods are moving more quickly and more cheaply out of our ports onto your doorsteps and onto store shelves and so all those concerns a few weeks ago there would be a there d not be ample food available for thanksgiving so many people talked about that understandably but families can rest easy grocery stores are well stocked with turkey and everything else you need for thanksgiving and the major retailers i mentioned are have confirmed that their shelves will be well stocked in stores this holiday season and that s good news for those moms and dads who are worried about whether their christmas gifts will be available that goes for everything from bicycles to ice skates you know today though i want to address another challenge that families are facing and the one that i think they re most focused on right now high gas prices this is a problem not just here in the united states but around the world the price of gasoline has reached record levels recently in europe and in asia in france at the end of last month it reached about 7 per gallon in japan it s about 5 50 per gallon the highest it s been in years of course it s always painful when gas pices gas prices spike today the price of gas in america on average is 3 40 a gallon in california it s much higher the impact is real but the fact is we ve faced even worst spikes before just in the last decade we saw it in 2012 when the price of gasoline hit 3 90 we saw it in 2014 when it hit 3 69 and re as recently as 2019 we saw it surpass 3 in many places the fact is we always get through those spikes but we re going to get through this one as well and hopefully faster but it doesn t mean we should just stand by idly and wait for prices to drop on their own instead we re taking action the big part of the of the reason americans are facing high gas prices is because oil producing countries and large companies have not ramped up the supply of oil quickly enough to meet the demand and the smaller supply means higher prices globally globally for oil to address these issues i got on the phone with leaders from other countries grappling with this challenge to try to find ways to lower oil prices and ultimately to to the price you pay at the pump so today i m announcing that the largest ever release from the u s strategic petroleum reserve to help provide the supply we need as we recover from this pandemic in addition i brought together other nations to contribute to the solution india japan the republic of korea and the united kingdom have agreed to release additional oil from their reserves and china may do more as well this coordinated action will help us deal with the lack of supply which in turn helps ease prices the bottom line today we re launching a major effort to moderate the price of oil an effort that will span the globe in its reach and ultimately reach your corn your corner gas station god willing i ve worked hard these past few weeks in calls and meetings with foreign leaders policymakers to put together the building blocks for today s global announcement and while our combina our combined actions will not solve the problem of high gas prices overnight it will make a difference it will take time but before long you should see the price of gas drop where you fill up your tank and in the longer term we will reduce our reliance on oil as we shift to clean energy but right now i will do what needs to be done to reduce the price you pay at the pump from the middle class and working families that are spending much too much and it s a strain and they re you re the reason i was sent here to look out for you there s another issue that s would be that i will be addressing as well because the fact is the price of oil was already dropping prior to this announcement and many suggesting anticipation of the announcement the price of gasoline in the wholesale market has fallen by about 10 percent over the last few weeks but the price of the pump hasn t budged a penny in other words gas supply companies are paying less and making a lot more and they do not seem to be passing that on to the consumers at the pump in fact if the gap between wholesale and retail gas prices was in line with past averages americans would be paying at least 25 cents less per gallon right now as i speak instead companies are pocketing the difference as profit that s unacceptable and that s why i ve asked the federal trade commission to consider whether potentially illegal and anti competitive behavior in the oil and gas industry is causing higher prices for consumers so we can ensure the american people are paying a fair price for their gasoline i also want to briefly address one myth about inflated gas prices they are not due to environmental measures my effort to combat climate change is not raising the price of gas or increasing its availability it what it is doing it s increasing the availability of jobs jobs building electric cars like the one i drove at the gm detroit at the gm factory in detroit last week for the hundreds of thousands of folks who bought one of those electric cars they re going to save 800 to 1 000 in fuel costs this year and we re going to put those savings within reach of more americans and create jobs installing solar panels batteries electric heat pumps jobs making those clean power generating devices and by the way deploying these technologies for each home where they re installed is going to save folks an additional hundreds of dollars in energy costs every year let s do that let s beat climate change with more extensive innovation and opportunities we can make our economy and consumers less vulnerable to these sorts of price spikes when we do that and finally even as we meet even as we meet to work out this challenge it s important to maintain perspective about where our economy stands today the fact is america has a lot to be proud of we re experiencing the strongest economic recovery in the world even after accounting for inflation our economy is bigger and our families have more money in their pockets than they did before the pandemic and america is the only major economy in the world that can say that it s a testament to the grit and determination of the american people as well as our unique approach to this recovery and our focus on rebuilding our economy from the bottom up and the middle out not the top down because of that approach we re the only leading economy in the world where household income and the economy as a whole are stronger than they were before the pandemic hit let me close with this this thanksgiving we have so much to be grateful for vaccines that are effective safe and free promising new treatments providing for hope that we can bring an end to the worst tragedies of this crisis record job growth the strongest recovery in the world and most of all the chance to be together again with the people we love on thanksgiving as you gather together with your family this thanksgiving i want you to know how grateful i am to serve as your president and i promised you that i ll never stop working to address your family s needs and together we re going to confront challenges that we face and are going to face them honestly and that we ll keep building this economy around the hardworking folks who built this country happy thanksgiving and god bless you and may god protect our troops and i m heading

kind of scale needed to compete against increasing competition from companies like netflix and amazon telus said achieving that scale would open the potential for rogers to secure exclusive rights to international content and make rogers a de facto licensing authority for canadian programming vancouver based telus said that if the merger went ahead rogers would have about 47 per cent of english language broadcast subscribers and that its network would reach 80 per cent of canadians the scale combined with rogers vertical integration of program creation and distribution would give it tremendous potential to control exclusive content it argued telus said that regulatory safeguards would not be enough to offset the competitive advantage of that scale and urged the regulator to

pretty much all homeowners will find themselves faced with unwanted wildlife on their property sooner or later and since it s best to invest in prevention we d recommend that you prepare yourself ahead of time should the situation ever arise in order to properly educate yourself on the topic of nuisance wildlife it s important that you learn which animals are most common in your area and in this article we talk about which animals are most likely to invade your property on the east coast 1 bats bats are quite common across the united states though they re a rather tricky home intruder since in many states they re protected by law since they re thought to contribute to the ecosystem by consuming various harmful insects so trying to remove them yourself might not be a good idea bats tend to get into human homes in search for a nice dark shelter often for raising their young we recommend that if you find yourself faced with a bat colony on your property you call a professional wildlife removal service like new journey pest control to figure out how to safely and legally get rid of the problem for you 2 opossums opossums are also quite a likely encounter in the eastern region of the united states these white grey creatures usually skulk around your home in search of food and can be highly destructive animals by nature this is why it s important to focus on preventing possums from getting into your house or else if it s too late on getting them out as quickly as possible to minimize the damage they are also known to hide in other animals burrows and will hiss and barr their teeth if they re startled or threatened generally if you re dealing with a wild animal on your property it s not recommended to attempt to seize them yourself particularly if you re not too confident of your skills while most nuisance wildlife will flee rather than fight surprising them can still lead to an attack 3 raccoons raccoons are another widespread nuisance animal species who are notorious for toppling over trash cans and making a general mess of things the big concern around raccoons is that they re notorious for carrying and spreading rabies both to pets and to humans one thing that is known to attract raccoons to human homes is a readily available water source careful though this doesn t only mean a pond or stream or other such obvious water sources it can also be a leaky pipe or some water set out for livestock which the raccoon will have no qualms about infiltrating to prepare yourself for a potential raccoon invasion we recommend that you visit nycraccoon com to learn more about raccoons 4 squirrels tired of dealing with squirrels in the attic you re not alone in fact one of the major issues is that since we rarely go up to the attic these wild intruders may be up there for weeks and even months without the homeowner even realizing usually during the warm months squirrels will nest in trees but during the winter they re quite likely to sneak into human homes in search of warmth while squirrels do carry a host of harmful bacteria they re generally less likely to pass on any serious disease than other animals however they can be quite destructive up in your attic they will chew on wood structures and might even do this with electrical wires which can put you and your family at serious risk it s important that regardless of the animal that s bothering you you take steps to get rid of them as swiftly as possible story by jessica loticus

moderates so there doesn t seem to be a consensus at this time while chair jerome powell preaches patience of course with president biden expected to add three likely doves to the mix that could slow

sealed lips is mashable s series on pelvic pain an experience rarely discussed but shockingly common soon after she started having sex emily sauer realized that deep penetration sent her into bouts of pain she tried to find advice online but all she found were blogs gushing over big dicks and retailers hawking supplements and tools meant to help people with penises get bigger go deeper last longer she tried to talk to doctors but they all dismissed her pain telling her she just needed to drink some wine and relax which didn t work in the slightest after years of searching the closest she d come to finding a fix for her frustrating issue was the following hack cut the end off of a tube sock roll it into a ring of fabric slide it down to the base of your partner s penis or the toy they re using on you this will limit their maximum depth of penetration it was a terrible idea uncomfortable and unsanitary for lack of options in 2017 sauer decided to invent her own solution the result was the ohnut a series of skin soft rings that act as a comfortable and body safe bumper at the base of a penis or a toy three prominent sex toy retailers as well as a number of sexologists told mashable that it was the first device device made specifically to limit the depth of penetration that they d ever seen and it s been a hit with sexperts and everyday consumers alike because pain triggered by deep penetration is actually a common problem especially when above average length penises are involved it s just an incredibly under addressed issue but the ohnut wasn t the first such device ever nearly 800 years ago the sufi poet jalal al din mohammed rumi wrote a poem about a likely fictional maid who used a specially carved gourd during sex to keep her partner from pushing too deep into her by the by her partner was a donkey and just over 400 years ago giulelmus fabricius hildanus a pioneer of early modern surgery developed a wearable bumper to limit pain caused during sex by a too large penis he put a description of the made to measure item in one of his widely circulated medical texts erwin kompanje a dutch medical historian wrote extensively about hildanus now long forgotten device in the mid aughts strenuously arguing that it deserves a resurrection in today s medical practice if we already had rudimentary tools built to tackle deep penetration pain centuries ago why was sauer so hard up for help that she had to reinvent the wheel just five years ago the answer to that riddle speaks to the importance of diversity and inclusion to the field of sexual health a brief history of deep penetration pain and its erasure we don t know much about how the vast majority of human cultures historically thought about or addressed issues like pain during sex because there are few recorded details on the subject in the texts tales or items they left behind but most of the cultures that did leave us ample records about their sexual attitudes clearly didn t much care about the experience of receptive partners during sex in ancient greece for example we find some discussions of foreplay and playful seduction says alastair blanshard author of the definitive sex vice and love from antiquity to modernity but the focus of the act of penetration is almost exclusively on the penetrator this is best summed up by a vase painting showing a man barking keep still to a woman he is penetrating from behind seemingly indifferent to any discomfort she may be feeling the terms we use when talking about sex reflect the widespread and longstanding nature of this penile focus argues amy boyajian of wild flower a sexual health boutique focused on inclusion and education specifically they convey the long entrenched idea that the penis owner is the one doing and leading the action of sex they explain if sex came from a receiver centered view we might say envelopment or enwrapping instead of penetration when talking about intercourse yet in the medieval era the catholic church devoted ample attention to reports of pain caused by a disparity between the size of male and female genitals as the historian ruth evans noted in a recent academic article because church leaders believed this size based pain caused infertility and miscarriages it doesn t in the name of procreation and the sanctity of the family unit they recorded ideas on how to address this issue in texts used to train midwives and physicians it was this thought stream that motivated hildanus work on his penis shortening contraption we don t know if similar beliefs led to the development of rumi s gourd in fact we don t even know if his device actually existed or if it was just a fanciful literary device no remaining records contain any clues about how widely known or used hildanus device was if others like it existed or when it they fell off of the medical radar but we do know that leading church figures went back and forth throughout the medieval era on how much stock to put into the pain fertility miscarriage theory innocent iii a famous late 12th century pope thought size related pain was a clear and serious enough issue that he declared it fair grounds for the dissolution of any marriage evans writes but the influential early 13th century theologian william of rennes argued that pain during sex was no cause for concern and that women ought to just bear it mashable after

signing up a penis shortening device modeled after giulelmus fabricius hildanus description credit courtesy of erwin kompanje william s views eventually won out likely because they aligned with the urges and inclinations of all male decision making bodies european medical practice also became increasingly male dominated and focused as it slowly professionalized by the dawn of the modern era few if any medical experts cared about women s personal experiences of sex they just wanted to make sure they could satisfy male sexual urges and reliable pump out children this consensus left little conceptual space for devices meant to address pain caused by deep penetration sauer and others draw a direct line from this legacy of overt sexual bias in the medical domain to modern practitioners widespread cluelessness about and dismissiveness of receptive partners reports of pain during deep penetration this history also goes a long way towards explaining why even seemingly progressive guides to navigating this sort of pain focus on what a receptive partner can do to accommodate a big penis rather than on what a penis haver can do to work with receptive anatomy notably most prescribe relaxation techniques stretching regimens plenty of build up and lubrication and positions that task receptive partners with controlling the depth angle and speed of penetration bigger isn t always better western culture also wasn t as fixated on big dicks in hildanus day as it is now in fact from antiquity straight through to the renaissance most artists and philosophers extolled the virtues of a dainty dick painting colossal cocks as grotesque and laughable signs of stupid animalism no one s entirely sure when why or how the shift towards our modern big dick fixation started elements of western culture likely always had some ever shifting degree of appreciation for a little extra girth and length as a sign of healthy male virility even as they heaped scorn on the heartiest of hard ons but over the last few decades especially many folks internalized the idea that a bigger penis is always better cis hetero men especially are so hung up on size that even many of average and above average dimensions now think they need to bulk up somehow until recently men dominated the adult products industry explains hallie lieberman the author of buzz a stimulating history of the sex toy both as designers and consumers so their tastes and hang ups have long set the tone for the sexual health and wellness market hence the endless stream of dubious even dangerous size enhancing products and services these male decision makers saw no need for something that d make them look or feel smaller so they never thought to revive or re invent something like hildanus device it wouldn t have vital marketable big dick energy lieberman reviewed her archive of over 60 years worth of sex toy catalogues for this article to her surprise she could not find a single device designed to address deep penetration pain before sauer s ohnut hit the market heather jeffcoat a pelvic health expert recalls seeing one depth limiting device in a catalogue about 20 years ago but she wrote it off as too rigid and cumbersome for either penetrative sexual partner to enjoy she can t remember exactly where she saw this device what it was called or which toy maker or medical firm made it though and she adds that after that device she too saw nothing suited to this need until the ohnut came out systematic neglect in the medical world and the adult industry forced many receptive partners to grit their teeth and push through painful sex for decades but not all the sexologist carol queen says that good vibrations the sex store chain she s worked with since 1990 has always had at least a few customers looking for depth limiting devices through experimentation toy experts and consumers alike figured out that they could stack up thick cock rings or trim the ends off a masturbation sleeve to create a diy bumper for the base of a penis or toy these hacks are cheap and easy queen notes however wild flower s boyajian points out that stacking cock rings is not always safe these rings increase rigidity by restricting blood flow into and out of the penis that s inherently risky for some folks with circulatory issues or pre existing penile injuries and everyone courts injuries and mishaps if they wear cock rings too long or use one that s too tight whether alone or in a stack trimmed down sleeves are certainly safer overall however since they weren t designed as bumpers they can be a bit unwieldy in that role these diy solutions spread through the queer community ever experimental and broadly liberated from heterosexual cultural scripts as it is over the course of a few decades boyajian notes but it wasn t until six or seven years ago that i first saw the same methods discussed by cisgender women who were finding penetration uncomfortable or painful they believe this reflects a sea change in sexual discourse over the last decade flowing out of novel online spaces that finally gave women room to publicly critique and organize against the widespread disregard for their experiences this broad public reevaluation of norms and expectations around sex and pleasure alongside the mainstreaming of the sexual health and wellness industry then created cultural and economic space for a new wave of products designed by and or for receptive partners which explains how and why a few other explicitly depth limiting devices like the established toy brand perfect fit s the bumper thrust buffer launched around the same time as the ohnut some say they ve changed their sex lives making pleasure through penetration possible amy boyajian wild flower these toys are on the rise says boyajian users give overwhelmingly positive feedback on them some say they ve changed their sex lives making pleasure through penetration possible still queen acknowledges many people don t seem to know about them yet including sexual health professionals after mashable asked urologist dr jesse mills director of the men s clinic at the university of california los angeles for his thoughts on the ohnut and its ilk he conferred with several colleagues and determined that none of them had ever even heard of a depth limiting device before this may change as early adopters start singing their praises in mainstream venues and as their price points go down most currently cost over 65 which is over three times as expensive as an open ended masturbation sleeve boyajian notes but if the history of hildanus depth limiting device and its disappearance into the historical ethet tells us anything it s that we shouldn t take this trajectory as a given medical experts still largely discount receptive partners accounts of sexual pain mainstream culture still glories in the quest for big dicks to the exclusion of every other objective and there is always a risk that the tides that ve buoyed diverse voices allowing the re invention of penis bumpers will recede and take these devices back into obscurity again with them that d leave the countless sauers of the world up shit creek once more

role of elbit systems cfo from april next year the results of our third quarter reflect the successful execution of our global diversification strategy that is delivering strong revenue growth and an improved operational performance which is a result of efficiency measures we discussed in the past we continue to implement mitigation plans to limit the impact of the strengthening of the israeli shekel in the short term this includes the adoption of a rolling hedge policy and efficiency measures over the longer term we plan to expand our manufacturing footprint in high quality lower cost countries to better balance our currency exposure and reduce risk i will now highlight and discuss some of the key figures and trends of our financial results third quarter revenues were 1 363 billion and increased by over 20 year over year a major part of the growth was organic in addition to the contribution from sparton which we acquired in the second quarter of 2021 in terms of revenue breakdown across our areas of operation airborne systems accounted for 37 of the total quarterly revenues and increased year over year mainly due to airborne precision guided munition sales land systems accounted for 23 of total revenues a similar level to the revenues of the third quarter of 2020 c4isr at 27 of revenues increased year over year primarily due to the acquisition of sparton electro optics accounted for 10 of total sales and increased year over year due to the ramp of elbit night vision programs other sales were 3 of revenues and increased year over year due to the growth of our u s medical device subsidiary our diverse geographic revenue base is important to the long term sustainability of our business in the third quarter asia pacific contributed 31 of revenues north america 30 israel was 18 and europe 17 the growth in u s was mainly due to the sparton acquisition and sales of non defense medical devices asia pacific revenues increased mainly due to sales of precision guided munitions and uas the growth in european revenues was due primarily to c4isr sales to the u k the non gaap gross margin for the third quarter was 27 2 compared with 26 7 in the third quarter of 2020 gaap gross margin in the third quarter of 2021 was 26 6 of revenues compared with 20 9 of revenues in the third quarter of 2020 the gaap gross margin profit in the third quarter of 2020 included a 60 million non cash expense from asset impairments and inventory write offs due to the impact of covid 19 the gross margin improvement during the second quarter and third quarters of 2021 is encouraging and reflects the benefits of the cost control measures we adopted the third quarter non gaap operating income was 123 million or 9 of revenues compared with 93 1 million or 8 2 of revenues last year gaap operating income for the third quarter was 110 million versus eur24 million last year following the inventory write offs and impairments the operating expense breakdown in the third quarter was as follows net r d expenses were 7 4 of revenues versus 8 in the third quarter of last year marketing and selling expenses were 6 2 of revenues versus 6 3 last year g a expenses were

compared with 2 2 million in 2020 the effective tax rate in the third quarter was 8 6 compared with 15 4 in 2020 our non gaap diluted eps was 2 33 in the third quarter compared with 1 64 last year the gaap diluted eps was 2 08 compared with 0 38 last year our backlog orders as of september 30 2021 was approximately 13 6 billion 2 7 billion higher than the backlog at the end of september 2020 and at a similar level to the backlog at the end of june 2021 approximately 40 of the current backlog is scheduled to be performed during 2021 and 2022 and the remainder is scheduled for 2023 and beyond the percentage of the backlog for the remainder of the year and the following year is lower than the third quarter last year following a number of multi year contracts awarded recently the order backlog is equivalent to more than two and a half years of revenues and provides good visibility for the future cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was 150 000 outflow compared with 63 million outflow in the same quarter of last year during the third quarter we successfully completed the tender of three series of notes raising approximately 575 million the notes will be traded on the tel aviv stock exchange and provide us with good long term source of funding for ongoing business operations as well as potential acquisitions the board of directors declared a dividend of 0 46 per share for the third quarter of 2021 i will now turn the call over to mr machlis elbit s ceo butzi please bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer thank you yossi i would like to welcome kobi to the call and wish him luck i have worked with kobi for many years as you may know kobi was vp finance at elbit system land and c4i when i was general manager turning to the financial results the recent months have been busy and productive with a number of strategic contract awards we continue to see good momentum across almost all our end markets including israel following the approval of defense budgets at our investor day in april we discussed the increased importance of maritime domain and the investment elbit has made to develop solutions for the growing market in november our u k subsidiary elbit system u k was awarded 100 million 13 year contract from babcock to provide the royal navy with new electronic warfare capabilities as part of this contract elbit system u k will design and manufacture maritime ew suites comprised of digital full spectrum radar electronic support measures and ew command and control systems these latest generation technologies will enhance the situation awareness and anti ship missile defense of royal navy ships improving the capability to exploit the electromagnetic environment elbit systems supplies electronic warfare systems for air land and naval platforms and in recent years has signed a number of contracts to supply ew systems for the u s air force national guard f 16 and german air force helicopters we are also installing ew systems on the israeli navy s new sa ar 6 corvette in september we received a 56 million contract to provide an integrated anti submarine warfare solution to the navy of an asia pacific country elbit will provide civil unmanned surface vessel consumed to perform anti submarine warfare missions and our towed reelable active passive sonar or traps systems this award follows a contract earlier this year to provide seagull usvs configured for mine countermeasure missions the integration of sparton is progressing as planned i am very satisfied with the progress we have delivered in the maritime market this year expanding our market positions and product portfolio elbit is well positioned for growth in this market over medium term a few weeks ago we hosted israeli defense minister benny gantz at the cornerstone laying ceremony at our new ramat beka facility we are building in the south of israel over the coming years we will transfer imi s manufacturing activities from central israel to a new modern facility the new facility is an important part of the implementation of the multi year imi turnaround plan and we expect to complete the move by 2024 these efforts should support our efforts to enhance imi profitability the second part of the imi turnover is to increase the share of international sales these were significantly lower than elbit when we acquired imi accordingly imi s international orders have grown rapidly since the acquisition in the first nine months of 2021 60 of imi orders were from international customers compared to approximately 20 prior to the acquisition in 2018 the acquisition of imi enhanced elbit system portfolio for artillery solutions by adding advanced munition to our legacy portfolio of services mortar target acquisition and dedicated command and control solutions the israeli mod selected elbit system to develop and manufacture a new generation of sigma howitzer to the ids sigma is a 1 5 millimeter self propelled howitzer capable of automatic loading and laying of the gun system rapid in and out action times and high rate of fire the ramp in this program is progressing as planned last week we received 106 million contract to supply sigma fully automatic self propelled howitzer gun system to a country in asia pacific the first international order for the sigma we believe there is a significant potential for additional activity orders for militaries around the world looking to upgrade their legacy artillery systems elbit systems atmos howitzer participated in the u s army shoot off earlier this year and we and was on display outside ausa in d c in october we continue to invest in the expansion of our u s footprint in november elbit systems of america announced plans to establish a new 135 000 square foot facility in charleston south carolina the facility will hold the esa s ground combat vehicle assembly and integration center of excellence we expect operations in the facility to begin by the third quarter of 2022 to support contracts esa received from the israeli ministry of defense for the supply of self propelled howitzer gun system to their ids the new facility is part of elbit systems strategy to expand our engineering and manufacturing capability in the u s this facility will create around 300 new jobs will support 280 suppliers across south carolina and can be used for selling integration effort for future dod programs in september esa received a 54 million contracts for envg production from the u s army this order is part of the ota contract with a maximum value of 442 million we received in 2020 in october esa received 76 million idiq contract to supply head mount and display systems for the u s army apache helicopter in summary our broad based backlog continues to provide us with good visibility and we continue to see significant potential around the world for our leading high technology solutions and with that i will be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you the first question is from greg konrad of jefferies please go ahead greg konrad jefferies analyst good morning bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer good morning greg greg konrad jefferies analyst maybe just to start on revenue kind of a two part question one kind of more short term one longer term i mean just in the short term is this year any different where you typically have a q4 ramp for sales or were there some items kind of pulled into q2 and q3 and then kind of the second part longer term i mean organic growth has been running well ahead of our expectations and also kind of the mid single digit target you ve laid out in the past i mean has the growth profile been reset or are there headwinds heading into next year we should be thinking about just kind of how we should think about the overall growth target joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer look usually as you have mentioned the fourth quarter is usually a strong quarter at elbit systems from point of view of revenues and we expect this to be the case for 2021 as well we did see the transformation of the strong backlog growth that we had in recent years into revenues actually i would say that repeatedly we were asked by the markets how come that we grow so strongly in the backlog and we do not see a simultaneous growth in revenues as we explained it takes some time from the growth of the backlog until it transforms into revenues and presently we do see that effect happening this year looking forward i think the transformation of the backlog into revenues will continue the continued growth in backlog will create continuous growth in revenues however i am not sure at this point in time that we will be able to deliver strong double digit growth through all of next year we do believe that the growth will happen because of the backlog numbers and that next year we will see growth in the top line as well greg konrad jefferies analyst thank you for that and maybe just transitioning to margins i mean you mentioned cost control measures and a number of maybe efficiencies around manufacturing i mean how are you thinking about the margin target i think you ve laid out a 10 longer term margin target in the past i mean how do we think about the path to get there between maybe mix some of the efficiency measures you ve kind of put in place and just overall volume leverage joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer i think that our long term plan is definitely underway and we started to see the positive results of our long term strategic plan of reduction of overheads of cost of improving efficiencies of combining production lines and all the other efficiencies including centralized acquisitions and so on all of this is happening in the past we mentioned also what we call the one erp system that is implemented across the whole organization we are well over 50 already implemented and we expect to complete that somewhere most of it during next year and may be some very small parts in the year after that and we already start to see to see the benefits of that although the biggest part will come in 2022 and 2023 when we have most of the company under the same erp system this all effort will continue and as i said it s part of the long term plan that is implemented and thus help us in the improved performance from the point of view of profitability together with that we have some headwinds because of the local currency exchange rate we are making all the efforts possible in order to mitigate that and that effort will also continue into the future we also are looking at various production sites in order to enable us to manufacture and do some as well as engineering efforts in high quality low cost countries that will enable us to reduce our cost base in the various areas of cost in the company one of the elements that helps us to reduce the overall percentage of costs of the operating expenses is of course the very strong growth in the top line and when the company is growing then the reduction in percentage of cost in the g a the percentage of cost of r d and other expenses is also helpful in improving the operating profit line greg konrad jefferies analyst i will leave it there thank you and a good quarter thanks bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer thanks greg operator the next question is from pete skibitski of alembic global please go ahead pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst yeah nice quarter guys and yossi congratulations on your pending retirement joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you i will be around for some time bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer he is not retiring yet pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst understood so yeah second straight quarter of it looks by my math sort of mid teens organic revenue growth and i think the last quarter you talked about a large precision guided munition sale to an asia pacific nation as being a key driver of that second quarter growth and so i m guessing maybe that was a big driver in the third quarter as well can you give us a sense for when that large program may start to run off just so we can maybe get an idea for the timing of maybe transitioning from this kind of mid teens growth to more of a like you talked about your long term goal of mid single digit plus type growth joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer our revenues are definitely impacted by various programs of this kind this is not the only program that we are running this specific program it goes through the next year as well and however there are some significant other programs with similar characteristics that we have received in our backlog and will eventually replace the revenues from this program as we usually do over the years pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst okay ok and then can we talk cash flow for a second there is a large receivables billed this quarter i think i heard you got i don t know if that s related to the pgm sale or but i also heard you guys say that the israeli defense budget was approved which i think you were hoping that that could improve cash flow so i m just wondering maybe you could speak to expectations for fourth quarter cash flow and kind of catching up on some of the receivables billed joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer well the one good thing that has happened in november is that the israeli government has approved and department has approved the budget for the rest of 2021 and 2022 this of course has been reflected in approving all the expense elements the budgets of the mod in israel and that has translated in payments significant payments that were delayed by the israeli ministry of defense for many quarters actually so that at this point in time i can i am happy to report that a significant part of the delayed payments have been paid and we expect by the rest of this year to get paid for most of the delayed payments of the ministry of defense so from that point of view that s very good news and things are back on track as they should have been for normal course of business and i would emphasize that this is not reflected yet the improved collection from the ministry of defense in israel is not reflected in the third quarter numbers because the budget was approved in november we will see that in the fourth quarter from a point of view of the other elements yes when you have increased revenues then of course you have increased receivables and we expect to collect all of that in time so looking at the next quarter i would cautiously be optimistic by saying that we probably will improve our working capital and we will see stronger cash generation pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst okay so that s great news i appreciate that maybe i can sneak one last one in maybe for butzi butzi a lot of news i think about opportunities for israeli firms in general but certainly for elbit for i will call it non israel defense sales i think you guys have tended to dubai airshow recently and there was an announcement that you are setting up a new unit in uae so can you talk about maybe how optimistic you are about these kind of new opportunities and kind of timing and magnitude and it just kind of seems like a whole new market has opened up to you fairly quickly bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer thank you it s true we participated for the first time in the dubai airshow the abraham agreements are opening new opportunities in new markets for elbit and i can tell you that there is a lot of interest in several countries for technology and i am optimistic that it will generate revenues in the future for us in this new market we are working with the local industries already and we know the market quite well and i am quite optimistic that we will continue to see revenues in this market in the future as well and this is not true just for uae it is true for additional countries which are open for us right now based on the agreement which was declared year and a half years ago pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst that s great i appreciate all the color guys bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from ella fried of bank leumi please go ahead ella fried bank leumi analyst hello first i would like to congratulate the new cfo kobi on his appointment and wish him a lot of success and i have a few questions the first question relates to the operational profit and the hedge level you have achieved in this quarter quite a nice rate of operational profit certainly non gaap and we also remember that this year you set the hedge level at ils3 3 for dollar what about going i also remember that you established now a continuous hedge so what are you expecting the next year did you catch a nice level for the forward going quarters joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we have hedged our shekel expenses for this year and that includes the fourth quarter for next year we have been successful to hedge part of that mainly in the first half of next year and we of course are keeping track on the changes in the currency and looking for opportunities to continue our policy of continuous hedging as it comes along ella fried bank leumi analyst so you have two certain quarters you had a few that are fully almost fully hedged at the current level and then you have to try and keep it on joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer i said and i say part of next year yes ella fried bank leumi analyst part of next year i decided it s my decision that it s half of next year okay and the next question is actually about i don t know to whom it s related but it s about removing facilities you mentioned it for many years and now i think the time is now because the level are really the exchange levels are really unheard of and when you mentioned charleston could it be one of the facilities to actually accept the removed operations or it s just a different project and the operations will be removed to countries with even cheaper labor costs bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer hi ella good afternoon ella fried bank leumi analyst good afternoon bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer as you know we have dozens of companies all around the world in brazil in the u s in the u k in germany in india and many other places and we in all these markets it s very important to create local jobs and to do development and to do production so we are taking advantage of the positions we have in these markets and we are expanding our facilities there it helps us first to be more local to be more crafted and to do more jobs on the ground and secondly also to hedge some of our activities which we do in israel and other facilities so it s a long term process and it s part of improvement we are trying to gain in the op as yossi mentioned it s one element there it s already effective as you all saw in the last results other parts are increasing productivity which is boca the raton boca facility will help us with that and centralized procurement and the new erp are the measures which were mentioned by yossi earlier so all together we have a long term plan to improve the profitability of the company and we are implementing it it s quite effective and we will continue to do it in the future just on facilities just one piece in this quarter ella fried bank leumi analyst okay thank you and the last question was actually also for you it s a more marketing question do you intend to keep in the long term imi label or you plan to integrate it a certain within the few years into elbit systems label because there are different sites to it so what do you have a definite plan now bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer it s a good question and for that i can tell you that imi have very good reputation all around the globe mainly for mission and for land platforms so for the time being we intend to keep the name of the product we would like to gain benefits of the reputation of the good reputation imi is having in many countries ella fried bank leumi analyst okay thank you for taking my questions bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer thank you ella operator the next question is from elad kraus of excellence please go ahead elad kraus excellence analyst thanks hi butzi yossi and kobi i have a couple of questions first regarding the sales i see that israel is only 19 of the sales do you see that a trend that israel should go lower or it s one time that usually will come back to the normal where it used to be a few quarters ago and the second question is also regarding the margins do you see any changes in the environment right now that you can say that the margins should be higher or lower or the same compared to the last quarters joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer as you know elad the israeli market is a limited market as the company grows then a big part of our growth is international so with all the optimism that the israeli defense budget continues to grow and it does it looks like we are growing faster and our expansion is in the international market so based on that looking at the longer term and assuming that the company will continue to grow at a relatively high rate then the percentage wise the israeli market will probably be will be declining however the absolute value expected to grow at some rate so this is regarding your first question regarding the profitability stuff i think we explained that and we are doing everything possible in order to improve it i think we are on track the prices in the market are defined by the market itself so the improvement in the profitability we expect it to come from improvement in operations of the company so this is actually the plan and we see very successful results out coming from that plan elad kraus excellence analyst yeah so that is still at the same level i mean there is no higher competition joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer well the competition is essentially there it was there it continues to be there and we expect it to be there in the future as well elad kraus excellence analyst all right thanks operator there are no further questions at this time before i ask mr machlis to go ahead with his closing statement i would like to remind participants that a

of 1 27 billion reflecting growth at 24 from 2020 and an increase of 19 to 2019 healthy sales and merchandise margins combined with cost efficiencies drove profit flow through which surpassed our expectations record operating income of 210 million reflecting a margin at 16 5 our highest rate since 2007 we are extremely pleased to see a sustained momentum across our brands and channels which posted growth versus 2020 at pre pandemic 2019 levels casualwear remains in high demand and ae and aerie are perfectly positioned to benefit we are delivering great product and sharper marketing as

customers it s exciting to see the consistency in our signature jean business which continues to reach new heights across genders at the same time we are seeing renewed growth in categories that have been underpenetrated in recent years aerie s growth continues at a fast pace with momentum across all categories including our new activewear brand offline by aerie customers who try aerie love it and the brand is just beginning to unlock its true potential healthy acquisition retention are fueling strong sales and we are seeing nice reception as we expand into new markets our real power real growth strategic pillars have provided a roadmap and instilled focus across the company simply put we are running our business better than ever key initiatives such as inventory and real estate optimization and the transformation of our supply chain are driving significant profit flow through the processes disciplines and capabilities we have put in place over the past 18 months will continue to set us apart fueling strong returns and taking aeo to even greater heights as an organization innovation is a core value and at the heart of everything we do we clearly recognize that many of the changes in our industry over the past year are here to stay in order to remain competitive today and in the years to come we must pivot and think differently about our business that brings me to our exciting plan to acquire quiet logistics this acquisition marks a major milestone for our company which i believe will be transformative acquiring quiet allows us to build on the efficiencies we ve gained over the past 12 months and position us for success as we grow our business over the coming years we also have a broader vision we expect the combination of quiet logistics and the recent acquisition of airterra to create a unique platform that revolutionizes logistics within our business and retail through consolidation and pooled resources the customer at quiet and airterra will enjoy the agilities and efficiencies that were previously only available to the world s largest brands and retailers i believe this will create an exciting new profit center with meaningful growth opportunities for aeo lastly our efforts around sustainability and building a better world through our esg initiatives remain front and center at all times we continue to increase our most sustainable real good styles across all merchandise categories additionally we are investing to decrease emissions in our operations as we make progress toward becoming carbon neutral ae s outperformance year to date was truly remarkable and exceeded our expectations i d like to thank our teams across aeo for how well they have executed in the quarter and throughout the year they clearly demonstrated the agility to meet unexpected challenges while also staying the course toward our long term goals our results continue to be fueled by a sound and meaningful strategy resilient operations and focus on innovation and a passionate world class team strong demand continues and we expect a strong close to 2021 with that i ll turn it over to jen jennifer foyle president executive creative director ae aerie thanks jay and good morning everyone this was another amazing quarter for aeo we saw tremendous excitement around aerie and ae as customers turned to their favorite brands this back to school customer kpis were very favorable as we brought in new customers and won more of their wallet it was a great set up for the holiday season where i m happy to note the energy has stayed just as elevated starting with aerie we consistently reach new heights each and every quarter 28 revenue growth in the third quarter following a 34 increase last year demonstrates aerie s strong growth path this marked the 28th consecutive quarter of double digit growth profit flow through was also very healthy with a 16 5 operating margin reflecting new third quarter highs for the brand we achieved this despite some unevenness of inventory flow during factory shutdowns in south vietnam this occurred primarily in our high demand legging business which is also one of our best margin categories sales metrics in the third quarter were incredibly healthy the aur was up in the high teens driven by higher full price selling and more strategic decision making around promotions demand was strong across the aerie portfolio with our core intimates bralettes and apparel leading the charge the offline activewear brand is continuing to generate excitement as it expands its product offering we feel great about what s to come as we grow the store footprint and widen the customer base marketing is also playing a key role in august we launched the voices of aeriereal this was aerie s largest integrated marketing campaign featured across tiktok and connected tv and snapchat this platform is giving our customers a voice and opportunity to share what makes them real the response was truly amazing hundreds of customers shared their touching and funny real stories and will be featured in our upcoming campaigns year to date aerie s customer file has expanded 15 customers are transacting more frequently and across more categories this is driving higher spend per customer as aerie becomes the go to for intimates activewear and cozy apparel we opened 29 new aerie doors in the quarter including a mix of new stand alone and side by side formats roughly a quarter of them are offline doors momentum heading into the holiday season remains strong we are focused on driving broad based scale recognition of aerie as a must stop gifting destination and i am so excited for what we have planned and i look forward to sharing more aerie highlights in the upcoming quarters now turning to american eagle i m thrilled with the great progress we re making just 11 months into the launch of our new strategy as i shop our website and walk our stores i have to tell you the strong ae heritage we all know and love is back the assortment has been refreshed our advertising and messaging is reenergized and it s working sales in the quarter rose 21 compared to 2020 and increased 8 to 2019 reigniting our brand product together with inventory optimization and promotional discipline drove strong aur growth and merchandise margin expansion this resulted in significant profit flow through and operating margin of 27 8 that reflected new highs our strength during back to school is clear is a clear signal that we are the destination for jeans which continues to hit new highs ae s customer file is up and here too customers are buying more frequently and spending more as we predicted current trends and shifts in silhouettes are playing right into ae s strengths as the market leader in the quarter our men s business saw tremendous growth across all categories the women s business also posted strong sales supported by our signature denim category and a focus on outfitting ae continues to explore innovative ways to reach and broaden its audience i am so proud to share that ae was included in tiktok s pilot of its social commerce program this quarter being a part of the new initiative is a true testament to the growing strength of the ae brand and its importance to customers ae also launched a store on snapchat and became the official partner of twitchgaming a new channel created by gamers for gamers there is so much momentum across the brands as we head into the holiday season the teams did a great job getting our product out here and we re positioned to meet strong demand to the teams across ae and aerie i can t thank you enough for all your hard work it s paying off in spades and i m so happy how far we have come and how much we ve accomplished in such a short period of time more to share in the coming quarters thank you and now i ll turn the call over to michael michael r rempell executive vice president chief operations officer thanks jen and good morning everyone i m very pleased with how we executed this quarter the teams did a remarkable job managing through a highly disrupted operating environment strong top and bottom line results are a clear indication that our strategies are working we are making sustained progress against the strategic pillars outlined in our real power real growth value creation plan and with this we are unlocking structural benefits across our business and building a competitive edge in the industry a key pillar of our strategy is to create the best brand experience for our customers and our selling channels really delivered this quarter we are pleased to see store traffic rebuild rising in the double digits driving a 29 increase in store revenue selling trends were robust across our factory outlets and mainline stores with both formats also seeing significant profit improvement momentum was broad based across all regions in the us and all international markets also posted positive results our digital business continued at a healthy pace with revenues up 10 successfully lapping 29 growth in the prior year i am pleased to note that both our store and digital revenues and profits in the quarter surpassed levels we achieved in the third quarter of 2019 this is reaffirming that we are emerging from the pandemic stronger year to date digital penetration is 35 and our trailing 12 month digital revenue is approximately 1 8 billion with very strong profitability as we prioritize enhancing the omnichannel shopping experience we are launching new tools and technologies this quarter we expanded our virtual selling tool ae live which leverages our amazing store teams and local influencers to connect directly with customers looking for inspiration and guidance on the latest trends we also launched afterpay in stores enhanced our e gifting for a more engaging experience and expanded both same day delivery services and customer self checkout to more geographies i am very encouraged by the strength in our customer data we closed the third quarter with the highest active customer count and highest average annual spend since 2010 over the past 12 and 24 months we added almost 1 75 million and 2 25 million new customers respectively approximately a third are engaging across both brands and spending approximately 2 times that of our average customer annually following a successful relaunch last summer the royalty program is growing with members spending more and staying longer now shifting gears to logistics and supply chain we continue to reap the benefits from our in market fulfillment model delivery costs leveraged 120 basis points in the quarter in fact delivery cost dollars were down year on year led by efficiencies created in digital delivery with product located closer to stores and customers delivery times and the average cost per shipment declined versus last year and with greater control over inventory placement shipments per order were also down dramatically this created enormous cost savings and efficiencies as jay said we are thrilled to announce the purchase of quiet logistics which will allow us to increase these benefits over time in particular the ability to drive substantially greater sales and margin on far less inventory create more precision in our inventory allocation decisions and deliver products to customers both faster and at a lower cost this comes shortly after our acquisition of airterra which we discussed on last quarter s call the combination of quiet and airterra has meaningful growth potential offering a one stop shop for cost effective transportation and fulfillment solutions to a growing customer base a technology led supply chain is the backbone of the successful retail business today and into the future we believe we are demonstrating the power of this and that quiet and airterra are providing capabilities that are much needed in today s marketplace we are going to continue to grow both of these businesses and are excited to welcome their highly skilled and experienced teams into our family as we discussed in september the global supply chain remains highly disrupted with core backlog and shifting production schedules leading to longer delivery times and higher transportation costs overall we managed effectively through these challenges in the third quarter the ae brand essentially had no disruption however as jen discussed aerie s legging category experienced uneven inventory flows when factory closures in vietnam created product delays as a result we chose to air the product to ensure we were in stock for the holidays although there is a related cost that mike will discuss in more detail we are in a healthy inventory position and are set up for a very strong holiday in closing i m extremely pleased with our performance year to date and i m looking forward to sharing more details on our new investments in the coming quarters and with that i m going to turn the call over to mike mike mathias executive vice president chief financial officer thanks michael good morning everyone in the third quarter we built on strong momentum from the first half of the year posting yet another record revenue and profit result even with the global operating environment still in flux our teams executed with precision guided by the initiatives we outlined in our real power real growth value creation plan back in january we continued to place strong emphasis on product innovation that strengthens customer affinity for our brands inventory discipline and focus and real estate optimization and supply chain investments that build on our leading omnichannel capabilities together these initiatives are fueling our performance and improving our gross margin for the long term revenue of 1 27 billion operating income of 210 million and adjusted eps of 0 76 marked third quarter records for the company gross margin of 44 3 and operating margin of 16 5 hit their strongest levels since 2007 growth across the business was also exceptional compared to the pre pandemic 2019 period consolidated third quarter net revenue increased 242 million or 24 versus third quarter 2020 and is up 208 million or 19 from 2019 across brands sales metrics were very favorable strong demand higher full price sales and fewer promotions drove the average unit retail up 15 and fueled a high single digit increase in our average transaction value as michael noted our selling strategy as an omnichannel retailer continues to be a competitive advantage fueling growth across channels we offer customers the convenience they seek on where and how to shop and continue to work to optimize the costs associated with that convenience from a brand standpoint aerie continued its industry leading multiyear growth trajectory revenue rose 28 from third quarter 2020 and over 70 from third quarter 2019 aerie s operating profit rose 46 and the operating margin expanded to 16 5 marking a new third quarter high incremental freight costs were 5 million or a 170 basis point headwind to brand operating margins in the quarter additionally uneven flow of goods particularly in our signature leggings business put pressure on volumes as well as product mix as this is one of our highest margin categories despite these headwinds aerie posted a significant improvement in profitability compared to prior years almost tripling versus third quarter 2019 moving to american eagle s brand performance i cannot be more pleased with our results here the third quarter saw a significant profit unlock at ae as top line grew 21 and operating profit jumped 68 operating margins hit a remarkable 27 8 as jen mentioned with improvements across key categories the top line grew 8 against 2019 we are seeing far better profitability even beyond our expectations strong demand for our products is being met with healthier decision making across all areas of the business and we are truly benefiting from the inventory optimization work unveiled in january with significant progress here we see still see room for further unlock moving forward total company consolidated gross profit dollars were up 36 compared to the third quarter of 2020 reflecting a 44 3 gross margin rate a strong top line allowed us to realize expense leverage and rent as we benefited from lease negotiations and as michael indicated efficiencies in our distribution network fueled leverage and delivery merchandise margins also expanded due to our focus on inventory optimization promotional discipline and higher full price selling partially offset by higher freight costs as a result of strong sales we saw sg a leverage 190 basis points the dollar increase of 41 million was due primarily to higher store payroll especially as we lapped capacity constraints last year as well as new store openings and increased advertising this was partially offset by lower incentive compensation due to accruals earlier in the year record operating income of 210 million reflected a 16 5 operating margin our highest third quarter rate since 2007 adjusted eps was 0 76 per share marking a record third quarter our diluted share count was 205 million and included 34 million shares of unrealized dilution associated with our convertible notes ending inventory was up 32 compared to a 13 decline last year the increased freight costs had about a 10 point impact on ending inventory at cost we re really happy with our inventory position i d like to take a minute to recognize the hard work our teams put in to get our product here on time to support strong demand this holiday season our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with 741 million in cash up from 692 million in the third quarter 2020 capital expenditures totaled 58 million in the quarter and 144 million year to date for 2021 we continue to capital expenditures to come in on the low end of our 250 million to 275 million guidance range reflecting cost savings and project timing with regards to our real estate strategy we have significant flexibility in managing our store fleet to support our revenue and profit goals as we work toward our long term target of rightsizing ae store footprint we are dealing with a sharp eye on maximizing profitability for aerie we are focused on markets with the greatest opportunity due to backlogs in building materials and fixtures several of our third quarter store openings shifted into the fourth quarter we expect the majority of these stores to open by the end of the year we re very excited about our recently announced acquisition of quiet this will improve our ability to service both channels and lock in the cost benefits and overall gross margin efficiencies we ve consistently seen over the past last year to wrap up our performance year to date has been truly phenomenal and even more so in the context of challenges and uncertainties in our external environment we re extremely pleased with our record results year to date and continued progress on our strategic initiatives sales trends remain strong heading into the key black friday and cyber week period we have met our goal to ensure our customers do not feel any impact from the supply chain disruptions and we re well positioned to meet holiday demand however that has come with additional freight costs in the range of 70 million to 80 million which will impact the fourth quarter of course we expect to nicely exceed 600 million of operating income for the year well above the 550 million 2023 target we will be updating our longer term financial targets at icr this january our results year to date continue to reaffirm that the real power real growth value creation plan is working and that we re focusing on the right levers to drive financial success and returns to our shareholders with that i ll open it up for questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session thank you our first question comes from the line of jay sole with ubs please proceed with your question jay sole ubs analyst great thank you so much jay i want to ask you about your comments on the recent acquisitions of quiet and airterra you call them transformative and said they d be profitable can you talk about why you re using those type of words i mean can you give us a sense of what kind of revenue and profit these acquisitions can generate for the company and also why you see this transformative jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer all right we have a problem that your voice came in all ruffled up we couldn t hear the question jennifer foyle president executive creative director ae aerie yeah jay can you try to repeat that jay sole ubs analyst can you hear me can you hear me now jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer there s something wrong with your line michael r rempell executive vice president chief operations officer yeah i think he was asking about quiet and airterra jay sole ubs analyst can you hear me better now michael r rempell executive vice president chief operations officer there you go jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes yes now we can hear you much much better much better jay sole ubs analyst okay sorry about that the questions were about the acquisitions jay you used the words transformative and profitable just can you elaborate on why you see this transformative and what kind of profit potential you see from these businesses also revenue potential as well as profit potential thank you jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer all right first of all this is an acquisition that we ve been using for the last 15 16 months ourselves we saw this year part of our success of getting higher margin is ability to have the right merchandise at the store at the right time in the most efficient manner and a part of it is because of using quiet we ve had very good success with it we ve had such success that we didn t toot our horn but this past quarter our operating costs on our logistics were lower percentages than the last couple of years probably the best lower percentages and actual dollars for the quarter were less dollars than the previous year and i don t think any retailer can make that statement that their costs of merchandise not the cost of merchandise but the cost of the handling was less than the year before with what s going on in the market and the environment they re working on first of all the systems in quiet are the most up to date systems we got the zero robots walking around pulling we have the ability to deliver to the customer fast and the big thing that we have is that this system follows our model that we set up we were the first people when we built our distribution center a few years ago to have the ability to handle stores and direct to the customer in the same facility most people do not build their facilities they build separate facilities for the online business and separate facilities for the store we really made a true omni experience where our facilities can handle both this same system that quiet has gives us the ability to even do it better if you ask me what i see i see us expanding quiet with more locations that will have all these micro centers around the country and be able to deliver it faster better and more efficient and also the big thing is we already have 60 customers handling other people other retailers we re giving great service and i look at us getting a platform which will be able to allow ourselves and our partners in it whoever different retailers between airterra that have aboard and the ones that are coming aboard in quiet to really be able to compete against the amazons of the world and the walmarts of the world in an efficient manner because in the future and i say this to our team logistics logistics logistics if you re not efficient there you re not going to win we have the best merchandise in the world and the best looks but if we don t have the ability to get it there in an efficient manner we re not going to win and this will give us ability to stay on top and we have great teams we brought in the quality of our teams i ll put against anybody in the industry period jay sole ubs analyst thank you for that maybe if i could just follow up if you could offer some ideas on revenue and profit potential because you mentioned you have 60 customers do you see that customer count growing and what does that mean for revenue and profit potential of the business michael r rempell executive vice president chief operations officer yeah jay this is jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer i ll let michael rempell answer that but we re very excited about that when you say about growing the area of people contact is we want to become customers like we could talk about the potential it s big potential i mean this is a true hi tech story michael r rempell executive vice president chief operations officer yeah yeah so jay we re actually going to defer that answer till next year but like jay is saying we see tremendous potential for this business and as we said in the quiet release we see this business not only being very large but being very profitable and having margins that are incremental to the company and we ll give more color at the beginning of next year jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer you know something michael i think the big thing we re pointing out is we re taking what s normally been a cost center and we re going to turn it to a profit center michael r rempell executive vice president chief operations officer right operator thank you judy meehan vice president investor relations right we ll take the next question operator yes our next question comes from the line of matthew boss with jpmorgan please proceed with your question matthew boss jpmorgan analyst great thanks and congrats on a nice quarter michael r rempell executive vice president chief operations officer thanks matt jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks matt matthew boss jpmorgan analyst at aerie and american eagle could you speak to demand that you re seeing across categories exiting the third quarter as we enter holiday how you feel about overall momentum at each concept so far in november maybe and just comfort with your inventory across the assortment as we think about the fourth quarter as a whole and exit the year jennifer foyle president executive creative director ae aerie hi it s jen how are you doing matt and happy thanksgiving to everybody look i first want to start with inventory and congratulate the supply chain i m hearing from competition that they really leaned on direct which is indicative to me that they couldn t probably support their store base keep in mind that we have a decent sized store fleet across our chain and we were able to not only meet the customer demands there but also on direct our store business was fantastic and with just real disciplines in inventory we were able to get that product based on some of what jay just spoke about to the customer at the right time and i do want to add in one thing there when i think about doing that i love the reactivation rates we re seeing on our customer base we re plus 40 in both brands on customer reactivation which again tells me plus 40 i should say tells me that our customers are highly engaged they re excited to go to the store and see what we have to offer we re in great supply there and i think we re ready to hit the road into holiday and i love what i m seeing i was just in the mall i saw all three brands excuse my voice i m a little throaty today and i saw our offline store in area i saw aerie and i saw american eagle outfitters and i have to tell you we are ready for the holiday season it looks like there wasn t a blip in the road as far as i m concerned and i think we look best in show so i m really proud of what these teams are able to deliver just to really deliver on to the season and like look this is definitely continued momentum so far we have a few weeks ahead of us meaning this week is our big one so we re buckling up and i m pretty excited about our execution to date that said look in american eagle we have reignited that customer we set out a strategy a year ago and look at these results i mean the earnings are spectacular the execution on low inventory levels of course there s a denim trend out there and those cycles last for a long time and i love that they re incredibly it s not just one fits that s the best part and what we re seeing in that is that she s aging she and he they re aging up with us and they re growing with us so we re pretty excited about that and i love what i see in the future the way we re mixing denim this marks almost a full year of really not promoting denim 365 days a year and look at those results our promotional cadence is lower than ever and again just the thoughtfulness in our strategies around exciting the customers is right on all categories have really been performing nicely and we see continued opportunity in both men s and women s for outfitting in the future in ae and i love what spring is going to bring us i saw early on some of the early on photo shoots and what our marketing campaigns are going to be and it s better with age and lastly i will say don t forget we have a brand new design team a new head merchant and they re really putting together a fabulous assortment strategy for the future and i could not be more proud of that team and looking to aerie well number one we have a whole new business category offline you heard about the leggings incredible those results with one of our highest demand categories and our highest margin category so we were able to hurdle that potential bump in the road and i think we did a great job doing so and watch out because those leggings are here and they re ready for holiday look the new brand is certainly exceeding expectations offline we have a lot of learnings and we had a lot of learnings i always love a learning because it means there s upside for next year and the team is really disciplined right now and focused on delivering incredible results in aerie all categories have fired though in q3 we ve seen a nice acceleration in our core intimates business as well as lounge many people scratch their heads and wondered if lounge was still going to be a desired category and certainly is we re really excited with what we ve been seeing so more to come and we re excited about holiday and the future matthew boss jpmorgan analyst that s great color jen maybe mike just as a follow up on profitability so kind of twofold can you speak to drivers of ae s operating margin expansion i think it was up over 1 000 basis points in the third quarter relative to two years ago and then just with aerie is 20 operating dollar flow through is that still the right rate to think about for the concept as we move forward mike mathias executive vice president chief financial officer yeah thanks matt i ll answer the second question first i think we talked about 25 for our longer term targets we flowed through about 25 in aerie this quarter over a two year basis but i think if you do the math on the freight that we incurred in the brand which on a proportionate basis was a bigger deal to aerie we definitely missed some business in leggings that jen was just talking about to the tune of probably we re estimating maybe 15 million on the quarter maybe a little over a 1 million a week in leggings business so if you do the math on that you d be at a probably 20 operating rate or so for the quarter versus the 16 5 and if you think about the flow through then would have been probably 30 plus 30 or higher in the quarter versus the 25 so i think we ll talk about the longer term goals in january again 25 is what we communicated last january we got the question around that being conservative the answer to that was likely conservative we ve been flowing through i think in the first half of the year more like 40 so we ll talk about it i think 30 is probably a good number to have in your mind now and we ll refine that for january at icr and then on the operating rate expansion in ae it s really the story of everything we re talking about at the company level too so we saw some nice merchant margin gains on top of really strong gains last year but the bigger story is through the gross margin was rent and delivery the majority of our leverage the majority of the gross margin expansion which then benefited ae on some nice revenue growth were those two categories and then again ae growing 21 to last year but even but then up 8 to 19 had us leveraging other expenses too but the rent and delivery were definitely standouts for us and i think that s continued work that we ll see that s the quiet conversation that s the logistics capabilities efficiencies and leverage we expect to continue to see and we ll continue to tell give provide more details around that in the future operator thank you our next question comes from the line of paul lejuez with citi please proceed with your question kelly crago citi analyst hi this is kelly crago on for paul thanks for taking our question i m just curious if you could elaborate on your outlook for the gross margin line in the fourth quarter just in light of the 70 million to 80 million in additional freight costs and what are your aur assumptions in the fourth quarter are you expecting as strong as aur that you saw so far this year and then just secondly on the auc just curious what you re looking at for at 22 what sort of price increases would you expect to help offset thank you mike mathias executive vice president chief financial officer thanks kelly i ll take the gross margin pieces and maybe michael can take some of the 22 questions so at first aur we re expecting similar type of results in aur again we have a lot of business ahead of us in the fourth quarter here navigating week to week but our expectations are similar in terms of what we saw in the third quarter gross margin piece of your question for the fourth quarter we disclosed and we talked about the 70 million to 80 million of freight cost the number for the year is more like is over 90 million so we did incur as we talked about in the aerie comments we incurred some incremental freight costs in the first or in the third quarter you can think about maybe 100 basis points of impact there to the company but fourth quarter it s 70 million to 80 million and if you do the math on rounding what you re expecting in revenue or what we re probably expecting in revenue it s probably all it s close to 500 points of gross margin so i think the benefits we re seeing in rent delivery almost we ll expect those things again but then we did what we said we re going to do which was get our inventory here make sure the customer didn t feel any impacts of the supply chain disruptions of vietnam shutdown and we spent money to get it here so that s about 500 basis points to the fourth quarter and if you do the math and related to guidance i mean i ll just hit that question maybe now which if you model out what you would expect us to probably have been guiding to in the fourth quarter and subtract 70 million to 80 million you re probably in the right place and just to say it proactively not tough to put it in a press release but we d be talking about a 700 million number or higher if not for that freight cost operator thank you our next question comes from the line of adrienne yih with barclays please proceed with your question adrienne yih barclays analyst good morning congrats and i just have to say from personal experience the digital and from store are remarkably fast like a day it s crazy so good for you michael r rempell executive vice president chief operations officer you re experiencing the efficiency first hand then thank you jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah thanks adrienne adrienne yih barclays analyst you re welcome maybe jay or jen or whomever wants to take this one can you talk about ae brand s number two denim selling position in the us how has that changed maybe from five years ago i seem to recall annually it was sort of in that 20 of sales but it seems like it s like significantly higher than that so if you can talk about where that is and then any comment on fourth quarter to date holiday we ve heard about acceleration massive acceleration in the space into the first part of november any quarter to date by brand would be super helpful thank you jennifer foyle president executive creative director ae aerie so yes in denim we still remained number one in women s for all ages and we sit number one in men s for our age demo 20 market share or still in that zone i would like to just add though it s really about the health of the business i mentioned it on my prior answer is the aurs in denim are at record highs and they ve surpassed the total ae brand aurs so it s pretty impressive as a percentage growth it s pretty pretty impressive when you see our ability to sell full price denim and honestly it s about time because the love and the detail and the workmanship that goes into our denim at this price value equation is like no other and i d like to say that we re in this for the long haul i like what we ve done over the past year i like that we re demanding the retails that warrant the quality that i just spoke about because i think it bodes well for our future where many retailers are going to face a lot of headwinds we have that beauty of again delivering quality less units and we re going to keep on looking at what else we can offer this customer and grow that aur where it s warranted so only where it s warranted but we re seeing no resistance if they love the fit and they love the silhouette they re spending so that will give us a lot of leverage in the future if you think about it eventually these headwinds are going to come down our costs are going to be more advantageous and i think we re going to be in a good position to take advantage of some of that but also continue to better our quality year over year and that s truly the strategy we re trending up over the past five years as far as market share and our customer is aging with us which i mentioned as well love that because in the past we used to see the customers jump out around 19 20 years old so we are in there as the number one solid denim offering in specialty from age 15 to 25 so really excited about that and headed into holiday we re continuing the momentum i like what i m seeing but again it s early on adrienne to tell it s obviously a big quarter but we definitely saw some acceleration early in on the quarter so now we re here we call it green week and we are ready to fight and most importantly delight our customers so just wanted to wish you a happy thanksgiving as well adrienne yih barclays analyst great job happy thanksgiving jennifer foyle president executive creative director ae aerie take care adrienne operator thank you our next question comes from the line of oliver chen with cowen and company please proceed with your question oliver chen cowen and company analyst hi thank you happy holidays everybody the topic of esg and sustainability is really important to cowen and a lot of the research that we ve been doing on is for gen z and gen a what would you say distinguishes you in terms of your competitive advantages one of the risk factors we see around denim is clearly water and the future of water as well as dying and thinking about transparency and the consumers preference for transparency as well thank you michael r rempell executive vice president chief operations officer hey oliver it s this is michael rempell yeah look i would just build on what jen was saying which is we ve invested over the last few years a lot of time and money and resources in building the best product that we can and part of doing that is investing in how that product is manufactured whether it s using better dye stuff more sustainable dye stuff more sustainable cotton reducing water usage as part of the manufacturing process and we re working very closely with our factories we set ambitious goals in fact our water goal that we set earlier last year we believe we re likely to accomplish that this year or next year in terms of water reduction and we re going to continue to raise the bar and make sure that our product is as sustainable as possible because if there s something our customers care about it s great quality it s great fit it s great innovation it s great value but it s also the way our product is manufactured and the impact on the environment so it s something we take very seriously and we re going to continue to raise the bar and improve the sustainability of our product and believe that in this environment where people are dealing with inflation and other pressures that the sustainability of our product along with the quality of our product is going to be a significant competitive advantage for us jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer also michael and jen i think you could tell them about the t shirt program we have coming up for the spring with the special dyes the special cv dyes jennifer foyle president executive creative director ae aerie yeah i mean the design team in both brands obviously have real good top of mind for all of our product categories i mean from swim as the swim category being almost 100 denim and again there s many variables under that what 100 means but our swim denim for back to school we re going to be almost 90 there as far as 90 of our denim being real good and we re just innovating under the covers i mean jay i don t want to tell everyone what we have on order we have some really cool t shirts coming your way i can t tell them the ingredients though jay jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer jennifer foyle president executive creative director ae aerie there s special ingredients there but the design teams definitely knows that this could be a top of mind question when we go to design and the sketch point and raw materials what can we do what part of this garment could be real good everything we do every part of it something that we do is better than doing nothing i mean that s my position on this subject matter and we are continuing to innovate in all of our categories whether it s be it whatever it may be you ll see more and more of this coming from aeo inc and really it s what our customer cares about it s top of mind for this next generation it s the number one idea or concept that these generations talk about and trust me i have a 14 year old and she s always reminding me that i need to go recycle my shoes so i will say it s something that we care about in aeo inc and there s going to be some great report outs and we ll i m sure we re going to talk about it when we go into the investor meetings and icr at the beginning of the year so thank you judy meehan vice president investor relations thanks oliver operator thank you our next question comes from the line of simeon siegel with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question simeon siegel bmo capital markets analyst hey everyone congrats on the ongoing strength and i hope you all have a great holiday season jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks simeon siegel bmo capital markets analyst the two year revenue growth is fantastic so great job you ve clearly been enjoying the higher full price sell through just curious how are units versus 2019 for ae and aerie and then sorry if i missed it did you speak to how you re approaching wage inflation from here thanks guys mike mathias executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i can answer i mean for ae brand units are down so when you think about the aur growth margin growth we ve seen we re doing more with less units so this revenue growth you re seeing is significant unit efficiency that s what we re seeing through the p l and other places like delivery in terms of cost efficiencies so that s the continued story aerie of course on the growth we re seeing there units are up but so is aur so not it s not all driven by unit growth it s as much or more driven by aur growth so again that s just inventory optimization that s the way jen and the teams are buying with depth we re seeing aur growth and less promotional spend and that s i think we ve talked about it profit equals less units so the more we can drive revenue with less units the more profit we ll see all the way through the p l and there s more efficiency higher sustainability you name it it s all a good story when you re selling less units simeon siegel bmo capital markets analyst great thanks and anything on wage inflation mike mathias executive vice president chief financial officer we have not seen i mean i think we are in good shape there simeon i think in our stores and our distribution centers we are not seeing anything that s beyond especially in the stores typical sort of market or local minimum wage increases that s part for the course things we deal with over and over we re not seeing a significant impact there in stores and i think we ve done a nice job in our distribution centers as well to mitigate wage inflation there michael i don t know if there s any other color you want to add on dc side but michael r rempell executive vice president chief operations officer no actually our labor situation in our distribution centers is in good shape we have raised wages in the dcs to attract talent but we ve been able to attract all the labor that we need for the season and we believe that we re largely going to offset any of the wage increases with efficiencies in the distribution center so we feel good about how we re positioned going into holiday mike mathias executive vice president chief financial officer maybe one we levered our own dc costs and labor we leveraged in the third quarter simeon so we re seeing as much michael just hit the points on sort of how we re handling labor and making sure we re staffed appropriately but we on a total basis our dcs we leverage costs judy meehan vice president investor relations thanks simeon operator thank you thank you our next question comes from the line of dana telsey with telsey advisory group please proceed with your question dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst good morning and congratulations on the nice results i think the acquisitions of quiet and airterra are very interesting as you think of this becoming a separate business line in your income statement and potentially revenue and profit driver does this lead to more acquisitions what fits in this and how do you see the margin profile compared to the base business and does the base business grow because of having these businesses that help drive logistics leverage thank you michael r rempell executive vice president chief operations officer hey dana it s michael i ll answer that first just to reiterate what jay said clearly this is working okay our total delivery leverage digital delivery leveraged as a percent of sales delivery dollars are down and our packages are getting to customers 10 to 15 faster so we couldn t be more thrilled about seeing these acquisitions that we have these partnerships that we have and the impact they re having on our business and clearly we we re acquiring the quiet and we acquired airterra because we believe that this combination of scale speed and cost advantages is needed in the market and what we re finding we haven t closed on quiet yet we re planning to close at the end of december but what we re finding is we re going out to airterra is that there s a massive unmet need in the market brands and retailers of all sizes are anxious to sign up with us and well again we ll give more color on that at the beginning of next year because previously they didn t have these kind of capabilities they couldn t access local delivery networks they couldn t position their inventory closer to customers and stores the combination of what we re doing with quiet and airterra gives brands and retailers of all sizes the ability to do both the ability to better position inventory the ability to serve stores and the ability to deliver e commerce to customers faster and cheaper than they could previously so we re excited to give you color on it clearly we invested in it jay is a great entrepreneur he worked with us he saw the opportunity but we invested in it not just because it s supporting our american eagle business but because we believe that this is going to be a big business in its own right and as we went out and we talked about this before but as we went out and we re building our plans not only is there substantial top line growth not only is there nice profit associated with that but it s actually accretive to our margin rates so again we re going to talk about it more at the beginning of next year but you re seeing the results in the american eagle business it gives us a lot of confidence that and the conversations we re having with other brands and retailers give us a lot of confidence that there s a huge unmet need here and that this is going to be a big business in its own right and we re looking forward to giving you more color at the beginning of next year judy meehan vice president investor relations okay take one more question jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah you know something i ll just add one i ll just add like one thing to what michael said we believe that in this logistic business bulk is very important getting better rates and as far as the shipping cost and we also believe that this platform and we look at this thing as a platform not just a business and someone is going to develop and we figured it might as well be us that this will be a platform that will be shared by our competition it will make them stronger because if we have stronger competition it s better for us more people that are attracted in the malls it helps our stores too and this is really going to be the answer to certain other retailers who really have been out trying to destroy retail in this country and we think we have an answer against that and we re prepared to lead the charge operator thank you our final question this morning comes from the line of susan anderson with b riley securities please proceed with your question susan anderson b riley securities analyst hi good morning nice job on the quarter just a follow up on the denim aur it sounds like you ve been pretty pleased with what you re seeing there i m curious if the consumers are shopping your more middle price point denim or if they re also kind of biting at those higher price points that we re seeing in the stores that approach 80 at full price and then also i m curious how you re thinking the sales play out for this holiday we re hearing a lot of consumers will shop earlier do you think that the results you ve seen so far in fourth quarter reflect some earlier shopping and potentially we ll get that december lull thanks jennifer foyle president executive creative director ae aerie sure i love retail because it s art and commerce right i think the team is doing a great job painting a beautiful picture for our customers but it s also about how we invest so when we think of pricing and we look at our tiered price points we ensure that our investments make sense so regarding the higher price points as we learn we will scale and we ve seen no resistance at this stage which gives us some runway for the future as i just mentioned with sustainability being at the forefront it s important that we think about that because it s not cheap to be green shall i say that and i think we re paving a great way ahead of us not even in just denim but in all of our categories because it allow us to be able to face some of these cost increases which then again we will be able to leverage once we get through some of these headwinds but to our benefit i love what we re seeing in our ability to sell higher prices in a nutshell so denim certainly we re like i said the team is investing accordingly based on where we think the demand is by price point but certainly we ve seen some great opportunities for the future as far as holiday look we re coming into q4 with great momentum certainly at the beginning of this month we definitely saw that and i do believe we re going to win throughout the season we have goods here right now to sell for this week coming up but we also are going to be in good position in december and we have newness flowing in december and we have flow strategies that are exciting that will keep the customer engaged so without having a crystal ball in front of me i like where we re positioned i think the teams have done an outstanding job getting us here so now it s our job to maximize the potential operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i will turn the floor back to mr schottenstein for any final comments jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer okay in closing this was an excellent quarter for aeo with record revenue and profit performance the strategic initiatives we laid out as part of our real power real growth value creation plan are clearly working momentum heading into the holidays is strong and we feel

officer thank you steve moving on to slide 7 to review critical mission solutions during the fourth quarter our cms business continued its strong performance total cms backlog increased 16 year over year 7 on a pro forma basis to 10 6 billion driven by a strategic new wins in cyber and intel and nuclear and remediation our cms strategy is focused on creating recurring revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities three market trends that we see offering continued strong growth include cyber commercial space and 5g technology for national security beginning with cyber and intelligence we are seeing several major emerging threats to national security first cyber attacks on mission critical infrastructure which are even more stealth and as disruptive as a traditional attack second the speed and complexity of near peer threats which requires real time coordination between space and other domains as a severity of nation state sponsored attacks continues to increase and third the adoption of a data intensive ai based applications are dramatically increasing the need for real time data security and integrity the funding for addressing these threats are partially reflected in the unclassified federal government spending on cyber in fy 22 which is expected to be over 20 billion up 10 from prior year additionally we expect to spending within classified budgets to be up higher during the quarter we are awarded a 300 million seven year contract with the national geospatial intelligence agency to modernize the nga s ability to rapidly gain and share insights from cross domain inventory including top secret data classification and within the classified budget we were awarded 170 million five year new contract to develop highly secure and hardened software application that are leveraging the latest advances in ai and machine learning we recently closed the blacklynx acquisition which provides software enabled solutions for automating the collection of data at the edge and quickly gaining insights into extremely large volumes of structured and unstructured data our strong presence across the dod and intelligence community as well as our digital enablement center will provide the escape velocity for blacklynx to commercialize and scale their solutions resulting in highly profitable recurring revenue we also recently announced a strategic investment and distribution agreement with hawkeye 360 which will enhance our digital intelligence suite of technologies with their rf spectrum analytics and collection automation offering moving on to space with a significant amount of capital being infused into the commercial space companies the affordability of space tourism is becoming a reality as well as other emerging opportunities such as acceleration of satellite based technologies and the need to understand the impact of space debris today we support commercial space companies with manufacturing process optimization system and subsystem prototype work and test facility studies and projects as commercial space matures we are positioning our solutions for these emerging opportunities during the quarter we were notified of a significant increase to the ceiling of our contract in marshall space flight center that also supports artemis and sls the u s space force selected jacobs for a five year contract to provide software and system support for its patriot excalibur system which coordinates to scheduling training and status of u s space force aircraft finally our telecom business had a strong quarter and we see the rollout of 5g investment from clients like at t verizon directv t mobile and dish network accelerating in 2022 and beyond in addition the new bipartisan infrastructure bill includes 2 5 billion for 5g rollout at u s military bases and the dod is investing heavily in 5g technology in support of national priorities in summary we continue to see strong demand for our solutions in 2022 the cms sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18 month qualified new business opportunities remaining above 30 billion which includes 10 billion in source selection with an increasing margin profile now on to slide 8 i ll discuss our people places solutions business we finished the year with strong financial performance with the year

targets for the year and is well positioned for continued out year growth i will now turn it over to kevin kevin berryman president chief financial officer thank you bob and good day to all listening on the call today turning to slide 10 for a financial overview of fourth quarter results followed by our fiscal year review as we have previously communicated our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13 week quarters which impacted our quarter year over year growth rate by 7 and our full year growth rate by 2 fourth quarter gross revenue increased 2 year over year and net revenue was up 7 including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions and adjusting for the year ago extra week net revenue was up 6 for the quarter adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27 2 up 370 basis points year over year consistent with last year the year over year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both people places cms as well as the benefit from pa consulting which has a strong accretive gross margin profile of nearly 50 we will continue to focus on increasing gross margins as we bring to market higher value solutions for our clients adjusted g a as a percentage of net revenue was up year over year to 17 within g a during the quarter we incurred an approximate 20 million or 0 12 per share charge to a legal settlement cost which burdened both gaap and our adjusted results this charge was related to a ch2m legacy matter surrounding a previously completed product advisory arrangement gaap operating profit was 252 million and was mainly impacted by 46 million of amortization from acquired intangibles adjusted operating profit was 303 million up 17 our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10 up 85 basis points year over year on a reported basis gaap eps from continuing operations rounded to 0 34 per share and included 0 45 primarily related to the u k statutory tax rate changes and other tax related items 0 40 related to the final mark to market of the worley stock and related fx impact 0 23 of net impact related to amortization of acquired intangibles 0 10 of transaction and other related costs and 0 06 from focus 2023 and other restructuring costs excluding these items fourth quarter adjusted eps was 1 58 including the 0 12 burden from the previously discussed legal matter during the quarter pa s continued strong performance contributed 0 23 of accretion net of incremental interest q4 adjusted ebitda was 310 million and was up 12 year over year representing 10 of net revenue finally turning to our bookings during the quarter our revenue book to bill ratio was 1 3 times for q4 positioning us well for the developing growth momentum we expect over the course of fiscal year 22 now turning to a recap of our full year fiscal year 2021 on slide 11 gross revenue increased 4 and net revenue was up 7 including the pro forma impact of all acquisitions and adjusting for the extra week in the year ago period net revenue was up 3 for the full year we continue to enhance our portfolio to higher value solutions which is evident as gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 26 for the year up 235 basis points year over year we expect mid single digit reported revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 with an acceleration in the second half of our fiscal year driven by u s infrastructure spending and the ramp up of new awards in our cms business gaap operating profit was 688 million and was mainly impacted by the 261 million of purchase price consideration for the pa consulting investment and a 150 million of amortization of acquired intangibles adjusted operating profit was 1 188 billion up 23 and represented 10 of net revenue adjusted ebitda of 1 244 billion was up 18 year over year to 10 6 of net revenue and just above the midpoint of our increased fiscal 2021 outlook gaap eps was 3 12 and was impacted by 1 96 from the pa consulting purchase price consideration and valuation allocation 0 77 of amortization of acquired intangibles 0 57 related to the u k statutory rate change and other u k related tax items 0 35 of net charges related to focus 2023 deal costs and restructuring and all of this being partially offset by a net positive 0 48 from the final sale of worley and c3 ai equity stakes excluding all of these items adjusted eps was 6 29 also above the midpoint of our previously increased outlook of the 6 29 pa consulting contributed 0 48 to that figure before turning to lob performance i would like to highlight that we are currently working on a further optimization of our real estate footprint as a result while we are still reviewing key components of the plan we expect the potential non cash impairment charge ranging from 60 million to 70 million in the first half of fiscal 22 our new footprint will facilitate virtual work options that leverage new technology and more collaborative workspaces in our offices regarding our lob performance let s turn to slide 12 starting with cms q4 2021 revenue was down 5 year over year but when adjusting for the extra week in q4 2020 was relatively flat on a pro forma basis let me remind you of the transitional dynamic impacting cms revenue growth related to the transitioning off of two lower margin contracts this represented 175 million year over year revenue impact during the quarter when excluding the contract roll off and adjusting for the extra week a year ago pro forma cms revenue was up double digits year over year in 2022 q1 we expect to we continue to expect an approximate 210 million year over year impact from these two contract roll offs and this will phase out in q2 as a result we expected report we expect reported revenue in the first quarter 2022 to be down slightly on a year over year basis with underlying growth being much stronger we expect the cms growth trajectory to improve over the year resulting in a reported mid to high single digit full year 2022 growth rate q4 cms operating profit was 115 million up 7 operating profit margin was strong up 100 basis points year over year to 9 1 for the full year cms operating profit was 447 million up 20 with 8 8 operating profit margin the improvement for the quarter and the year in operating margin was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities across the business we expect operating profit margin to remain in the mid 8 range through fiscal 2022 moving to people places q4 net revenue was flat year over year when factoring in the impact from the extra week p ps grew net revenue approximately 8 year over year for q4 and was up 2 for the fiscal year 2021 in q4 total p ps operating profit was down year over year driven by the 20 million legal settlement cost i described earlier adding back down legal settlement costs operating profit growth would have been up 8 in q4 for the fiscal year operating profit was up 5 or 8 excluding the legal settlement in terms of pa s performance pa contributed 273 million in revenue and 66 million in operating profit for the quarter q4 revenue grew 41 and 32 year over year in sterling q4 adjusted operating profit margin was 24 in line with our expectations on a full year basis pa consulting grew revenue 33 24 in sterling with adjusted operating profit margin up 23 our non allocated corporate costs were 55 million for the quarter and 190 million for the full year these costs were up year over year and in line with our expectation this the increase excuse me was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs and it investments related to our new ways of working in fiscal 2022 we expect non allocated corporate costs to be in the range of 200 million to 250 million given continued increases in medical costs and other investments these corporate costs as well as focus 2023 cms p ps investments will precede our expected acceleration in revenue growth and profit later in 2022 in summary these increased investments ahead of our growth will likely result in our q1 profitability and eps being relatively flat versus our q4 results with q2 then showing improvement and further acceleration occurring in the second half of the year turning to slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet during the fourth quarter we generated 176 million in reported free cash flow as dso again showed strong improvement the quarter s cash flow included 22 million of cash related to restructuring and other items was 16 million related to a real estate lease termination as we take advantage of virtual working for the year free cash flow was 633 million which was mainly impacted by the 261 million of pa purchase price consideration treated as post closing compensation that we discussed last quarter regardless our reported free cash flow represented 133 conversion against our reported net income for the full year 2022 we will again target an adjusted free cash flow conversion of at or above one times as a result of our strong cash flow we ended the quarter with cash of 1 billion and a gross debt of 2 9 billion resulting in 1 9 billion of net debt our pro forma net debt to adjusted expected 2022 ebitda is approximately 1 3 times a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet during the quarter we monetized our worley stock for 370 million and executed a 250 million accelerated share repurchase program we will continue to monitor for any material dislocation in our share price given the strong long term secular growth opportunities for our company and finally given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which was increased 11 earlier this year to 0 21 per share now i ll turn it back over to steve steve demetriou chairman chief executive officer thanks kevin we are introducing our fiscal 2022 outlook for adjusted ebitda to be in a range of 1 37 billion to 1 45 billion which at the midpoint represents double digit growth our adjusted earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2022 is in the range of 6 85 to 7 45 we expect a multi year benefit from the u s infrastructure investment and jobs act to support our growth in the second half of fiscal 2022 as we look beyond this year we see substantial opportunities for sustained organic growth driven by infrastructure monetization climate response and digital transformation we anticipate approximately 10 of adjusted eps through fiscal 2025 at our in person investor event in march we ll further expand on our long term strategy and financial model operator we ll now open the call for questions questions and answers operator and your first question comes from the line of jerry revich of goldman sachs jerry revich goldman sachs analyst yes hi good morning everyone steve demetriou chairman chief executive officer good morning bob pragada president chief operating officer good morning jerry jerry revich goldman sachs analyst steve as you built the portfolio it s clearly been a focus to bring together green businesses because of the idiosyncratic esg scoring unfortunately you folks aren t getting much credit for that esg funds are 80 underweight jacobs how does that impact the way you folks view the cms portfolio or portions of the cms portfolio going forward steve demetriou chairman chief executive officer well look there are some investors that are holding back because of some of our work which is really a very small portion probably less than 2 of our overall revenue that is really focused around what i would call critical national security for the u s government and we are reaching out to those investors to try to explain that we re not involved in things like the manufacturing of nuclear weapons or whatever is holding them back but i really think that as people understand sort of the fact that we re probably the largest public company delivering esg climate change solutions out there that as they see that ramping up and get more clarity i think we re going to attract a lot more investors that want to be part of the esg story jerry revich goldman sachs analyst and steve just a clarification is divestiture of that 2 on the table at all how are you thinking about that within the portfolio context steve demetriou chairman chief executive officer look again it s so small that we haven t really thought about that but like anything else jerry over the next few years you will hear a little more about this during the strategies we re going to continue to look at our portfolio and make sure we re aligned with all the right growth dynamics and i think we ve proven that up to now we ll continue so transform our portfolio in the right direction jerry revich goldman sachs analyst okay thanks operator and your next question comes from the line of josh sullivan of the benchmark company josh sullivan the benchmark company analyst hey good morning steve demetriou chairman chief executive officer good morning josh sullivan the benchmark company analyst i was curious if you could just give us some perspective just on global capex expectations into 22 you guys have such a large global portfolio and touched so many different markets from your view what are customers generally planning for capex heading into 22 as they look to move out of the pandemic kevin berryman president chief financial officer so look i think there is a couple of things that we need to point out specifically the customers that bob highlighted in the in his comments really about our advanced facilities clearly very very very strong there and the semiconductor shortages is acute and we have many of our clients that are looking to build significant capacities over the next several years i do think our private clients ultimately are now all thinking more robustly about spend as it relates to environmental solutions and thinking about how they can transform their footprints in a way that are facilitating our ability to become a more sustainable global economy and i think that that s clear and then i would augment that is with our government services side exactly the same comment so i think that capex is very strong in that regard the last piece i would call out is our environmental businesses and energy transition business is touching the oil and gas space as well where we are working with them to ultimately provide incremental capability sets that will help them in them becoming a more viable sustainable contributor to the global climate actions being taken around the globe so i think you re right there were wide we re focused across a wide swath and actually a lot of them given the work we do are very very strongly focused on these areas which we think will encourage incremental capex longer term operator your next question comes from the line of jamie cook of credit suisse jamie cook credit suisse analyst hi good morning i guess first question the eps target that you put out there for 2025 the 10 supports obviously good growth there kevin can you just talk about one are the costs to achieve the 10 in terms of restructuring or investment and then on the 10 can you provide some parameters sort of top line margins do we need to utilize the balance sheet in terms of m a or share repurchase to help achieve the 10 so i guess that s my first question i ll start there kevin berryman president chief financial officer yeah jamie thanks for that the 10 is really an organic number that we re alluding to and really doesn t involve capital deployment in any material fashion and so i think clearly there could be potential upside to those numbers but we re working through all of that with our strategy which we will talk more about in march as steve outlined so some of your questions are little premature as we re finalizing all that work for margins and whatnot rest assured though i think you can pretty much assume that the margin is not going down as it relates to what we re trying to get accomplished from an overall perspective as it relates to cost to get there look we think that most of the things that we re going to be able to do are going to be embedded in our normal course operational expenditures we did i did highlight the fact that we re working on a further optimization of our real estate footprint backing a potential impairment of 60 to 70 maybe maybe up to 70 in the first half maybe even in the first quarter and then if i think about other things it s not going to be significant monies on top of that maybe 25 to 50 in 2022 and then 23 and beyond tbd i would say and so we re really thinking that we like the portfolio and other than things that would occur relative to integration of acquisitions and deal cost and those kind of things probably somewhat de minimis in terms of restructuring costs outside of those operator and your next question comes from the line of steven fisher of ubs steven fisher ubs analyst great thanks good morning one of the things i think the business and the stock really need just kind of a breakout to the upside on the p ps organic revenue growth and it seems like we started to see that this quarter but i think kevin you said maybe 8 nsr growth which is i think up from about 1 4 for the last couple of quarters so maybe just more qualitatively to what extent are you really seeing a breakout on that p ps growth now sort of what s the organic assumption you have for the rest of fiscal 22 because i think you gave us some color on q1 and what have you factored in there exactly for stimulus as part of that growth thank you kevin berryman president chief financial officer so let me take it and then bob you can add any commentary if you d like to look we re in this period of time in our q1 and q2 primarily where the numbers aren t really going to be impacted yet by the stimulus we believe that s more a q3 event maybe we get a little bit in q2 but likely not that is more q3 and an acceleration into q4 that we would expect the benefits associated with the stimulus and so we re excited about that having said all of that i do believe our incremental growth going forward in q1 and q2 is going to be more solid than what we ve been seeing over the last few quarters and so we re starting to see some of that benefit of the advanced facilities certainly not as much in q1 but in q2 and so i do think we will see some good solid growth in q1 and q2 on people places and then it will accelerate again hopefully into the q3 and q4 numbers so we feel good about the developing momentum i did make the comment that we re investing in front of that growth too so we re not going to see a lot of incremental margin associated with that because we are investing heavily bob pragada president chief operating officer yeah what i d add to that kevin is that steve was giving us optimism around there is our bookings if we look at just the way we started out the year from a bookings perspective it s been solid what the other part of that is that we have to if you think about the project lifecycle so these bookings are starting off with consultative services better on the front end of some of these programs and projects and then they go through the subsequent phases where our services will escalate so overall very good leading indicators that support what kevin is saying operator and your next question comes from the line of andy kaplowitz with citigroup andy kaplowitz citigroup analyst hey good morning guys steve demetriou chairman chief executive officer good morning andy kaplowitz citigroup analyst could you give us a little more color into what s going on in cms i think kevin you said that cms margin would stay in the mid 8 range in fy 22 but the margin has already risen to over 9 in the last quarter despite still significant contribution from the lower margin contract work that s flowing through is there something else now impacting your margin in fy 22 and then on the revenue side your cms backlog up double digit seem to suggest that you could deliver the mid to high single digit guidance that you have but you need to see an acceleration of awards and or revenue burn what you ve been versus what you ve been recording in q4 to get there kevin berryman president chief financial officer so cms specifically as you may recall two three four years ago when we did have these lower margin large contracts we were in the 5 to 6 operating profit margin and we ve now built over over time that now to mid 8 number which is great and it s consistent with our strategy as we look about 2022 specifically we ll have ramp on some other lower margin business associated with idaho and other nuclear remediation work but that s not going to dampen our margin it s just going to hold it flat for 2022 and then in 23 and beyond we start to see incremental margin above that as well so it s a continuation of a long term margin play it s just ebbs and flows of when the big contracts come in the margins associated with them so 22 is a little limited in terms of incremental margin then it start to build again in 23 and beyond steve demetriou chairman chief executive officer i guess from the operator there is some background noise i don t know if it s your side after your opening it up for questions so could you double check that operator yes sir and your next question comes from the line of chad dillard of bernstein chad dillard bernstein analyst hi good morning guys so just wanted to dig into p ps it seems like you have so many opportunity ahead of climate change semiconductors infrastructure and digitization how are you guys sizing your bets can you just like talk about the relative rank of the size of the opportunity and then just thinking through just where you stack up in terms of competitive dynamics in those segments steve demetriou chairman chief executive officer chad can you repeat the front part of that question again you sort of broken chad dillard bernstein analyst yeah sure so i was just saying in p ps it seems like you have just so many different opportunities ahead from climate change to semis infrastructure digitization i just wanted to understand just how you guys are sizing your bets across all of those opportunities if you could talk about the relative rank in terms of the size of opportunity and your relative competitive positioning in those steve demetriou chairman chief executive officer sure so as far as prioritization goes i would say that kind of if you were to segregate into two buckets one around climate change and the second around all those things that are creating the supply chain disruption those are the ones that are coming to priority right now i d say on the climate change piece and this is where the portfolio optimization is really helping us we re honing in on those areas that we have a sound market leadership long term client relationships and where we can deliver immediate value and those are squarely around transportation water resiliency and all of the environmental impacts that are affiliated with climate change and so those client relationships that we ve had have been pretty robust for several years and are supporting those opportunities around advanced facilities this is a multi decade type of leadership approach that we ve had specifically in semis but also in life sciences that s been a legacy business of ours for forever so we re seeing those opportunities again not searching for them these are long term client relationships that we ve had and we re kind of in the capital planning for those clients and so it s really gaining share with long term clients that s setting the priorities operator and your next question comes from the line of sean eastman of keybanc capital markets sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst hi gentlemen so i m just looking at the 2025 target i think that implies around 12 earnings growth cagr over the next couple of years it seems like at the midpoint of the fiscal 22 guidance you re going to outpace that and i just wanted to reconcile that considering the way you describe the cadence of fiscal 22 earnings it seems like the exit velocity is going to be quite strong and that we should actually see accelerating earnings growth out of fiscal 22 so i hope that question makes sense just wanted to talk through the mechanics there maybe there is some conservatism any commentary there would be helpful kevin berryman president chief financial officer look i think what we do when we put forth our indications of what we expect our business to do we think those are numbers that are obviously going to be able to be executed against and so yeah there is a lot of moving pieces and you re right we will hopefully exit this year with a greater velocity than what we entered clearly and so we ll see how that plays out but i think ultimately what s clear is that we ve got whether it s 12 or 11 or 13 or whatever it ends up being we re going to have a long haul a good solid margin enhancing growth in front of us sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst okay operator and your next question comes from the line of michael dudas of vertical research michael dudas vertical research analyst hi good morning everybody maybe bob you can share a little bit of your thoughts on your recent acquisitions and other opportunities in the pipeline from cms certainly increasing your cyber intel higher margin business but also on the pps side i know you didn t put things out into your long term guide on acquisitions but how do you see that and is the company set to achieve these targets with the employees and professionals that you have and is there a good some interesting opportunities to leverage some of that pa work as you get more collaborative to drive even further growth to serve the client base bob pragada president chief operating officer hi michael let me unpack that here a bit first on the acquisition piece we re excited if you look at the last two that we did within cms about a year ago with the buffalo group and most recently with blacklynx these are right down the right in the bull s eye of where we re going in cyber and intelligence where we re bringing in whether it would be client diversification with the buffalo group and higher end advisory services and that has played out extremely well if you look at some of the we have code names for them but some of the wins that we ve had over the course of the last nine months that has played out perfectly and then blacklynx is getting us into those software solutions coupled with advisory services on automation and in collection of data with processing the engines that are working at the edge all around security and so we re excited about both of those and coupled with long term advisory platforms that we ve had in the agencies that we re already in that s going to service extremely well with regards to prospects in the p ps world i d target it more toward it s not too dissimilar than our cyber and intelligence prospects around technology we ve got a strong position with our domain knowledge for several decades within those end markets that we re talking about coupled with now technology enabled solutions is really what our acquisition strategy has been as accelerants to our strategy so we are looking at the pipeline right now it looks really good and more to follow on that front as steve mentioned at the investor day the employee base is something that we are acutely focused in on right now this is where our globality really really helps us in that we are in multiple locations around the world with high end talent that are delivering global talent utilized to deliver local solutions and so our ability to scale you hear about some of the labor shortages and labor topics that are that we re faced within the western hemisphere we re scaling in multiple locations for jobs that are all around the world and that s been a big piece of ours and then that last part with regards to pa we mentioned a couple of the collaborative opportunities but where are where pa sits in a lot of the same clients that we have in that c suite as well as in kind of the front end of technology as our clients are developing new innovative ways of delivering the global topics we re seeing the collaboration accelerate and hopefully we ll have some more wins to talk about the dfra win in the u k last quarter this win can t disclose the client in the biotechnology world has just shown that having the ability to offer expertise at the entirety of the lifecycle of a project a program or an issue is powerful and is one that s picking up some significant momentum so we re excited on all fronts operator and your next question comes from the line of gautam khanna of cowen gautam khanna cowen analyst hey good morning guys i wanted to follow up on the outstanding bids i think you said 10 billion in source selection and just give a sense for how what is sort of the phasings in terms of adjudication timeline are you expecting a strong december quarter in terms of bookings and just how does your how does if you could talk to us about the continuing resolution and how that might change kind of the range of outcomes with cms and relatedly recompete concentration over the next fiscal year how much of the business faces until rebid thank you steve demetriou chairman chief executive officer yeah look we re pretty positive confident that this whole continuing resolution defense budgets all that will play out over the next several months and get concluded and we re expecting an increase in the dod budget and we re pretty positive about space and cyber and the growth rate especially in the classified work we re significantly aligned to and hypersonics and telecom and we feel very well positioned that places like nasa and how the budget is played out there so really it comes down to the whole timing question that you asked there has been some delay very modest delay as the government clients are waiting just to see the outcome of this budget and so as soon as that gets finalized we see a few of these near term prospects that we ve hinted to unleash whether it happens in december or the second quarter i think we re talking about sort of that kind of timing so we are that s why we re very optimistic about the upward trend in cms revenue growth as we move through 2022 kevin berryman president chief financial officer just a follow up on your question on rebids there is at the end of the year a couple of larger rebids that we re going to have to be thinking through but there is we all know rebid risk embedded into the 2022 year of substance operator and your next question comes from the line of michael feniger of bank of america michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question kevin just so we re not missing anything here to follow up on sean s question you guys just did the high end of your eps range in 2021 and the midpoint is 14 growth so just conceptually with infrastructure ramping up the cms incrementals really taking off in 2023 is there just anything we should be aware of big picture of why earnings growth would not accelerate why it would step down to 2025 is there as you were kind of alluding to is it recompete risk is it just higher level of sg a or where the margins are just kind of help us understand i know you ll flush out more at the investor day just when we see that 10 of eps and the earnings growth you guys are getting this year which is back end loaded just the bridge there just what are the things that would hold back that earnings growth kevin berryman president chief financial officer well look we re talking 2025 here that s four years from now we re still in the midst of a pandemic and i think it s prudent to put some variability about what the world looks like four years from now so i think the most powerful message about the 10 is we re putting that number out there even if economic situation is in not a good place in 2025 so look i think it s prudent to put out numbers that are appropriate and we feel like we can get after and by the way that s four years from now so a lot can happen in four years michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you operator your final question comes from the line of andy kaplowitz of citigroup andy kaplowitz citigroup analyst hey guys good morning again i just want to follow up on pa consulting because you recorded almost 0 50 of accretion in 21 i think that s essentially double your original guide when you announced the deal i know you probably don t want to tell us know what s embedded exactly in fy 22 we know what your original guide was there but maybe you can give us color and what has at pa exceeded your expectations by such a wide amount and what does that mean for jacobs moving forward kevin berryman president chief financial officer so there s a couple of things and maybe i ll turn it over to bob for any additional color i think andy the first thing is that the acceleration in their growth which is really the driver to what s been happening in 2022 a lot of it or a chunk of it is in related to that specific work bob was alluding to on pandemic related and the work that they ve been doing for the u k government really really strong performance now as we look into 2022 they re going to be growing but it s not going to be at that same rate that we ve been talking about they got to figure out a way to recover and get new business to replace some of this business that s going to go away so it s not a slam dunk as it relates to what s going to be happening in 2022 by any stretch so having said all of that what they ve done in 22 or 21 has been extraordinarily strong good margins and they ve been executing well and actually the exciting thing is the collaboration between pa and people places and cms is very strong and we re seeing that develop into longer term growth opportunities from maybe pa but certainly jacobs as well bob pragada president chief operating officer maybe two areas that we knew about we probably didn t fully give credit to the depth of the two things that we d like to mention one is the applied technology ability that they have you see consulting firms that have kind of a roadmap or a recipe or a methodology that they utilize for different challenges and then proposing solutions pa s applied technology to solve a unique issue and so that has really paid some dividends especially with the new work kevin and i talked about the u k work but this is now what we re seeing in the u s and then second is around the depth of relationships the depth of relationships that pa has and where to connect in the client s organization and really hone that relationship through performance has been extremely impressive and is again we knew about it it s exceeded our expectation operator and there are no further questions steve demetriou chairman chief

thanksgiving has been known as the unofficial start to the holiday shopping season since the first modern thanksgiving day parade in 1924 the term black friday however did not arise until the 1960s when police officers in philadelphia complained about the traffic and congestion caused by holiday shoppers retailers however did not appreciate the negative connotation associated with the name black friday so they changed the meaning of the name to reflect the financial successes of that day traditionally accountants used red ink to show negative amounts and black ink to show positive amounts so retailers used this habit to rebrand black friday the new meaning behind the name is that black friday is the day when retailers finally begin to turn a profit for the year what time do black friday sales usually end despite the holiday being named black friday many retailers such as amazon and walmart started rolling out deals way before thanksgiving day some of them started a full month early many of these sales will run all the way through cyber monday but keep tabs on our coverage for any updates black friday 2021 tips 1 do research beforehand before jumping headfirst into black friday

strategy ahead of time to ensure you do not miss out on a deal start by identifying stores you want to shop at and products you want deciding on your ideal price and the maximum you are willing to pay

adjustments 5 read return policies while black friday can come with big savings it can also mean small fine print with details many tend to skim over during black friday sales refunds and returns

welcome kobi to the call and wish him luck i have worked with kobi for many years as you may know kobi was vp finance at elbit system land and c4i when i was general manager turning to the financial results the recent months have been busy and productive with a number of strategic contract awards we continue to see good momentum across almost all our end markets including israel following the approval of defense budgets at our investor day in april we discussed the increased importance of maritime domain and the investment elbit has made to develop solutions for the growing market in november our u k subsidiary elbit system u k was awarded 100 million 13 year contract from babcock to provide the royal navy with new electronic warfare capabilities as part of this contract elbit system u k will design and manufacture maritime ew suites comprised of digital full spectrum radar electronic support measures and ew command and control systems these latest generation technologies will enhance the situation awareness and anti ship missile defense of royal navy ships improving the capability to exploit the electromagnetic environment elbit systems supplies electronic warfare systems for air land and naval platforms and in recent years has signed a number of contracts to supply ew systems for the u s air force national guard f 16 and german air force helicopters we are also installing ew systems on the israeli navy s new sa ar 6 corvette in september we received a 56 million contract to provide an integrated anti submarine warfare solution to the navy of an asia pacific country elbit will provide civil unmanned surface vessel consumed to perform anti submarine warfare missions and our towed reelable active passive sonar or traps systems this award follows a contract earlier this year to provide seagull usvs configured for mine countermeasure missions the integration of sparton is progressing as planned i am very satisfied with the progress we have delivered in the maritime market this year expanding our market positions and product portfolio elbit is well positioned for growth in this market over medium term a few weeks ago we hosted israeli defense minister benny gantz at the cornerstone laying ceremony at our new ramat beka facility we are building in the south of israel over the coming years we will transfer imi s manufacturing activities from central israel to a new modern facility the new facility is an important part of the implementation of the multi year imi turnaround plan and we expect to complete the move by 2024 these efforts should support our efforts to enhance imi profitability the second part of the imi turnover is to increase the share of international sales these were significantly lower than elbit when we acquired imi accordingly imi s international orders have grown rapidly since the acquisition in the first nine months of 2021 60 of imi orders were from international customers compared to approximately 20 prior to the acquisition in 2018 the acquisition of imi enhanced elbit system portfolio for artillery solutions by adding advanced munition to our legacy portfolio of services mortar target acquisition and dedicated command and control solutions the israeli mod selected elbit system to develop and manufacture a new generation of sigma howitzer to the ids sigma is a 1 5 millimeter self propelled howitzer capable of automatic loading and laying of the gun system rapid in and out action times and high rate of fire the ramp in this program is progressing as planned last week we received 106 million contract to supply sigma fully automatic self propelled howitzer gun system to a country in asia pacific the first international order for the sigma we believe there is a significant potential for additional activity orders for militaries around the world looking to upgrade their legacy artillery systems elbit systems atmos howitzer participated in the u s army shoot off earlier this year and we and was on display outside ausa in d c in october we continue to invest in the expansion of our u s footprint in november elbit systems of america announced plans to establish a new 135 000 square foot facility in charleston south carolina the facility will hold the esa s ground combat vehicle assembly and integration center of excellence we expect operations in the facility to begin by the third quarter of 2022 to support contracts esa received from the israeli ministry of defense for the supply of self propelled howitzer gun system to their ids the new facility is part of elbit systems strategy to expand our engineering and manufacturing capability in the u s this facility will create around 300 new jobs will support 280 suppliers across south carolina and can be used for selling integration effort for future dod programs in september esa received a 54 million contracts for envg production from the u s army this order is part of the ota contract with a maximum value of 442 million we received in 2020 in october esa received 76 million idiq contract to supply head mount and display systems for the u s army apache helicopter in summary our broad based backlog continues to provide us with good visibility and we continue to see significant potential around the world for our leading high technology solutions and with that i will be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you the first question is from greg konrad of jefferies please go ahead greg konrad jefferies analyst good morning bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer good morning greg greg konrad jefferies analyst maybe just to start on revenue kind of a two part question one kind of more short term one longer term i mean just in the short term is this year any different where you typically have a q4 ramp for sales or were there some items kind of pulled into q2 and q3 and then kind of the second part longer term i mean organic growth has been running well ahead of our expectations and also kind of the mid single digit target you ve laid out in the past i mean has the growth profile been reset or are there headwinds heading into next year we should be thinking about just kind of how we should think about the overall growth target joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer look usually as you have mentioned the fourth quarter is usually a strong quarter at elbit systems from point of view of revenues and we expect this to be the case for 2021 as well we did see the transformation of the strong backlog growth that we had in recent years into revenues actually i would say that repeatedly we were asked by the markets how come that we grow so strongly in the backlog and we do not see a simultaneous growth in revenues as we explained it takes some time from the growth of the backlog until it transforms into revenues and presently we do see that effect happening this year looking forward i think the transformation of the backlog into revenues will continue the continued growth in backlog will create continuous growth in revenues however i am not sure at this point in time that we will be able to deliver strong double digit growth through all of next year we do believe that the growth will happen because of the backlog numbers and that next year we will see growth in the top line as well greg konrad jefferies analyst thank you for that and maybe just transitioning to margins i mean you mentioned cost control measures and a number of maybe efficiencies around manufacturing i mean how are you thinking about the margin target i think you ve laid out a 10 longer term margin target in the past i mean how do we think about the path to get there between maybe mix some of the efficiency measures you ve kind of put in place and just overall volume leverage joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer i think that our long term plan is definitely underway and we started to see the positive results of our long term strategic plan of reduction of overheads of cost of improving efficiencies of combining production lines and all the other efficiencies including centralized acquisitions and so on all of this is happening in the past we mentioned also what we call the one erp system that is implemented across the whole organization we are well over 50 already implemented and we expect to complete that somewhere most of it during next year and may be some very small parts in the year after that and we already start to see to see the benefits of that although the biggest part will come in 2022 and 2023 when we have most of the company under the same erp system this all effort will continue and as i said it s part of the long term plan that is implemented and thus help us in the improved performance from the point of view of profitability together with that we have some headwinds because of the local currency exchange rate we are making all the efforts possible in order to mitigate that and that effort will also continue into the future we also are looking at various production sites in order to enable us to manufacture and do some as well as engineering efforts in high quality low cost countries that will enable us to reduce our cost base in the various areas of cost in the company one of the elements that helps us to reduce the overall percentage of costs of the operating expenses is of course the very strong growth in the top line and when the company is growing then the reduction in percentage of cost in the g a the percentage of cost of r d and other expenses is also helpful in improving the operating profit line greg konrad jefferies analyst i will leave it there thank you and a good quarter thanks bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer thanks greg operator the next question is from pete skibitski of alembic global please go ahead pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst yeah nice quarter guys and yossi congratulations on your pending retirement joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you i will be around for some time bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer he is not retiring yet pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst understood so yeah second straight quarter of it looks by my math sort of mid teens organic revenue growth and i think the last quarter you talked about a large precision guided munition sale to an asia pacific nation as being a key driver of that second quarter growth and so i m guessing maybe that was a big driver in the third quarter as well can you give us a sense for when that large program may start to run off just so we can maybe get an idea for the timing of maybe transitioning from this kind of mid teens growth to more of a like you talked about your long term goal of mid single digit plus type growth joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer our revenues are definitely impacted by various programs of this kind this is not the only program that we are running this specific program it goes through the next year as well and however there are some significant other programs with similar characteristics that we have received in our backlog and will eventually replace the revenues from this program as we usually do over the years pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst okay ok and then can we talk cash flow for a second there is a large receivables billed this quarter i think i heard you got i don t know if that s related to the pgm sale or but i also heard you guys say that the israeli defense budget was approved which i think you were hoping that that could improve cash flow so i m just wondering maybe you could speak to expectations for fourth quarter cash flow and kind of catching up on some of the receivables billed joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer well the one good thing that has happened in november is that the israeli government has approved and department has approved the budget for the rest of 2021 and 2022 this of course has been reflected in approving all the expense elements the budgets of the mod in israel and that has translated in payments significant payments that were delayed by the israeli ministry of defense for many quarters actually so that at this point in time i can i am happy to report that a significant part of the delayed payments have been paid and we expect by the rest of this year to get paid for most of the delayed payments of the ministry of defense so from that point of view that s very good news and things are back on track as they should have been for normal course of business and i would emphasize that this is not reflected yet the improved collection from the ministry of defense in israel is not reflected in the third quarter numbers because the budget was approved in november we will see that in the fourth quarter from a point of view of the other elements yes when you have increased revenues then of course you have increased receivables and we expect to collect all of that in time so looking at the next quarter i would cautiously be optimistic by saying that we probably will improve our working capital and we will see stronger cash generation pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst okay so that s great news i appreciate that maybe i can sneak one last one in maybe for butzi butzi a lot of news i think about opportunities for israeli firms in general but certainly for elbit for i will call it non israel defense sales i think you guys have tended to dubai airshow recently and there was an announcement that you are setting up a new unit in uae so can you talk about maybe how optimistic you are about these kind of new opportunities and kind of timing and magnitude and it just kind of seems like a whole new market has opened up to you fairly quickly bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer thank you it s true we participated for the first time in the dubai airshow the abraham agreements are opening new opportunities in new markets for elbit and i can tell you that there is a lot of interest in several countries for technology and i am optimistic that it will generate revenues in the future for us in this new market we are working with the local industries already and we know the market quite well and i am quite optimistic that we will continue to see revenues in this market in the future as well and this is not true just for uae it is true for additional countries which are open for us right now based on the agreement which was declared year and a half years ago pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst that s great i appreciate all the color guys bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from ella fried of bank leumi please go ahead ella fried bank leumi analyst hello first i would like to congratulate the new cfo kobi on his appointment and wish him a lot of success and i have a few questions the first question relates to the operational profit and the hedge level you have achieved in this quarter quite a nice rate of operational profit certainly non gaap and we also remember that this year you set the hedge level at ils3 3 for dollar what about going i also remember that you established now a continuous hedge so what are you expecting the next year did you catch a nice level for the forward going quarters joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we have hedged our shekel expenses for this year and that includes the fourth quarter for next year we have been successful to hedge part of that mainly in the first half of next year and we of course are keeping track on the changes in the currency and looking for opportunities to continue our policy of continuous hedging as it comes along ella fried bank leumi analyst so you have two certain quarters you had a few that are fully almost fully hedged at the current level and then you have to try and keep it on joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer i said and i say part of next year yes ella fried bank leumi analyst part of next year i decided it s my decision that it s half of next year okay and the next question is actually about i don t know to whom it s related but it s about removing facilities you mentioned it for many years and now i think the time is now because the level are really the exchange levels are really unheard of and when you mentioned charleston could it be one of the facilities to actually accept the removed operations or it s just a different project and the operations will be removed to countries with even cheaper labor costs bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer hi ella good afternoon ella fried bank leumi analyst good afternoon bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer as you know we have dozens of companies all around the world in brazil in the u s in the u k in germany in india and many other places and we in all these markets it s very important to create local jobs and to do development and to do production so we are taking advantage of the positions we have in these markets and we are expanding our facilities there it helps us first to be more local to be more crafted and to do more jobs on the ground and secondly also to hedge some of our activities which we do in israel and other facilities so it s a long term process and it s part of improvement we are trying to gain in the op as yossi mentioned it s one element there it s already effective as you all saw in the last results other parts are increasing productivity which is boca the raton boca facility will help us with that and centralized procurement and the new erp are the measures which were mentioned by yossi earlier so all together we have a long term plan to improve the profitability of the company and we are implementing it it s quite effective and we will continue to do it in the future just on facilities just one piece in this quarter ella fried bank leumi analyst okay thank you and the last question was actually also for you it s a more marketing question do you intend to keep in the long term imi label or you plan to integrate it a certain within the few years into elbit systems label because there are different sites to it so what do you have a definite plan now bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer it s a good question and for that i can tell you that imi have very good reputation all around the globe mainly for mission and for land platforms so for the time being we intend to keep the name of the product we would like to gain benefits of the reputation of the good reputation imi is having in many countries ella fried bank leumi analyst okay thank you for taking my questions bezhalel machlis president and chief executive officer thank you ella operator the next question is from elad kraus of excellence please go ahead elad kraus excellence analyst thanks hi butzi yossi and kobi i have a couple of questions first regarding the sales i see that israel is only 19 of the sales do you see that a trend that israel should go lower or it s one time that usually will come back to the normal where it used to be a few quarters ago and the second question is also regarding the margins do you see any changes in the environment right now that you can say that the margins should be higher or lower or the same compared to the last quarters joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer as you know elad the israeli market is a limited market as the company grows then a big part of our growth is international so with all the optimism that the israeli defense budget continues to grow and it does it looks like we are growing faster and our expansion is in the international market so based on that looking at the longer term and assuming that the company will continue to grow at a relatively high rate then the percentage wise the israeli market will probably be will be declining however the absolute value expected to grow at some rate so this is regarding your first question regarding the profitability stuff i think we explained that and we are doing everything possible in order to improve it i think we are on track the prices in the market are defined by the market itself so the improvement in the profitability we expect it to come from improvement in operations of the company so this is actually the plan and we see very successful results out coming from that plan elad kraus excellence analyst yeah so that is still at the same level i mean there is no higher competition joseph gaspar executive vice president and chief financial officer well the competition is essentially there it was there it continues to be there and we expect it to be there in the future as well elad kraus excellence analyst all right thanks operator there are no further questions at this time before i ask mr machlis to go ahead with his closing statement i would like to remind participants that a

by faith karimi cnn a wave of smash and grab crimes is plaguing upscale stores in major us cities with mobs of thieves making off with expensive goods in brazen nighttime raids at least 18 people broke into a nordstrom department store in los angeles monday night and stole thousands of dollars in merchandise the city s police chief said the thefts followed a rash of similar incidents over the weekend in the san francisco bay area a group of thieves swarmed the southland mall in hayward on sunday evening wielding hammers to smash cases at a jewelry store before grabbing items and fleeing three suspects were arrested saturday night after a mob ransacked a nordstrom department store in walnut creek east of san francisco some 80 suspects were involved and they fled the outdoor mall in at least 10 different vehicles police said that robbery came after similar raids friday night near san francisco s union square where thieves targeted louis vuitton burberry and bloomingdale s stores a walgreens and cannabis dispensaries and california isn t the only place grappling with smash and grab crimes fourteen robbers barged into a louis vuitton store in suburban chicago last week and fled with more than 100 000 in handbags and other merchandise so why so many recent incidents are they linked to the holiday season is it pandemic restlessness this has nothing to do with the pandemic said pete eliadis a former law enforcement official and founder of security company intelligence consulting partners the pandemic is overused at this point but security experts cited a mix of several other factors such cases aren t always a priority for law enforcement san francisco has seen a surge in crime since it reopened in the pandemic in the central district for example larceny and theft incidents are up almost 88 from a year earlier and overall crime is up almost 52 according to police statistics many of the store thieves wear masks or hoods making them difficult to identify even when they re spotted on security cameras police in los angeles and san francisco have made some arrests but thieves often face few consequences eliadis said one reason for this is law enforcement s lack of resources which means theft cases sometimes are put on the back burner he said and he added the defund the police movement has sapped some officers morale there s no political will to prosecute the people in this climate why should a police officer waste time getting into an altercation when the person is not going to jail because it s overcrowded and a prosecutor is not going to prosecute that case because it s not high on the priority list eliadis said the takeaway is we need the political will more prosecution and backing of law enforcement thieves may face few consequences the decriminalization of low level offenses in some states has created opportunities for criminals to manipulate the system said lynda buel president of ohio based security consulting firm srmc for example proposition 47 a california ballot initiative passed in 2014 sought to alleviate prison overcrowding by reducing the penalties for some crimes the measure raised the threshold for felony theft from 500 to 950 for the low level criminal the benefit far outweighs the risk since the threshold for a misdemeanor offense is 950 meaning that a person can steal up to that amount and only be charged with a misdemeanor buel said organized crime rings are often behind these types of smash and grab operations and pay low level criminals to steal for them she said security experts said dismantling these sophisticated crime groups must be a law enforcement priority people see the ability to commit these smash and grab incidents knowing that there is little consequence especially if the thefts are kept below the threshold of a felony offense buel said it s easy it s fast and the payback is good the holidays provide more opportunities for theft it s not unusual for smash and grabs to increase around the christmas holiday season buel said stores stock up before the holidays which means there s a bounty of merchandise to pick from that means more opportunities and more convenience for the smash and grabbers she said but retail theft by organized gangs is not limited to the holiday season in july california gov gavin newsom signed a law reinstating a task force to investigate organized theft at stores this is not new in the state we ve been organized in a very deliberative manner to address the issue of organized retail crime for a number of years newsom said we are doubling down on those efforts today in illinois attorney general kwame raoul said in september that crime rings are costing retailers across the country an estimated 45 billion in annual losses he created a task force to crack down on organized crime rings that target stores these brazen violent crimes are committed by sophisticated criminal organizations that are involved in drug trafficking human trafficking and other serious crimes raoul said there are numerous places to sell stolen items once items are stolen there are several ways to sell them all extremely easy and with little regulation and monitoring from law enforcement experts said most items grabbed in such cases have no serial numbers making tracing them almost impossible eliadis said it is incredibly easy to sell stolen merchandise online through e commerce platforms buel said e commerce has really taken off as the place to sell stolen goods other thieves don t need to sell their stolen goods on craigslist or ebay they can also use flea markets pawn shops and street vendors thieves can sell expensive items at slashed prices meaning there s no shortage of buyers eliadis added the result is a ruthless cycle that affects everyone eliadis said some affected stores will shut down or relocate and retailers plagued by thefts see their insurance rates and private security costs increase costs that eventually get passed on the customer the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

joe biden s awkward ron burgundy moment is not as it seems president uses end of quote to clarify he was simply repeating walmart ceo s comments over supply chain issues president joe biden was compared to anchorman after edited clip went viral it made it appear as if biden had mistakenly read end of quote off teleprompter but a full length video shows the president was simply indicating he was quoting the gaffe prone president 79 has faced claims that he lacks mental capacity joe biden has been accused of a ron burgundy moment after saying end of quote during a speech but the full footage shows he was not mistakenly reading it from a teleprompter but was indicating that he was quoting somebody the deceptively edited clip of biden speaking on tuesday went viral in right wing circles making it appear as if the gaffe machine president read end of quote off his teleprompter by accident it drew instant comparisons to burgundy from the anchorman comedy who famously read out go f k yourself san diego when it appeared on the prompter but unedited video of his speech shows that the 79 year old was saying end of quote to simply ensure that his speech was correctly attributed biden said and by the way you may have heard the ceo of walmart yesterday on the steps we ve taken he said and i quote the combination of private enterprise and government working together has been really successful he went on to say all the way through the supply chain there s a lot of innovation because of the actions we ve taken things have begun to change end of quote the only mistake the president appears to make is that he should have said end of quote immediately after he finished quoting the ceo but he added in the line which begins because of the action we ve taken however that is a fairly minor mistake compared to what the edited clip makes out which suggests that biden is incoherent and adds to claims on the right that the elderly president is mentally impaired president joe biden was being compared to anchorman s ron burgundy known for reading the teleprompter verbatim when he said end of quote in a speech tuesday will ferrell s ron burgundy left was known for reading the teleprompter verbatim and famously uttered the near career ending phrase go f k yourself san diego when it was entered in the prompter during his speech on tuesday biden once again sought to speak to reassure americans who are focused on inflation or worried about the state of the economy referencing mothers and fathers who are asking will there be enough food we can afford to buy for the holidays will we be able to get christmas presents to the kids on time and if so will they cost me an arm and a leg he made sure to show he is in tune to concerns about gas prices including on the west coast where they face high taxes right now i will do what needs to be done to reduce the price you pay at the pump he said touting a new action to release 50 million gallons from a strategic petroleum reserve families can rest easy grocery stores are well stocked with turkey and everything else you need for thanksgiving he said he also spoke to supply chain issues mentioning meetings with walmart target home depot and other retailers he cited a 33 per cent drop in the time container ships were sitting on docks and said major retailers have confirmed that their shelves will be well stocked in stores this holiday season he called it good news for parents worried about whether everything from bicycles to ice skates will be available biden spoke for more than 11 minutes but once again did not take questions from white house reporters the white house took other steps to make reporters comfortable piping in jazz standards by dexter gordon and dave brubeck to an auditorium on the white house grounds while they awaited his remarks a changeable set constructed on stage featured rotating images of electric vehicles including the chevy volt biden declined to take questions following the event he reassured americans that thanksgiving food would be available on store shelves and that supply chain problems were improving when he concluded his remarks reporters shouted out questions about the tragedy in waukesha inflation and other topics steve portnoy of cbs radio who chairs the white house correspondents association yelled out when will you tell us what you discussed with xi jinping and other leaders when will you answer our questions sir biden held a three hour digital summit with the chinese president last week instead biden walked away from the press following reporters and videographers who were there for his remarks his press secretary jen psaki fielded questions later from the brady briefing room along with energy secretary jennifer granholm biden announced the largest ever release of oil from the u s strategic petroleum reserve with 50 million barrels as americans pay premium prices for a gallon of gas and republicans slam the move as just a band aid the bottom line today we re launching a major effort to moderate the price of oil biden said from the white house an effort that will span the globe and ultimately reach your corner gas station god willing you should see the price of gas drop where you fill up your time he assured and in the longer term we will reduce our reliance on oil as we shift to clean energy but right now i will do what needs to be done to reduce the price you pay at the pump the average price of a gallon of gas in the u s sits around 3 40 as of tuesday biden listed times when he was vice president when the prices were higher like in 2012 when it was at 3 90 per gallon and in 2014 when it was at 3 69 he also noted that the prices surpassed 3 00 in many places in 2019 when donald trump was president the fact is we always get through those spikes but we re going to get through this one as well and hopefully faster he said but it doesn t mean we should stand by idly and wait for prices to drop on their own instead we re taking action but republican lawmakers say that this measure is only a short term fix that will not help decrease prices at the pump in the long run instead they are urging the president to tap ramp up u s production of natural resources his actions on the strategic petroleum reserve are meant to lower soaring prices americans are paying at the pumps biden is working with india south korea china and japan to tap from their resources after opec nations in the middle east rebuffed his pleas to pump more oil it is a dramatic move that hasn t been used since the aftermath of hurricane katrina experts believe it is just a short term fix to the soaring costs and republicans said biden was trying to desperately fix an emergency he has created even democratic senator joe manchin chairman of the energy and natural resources committee slammed the move as a band aid for rising gas prices but does not solve for the self inflicted wound that shortsighted energy policy is having on our nation biden is taking oil from the reserve which has 604 5 million total barrels across four sites in louisiana and texas with gas prices at a seven year high inflation hitting historic records and america facing a winter heating crisis oil prices rose towards 81 a barrel on tuesday morning after the announcement to try to and cool the market falling short of some expectations americans will likely not see a change in prices at the pump for at least another two weeks presidents typically tap oil reserves when emergencies or natural disasters disrupt the supply chain although more recently have even tapped them to keep prices in check from time to time the last time that the oil reserve was tapped in the u s was as oil prices surged in the aftermath of hurricane katrina at the time then president george bush ordered 30 million barrels be released the average price of gasoline recently breached a seven year high and now costs 3 409 per gallon according to aaa in california residents have reported paying up to 4 84 a gallon the consumer price index is up 6 2 per cent over last year and rose 0 9 per cent in october alone tanking public trust in the president following a presidential announcement for the release of oil it usually takes 13 days to hit the market according to the energy department experts have predicted it could take two weeks for the prices to start dropping but have also warned it is not a long term solution because it doesn t solve supply and demand problems in the aftermath of the pandemic biden will formally announce the move to release reserve oil in a speech on tuesday afternoon aimed at addressing the economy and lowering prices later tuesday evening the president and first lady will leave washington d c to spend thanksgiving with family in nantucket massachusetts president biden is authorizing the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve in a bid to lower soaring prices americans are paying at the pumps the white house announced on tuesday the average price of gasoline recently breached a seven year high and now costs 3 409 per gallon according to aaa in california residents have reported paying up to 4 84 a gallon prices for a gallon of gas are highest in west coast states and in the north east according to aaa they are lowest in south central states like florida louisiana and mississippi where prices range from 2 97 3 15 american consumers are feeling the impact of elevated gas prices at the pump and in their home heating bills and american businesses are too because oil supply has not kept up with demand as the global economy emerges from the pandemic the white house said in a statement released friday morning that s why president biden is using every tool available to him to work to lower prices and address the lack of supply today the president is announcing that the department of energy will make available releases of 50 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to lower prices for americans and address the mismatch between demand exiting the pandemic and supply eighteen million barrels will be part of an accelerated release from previous sales and 32 million will be released as an exchange to be replenished at a later date the white house said biden has already faced a lot of criticism over revoking a key permit upon taking office in january that suspended construction of the keystone xl pipeline his administration has also threatened to close the michigan five pipeline republicans immediately weighed in on the announcement of tapping the reserve claiming this emergency measure should be taken during war time former president donald trump called it an attack on the oil reserve for decades our country s very important strategic oil reserves were low or virtually empty in that no president wanted to pay the price of filling them up i filled them up three years ago right to the top when oil prices were very low trump praised his administration in a statement tuesday morning those reserves are meant to be used for serious emergencies like war and nothing else he wrote now i understand that joe biden will be announcing an attack on the newly brimming strategic oil reserves so that he could get the close to record setting high oil prices artificially lowered we were energy independent one year ago now we are at the mercy of opec gasoline is selling for 7 in parts of california going up all over the country and they are taking oil from our strategic reserves is this any way to run a country it appears trump s claim that he helped add to the reserve during his time as president is not true according to the u s energy information administration the national strategic petroleum reserve stockpile went from 695 million barrels in january 2017 to 638 million in january 2021 the same timeline trump entered and left office the move by biden and other leaders may just be pushing the supply issue down the timeline expert reacts to oil release louise dickson senior oil markets analyst rystad energy consultants today marks an official emergence of an anti opec a group of top oil consuming countries that are taking the supply side dynamics into their own hands in the unconventional and unprecedented release of strategic petroleum reserves to create artificial looseness in the oil market and deliver a negative blow to oil prices the orchestrated supply side via sprs is a last ditch effort after the us was unsuccessful an influencing opec to release supply an ongoing call since august t he supply side support is intended to quell oil prices and keep pandemic gdp recovery on track especially amid the backdrop of an increasingly inflationary macro environment the coordinated effort is by the us which has pledged 50 million barrels of supply and joined by other major consumers china india japan korea and the uk the white house didn t provide a chartered schedule for the release but some of the barrels will be hitting the market as early as december much of the downward price impact has already been priced into the futures curve over the past week since china announced it was ready to cooperate following the xi biden summit the sale of the reserves should more be viewed as swap as these strategic reserves will need to be replenished at some point meaning a demand uptick in the future however with a flatter price structure ahead these countries will have the arbitrage advantage of restocking reserves at a price band much lower than 80 per barrel brent today s historic but very unorthodox move is a clear message to opec that it s not the only actor on the global oil market stage the coordinated effort represents the formation of an unofficial demand side alliance that keeps opec in check if it fires up prices to a level seen as unsatisfactory to spur economic growth and keep consumer purchasing power in check the threat of more supply in the short term certainly creates an artificially looser oil market for the next 1 2 month period however the move by biden and other leaders may just be pushing the supply issue down the timeline as emptying out storage will put even further strain on already low oil stockpiles and as these countries will eventually have to go on a buying spree to refill the strategic reserves the white house announcement referenced a release of barrels of oil so for now we assume this refers to crude stocks and not any refined products such as gasoline or diesel while the majority of us reserves are held in crude stockpiles the participating asian economies may decide to tap into more gasoline and diesel stocks which would provide more immediate relief to the products market to the consumer pain and to the inflated pump prices in the us especially with the traditionally high demand during the thanksgiving holiday that is coming up it is unlikely the price relief will be passed down to consumers in the near short term unless the biden administration prioritizes the release of gasoline stocks the tug of war between producers for higher prices and consumers for lower prices can only lead to a very volatile price environment in 2022 advertisement senator cindy hyde smith of mississippi tweeted tapping the strategic petroleum reserve which is meant for emergencies is a short sighted inadequate action to address biden caused record spikes at gas pumps to truly help our nation the whitehouse needs to reverse the policies that put our energy security at risk she urged arkansas senator john boozman and louisiana senator bill cassidy shared that stance instead of begging opec to increase production or tapping into our strategic petroleum reserves we should be increasing our domestic energy production boozman tweeted tuesday americans are paying more for gas and heating fuel up to 30 higher this winter it will be a colder thanksgiving for too many cassidy wrote the best way to lower gas prices is to continually invest in the u s energy industry so we don t have to import energy from other countries when there is a supply shortage americans need long term solutions to skyrocketing gas prices not a band aid fix senator lindsey graham tweeted the democratic brand is suffering from the reality of a biden presidency and a democrat controlled congress when people hear democrat people think of high gas prices empty shelves broken borders and the heartbreak of afghanistan the south carolina republican added in his criticism of the biden administration a group of 33 house republicans sent a letter to biden and energy secretary jennifer granholm proposing an alternative strategy of increasing the country s oil production rather than tap the emergency reserves there is no reason to use our country s safety net to bail out president biden s failed policies and poor planning the letter reads rather it would be in our best interest to reopen oil and gas production on federal lands which would equate to a 20 increase in our domestic oil production if we were to withdraw reserves from the spr that are currently priced at 29 per barrel and forced to replace them at a cost of over 80 per barrel and growing we would be creating another economic nightmare for taxpayers they explained the letter continued higher gas prices hurt the american public encouraging domestic oil and gas production helps to create american jobs energy independence from russia and the middle east and cheaper visits to the pump resorting to withdrawals from the spr only postpones reality and creates larger economic concerns for the future at a time when we will undoubtably have harsh winter storms and hurricanes along with an uncertain global geopolitical environment future withdrawals from the spr may be urgently needed we must ensure the spr is fully stocked and able to protect americans the way it was intended to they pleaded gop representative bob gibbs spokesperson told dailymail com the president s decision to tap into the strategic petroleum reserve is just a band aid on a gaping wound caused by his anti energy policies that are killing domestic energy production long term price stability can only be guaranteed by a stable and affordable domestic energy supply they continued it s reprehensible that the biden administration has killed thousands of american energy jobs but goes hat in hand to nations that include adversaries and begs them to increase production asking pretty please is not a responsible energy policy we wouldn t have to tap our emergency reserves or beg opec if president biden hadn t allied himself with socialist anti energy activists georgia representative buddy carter tweeted on monday biden is slapping a bandaid on our energy crisis we need policy changes not a few extra barrels of oil to hold us over rystad energy an independent energy research and business intelligence

over the past week since china announced it was ready to cooperate following the xi biden summit former president donald trump called the measure an attack on the oil reserve and claimed that he helped grow the strategic petroleum reserve when he was president despite the crude oil amount decreasing from january 2017 to january 2021 inflation is at its highest in 30 years one of the factors leading to a massive decrease in approval for joe biden on the other hand democrats said their calls for biden to tap the reserve were answered tuesday senate majority leader chuck schumer called it good news for families i called for this to provide relief at the pump and signal to opec they can t manipulate supply to inflate gas prices the new york democrat continued on twitter of course the only long term solution is to keep working to eliminate fossil fuel dependence and create a robust green energy economy the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its allies are scheduled to meet dec 2 and are eyeing plans to increase oil production by a mere 400 000 barrels per day in january but opec officials warned in turn they would respond if the world s largest oil consumers tapped their reserves setting up a fight for control of the global oil market opec officials have said they may reconsider plans to add production at their meeting next week according to al jazeera the standoff demonstrates a fraught relationship between washington and riyadh saudi arabia traditionally a strong trade ally of the us biden has repeatedly pointed to opec and russia for price hikes and even called on the federal trade commission to investigate for price gouging as he tries to find a culprit for the inflation that is beguiling his administration if you take a look at gas prices and you take a look at oil prices that s a consequence of thus far the refusal of russia or the opec nations to pump more oil he said opec in april 2020 cut output by more than 10 million barrels a day the group has about 3 8 million bpd in supply cuts that it has not yet returned to the market but another reason prices have surged is that the us cut production of oil by three million barrels in the summer of 2020 as the pandemic crushed demand advertisement and as biden begs other nations to pump more oil he has taken a number of steps to curb oil and gas production within the us pausing new

his son on election day in november biden introduced a crowd to his granddaughter but referred to her as his son during an election day speech in philadelphia biden stumbled over his words and confused his granddaughter with his late son beau biden biden told the crowd i want to introduce you to two of my granddaughters this is my son beau biden who a lot of you helped elect to the senate

before realizing he was in a wheelchair not all of biden s gaffes occurred in the 2020s or even the 2010s in fact some happened in the early aughts in september 2008 after biden had been named former president barack obama s running mate he attended a campaign rally in missouri it was there that he called on then missouri state senator chuck graham who passed away last year to stand up for the crowd i m told chuck graham state senator is here stand up chuck let em see you biden said it was at that moment he realized graham was in a wheelchair due to muscular dystrophy oh god love you what am i talking about i ll tell you what you re making everybody else stand up though pal according to the columbia tribune graham said he was never offended by the mistake advertisement
the delaware supreme court recently decided that an agreement sometimes referred to as a drag along to waive prospectively statutory appraisal rights is fully enforceable against the common stockholders who made such agreement in the circumstances described below in doing so the court in manti holdings llc et al v authentix acquisition company inc manti rejected the petitioners claim that an advance waiver of appraisal rights by common stockholders is per se against public policy and unenforceable as a matter of the delaware general corporation law dgcl to the contrary the court held that the dgcl does not prohibit sophisticated and informed stockholders who were represented by counsel and had bargaining power from voluntarily agreeing to waive their appraisal rights in exchange for valuable consideration therefore the advance waiver of appraisal rights by these common stockholders made at the time they entered into a stockholders agreement subsequently barred them years later from exercising appraisal rights with respect to the sale of their company via a merger while it may seem surprising given the prevalence of drag along rights this decision marked the first time that the delaware judiciary has directly addressed the enforceability of an advance waiver of appraisal against common stockholders based on its facts the manti decision provides welcomed confirmation from the highest delaware court of practices that the venture capital world has relied on for years below is some background information and a summary of this important decision for private companies and the venture capital investors who fund them statutory appraisal rights of the dgcl appraisal rights sometimes called dissenters rights in other jurisdictions are a feature of the corporation law of the state in which a company is incorporated in general these statutory appraisal rights entitle a stockholder who has not voted in favor of a specified sale of the company to forgo the price being paid by the acquirer and instead seek a post closing judicial determination of the fair value of his or her shares if certain procedural conditions are met such a judicially determined value can be greater equal or lesser than the acquirer s price and the appraisal rights petitioner is required to accept the outcome i e no optionality to take the acquirer s price if the judicially determined value turns out to be lower section 262 of the dgcl provides appraisal rights with respect to the sale of a delaware corporation that is structured as a merger where the approval of the target corporation s stockholders is required under the dgcl and the merger consideration is cash or stock unless the market out exception applies the purpose of these appraisal rights is to protect minority stockholders who do not vote in favor of a merger from being squeezed out by the controlling stockholders for an unfair value often when a private company is sold to a third party it is structured as a merger thereby triggering appraisal rights mergers are common because as a practical matter they best enable the board of directors of the company and its controlling stockholders who are usually represented on the board of directors to control the negotiations with the third party and obtain the requisite stockholder approval of the transaction subject to applicable fiduciary duties without the complications of involving minority stockholders until after the deal is signed and closed an alternative would be using a stock purchase agreement which would avoid triggering appraisal rights however such an approach would require 100 of the target stockholders to participate which often is impracticable if there are a large number of stockholders for these and other reasons beyond the scope of this article such as tax private company sale transactions often are mergers triggering statutory appraisal right under section 262 of dgcl as described above drag along rights and facilitating venture investment in private companies even when contemplating its initial investment in a company a venture capital investor will always be mindful of its strategy for exiting the investment in the future hopefully at a profit conditioning any new investment in a company on the stockholders of such company signing an agreement containing a drag along right helps to facilitate such an exit drag along rights obligate stockholders to agree upfront to a future sale of the company if approved by the board of directors and the controlling stockholder s at the time and if other conditions are satisfied thereby preventing the minority stockholders from obstructing such a sale even when the minority stockholders would receive no merger consideration pursuant to the waterfall provision in the company s certificate of incorporation in essence drag along rights give the controlling holder s the power to decide when to exit an investment and on what terms without having this control venture investors might be reluctant to make new investments which would be detrimental to private companies seeking capital and their existing stockholders specifically in the event of a sale of the company drag along rights require stockholders i in the case of a stock purchase agreement to sell their shares to the third party in the same proportion and on the same terms as the controlling stockholders ii in the case of a merger to vote for the merger thereby making them ineligible to pursue appraisal rights under section 262 and iii to refrain from exercising any applicable appraisal rights the latter is an express waiver of appraisal rights while it may seem superfluous given that clause ii would have the same effect the express waiver in clause iii is needed because as a practical matter many private companies approve mergers by the written consent of their controlling stockholders only assuming they represent the requisite approval under the dgcl and the certificate of incorporation therefore minority holders often do not actually cast the favorable votes for the merger that would be necessary to disqualify them from exercising appraisal rights with respect to such a merger instead the minority holders often hear about the merger in a section 228 notice sent after the merger is approved and closed this express waiver of appraisal rights creates greater certainty for the acquirer that it will not be subject to post closing liability from appraisal claims no matter the mechanics of how the target company obtained approval for the merger for a fuller discussion of drag along rights including the advance waiver of appraisal rights see section 3 of the nvca model voting agreement updated july 2020 at this link the manti case the petitioners in manti were minority common stockholders at the time their private company authentix was sold in 2017 to an unaffiliated third party in an all cash merger approved by authentix s board of directors and its controlling stockholders including private equity investor carlyle group carlyle as common stockholders the petitioners were entitled to receive essentially no merger consideration from this deal as explained below this outcome motivated the petitioners to seek appraisal rights but an understanding of earlier events and facts is critical about 10 years earlier the petitioners had been the majority holders of authentix as a condition of carlyle acquiring authentix in 2007 and enabling the petitioners to roll over their equity as minority common stockholders carlyle required all stockholders to enter into a stockholders agreement containing the following drag along rights n the event that a company sale is approved by the board and the carlyle majority each other holder shall consent to and raise no objections against such transaction and refrain from the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to such transaction in the negotiation of the carlyle acquisition of authentix including this stockholders agreement each of the petitioners authentix and carlyle were represented by their own counsel had bargaining power and received valuable consideration in exchange for entering in the transaction agreements as the court put it the stockholders agreement was not a contract of adhesion fast forward back to 2017 the exit transaction was approved only by the then controlling stockholders of authentix including carlyle via written consent as minority holders at such time the petitioners did not receive advance notice of the merger and were not given an opportunity to vote on the transaction shortly after the merger closed the petitioners received notice of the closing and the cancellation of their shares of common stock and conversion thereof into a right to receive merger consideration based on the liquidation preference provision in authentix s certificate of incorporation which gave priority to preferred stockholders there would be little to no merger consideration available to distribute to the petitioners and any other fellow common stockholders despite the drag along rights above the petitioners attempted to exercise appraisal rights authentix now under new ownership moved to dismiss such actions citing the above drag along rights as constituting a valid advance waiver of statutory appraisal rights which authentix was entitled to enforce against the petitioners as contractual obligations the lower court agreed with authentix the petitioners subsequently appealed to the delaware supreme court on appeal the delaware supreme court upheld the enforceability of the advance waiver of appraisal rights in the drag along stating that the dgcl does not prohibit sophisticated and informed stockholders who were represented by counsel and had bargaining power from voluntarily agreeing to waive their appraisal rights in exchange for valuable consideration in rejecting the petitioners argument that appraisal rights are a mandatory feature of the dgcl and are so fundamental to the identity of a corporation that they cannot be contractually waived especially in advance of a transaction the court said t its core the dgcl is a broad enabling act that allows immense freedom for businesses to adopt the most appropriate terms for the organization finance and governance of their enterprise and noted that a public policy favoring private ordering is evident throughout the dgcl the court further stated that as a matter of public policy there are certain fundamental features of a corporation that are essential to that entity s identity and cannot be waived nonetheless it is the court s view that the individual right of a stockholder to seek judicial appraisal is not among those fundamental features that cannot be waived the court also affirmed that an advance waiver of appraisal rights can appropriately be contained in a stockholders agreement and does not need to be included in the company s certificate of incorporation pursuant to section 151 a of the dgcl noting that it is a personal obligation and not an encumbrance of the property rights that runs with the stock in reaching the foregoing conclusions it is evident that the court was strongly influenced by the sophistication of the petitioners and the fact that authentix was enforcing the waiver of appraisal rights against the very persons who used their bargaining power to negotiate for funding from carlyle in exchange for waiving their appraisals rights not any transferees or successors different facts might have resulted in a different outcome with respect to enforceability in a rare occurrence for the delaware supreme court there was a dissenting opinion justice karen valihura disagreed with the majority opinion for three main reasons first justice valihura viewed the terms of the waiver of appraisal rights as ambiguous in several regards including whether the waiver survived the stockholders agreement which terminated upon the closing of the sale of the authentix second she views appraisal rights as so fundamental to the identity of the corporate entity that as a categorical matter they cannot be waived third if the legislature in delaware were to permit such a waiver justice valihura believes that such waiver would need to be included in the certificate of incorporation regardless of the views expressed in this dissenting opinion the current state of the law in delaware on this topic is as described above in the majority opinion conclusion for years private companies and venture capital investors have used drag along provisions containing an advance waiver of appraisal rights this feature has been an important element in the private equity financing world helping to facilitate investment in private companies from a legal perspective it has typically been assumed to be non controversial but untested judicially until now the manti decision provides welcomed confirmation of this practice subject to the facts and circumstances of that case endnotes 1 manti holdings llc v authentix acquisition co inc no 354 2020 2021 wl 4165159 del sept 13 2021 2 the delaware court of chancery has previously upheld the enforceability of an advance waiver of appraisal rights against preferred stockholders noting the essentially contractual nature of preferred stock see in re appraisal of ford holdings inc preferred stock 698 a 2d 973 del ch 1997 the only delaware case addressing the enforceability of an advance waiver of appraisal rights against common stockholders was decided on procedural grounds it was determined that the particular drag along rights were not properly invoked in the first instance so the substantive question of whether the waiver of appraisal rights would be enforceable as a matter of the dgcl was not directly addressed see halpin v riverstone nat l inc c a no 9796 vcg del ch feb 26 2015 glasscock v c 3 manti 2021 at 11 4 id at 3 5 id at 25 6 in this regard the court stated he was not a midstream amendment that was forced upon the petitioners without their express consent id at 36 37 it also stated the following with respect to the assignment and successors provision in the stockholders agreement and while the clause purporting to bind successors assigns and transferees may be unenforceable the stockholders agreement has a severability clause and authentix is not attempting to enforce the against any stockholders that did not sign the stockholders agreement in exchange for consideration id at 26 7 the dissenting opinion cited approvingly the savings clause language in section 6 of the nvca model voting agreement as a way of clarifying the survival of the waiver obligation co authored by brendan j chaisson
price inflation is affecting everything from entertainment and electronics to things like food and clothing according to reader s digest a shortage of shipping containers a labor crisis shortages of raw materials and even climate change are to blame for this you may have heard of the microchip shortage when the pandemic first began factories that manufacture microchips for electronics and vehicles shut down while orders continued to come in these factories are still playing catch up and struggling to meet demand gas prices rose 42 7 in the last year the pandemic shutting things down for a while and the resurgent demand for oil after lockdowns cop producers off guard and they raised prices to compensate for low supply clothing prices rose 4 2 in august this is due in part to former president trump s trade policies with china making the price of cotton rise according to npr airfare and hotel prices are on the rise as more americans are encouraged to get vaccinated and we ll start traveling again advertisement president biden aims to do what presidents often can t beat inflation share copy link copy lbj tried jawboning richard nixon issued a presidential edict the ford administration printed buttons exhorting americans to whip inflation now over the years american presidents have tried and mostly floundered in their efforts to quell the economic and political menace of consumer inflation now president joe biden is giving it a shot confronting a spike in gasoline and other consumer prices that s bedeviling american households biden on tuesday ordered the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the u s strategic petroleum reserve the move done in coordination with several other major nations is intended to contain energy costs oil markets having anticipated the move were unimpressed with the details oil prices actually rose on the news it was just the latest step biden has taken to show he is doing everything he can to combat inflation as gasoline and food prices in particular have imposed a growing burden on american households on monday he announced that he would reappoint jerome powell as chair of the federal reserve a move meant in part to reassure financial markets that washington is serious about containing consumer prices last month he announced a deal to ease supply backlogs at the port of los angeles by extending operations there to 24 hours a day seven days a week yet none of the president s actions is considered likely to make a meaningful dent in surging prices anytime soon i don t think the president has many levers to pull to bring down the rate of inflation any time soon said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the things he is doing are positive and there s no downside to them but they are on the margins they re not going to move the dial very much inflation is always a tough foe made even more complicated by the unusual recovery from the pandemic recession with shortages of supplies and workers and shipping bottlenecks forcing up prices what is happening to consumer prices the government s consumer price index skyrocketed 6 2 in the 12 months that ended in october the sharpest such jump since 1990 coming after nearly four decades of more or less stable prices the cpi news represents a once in a generation uptick in inflation said sarah binder a george washington university political scientist who studies the fed the problem is pretty stark because it s something that voters notice it s hard to escape the impact of a spike in inflation on your daily life whether it s buying milk or buying gas the average price of regular gasoline has shot up to 3 40 a gallon from 2 11 a year ago according to aaa compounding the pain and heightening the pressure on biden inflation has been outpacing americans income adjusted for price increases average hourly wages were actually down 1 2 last month compared with a year earlier inflation is painful and it s always political said diane swonk chief economist at the accounting and consulting firm grant thornton what s behind the price spike it s partly the consequence of very good news the world economy and america s in particular rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from last year s brief but intense recession it was a result of super low interest rates massive government spending and eventually the broad rollout of vaccines that allowed more of the economy to reopen the swiftness of the rebound caught businesses off guard a year and a half ago they were bracing for the worst laying off workers letting shelves and warehouses go bare reducing investment and factory output and energy companies did the same they cut production of oil and gas as demand for transportation fuels plummeted once demand came roaring back they were unprepared they found themselves scrambling to call back workers and buy enough to fill customer orders ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic countries competed over boatloads of overpriced liquid natural gas periodic covid 19 outbreaks shut down asian ports and factories global supply chains broke down as costs rose many businesses found that they could pass the burden along to consumers in the form of higher prices in the meantime many families had banked their government relief checks and built up their savings some critics also blamed biden s 1 9 trillion emergency aid package for overheating the economy and contributing to inflation pressures economists are divided over how long the inflation spike will last gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial predicts that inflationary pressures will ease as supply chains sort themselves out i expect to see inflation slow in 2022 he said what can presidents do the white house has limited tools for reversing higher prices that task belongs more to the fed which can raise borrowing costs to cool a sizzling economy during the 1960s and 1970s though presidents increasingly felt pressure to do something about inflation because it had become a serious political threat president lyndon johnson tried to persuade companies to forgo price increases and labor unions to limit wage demands a practice known as jawboning when bethlehem steel raised steel prices in 1965 johnson criticized its executives as unpatriotic and they backed down according to robert samuelson s book the great inflation and its aftermath when egg prices rose in 1966 johnson ordered america s surgeon general to highlight the health hazards of cholesterol in eggs with the intent of lowering egg sales and therefore prices nixon imposed wage and price controls in 1971 and 1973 which briefly stifled inflation only to see prices soar once the controls were lifted gerald ford s whip inflation now program encouraged americans to grow their own vegetables reduce their food waste and consume less americans responded mostly by mocking the program some wore the president s win buttons upside down explaining that the resulting nim stood for no immediate miracles what has biden done biden last week signed into a law a 1 trillion public works program which pours money into fixing roads bridges and ports potentially easing the supply chain backlogs that have contributed to rising prices untangling shipping bottlenecks would be doubly helpful it would ease inflationary pressures and boost the economy by increasing the flow of goods to customers last week biden sent a letter to the federal trade commission asking the ftc chair to consider investigating whether higher gasoline prices were the result of illegal conduct the white house is also stepping up anti trust enforcement of the meatpacking industry seeking to increase competition and drive down meat prices his decision to re nominate powell to lead the fed was meant in part to reassure the financial markets of washington s resolve to prevent consumer prices from spiraling out of his control the other likely contender for the job lael brainard a member of the fed s board of governors was perceived as less hawkish toward inflation why did biden tap the strategic petroleum reserve tuesday the idea was that by putting more oil on the market prices would fall that hasn t happened but depending on what happens in the rest of the world there s still a chance it could work america s petroleum reserve holds about 605 million barrels of oil in underground caves in texas and louisiana it was designed in the 1970s in response to the arab oil embargo to store oil in case there was a supply disruption or emergency but the dynamics of the global oil industry changed dramatically in recent years and now the u s exports more oil than it imports the 50 million barrels that biden promised to release will likely be sold slowly at a rate of about 1 million barrels per day meaning that the new influx of oil could last about two months adding even a small amount of oil to the market can tip it into surplus and potentially lower the price said jim burkhard of ihs markit the immediate price reaction is not the final judgment on the effectiveness of this of the effort he added it will really be in the months ahead ___ ap economics writer martin crutsinger contributed to this report

regulatory gaps the report notes that stablecoin arrangements are not subject to a consistent set of prudential regulatory standards that address the risks highlighted above and the number of different key parties coupled with the operational complexity of these arrangements pose challenges for supervisory oversight for example even if an issuer of stablecoins is a bank insight into the activities of key entities in the arrangement depends on the structure of the relationship and the nature of the services if any provided to the issuer bank as client report recommendations to address these risks the report recommends that congress act promptly to enact legislation to ensure that payment stablecoins are subject to a federal prudential framework on a consistent and comprehensive basis the report s recommendations include the following legislation legislation should require stablecoin issuers to be insured depository institutions which are subject to appropriate supervision and regulation at the depository institution and the holding company level to guard against stablecoin runs legislation should address concerns about payment system risk and require custodial wallet providers to be subject to appropriate federal oversight as well as provide the federal supervisor of a stablecoin issuer with the authority to require any entity that performs activities critical to the functioning of the stablecoin arrangement to meet appropriate risk management standards legislation should address systemic risk and economic concentration of power and require stablecoin issuers to comply with activities restrictions that limit affiliation with commercial entities a glass steagall like rule supervisors should have authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins other measures recommended in the report in the absence of legislation that addresses the risks associated with payment stablecoin arrangements the agencies forming the pwg intend to continue to use their existing authorities to address these prudential risks to the extent possible including banking agencies will seek to ensure that applicants address the risks outlined by the report including risks associated with stablecoin issuance and other related services conducted by the banking organization or third party service providers the financial stability oversight council should take steps to address the risks outlined in the report such as designating certain activities conducted within a stablecoin arrangement as or as likely to become systemically important payment clearing and settlement activities such designation would permit the appropriate agency to establish risk management standards for financial institutions that engage in designated activities including requirements in relation to the assets backing the stablecoin requirements related to the operation of the stablecoin arrangement and other prudential standards the doj sec and cftc will consider the application of federal securities laws and or the commodity exchange act 7 u s c 1 to stablecoin arrangements in the context of those stablecoins that are securities commodities and or derivatives the doj may consider whether or how section 21 a 2 of the glass steagall act 12 u s c 378 a 2 which generally prohibits dealers in securities as well as individuals or associations from engaging in banking business may apply to certain stablecoin arrangements the u s department of the treasury s financial crimes enforcement network fincen may consider the application of federal anti money laundering combating the financing of terrorism obligations under the bank secrecy act bsa 12 u s c 1724 12 u s c 1813 15 u s c 78a to stablecoin arrangements that also offer money transmission services conclusion while the scope of the report is limited to stablecoins u s financial regulatory agencies and congress continue their study of digital assets and other innovations related to cryptographic and distributed ledger technology the biden administration and the u s financial regulatory agencies have stated that they will continue to collaborate closely on ways to foster responsible financial innovation promote consistent regulatory approaches and identify and address potential risks that arise from such innovation however debate continues throughout industry and the financial regulatory regime as to what level of oversight and regulation may be appropriate on nov 17 2021 at a conference held by the federal reserve bank of cleveland and the office of financial research federal reserve governor christopher waller warned against excessive regulation of stablecoins noting that regulatory oversight can insulate banks from some forms of direct competition and limit free entry into at least some of the markets in which banks operate congress and regulators will need to balance the need for oversight with the risk of stifling innovation and driving business

million barrels of oil in underground caves in texas and louisiana it was designed in the 1970s in response to the arab oil embargo to store oil in case there was a supply disruption or emergency but the dynamics of the global oil industry changed dramatically in recent years and now the u s exports more oil than it imports the 50 million barrels that biden promised to release will likely be sold slowly at a rate of about 1 million barrels per day meaning that the new influx of oil could last about two months adding even a small amount of oil to the market can tip it into surplus and potentially lower the price said jim burkhard of ihs markit the immediate price reaction is not the final judgment on the effectiveness of this of the effort he added it will really be in the months

or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story salt lake city utah is drying up no this isn t about the drought global supply chain shortages are hurting liquor companies which is in turn starting to impact state owned liquor stores bars hotels and restaurants across utah some shortages have existed for months but the state agency charged with selling alcohol is gearing up for its biggest test yet with the arrival of the holiday season this week is the busiest beverage holiday in the united states whether it s alcohol beverages or nonalcoholic beverages said tiffany clason the executive director of the utah department of alcoholic beverage control this holiday season will be particularly interesting for the dabc with product shortages already happening clason says the department is feeling the crunch that almost every other industry in the world is experiencing at the moment it s actually something the department anticipated based on shortages emerging in various industries dabc s preparation began several months ago with the end of the year thanksgiving christmas and new year s are all major holidays for dabc sales in mind we ve been planning and preparing for this as far back as this spring anticipating this really busy time of the year clason said to counter this supply issue the department held back on selling some items so they didn t run out immediately just in case they didn t get another shipment from the manufacturer in the future she said they also began to stock up on alternate inventory building up the supply of items similar to the desired products in short supply think of it as stocking up on other brands of cola because coca cola or pepsi is in short supply utah department of alcoholic beverage control also formed a list so customers including the state s bars and restaurants know what is in short supply those are products that the department has decided to ration at the moment patron tequila is at the top of the list that isn t really a surprise the demand for agave used in the production of the adult beverage has far exceeded the production of the plant national news outlets have talked about this shortage for years but agave became even more scarce in 2021 modelo negra beer brown glass shortage and moet champagne multiple supply chain issues are other examples of items currently in short supply dabc responded to this issue by placing purchase limits for items on the list for instance a customer can only buy one bottle a day for every item being rationed a business licensed to sell liquor in utah can buy two that of course depends if the item is even in stock this is a great opportunity to shop local we have great products out there that are made locally tiffany clason executive director of the utah department of alcoholic beverage control clason explained the department decided to give bars and restaurants an additional bottle because of the business implications the dabc warned the businesses earlier this year about the supply shortages and asked them to either plan their menus accordingly or build up their stock we re really working hard to work with those small business owners bars restaurants and hotels so if they do have an emergency of sorts we can best understand that and help them problem solve she said while we know it doesn t sound like much giving them just one extra bottle per order we do think it helps and it s just a good thing that we can try to do to mitigate the problem with the holidays now here the dabc is asking its customers to make decisions with the shortages in mind that includes shopping early and compromising with the size of the bottle of the product on the shelves among items that aren t being rationed there is another option that goes in hand with dabc s plan of stocking up on different brands of alcohol that clason views as a big win for utah s businesses this is a great opportunity to shop local she adds we have great products out there that are made locally so this is a great opportunity to try something new to support a local manufacturer and i think most people would be pleasantly surprised all of this plays into state revenues because again the dabc is a state agency liquor sales brought in 500 million in state revenue during the 2020 fiscal year resulting in about 210 million going back to the state treasury and over 120 million going toward the state s general fund according to the agency s most recent annual report the agency reported 517 million in revenue in the 2021 fiscal year with 184 1 million going toward provided to the state of utah to fund various services including public safety education transportation and infrastructure another 30 6 million in sales taxes was split up between local municipalities where stores are located the utah governor s office reported earlier this month that the state ended up with a 614 million budget surplus altogether dabc officials said it s too early to know if any of the supply shortages will impact sales at all during the current 2022 fiscal year which began in july clason however contends that the strategies imposed to counter supply shortages have utah well positioned for the near future contributing lindsay aerts

ohio counties a federal jury said tuesday in a verdict that could set the tone for u s city and county governments that want to hold pharmacies accountable for their roles in the opioid crisis lake and trumbull counties blamed the three chain pharmacies for not stopping the flood of pills that caused hundreds of overdose deaths and cost each of the two counties about 1 billion their attorney said how much the pharmacies must pay in damages will be decided in the spring by a federal judge it was the first time pharmacy companies had completed a trial to defend themselves in a drug crisis that has killed a half million americans over the past two decades the counties were able to convince the jury that the pharmacies played an outsized role in creating a public nuisance in the way they dispensed pain medication into their communities the law requires pharmacies to be diligent in dealing drugs this case should be a wake up call that failure will not be accepted said mark lanier an attorney for the counties the jury sounded a bell that should be heard through all pharmacies in america lanier said attorneys for the three pharmacy chains maintained they had policies to stem the flow of pills when their pharmacists had any concerns and would notify authorities about suspicious orders from doctors they also said it was the doctors who controlled how many pills were being prescribed for legitimate medical needs a car enters trumbull county wednesday in this photo from nov 17 2021 near warren ohio three retail pharmacy chains recklessly distributed massive amounts of pain pills in two ohio counties a federal jury said tuesday nov 23 2021 in a verdict that could set the tone for u s city and county governments that want to hold pharmacies accountable for their roles in the opioid crisis photo tony dejak associated press spokespeople for cvs health and walgreen said the companies disagree with the verdict and will appeal as plaintiffs own experts testified many factors have contributed to the opioid abuse issue and solving this problem will require involvement from all stakeholders in our health care system and all members of our community cvs spokesman mike deangelis said in a statement walgreen spokesman fraser engerman said the company believes the court erred in allowing the case to go before a jury on a flawed legal theory that is inconsistent with ohio law as we have said throughout this process we never manufactured or marketed opioids nor did we distribute them to the pill mills and internet pharmacies that fueled this crisis engerman said in a statement the plaintiffs attempt to resolve the opioid crisis with an unprecedented expansion of public nuisance law is misguided and unsustainable two other chains rite aid and giant eagle already had settled lawsuits with the two ohio counties lanier said during the trial that the pharmacies were attempting to blame everyone but themselves the jury sounded a bell that should be heard through all pharmacies in america mark lanier attorney for two ohio counties the opioid crisis has overwhelmed courts social services agencies and law enforcement in ohio s blue collar corner east of cleveland leaving behind heartbroken families and babies born to addicted mothers lanier told jurors roughly 80 million prescription painkillers were dispensed in trumbull county alone between 2012 and 2016 equivalent to 400 for every resident in lake county some 61 million pills were distributed during that period the rise in physicians prescribing pain medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone came at a time when medical groups began recognizing that patients have the right to be treated for pain kaspar stoffelmayr an attorney for walgreens said at the opening of the trial the problem he said was that pharmaceutical manufacturers tricked doctors into writing way too many pills the counties said pharmacies should be the last line of defense to prevent the pills from getting into the wrong hands they didn t hire enough pharmacists and technicians or train them to stop that from happening and failed to implement systems that could flag suspicious orders lanier said the trial before u s district judge dan polster in cleveland was part of a broader constellation of federal opioid lawsuits about 3 000 in all that have been consolidated under the judge s supervision other cases are moving ahead in state courts utah vows to spend 309m cut of national opioid settlement on treatment and prevention the state s anticipated share of a national settlement from drug companies 309 million will help address the crisis that continues to claim lives and devastate families regardless of where they live in utah or how much money they have kevin roy chief public policy officer at shatterproof an organization that advocates for solutions to addiction said the verdict could lead pharmacies to follow the path of major distribution companies and some drugmakers that have reached nationwide settlements of opioid cases worth billions so far no pharmacy has reached a nationwide settlement it s a signal that the public at least in select places feels that there s been exposure and needs to be remedied roy said the committee of lawyers for the local governments suing the drug industry in federal courts called tuesday s verdict a milestone victory for decades pharmacy chains have watched as the pills flowing out of their doors cause harm and failed to take action as required by law the plaintiffs executive committee said in a statement instead these companies responded by opening up more locations flooding communities with pills and facilitating the flow of opioids into an illegal secondary market the judgment today against walmart walgreens and cvs represents the overdue reckoning for their complicity in creating a public nuisance the government claims against drugmakers distributors and pharmacies hinge on state and local public nuisance laws roy noted that courts have not been consistent on whether those laws apply to such cases there s been a variety of different decisions lately that should give us reason to be cautious about what this really means in the grand scheme he said two recent rulings have gone against the theory and more cases are heading toward rulings trials against drugmakers in new york and distribution companies in washington state are underway now a trial of claims against distribution companies in west virginia has wrapped up but the judge has not yet given a verdict earlier in november a california judge ruled in favor of top drug manufacturers in a lawsuit with three counties and the city of oakland the judge said the governments hadn t proven that the pharmaceutical companies used deceptive marketing to increase unnecessary opioid prescriptions and create a public nuisance also in november oklahoma s supreme court overturned a 2019 judgment for 465 million in a suit brought by the state against drugmaker johnson johnson other lawsuits have resulted in big settlements or proposed settlements before trials were completed the jury s decision in cleveland had little effect on the stock of cvs walgreens and walmart shares of all three companies rose tuesday shares of cvs and walgreens are up by 36 and 19 this year respectively contributing geoff mulvihill
price inflation is affecting everything from entertainment and electronics to things like food and clothing according to reader s digest a shortage of shipping containers a labor crisis shortages of raw materials and even climate change are to blame for this you may have heard of the microchip shortage when the pandemic first began factories that manufacture microchips for electronics and vehicles shut down while orders continued to come in these factories are still playing catch up and struggling to meet demand gas prices rose 42 7 in the last year the pandemic shutting things down for a while and the resurgent demand for oil after lockdowns cop producers off guard and they raised prices to compensate for low supply clothing prices rose 4 2 in august this is due in part to

of 50 million barrels of oil from the u s strategic petroleum reserve the move done in coordination with several other major nations is intended to contain energy costs oil markets having anticipated the move were unimpressed with the details oil prices actually rose on the news it was just the latest step biden has taken to show he is doing everything he can to combat inflation as gasoline and food prices in particular have imposed a growing burden on american households on monday he announced that he would reappoint jerome powell as chair of the federal reserve a move meant in part to reassure financial markets that washington is serious about containing consumer prices last month he announced a deal to ease supply backlogs at the port of los angeles by extending operations there to 24 hours a day seven days a week yet none of the president s actions is considered likely to make a meaningful dent in surging prices anytime soon i don t think the president has many levers to pull to bring down the rate of inflation any time soon said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the things he is doing are positive and there s no downside to them but they are on the margins they re not going to move the dial very much inflation is always a tough foe made even more complicated by the unusual recovery from the pandemic recession with shortages of supplies and workers and shipping bottlenecks forcing up prices what is happening to consumer prices the government s consumer price index skyrocketed 6 2 in the 12 months that ended in october the sharpest such jump since 1990 coming after nearly four decades of more or less stable prices the cpi news represents a once in a generation uptick in inflation said sarah binder a george washington university political scientist who studies the fed the problem is pretty stark because it s something that voters notice it s hard to escape the impact of a spike in inflation on your daily life whether it s buying milk or buying gas the average price of regular gasoline has shot up to 3 40 a gallon from 2 11 a year ago according to aaa compounding the pain and heightening the pressure on biden inflation has been outpacing americans income adjusted for price increases average hourly wages were actually down 1 2 last month compared with a year earlier inflation is painful and it s always political said diane swonk chief economist at the accounting and consulting firm grant thornton what s behind the price spike it s partly the consequence of very good news the world economy and america s in particular rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from last year s brief but intense recession it was a result of super low interest rates massive government spending and eventually the broad rollout of vaccines that allowed more of the economy to reopen the swiftness of the rebound caught businesses off guard a year and a half ago they were bracing for the worst laying off workers letting shelves and warehouses go bare reducing investment and factory output and energy companies did the same they cut production of oil and gas as demand for transportation fuels plummeted once demand came roaring back they were unprepared they found themselves scrambling to call back workers and buy enough to fill customer orders ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic countries competed over boatloads of overpriced liquid natural gas periodic covid 19 outbreaks shut down asian ports and factories global supply chains broke down as costs rose many businesses found that they could pass the burden along to consumers in the form of higher prices in the meantime many families had banked their government relief checks and built up their savings some critics also blamed biden s 1 9 trillion emergency aid package for overheating the economy and contributing to inflation pressures economists are divided over how long the inflation spike will last gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial predicts that inflationary pressures will ease as supply chains sort themselves out i expect to see inflation slow in 2022 he said what can presidents do the white house has limited tools for reversing higher prices that task belongs more to the fed which can raise borrowing costs to cool a sizzling economy during the 1960s and 1970s though presidents increasingly felt pressure to do something about inflation because it had become a serious political threat president lyndon johnson tried to persuade companies to forgo price increases and labor unions to limit wage demands a practice known as jawboning when bethlehem steel raised steel prices in 1965 johnson criticized its executives as unpatriotic and they backed down according to robert samuelson s book the great inflation and its aftermath when egg prices rose in 1966 johnson ordered america s surgeon general to highlight the health hazards of cholesterol in eggs with the intent of lowering egg sales and therefore prices nixon imposed wage and price controls in 1971 and 1973 which briefly stifled inflation only to see prices soar once the controls were lifted gerald ford s whip inflation now program encouraged americans to grow their own vegetables reduce their food waste and consume less americans responded mostly by mocking the program some wore the president s win buttons upside down explaining that the resulting nim stood for no immediate miracles what has biden done biden last week signed into a law a 1 trillion public works program which pours money into fixing roads bridges and ports potentially easing the supply chain backlogs that have contributed to rising prices untangling shipping bottlenecks would be doubly helpful it would ease inflationary pressures and boost the economy by increasing the flow of goods to customers last week biden sent a letter to the federal trade commission asking the ftc chair to consider investigating whether higher gasoline prices were the result of illegal conduct the white house is also stepping up anti trust enforcement of the meatpacking industry seeking to increase competition and drive down meat prices his decision to re

by michael r strain it s official president biden will seek to keep jerome powell at the helm of the federal reserve for another four year term mr powell has his work cut out for him with inflation rising to alarming levels the fed should be making moves to cool the economy but under its dual mandate the agency is also obligated to ensure maximum sustainable employment at present the fed is erring too much on the side of maximum employment instead mr powell must tip the scales back in favor of price stability if he doesn t he risks inviting a sluggish economy or even a recession in the coming years the fed s loose monetary policy keeping the key interest rate it controls close to zero and purchasing large quantities of government bonds and mortgage backed securities provides juice to the economy and increases employers need for workers it has contributed to troubling price increases that show signs of accelerating on net over half of small businesses the highest on record plan to increase their prices in the next three months according to a national federation of independent business survey investors in the bond market expect inflation to average around 3 percent over the next five years nearly double their expectation from one year ago by running the economy so hot mr powell may think he is giving idle workers their best shot at re entering employment at present there are six million fewer jobs than there would have been without the pandemic among workers ages 25 to 54 work force participation is down 1 4 percent from the start of the pandemic in february 2020 the rate for younger workers is 2 1 percent lower and workers over the age of 54 have a nearly 5 percent reduction in participation as he enters his second term mr powell must confront the fact that many of those missing workers aren t coming back a large share of them have taken early retirement or are otherwise reluctant to return to their prepandemic lives inflationary monetary policy and a hot economy won t change most of their minds many others might come back under the right circumstances they are temporarily on the sidelines because of covid fears child care problems swollen bank balances and excessively generous government programs but by the time they are ready to return to the work force next year the economy could be slowing under the weight of inflation and as concerns about inflation become more ingrained in the psychology of consumers and businesses the threat of fast price growth might leave the fed with no choice but to rapidly increase interest rates communicating to investors and businesses that it is worried about the economy this would slow business and consumer spending possibly shutting even more workers out of jobs so what seems like the pro labor move taking less aggressive action to fight inflation is actually the riskier option for workers mr powell has indicated that the fed will wind down its purchases of treasury and mortgage backed securities over the first half of next year after that it will probably begin increasing interest rates in the summer instead mr powell should immediately take tougher action to fight inflation rather than slowly reducing its purchases of mortgage backed securities given the white hot housing market the fed should immediately stop buying them it should aim to eliminate all additional asset purchases by the time fed officials hold their march meeting not june in addition the fed should signal that it expects to begin raising interest rates early in 2022 and that it is willing to increase rates several times next year it should also more clearly acknowledge the threat inflation poses to household finances business psychology and to the economy as a whole if this works the consumer price index may still be growing at an uncomfortable clip in the third quarter of 2022 but at a much slower pace than it is today and otherwise would be this would accommodate a gradual and steady labor market recovery while avoiding the risk of the fed abruptly throwing the economy into reverse but it s not just unwise fed policy that could damage the economy president biden s build back better agenda would make our already troubling inflation problem worse according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office this ambitious agenda would increase the deficit by around 300 billion over 2022 and 2023 the bill would also increase household income through more generous tax credits and deductions encouraging consumer demand and putting upward pressure on inflation moreover the one year expansion of the child credit in the current bill could be extended if so build back better would increase the deficit by around 400 billion over the next two years the white house argues that build back better will reduce inflation over the next decade and a few components of it might do that for example if its child care provisions make it easier for parents to work that would put downward pressure on wages and prices but even if they eventually materialize any disinflationary forces won t have kicked in next year it will take time for the bill s new programs to come online and for people to rearrange their lives to take advantage of them on the other hand the extra demand for goods and services generated by the bill s boost to household income would happen next year as soon as government checks are deposited in people s bank accounts for purposes of taming inflation what matters most is the effect the bill will have over the next year or two some may think the bill is worth the cost of higher inflation or even a recession but this is a false choice mr biden will still be president in 2022 he should wait to see how the economy evolves before deciding if building back better will make things worse of course concerns over inflation and the recovery of the work force may well turn out to be overwrought but mr powell faces a very different economy now than he did when he assumed leadership of the fed in 2018 today the balance of risks favors more aggressive tightening immediately
nairobi kenya economists say china s model of investment in africa is gaining public support despite the debt burden it imposes on many countries according to economic experts and the locals the united states multibillion dollar investments in africa are less visible and make less of an impact on people s daily lives catheren kiura s electronic business is one of thousands in kenya that distributes products both from china and western countries kiura says her chinese products are moving the fastest there is first quality second quality to fifth quality so it depends on what the customer is asking for because we sell something that the customer wants if it s a bulb for 30 shillings i have it if it s a bulb for 50 shillings kiura told voa electronics is a target area of investment by chinese companies in africa locals say such investments are impacting their daily lives directly joseph kamau a resident in nairobi said a lot of products we see in the shops are from china government projects we hear are also being run by chinese so even though america is investing we haven t seen them on the ground he added we hear that america has done this and that but we haven t seen them at the grassroots economists like wahoro ndoho say the model of investment by foreign countries is key in the competition for influence across africa china has followed its money in the countries it invested in unlike other lenders it has followed its projects with engineers sometimes even to the extreme of having their own workers what that has resulted in is a visible impact he expressed to voa during his three nation tour of africa last week u s secretary of state antony blinken said his country is investing in the continent without imposing unsustainable levels of debt wahoro told voa that distinction is an important one if you look at the overall picture of debt stock and by this i mean other debt beyond commercial loan china has been mainly for commercial debt the west is still ahead in terms of actual dollar on the ground and also because if you include the institutions owned by imf the totality of that bilateral multilateral institutions you see it s still the west space in a bid to strengthen relations with africa the white house has announced it will host an african leaders summit in 2022

trillion emergency aid package for overheating the economy and contributing to inflation pressures economists are divided over how long the inflation spike will last gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial predicts that inflationary pressures will ease as supply chains sort themselves out i expect to see inflation slow in 2022 he said what can presidents do the white house has limited tools for reversing higher prices that task belongs more to the fed which can raise borrowing costs to cool a sizzling economy during the 1960s and 1970s though presidents increasingly felt pressure to do something about inflation because it had become a serious political threat president lyndon johnson tried to persuade companies to forgo price increases and labor unions to limit wage demands a practice known as jawboning when bethlehem steel raised steel prices in 1965 johnson criticized its executives as unpatriotic and they backed down according to robert samuelson s book the great inflation and its aftermath when egg prices rose in 1966 johnson ordered america s surgeon general to highlight the health hazards of cholesterol in eggs with the intent of lowering egg sales and therefore prices nixon imposed wage and price controls in 1971 and 1973 which briefly stifled inflation only to see prices soar once the controls were lifted gerald ford s whip inflation now program encouraged americans to grow their own vegetables reduce their food waste and consume less americans responded mostly by mocking the program some wore the president s win buttons upside down explaining that the resulting nim stood for no immediate miracles what has biden done biden last week signed into a law a 1 trillion public works program which pours money into fixing roads bridges and ports potentially easing the supply chain backlogs that have contributed to rising prices untangling shipping bottlenecks would be doubly helpful it would ease inflationary pressures and boost the economy by increasing the flow of goods to customers last week biden sent a letter to the federal trade commission asking the ftc chair to consider investigating whether higher gasoline prices were the result of illegal conduct the white house is also stepping up anti trust enforcement of the meatpacking industry seeking to increase competition and drive down meat prices his decision to re nominate powell to lead the fed was meant in part to reassure the financial markets of washington s resolve to prevent consumer prices from spiraling out of his control the other likely contender for the job lael brainard a member of the fed s board of governors was perceived as less hawkish toward inflation why did biden tap the strategic petroleum reserve tuesday the idea was that by putting more oil on the market prices would fall that hasn t happened but depending on what happens in the rest of the world there s still a chance it could work america s petroleum reserve holds about 605 million barrels of oil in underground caves in texas and louisiana it was designed in the 1970s in response to the arab oil embargo to store oil in case there was a supply disruption or emergency but the dynamics of the global oil industry changed dramatically in recent years and now the u s exports more oil than it imports the 50 million barrels that biden promised to release will likely be sold slowly at a rate of about 1 million barrels per day meaning that the new influx of oil could last about two months adding even a small amount of oil to the market can tip it into surplus and potentially lower the price said jim burkhard of ihs markit the immediate price reaction is not the final judgment on the effectiveness of this of the effort he added it will really be in the months ahead ___ ap economics writer martin crutsinger contributed to this report

photo by mike yoder journal world file photo state regulators on tuesday expressed concerns about whether billions of dollars in planned energy projects by evergy would ultimately produce unnecessary increases in electric rates the kansas corporation commission issued an order requiring evergy the state s largest electric utility to better explain 10 4 billion worth of future capital expenditures the public utility has planned between now and 2025 the kcc the state s chief utility regulating body issued the order after spending months reviewing a sustainability transformation plan that evergy announced last year evergy has said the plan is needed to improve reliability of its electric service and to better position the company for the future detractors though have argued the plan has been too heavily influenced by activist investor elliott management which owns hundreds of million of dollars in evergy stock and is simply seeking to boost the company s stock value on tuesday the kcc didn t go so far it did not issue a ruling on the company s transformation plan and took no action to stop the company from implementing any part of it rather it said the company by feb 28 needs to file a report better explaining the 10 4 billion of kansas projects the plan calls for however the kcc board did highlight that it also wants evergy to not become too concerned about pleasing elliott management over the interests of kansas ratepayers as a regulated utility evergy s investment decisions including the timing of investments should not prioritize shareholder interests to the detriment of ratepayer interests the kcc said in its formal order the multi month review by the kcc showed there are major disagreements about how future spending by evergy will impact the electric rates that households and businesses in the state pay the kansas industrial consumers group argued that ratepayers in evergy s kansas territory would see a 10 to 11 rate increase by 2024 making it one of the largest electric increases in state history evergy though has argued the group s analysis is wrong and pointed to recent reductions in electric rates saying residential rates decreased by 6 5 from 2017 to 2019 while industrial rates decreased by 2 8 during the same time period what is more certain is that any rate increases related to the billions in spending aren t likely to happen immediately evergy which was created with the merger of kansas city power light and westar energy agreed as part of that merger to not bring forward a major rate case to regulators for five years that five year period lasts until late 2023 the kcc would be asked to approve future rate increases evergy has projected that the future projects will increase electric rates at a rate less than inflation that metric though has created concern with other groups as inflation has been soaring recently i want to point out that if we are tying our rates to inflation we are on the wrong metric david nickel consumer counsel for the citizens utility ratepayer board told the journal world we have to be looking at what people can afford nickel though said evergy does have projects it needs to complete and that a lot of evergy s infrastructure is old and may need to be replaced or upgraded in order to keep the system reliable but he said there is a balancing act with those types of improvements no matter how reliable the service is if you can t afford it because of rates reliability doesn t mean much nickel said a spokeswoman for evergy said the company is reviewing the kcc s most recent order as it figures out its next steps evergy provided substantial information to the commission and intervenors regarding development and execution of the sustainability transformation plan evergy spokeswoman gina penzig said the support of our regulators is essential and we will continue to maintain an open collaborative dialogue with them in its statement evergy which is the electricity provider in lawrence and also operates a coal fired plant just outside the city limits also said there are strategies that will allow the company to transition our fleet to more modern sources while mitigating the impact on rates we agree with the commission that affordability and regionally competitive rates are important penzig said keeping electricity affordable and having competitive rates are top priorities for us
quebec s language rules have business leaders brushing up on their skills it s an affront caption caption rr on a cool wet saturday afternoon in the outskirts of montreal near the city s main airport a crowd of about 100 gathered in front of air canada s headquarters demanding the resignation of the airline s chief executive it had nothing to do with a lackluster stock performance at canada s largest airline protesters were mad that the ceo who has lived in montreal for roughly 14 years can t speak french it s an affront to quebec said marie anne alepin a protest organizer and president of the francophone advocacy group société saint jean baptiste de montréal because the official language is french the chief executive michael rousseau took over the top job this year i have been able to live in montreal without speaking french and i think that s a testament to the city of montreal mr rousseau told reporters on nov 3 after a speech he delivered in english to a mostly french speaking crowd i would love to be able to speak french however he said his work schedule which includes steering air canada through the pandemic hasn t allowed for time the comments reignited a linguistic firestorm and the growing complexities of doing business in bilingual canada and french speaking quebec tension over english and french usage in quebec is longstanding but this time the complaints target some of the top business leaders in the province the air canada case has brought considerable heat on ceos across montreal the province s largest city said karl moore a professor at the faculty of management at montreal s mcgill university the french and english have lived together in quebec dating back to the 18th century although tensions persisted because of the influence the smaller english community had in the francophone region quebec s government declared french as the official language of the government courts education and business in the mid 1970s at the time the separatist quebec government said the province was a french enclave in north america and language policy needed to reflect that and ensure french culture could exist and prosper before the mid 1970s the senior executive ranks at major montreal based companies tended to be predominantly english speaking the share of quebec residents whose primary language is english has declined sharply since the 1970s the bulk of those who remain about 80 live in montreal the latest census had 718 000 people in quebec identifying english as their language learned at birth out of a province of more than 8 million quebec is now toughening language laws which for instance limit the use of english on outdoor signs in 2013 officials with the quebec government s language watchdog asked an italian restaurant to redo its menu so words such as pasta and bottiglia were spelled out in french pâtes and bouteille the watchdog later backtracked in 2019 the federal court of canada ordered air canada to pay a french speaking couple roughly 17 000 in damages after they complained that on the planes the french words sortie and avis were written in smaller characters relative to exit and warning and that only the english word lift was engraved on seat belts ms alepin president of the advocacy group said mr rousseau is emblematic of the struggles quebec french speakers face i would pose the question would a unilingual francophone be accepted as ceo of air canada no air canada s chairman vagn sørensen said in a letter to the canadian government that mr rousseau has started intensive french training and his language skills would now be part of his annual evaluation i want to make it clear that in no way did i mean to show disrespect for quebecers and francophones across the country mr rousseau said in a statement on nov 4 the day after his speech in english i apologize to those who were offended by my remarks meanwhile the ceo of another montreal company engineering and construction firm snc lavalin group inc said he was postponing a speech to a blue chip montreal crowd planned for this month to ensure his remarks had enough french the recent events surrounding the place given to the french language in canadian and quebec companies have led me to make this decision and to postpone my commitment until the coming year ceo ian edwards who hails from the united kingdom said in a letter to event organizers he said he took french classes after arriving in quebec about seven years ago with mixed results but has recommitted to further language training quebec s premier françois legault said he would like to meet with all top level ceos in the province to discuss their french at a press conference this month he said he wants to identify corporate leaders who are unilingual and convince them to learn french mr legault s government is widely expected to amend the province s language laws to impose stricter limits on businesses in providing contracts job offers and training documents in english the government argues changes are required to defend and protect french culture in quebec it has cited 2017 research from statistics canada which projected the use of french among quebec s population to decline from over 80 to 75 by 2036 whereas the use of english is set to rise to 13 from 11 quebec s language watchdog l office québécois de la langue française said its own study released this year indicated nearly half of the province s french speakers regularly use english or another language at work mr rousseau confirmed french speakers worst fears that you can live in the province in particular cosmopolitan montreal without speaking the official language said andré pratte principal at government relations firm navigator and a former chief editorial writer at montreal s la presse newspaper air canada a former state owned airline that was privatized over three decades ago is obligated under canadian law to have its headquarters in montreal and offer all services in both english and french canadian prime minister justin trudeau called mr rousseau s lack of french an unacceptable situation a spokeswoman said he declined to comment further attention has turned to other non quebecers leading montreal based companies a spokesman for laurentian bank of canada said ceo rania llewellyn appointed over a year ago is taking private french classes and is committed to improving her french canadian national railway co based in montreal is looking for a new leader to replace its retiring ceo the board of directors remains very sensitive to this reality the company said in a statement in reference to language issues the company s current ceo jean jacques ruest and his two predecessors are fluent in french and english before that the company was steered by the late hunter harrison an american from memphis who resisted taking french lessons but once opened a meeting at the railroad by saying bonjour y all

for reversing higher prices that task belongs more to the fed which can raise borrowing costs to cool a sizzling economy during the 1960s and 1970s though presidents increasingly felt pressure to do something about inflation because it had become a serious political threat president lyndon johnson tried to persuade companies to forgo price increases and labor unions to limit wage demands a practice known as jawboning when bethlehem steel raised steel prices in 1965 johnson criticized its executives as unpatriotic and they backed down according to robert samuelson s book the great inflation and its aftermath when egg prices rose in 1966 johnson ordered america s surgeon general to highlight the health hazards of cholesterol in eggs with the intent of lowering egg sales and therefore prices nixon imposed wage and price controls in 1971 and 1973 which briefly stifled inflation only to see prices soar once the controls were lifted gerald ford s whip inflation now program encouraged americans to grow their own vegetables reduce their food waste and consume less americans responded mostly by mocking the program some wore the president s win buttons upside down explaining that the resulting nim stood for no immediate miracles what has biden done biden last week signed into a law a 1 trillion public works program which pours money into fixing roads bridges and ports potentially easing the supply chain backlogs that have contributed to rising prices untangling shipping bottlenecks would be doubly helpful it would ease inflationary pressures and boost the economy by increasing the flow of goods to customers last week biden sent a letter to the federal trade commission asking the ftc chair to consider investigating whether higher gasoline prices were the result of illegal conduct the white house is also stepping up anti trust enforcement of the meatpacking industry seeking to increase competition and drive down meat prices his decision to re nominate powell to lead the fed was meant in part to reassure the financial markets of washington s resolve to prevent consumer prices from spiraling out of his control the other likely contender for the job lael brainard a member of the fed s board of governors was perceived as less hawkish toward inflation why did biden tap the strategic petroleum reserve tuesday the idea was that by putting more oil on the market prices would fall that hasn t happened but depending on what happens in the rest of the world there s still a chance it could work america s petroleum reserve holds about 605 million barrels of oil in underground caves in texas and louisiana it was designed in the 1970s in response to the arab oil embargo to store oil in case there was a supply disruption or emergency but the dynamics of the global oil industry changed dramatically in recent years and now the u s exports more oil than it imports the 50 million barrels that biden promised to release will likely be sold slowly at a rate of about 1 million barrels per day meaning that the new influx of oil could last about two months adding even a small amount of oil to the market can tip it into surplus and potentially lower the price said jim burkhard of ihs markit the immediate price reaction is not the final judgment on the effectiveness of this of the effort he added it will really be in the months ahead ___ ap economics writer martin crutsinger contributed to this report
homebuyers across the country are furious with zillow group inc nasdaq z for canceling contracts after the seattle based company promised to stick with all the deals it had under contract as it shutters its zillow offers division compounding the issue is the fact that many of these homeowners are waiting for their new construction homes to be completed pushing the sale of their existing homes to zillow until early next year it s these types of deals that zillow offers seems to be backing out of for a small subset of customers closing later in 2022 we determined we can no longer support their closing and are releasing our earnest money to them said zillow spokesperson matt kreamer typically homes close in 30 to 45 days as more homeowners are reaching out to the business journal to share their frustrations kreamer said zillow offers is cancelling nearly 400 transactions of the 8 172 contracts it has with home sellers nationwide in the atlanta area ellen bell received a call on her birthday from zillow offers offering to refund her 1 000 deposit plus another 4 000 if she terminates the contract by nov 30 for her 3 500 square foot home she had planned to sell to zillow for 360 000 frustration mounts that consolation prize is a far cry from the 10 912 zillow offered to tony and sarena miller in buckeye on nov 18 for their 1 580 square foot home that was set to sell to zillow for 418 872 when bell got the call from zillow she quickly showed her contract to her nephew who is an attorney he said the way the contract is set up the most i would be entitled to is the deposit if they default on the contract bell said it s frustrating she hasn t signed the contract yet but she feels she doesn t have much recourse she hopes she can find another ibuyer or investor to buy her home so she can use those proceeds for her new home under construction bell wonders why she was only offered 4 000 when the millers were offered 10 000 each customer s circumstances and homes are unique but unfortunately we don t discuss the particulars of each situation zillow s kreamer said in response stressful situation meanwhile jerry culpepper had a sale agreement with zillow for 351 085 for his home in marietta georgia that was set to close in february in time for their new home to be completed in florida however culpepper s offer was only 2 500 in addition to the 1 000 deposit he also has until nov 30 to accept the deal we went to zillow because they told us that they were a preferred partner of minto properties the building contractor in florida culpepper said our estimated closing for the new property is between january 2022 and march 2022 so zillow put our closing date as feb 18 2022 for contract purposes only they told us we could close at any time when the florida property was ready earlier than this date or later no worries the zillow representative who called culpepper told him that nothing is being funded past jan 31 2022 we tried to change our closing date to dec 31 2021 or even in january but she said that nothing could be changed culpepper said they have put us in a very difficult and stressful situation expand zillow offers is canceling a contract to buy this home in marietta georgia jerry culpepper greg hague founder of scottsdale arizona based 72 sold said zillow saw the housing marketing softening and appreciation slowing i think it strategically overpaid for homes to gain market share impress its shareholders and push up its stock price hague said now zillow recognizes it s likely to get burned because home appreciation won t cover the inflated prices it paid so it s cutting its losses now leaving those home sellers holding the bag people who may have planned on the equity zillow promised one sided option the home flipping business offers a no win proposition for home sellers hague said with firms closing on homes if they think they can make a quick buck and walking away if they discover they are overpaying to me the big bad on zillow is tying up homes with a fine print clause that lets then walk away when they don t think they ll make money hague said did the sellers who counted on money from the sale realize zillow s contract wasn t really a contract it was a one sided option in zillow s favor i doubt it meanwhile zillow is facing stockholder claims that the company withheld or misrepresented information about the impending collapse of the ibuying division ultimately leading to a 50 drop in zillow stock value in turn that raises the specter of potential lawsuits said john balitis chairman of the labor employment department at jennings strouss salmon plc law firm in phoenix the question all this begs is whether homesellers with zillow offers contracts in place could pursue class action claims of their own if zillow continues to cancel those contracts as the ibuying division winds down balitis said this clearly is a possibility depending on how widespread the contract cancellations are and depending further on how much flexibility the contract documents give to zillow to abort transactions with customers who have homes on the market with zillow it doesn t appear that any home seller class action lawsuits have been filed yet but that doesn t mean we won t see them in the near future zillow s stock closed at 54 34 a share nov 23 close to its 52 week low of 52 58 track the stock

advertisement president joe biden s decision to release barrels of oil from the country s strategic reserves was lambasted by former us president donald trump on november 23 tuesday who warned that washington will now be at the mercy of opec biden had previously announced the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve spr in collaboration with other energy consuming nations such as china india japan south korea and the united kingdom on tuesday now i understand that joe biden will be announcing an attack on the newly brimming strategic oil reserves so that he could get the close to record setting high oil prices artificially lowered we were energy independent one year ago now we are at the mercy of opec gasoline is selling for 7 in parts of california going up all over the country and they are taking oil from our strategic reserves is this any way to run a country trump said in a statement according to ani trump recalled that the us strategic oil reserves had been low or almost empty for decades when oil prices were very low three years ago i filled them to the brim those reserves are only supposed to be used in the event of a major emergency such as a war trump stated his opinion ani reported india to release 5mn barrels of crude oil from spr on tuesday the us and five other world countries announced a joint effort to dip into their national oil reserves in an attempt to lower increasing gas prices that have enraged consumers around the world following biden s declaration india announced that it would release 5 million barrels of crude oil from its strategic petroleum reserves in collaboration with other countries in order to cut prices in order to stabilise prices south korea stated it would sell a portion of its oil inventories from its strategic reserves as suggested by the us the uk also declared that 1 5 million barrels of oil from its strategic reserves would be released meanwhile allegations have surfaced that the japanese government wants to release enough oil from its strategic stocks to last many days in collaboration with a number of countries to lower prices oil traders appeared to be disappointed by the move as they had expected president biden to announce a larger release from america s strategic petroleum reserve which holds 620 million barrels and is the world s largest in worldwide trading the price of a barrel of crude oil surged after the announcement however administration officials claimed that prices could decline in the coming weeks the united states will withdraw 50 million barrels from the spr of that total 32 million barrels will be exchanged over the following few months while 18 million barrels will be sold sooner than planned with inputs from agencies image ap
washington nov 24 the administration of us president joe biden announced on tuesday it will release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with china india south korea japan and britain to try to cool prices after opec producers repeatedly ignored calls for more crude biden facing low approval ratings amid rising inflation ahead of next year s congressional elections has grown frustrated at repeatedly asking the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies known as opec to pump more oil without getting any response i told you before that we re going to take action on these problems that s exactly what we re doing biden said in remarks broadcast from the white house it will take time but before long you should see the price of gas drop where you fill up your tank and in the longer term we will reduce our reliance on oil as we shift to clean energy he said advertisement crude oil prices recently touched seven year highs and although they are still some way short of levels reached between 2011 and 2014 when they broke through us 100 a barrel many consumers are feeling the pain of a dramatic increase from a year ago under the plan the united states will release 50 million barrels the equivalent of about two and a half days of us demand india meanwhile said it would release 5 million barrels while britain said it would allow the voluntary release of 1 5 million barrels of oil from privately held reserves details on the amount and timing of the release of oil from south korea japan and china were not announced seoul said it would decide after discussions with the united states and other allies and japanese media said tokyo would detail its plans on wednesday advertisement it was the first time that the united states had coordinated such a move with some of the world s largest asian oil consumers officials said opec which includes saudi arabia and other us allies in the gulf as well as russia has rebuffed requests to pump more at its monthly meetings it meets again on dec 2 to discuss policy but has so far shown no indication it will change tack the group has been struggling to meet existing targets under its agreement to gradually increase production by 400 000 barrels per day bpd each month a pace washington sees as too slow and it remains worried that a resurgence of coronavirus cases could once again drive down demand recent high oil prices have been caused by a sharp rebound in global demand which cratered early in the pandemic in 2021 and analysts have said that releasing reserves may not be enough to curb further rises its not large enough to bring down prices in a meaningful way and may even backfire if it prompts opec to slow the pace at which it is raising output said caroline bain chief commodities economist at capital economics ltd biden s political opponents meanwhile seized on the announcement to criticize his administration s efforts to decarbonize the us economy and discourage new fossil fuel development on federal lands tapping the strategic petroleum reserve will not fix the problem we are experiencing higher prices because the administration and democrats in congress are waging a war on american energy said senator john barrasso the ranking republican on the senate energy committee benchmark brent crude was trading above us 80 a barrel on tuesday up from its levels before the announcement but still well below last month s three year high of more than us 86 brent futures rose us 2 65 or 3 3 per cent to us 82 35 a barrel by 12 52 p m est 1752 gmt while us west texas intermediate wti crude rose us 1 91 or 2 5 per cent to us 78 66 talking with partners the release from the us strategic petroleum reserve would be a combination of a loan and a sale to companies us officials said the 32 million barrels loan will take place over the next several months while the administration would accelerate a sale of 18 million barrels already approved by congress to raise funds for the budget we will continue talking to international partners on this issue the president stands ready to take additional action if needed and is prepared to use his full authorities working in coordination with the rest of the world a senior us administration official told reporters an opec source and several market analysts said the release was not as big as the headline figure suggested they said britain and india were releasing modest amounts and the united states had already announced some releases and so the additional quantity was less than expected but the effort by washington to team up with major asian economies to lower energy prices sends a warning to opec and other big producers that they need to address concerns about high crude prices up more than 50 per cent so far this year complication suhail al mazrouei energy minister of the united arab emirates one of opec s biggest producers said before details of the release from us reserves was announced that he saw no logic in lifting uae supply for global markets an opec source said releasing reserves would complicate calculations for opec as it monitors the market on a monthly basis these developments point to a period of heightened political tensions between the world s biggest consumers and opec which implies increased oil price volatility said henning gloystein at eurasia group the united states historically has worked on coordinated stocks releases with the paris based international energy agency iea a bloc of 30 industrialised energy consuming nations japan and south korea are iea members china and india are only associate members under a swap from us reserves oil companies taking crude must return it or the refined product plus interest swaps are typically offered when oil firms face supply disruptions such as a pipeline outage or damage from a hurricane outright sales are less common us presidents have authorized emergency sales three times most recently in 2011 during a war in opec member libya sales also took place during the gulf war in 1991 and after hurricane katrina in 2005 reuters
lexology gtdt market intelligence provides a unique perspective on evolving legal and regulatory landscapes this interview is taken from the private equity volume featuring discussion and analysis of emerging trends and hot topics within key jurisdictions worldwide 1 what trends are you seeing in overall activity levels for private equity buyouts and investments in your jurisdiction during the past year or so further expanding on the significant increase in m a activity during the second half of 2020 m a activity in the united states reached record levels in the first half of 2021 m a deal activity reached its highest recorded opening six month period during the first half of 2021 totalling approximately us 1 3 trillion across 7 841 deals a year over year increase in value of 249 per cent according to refinitiv m a activity in the united states accounted for approximately 47 per cent of worldwide m a activity during the period in the first half of the year 2 520 private equity buyout deals were consummated in the united states a year over year increase of 59 per cent compared to the same period in 2019 for a total deal value of approximately us 288 5 billion an increase of 217 per cent as compared to the same period during 2020 refinitiv despite significant increases in m a activity levels globally private equity sponsors remained some of the most active dealmakers this year accounting for 18 per cent of worldwide activity in the first half of 2021 as private equity buyout deals totalled us 533 3 billion in value globally across more than 6 500 deals a year over year increase in value of 76 per cent refinitiv mega deals likewise witnessed a resurgence as 27 deals valued at over us 10 billion reached a total deal value of us 578 4 billion during the first half of 2021 a year over year increase of 82 per cent and deals valued between us 5 billion and us 10 billion increased 239 per cent as compared to last year to reach a record high us 485 4 billion 2 looking at types of investments and transactions are private equity firms primarily pursuing straight buyouts or are other opportunities such as minority stake investments partnerships or add on acquisitions also being explored following the direct and indirect business impacts of the covid 19 pandemic and the rebound in private equity deal activity during the second half of 2020 private equity sponsors have been increasingly looking for creative ways to deploy their investors capital for example in addition to add on acquisitions which have been increasingly more popular over the past few years we have seen sponsors increasingly turn to using blank check special purpose acquisition company transactions spacs to deploy capital according to pitchbook during the first half of 2021 the popularity of spac offerings continued to support elevated volumes of public listings in the united states fifty three spac offerings occurred during the first half of 2021 greater than the 51 spac offerings of 2020 though the quantity of spac offerings has begun to wane in comparison to the beginning of 2021 in addition add on acquisitions and minority investments remain a popular avenue to deploy capital in the united states with add on acquisitions making up the highest percentage of leveraged buyouts on record during the half quarter of 2021 reaching a record 74 5 per cent of all private equity buyout deals during the first half of 2021 pitchbook 3 what were the recent keynote deals and what made them stand out notable private equity transactions in the united states in the first half of 2021 include the us 34 billion acquisition of a majority stake in medline industries inc by a consortium that included blackstone carlyle and hellman friedman the us 9 6 billion acquisition of aldevron llc from eqt by danaher corp the us 6 1 billion acquisition of the michaels companies inc by apollo global management the us 6 0 billion acquisition of home partners of america inc by blackstone and the us 5 75 billion acquisition of the core brands of the bountiful company from kkr by nestlé 4 does private equity m a tend to be cross border what are some of the typical challenges legal advisers in your jurisdiction face in a multi jurisdictional deal how are those challenges evolving significant cross border private equity activity is atypical although there has been steady interest in cross border deals particularly among larger funds with the capacity to manage such transactions several large cap private equity sponsors have stand alone region focused funds such as asia focused funds that have mandates to make investments in particular geographic regions it is more common for non us private equity sponsors such as european funds or asian funds to look to the united states for potential investment opportunities more broadly during the first half of 2021 cross border m a activity achieved its highest six month opening period since 2018 reaching a total value of us 862 8 billion which is a year over year increase of 95 per cent as compared to the first half of 2020 the primary challenges to cross border investments revolve around financing tax considerations regulatory compliance and securities laws limitations in addition us sponsors seeking to sell portfolio companies to non us buyers or considering other transactions involving sales to foreign acquirers should be aware of the possibility of review by the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius cfius is a multi agency committee authorised to review transactions that could result in foreign control over us businesses for potential impacts on us national security under the foreign investment risk review modernization act firrma enacted in 2018 cfius is authorised to review certain other investments by a foreign person in a us business including those that do not convey potential control if the us business 1 owns operates manufactures supplies or services critical infrastructure 2 produces designs tests manufactures fabricates or develops one or more critical technologies or 3 maintains or collects sensitive personal data of us citizens that may be exploited in a manner that threatens national security collectively defined in the regulations as tid us businesses as well as acquisitions of real estate and leaseholds near sensitive us military or other government facilities cfius has authority to negotiate and implement agreements to mitigate any national security risks raised by such transactions if cfius determines that such risks cannot be mitigated cfius can recommend that the us president suspend prohibit or unwind a transaction a cfius review can add delays and meaningful uncertainty to transactions depending on the nature of the target business and the identity of the foreign acquirer in transactions involving the sale of a portfolio company that is in a sensitive industry or that handles sensitive data especially to buyers that cfius considers are from countries of concern sponsors will be prudent to consider whether a cfius filing is advisable or a mandatory declaration is necessary under the mandatory regime described below to propose reverse termination fees or pre emptive divestitures to discuss possible mitigation efforts the buyer is willing to make and to build political support for the transaction since 2012 acquisitions involving chinese acquirers have been the most reviewed transactions pursuant to the cfius review process given the trump administration s avowed trade policies and anti china rhetoric the heightened tensions around north korea and russia and with the recent enactment of firrma which expanded cfius s jurisdiction and created a longer timeframe for cfius review among other reforms many practitioners anticipate a tougher cfius hurdle and expect increased scrutiny of inbound investments from chinese buyers to continue cfius has also introduced new regulations imposing mandatory filing requirements for certain transactions involving target companies active in critical technologies or critical infrastructure or that have access to the sensitive personal data of us citizens a failure to satisfy these new filing obligations could result in significant fines and penalties for the parties up to the value of the transaction itself and introduce additional deal uncertainty and regulatory risks following the conclusion of the formal firrma regulatory rule making process in february 2020 parties are required to notify cfius of transactions that would result in foreign ownership of a substantial interest in a us business where 1 the us business involves critical infrastructure critical technology or sensitive personal data of us citizens and 2 a foreign government has a substantial interest in a foreign party to the transaction cfius implemented a mandatory filing requirement the mandatory regime authorised by firrma that expanded cfius s jurisdiction by granting it the authority to review controlling and non controlling other investments made by a foreign person whether or not controlled by a foreign government in a company involved in critical technologies for which a us regulatory authorisation would be required to transfer that critical technology to a foreign investor or a foreign person in the investor s ownership chain and that affords the foreign person 1 access to any material non public technical information in the possession of the us business 2 membership or observer rights on or the right to nominate an individual to a position on the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the us business or 3 any involvement other than through voting of shares in substantive decision making of the us business regarding the use development acquisition or release of critical technology transactions subject to the mandatory regime are subject to mandatory declaration requirements although firrma and the mandatory regime include certain exceptions for us national managed investment funds firrma may increase the number of transactions involving us sponsors and co investors that would be subject to cfius review and investigation and the timing and substantive risks while the regulatory and other challenges in cross border sponsor exits and other transactions including cfius review are often manageable in many contexts they increase the level of resources required and may otherwise complicate the process for executing such transactions 5 what are some of the current issues and trends in financing for private equity transactions have there been any notable developments in the availability or the terms of debt financing for buyers over the past year or so the market has continued to enjoy a relaxation of guidelines promulgated by the federal reserve and the office of the comptroller of the currency for financial institutions by the new administration although a high degree of uncertainty exists in the current regulatory environment particularly as the current inflationary movement has prompted the federal reserve to indicate that it may implement a potential rate increase before the end of 2023 as was the case in 2020 dealmakers have continued to be able to find relatively attractive pricing and availability of credit for transactions in 2021 overall the debt financing markets in the united states have remained open with sponsors finding ready access to debt financing throughout the first half of 2021 during this period high yield debt activity reached its highest levels for any six month opening period reaching approximately us 400 9 billion globally representing a year over year increase of 52 per cent and the first six month opening period to exceed us 400 billion also during the first half of 2021 global syndicated loan revenue and volume increased year over year 28 per cent to us 2 7 trillion and 7 per cent to 4 963 deals respectively resulting in the highest value opening half year period since 2018 although loan value during the second quarter of 2021 witnessed an 8 per cent increase over loan value during the first quarter of the year volume decreased 19 per cent during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter syndicated lending in the united states represented 60 per cent of the global syndicated loan market increasing 51 per cent year over year in value to reach us 1 6 trillion across 2 117 deals globally investment grade corporate debt offerings decreased 18 per cent as compared to the first half of 2020 to us 2 4 trillion though this amount is nonetheless the second highest opening half year period on record all of the above data provided by refinitiv also as at the end of the second quarter of 2021 median debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation multiples for private equity buyout transactions was 7 5x compared to 5 9x for the entire year pitchbook 6 how has the legal regulatory and policy landscape changed during the past few years in your jurisdiction most private equity firms continue to be required to register with the securities and exchange commission sec as investment advisers and the sec have continued to focus on examining private equity firms with the goal of among other things promoting compliance with certain provisions of the investment advisers act that the sec deems of particular importance in recent years certain private equity industry practices have received significant attention from the sec which has led in certain cases to enforcement actions against private equity fund advisers areas that the sec continues to highlight as areas of particular concern include among others the following the allocation of expenses including for the compensation of operating partners senior advisers or consultants and employees of private equity fund advisers or their affiliates including seconded employees for providing services other than advisory services to funds and portfolio companies as well as for payments of a private equity fund adviser s regulatory compliance expenses to funds or portfolio companies or both also full allocation of broken deal expenses to funds instead of allocating a portion of such expenses to separate accounts co investors or co investment vehicles in each case without pre commitment disclosure and consent from investors the receipt by private equity firms of transaction based compensation or other fees or compensation from funds or portfolio companies or both outside of the typical management fee or carried interest structure eg an acceleration of monitoring fees and compensation for the provision of brokerage services in connection with the acquisition and disposition of portfolio companies without being registered as a broker dealer without a corresponding management fee offset the allocation of investment opportunities by private equity sponsors among the investment vehicles and funds that they manage the allocation of co investment opportunities the disclosure of conflicts of interest to investors including those arising out of the outside business activities and financial interests of a private equity firm s employees and directors investments made by affiliated different funds managed by a private equity firm in different levels of a company s capital structure financial relationships between private equity firms and select investors in their funds eg seed investor relationships portfolio companies use of affiliated service providers affiliated with the private equity firm or its principals fund restructurings and cross transactions between funds managed by the private equity firm the receipt of service provider discounts by private equity firms that are not given to the funds or portfolio companies marketing presentations and the presentation of performance information generally policies and procedures relating to the receipt of material non public information mnpi we continue to believe that larger established private equity firms that continue to provide robust pre commitment disclosure of and obtain consent for conflicts of interest in addition to maintaining and enforcing sound compliance policies and procedures to mitigate such conflicts of interest continue to be better positioned to absorb the incremental costs and compliance burdens associated with such scrutiny on 22 december 2017 president trump signed the tax cuts and jobs which was generally effective as of 1 january 2018 among the numerous changes included in the tax cuts and jobs act were a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate a partial limitation on the deductibility of interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to a trade or business subject to certain exceptions a new deduction for individuals receiving certain business income from pass through entities and a partial shift of the us taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system along with a transitional rule that taxes certain historic accumulated earnings and rules that prevent tax planning strategies and shift profits to low tax jurisdictions the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act on private equity transactions continues to be analysed as the internal revenue service and treasury have released new regulatory guidance 7 what are the current attitudes towards private equity among policymakers and the public does shareholder activism play a significant role in your jurisdiction while negative attitudes concerning private equity buyouts seems to have waned over the past few years shareholder activism associated with m a activity has become increasingly prominent irrespective of whether there is any private equity involvement as a result private equity sponsors seeking to effect going private transactions or investing alongside a strategic partner are becoming increasingly mindful of the investor relations aspects of such transactions and are evaluating the risks of potential shareholder activism despite the passage of the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act which rolled back certain regulations and requirements imposed by the dodd frank act including stress tests on small and medium sized banks the regulatory landscape largely remains unchanged as of the first half of 2021 however the biden administration has signalled an interest in increasing regulatory scrutiny particularly with regard to antitrust enforcement and greater taxation which could detrimentally affect m a activity broadly and private equity activity in particular a survey by mergermarket of 75 private equity executives and 75 corporate executives conducted during the first quarter of 2021 found that 45 per cent of respondents identified increased regulatory scrutiny as the most significant risk to dealmaking during the coming 12 months with the third highest identified risk being increased corporate tax rates at 13 per cent 8 what levels of exit activity have you been seeing which exit route is the most common which exits have caught your eye recently and why private equity backed exit activity increased in the first half of 2021 which is consistent with the overall high levels of activity that the m a environment has witnessed since the second half of 2020 according to data supplied by pitchbook as at the end of the second quarter of 2021 us private equity sponsors executed 676 exits that aggregated to approximately us 355 9 billion already eclipsing us private equity backed exit activity during all of 2019 in addition one of the trends that has continued to gain momentum in 2021 has been general partner gp led secondary sales of portfolio companies to newer funds established by the same gp or to continuation funds established by the gp such a structure provides earlier investors in a private equity fund a path to liquidity while still allowing the gp and other investors to remain invested in highly prized portfolio company assets for a longer hold period initial public offering ipo exit value during the first half of 2021 accounted for approximately 12 1 per cent of total private equity backed exit activity pitchbook expanding upon private equity firms increased interest in public listings in the united states overall ipo activity levels have remained high during the first half of 2021 with 60 public listings including ipos direct listings and spacs raising nearly us 139 9 billion during the first half of 2021 already exceeding both the value and volume of activity achieved across all of 2020 according to data supplied by pitchbook during the first half of 2021 completed ipos excluding listings of spacs achieved the strongest recorded opening six month period for ipos more than tripling in value as compared to the first half of 2020 and raising us 209 3 billion refinitiv the technology sector in particular contributed to ipo activity levels during the first half of 2021 including the us 26 6 billion listing of apploving a mobile app developer tool provider in which kkr had invested pitchbook 9 looking at funds and fundraising does the market currently favour investors or sponsors what are fundraising levels like now relative to the past few years global private equity fundraising in the first half of 2021 rose to its highest level since 2008 a total of 613 funds across buyouts growth equity venture secondaries distressed and co investments funds raised us 415 billion collectively this marks an approximately 20 per cent increase in the number of funds closed and a 53 per cent rise in aggregate capital raised over the same period in 2020 where the economic downturn caused by the covid 19 pandemic and related fundraising difficulties depressed fundraising relative to 2019 levels consistent with 2019 and 2020 capital was concentrated on mega funds ie funds raising approximately us 5 billion or more of recognised top performing sponsors this concentration demonstrates the continued consolidation in the private equity industry in favour of larger established sponsors with proven track records as a result of institutional limited partners seeking to make larger commitments to fewer funds consolidate manager relationships and invest with sponsors with whom they had prior relationships particularly in light of the inability to meet new sponsors in person during the pandemic specifically in the first half of 2021 the 10 largest funds raised a total of us 147 billion which represents more than one third of the total capital raised during this period this indicates an increase in consolidation from 2020 where the 10 largest funds that reached a final close in 2020 raised approximately a quarter of the total capital raised in 2020 regarding the distribution of capital across different types of private equity funds buyout funds accounted for more than half of capital raised during the first half of 2021 and growth funds constituted 17 per cent of capital raised buyout and growth funds however made up only 20 per cent and 16 per cent of funds closed respectively notably secondary funds accounted for a smaller percentage of the total capital raised in the first half of 2021 than they did in the first half of 2020 whereas secondary funds constituted 15 per cent of total capital raised in the first half of 2020 and over the year as a whole they made up only 9 per cent of capital raised in the first half of this year geographically the fundraising rebound during the first half of 2021 has been particularly evident in north america focused funds north america focused funds accounted for almost half of all capital raised 48 per cent in the first six months of this year more than double the percentage of 2020 capital represented by north america focused funds comparatively the percentage of total capital raised by europe focused funds decreased to slightly more than 7 per cent from approximately 12 per cent in 2020 yet the overall amount of capital raised for both europe and asia pacific focused funds in the first half of 2021 increased relative to the first half of 2020 compared with the first half of 2020 in the first half of 2021 europe focused funds raised 55 per cent more capital and asia pacific focused funds raised 22 per cent more capital it is expected that overall fundraising levels will continue to increase in the near term a record 5 248 private equity or venture capital funds are seeking to raise us 899 billion in total capital as of the beginning of q3 and capital raised in q2 2021 was 11 per cent higher than the preceding quarter many investors are also placing a premium on managers with established track records that have navigated a number of past economic cycles as larger institutional investors will continue to consolidate their relationships with experienced fund managers competition for limited partner capital among private equity funds will continue to increase with alternative fundraising strategies eg customised separate accounts co investment structures continuation funds early closer incentives umbrella funds anchor investments core funds growth equity funds impact funds gp minority stakes investing secondaries funds and complementary funds ie funds with strategies aimed at particular geographic regions or specific asset types playing a substantial role as a result established sponsors with proven track records should continue to enjoy a competitive advantage and first time funds will need to accommodate investors by either lowering fees expanding co investment opportunities focusing on unique investment opportunities or exploring other alternative strategies in addition in light of the strong less volatile performance by private equity funds over recent periods relative to the public markets particularly earlier in 2020 institutional investors may increasingly shift allocations from the public markets to private equity moreover it is anticipated that private equity fundraising will continue to focus on established dominant markets in north america and europe finally it is also expected that the sec will continue to focus on transparency eg full and fair pre commitment disclosure and informed consent from investors with respect to conflicts of interest including among others conflicts of interest arising out of the allocation of costs and expenses to funds and portfolio companies the allocation of investment opportunities and co investment opportunities and the receipt of other fees and compensation from funds portfolio companies or service providers given this larger private equity firms with the resources in place to absorb incremental compliance related efforts and costs are likely to continue to enjoy a competitive advantage among their peers 10 talk us through a typical fundraising what are the timelines structures and the key contractual points what are the most significant legal issues specific to your jurisdiction the characteristics of a typical fundraiser reflect the rise in investor demand for opportunities to invest in private equity funds and the consolidation of investor capital in experienced fund managers funds are performing well enough to raise and are returning back to market oversubscribed and the overwhelming majority of investors are expected to maintain or increase their exposure to private equity over the next 12 months it follows that current fundraising characteristics and the private equity market more generally favours sponsors fundraising in today s environment has become less episodic and more resource intensive with fund structures terms and marketing timelines customised to most effectively address the business objectives of sponsors particularly experienced sponsors with proven track records the following is a simplified framework and timeline for a typical private equity fundraising in most cases typical fundraising will begin with the preparation and distribution of a private placement memorandum to investors which includes important information about the sponsor and the fund including a term sheet setting forth the key terms of the fund and the offering of interests along with additional disclosure information pertaining to the fund many private equity funds are structured as delaware limited partnerships but the structure and jurisdiction of the fund will depend largely on the sponsor and the asset class geographic focus and anticipated investor base of the fund it is not uncommon for private equity funds to be organised in jurisdictions outside of the united states eg the cayman islands ireland or luxembourg legal counsel will work closely with the sponsor as part of the fundraising to prepare the draft limited partnership agreement investment management agreement subscription agreement and related fund documents which are the definitive agreements governing the operation of a private equity fund key contractual points in the fund documents will vary on a case by case basis but often include economic arrangements eg management fees and carried interest tax structuring provisions and minimisation covenants investment allocation provisions limited liability protections standards of care governance rights co investment arrangements and allocations of expenses it should be noted that increased regulatory scrutiny has resulted in a change in how marketing and offering documents are prepared environmental social and governance esg factors have also emerged as a fundamental underwriting criterion for investors and although north america and asia have lagged behind europe in the adoption of esg principles the prevalence of these factors in recent client fundraising due diligence indicates that implementation is accelerating across all regions as a result drafting fund documents is now a resource and time intensive exercise as pages and pages of granular disclosure are often added to such documents and more frequent updates are often made throughout fundraising in an effort to increase transparency following delivery of the fund documents to investors counsel and the sponsor will work closely with investors to resolve any questions or comments and once a critical mass of investors subscriptions has been secured the fund will hold an initial closing fundraising timelines in private equity can vary significantly depending on the sponsor involved and the type and size of fund being raised running anywhere from a few months to a few years once an initial closing has been held a private equity fund will typically be permitted to hold subsequent closings over a period of 12 to 18 months although the fundraising process has been accelerated to six to 12 months in recent years as the regulation of private equity funds continues to increase it remains very important for sponsors to work closely with counsel to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to permit marketing in each jurisdiction in which fund interests are to be marketed 11 how closely are private equity sponsors supervised in your jurisdiction does this supervision impact the day to day business private equity firms are subject to substantial regulation and supervision in the united states and the regulatory environment in which private equity firms operate is becoming increasingly complex the regulation and supervision of private equity firms affects not only the manner in which interests in private equity funds are marketed and sold to investors but also the day to day business and operations of private equity firms themselves the principal laws and regulations applicable to private equity firms affecting their day to day business and operations include among others the securities act of 1933 affecting the manner in which private equity funds market and sell interests to investors the securities exchange act of 1934 affecting ongoing reporting obligations and placing practical limitations on the number of investors in private equity funds the advisers act imposing substantive regulations and reporting provisions on many private equity fund advisers the investment company act of 1940 establishing certain eligibility requirements and limitations on investors in private equity funds the commodity exchange act regulating the ownership of commodities by private equity funds and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 imposing restrictions and onerous fiduciary requirements on private equity funds deemed to hold plan assets since the sec gained oversight of the industry under the dodd frank act private equity firms remain the subject of regulatory and public scrutiny the sec continues to find more regulatory lapses among private equity firms particularly related to expenses and expense allocation conflicts of interest and other disclosure matters and most recently mnpi policies and procedures private equity firms with dedicated compliance investor relations and administrative resources necessary to manage the increased regulatory and compliance burdens in addition to investor demands in today s competitive fundraising environment are likely to continue to enjoy an advantage in the future 12 what effect has the aifmd had on fundraising in your jurisdiction the aifmd has resulted in two approaches to fundraising in the european economic area eea by us fund managers the use of national private placement regimes npprs and the use of hosted solution platforms some us managers avoid active marketing in the eea but will admit investors to their fund at the initiative of the investor reverse solicitation although reverse solicitation is sometimes referred to as a way of marketing in the eea it is an exclusion that allows investors domiciled or established in the eea eea investors to invest in funds at their own initiative without thereby subjecting the fund manager to compliance with the aifmd as it is not a method of active fundraising or if used to that effect it would be a circumvention of the aifmd it is not considered further in this note the two approaches to fundraising reflect the options available under the aifmd depending on whether the fund manager is a non eea alternative investment fund manager non eea aifm or an authorised eea alternative investment fund manager eea aifm for marketing by a non eea aifm the aifmd allows national authorities to operate at their option an nppr in countries that permit marketing under npprs a non eea aifm may market an alternative investment fund solely within the territory of the relevant country provided that the non eea aifm complies at a minimum with a limited subset of aifmd requirements by contrast for an authorised aifm the aifmd provides a streamlined passport system that subject to certain limitations permits the marketing of eea funds to professional investors anywhere in the eea the aifmd makes provision for the possibility of extending this passport system to non eea aifms but there is as yet no indication as to when or if it will ever become available to us fund managers to understand why the aifmd has resulted in a bifurcation between npprs and hosted solutions it is useful to consider further aspects of each approach national private placement regimes there is no requirement for eea member states to allow non eea fund managers to privately solicit investors in their member state where it is permitted the member state is required to impose at least the following requirements pre investment disclosure periodic reporting annex iv reporting annual report and if applicable notification and disclosure requirements in relation to the acquisition of significant stakes or control of non listed companies and issuers and restrictions on certain distributions capital reductions and share redemptions in respect of portfolio companies the anti asset stripping rules member states are free to impose more stringent measures than those listed above at present some eea states do not operate npprs at all some eea states apply the minimum requirements described above others require the minimum plus for example the appointment of a depositary and some require compliance with substantially all of the aifmd making it impossible or practically impossible for a non eea aifm to market a fund in that member state the process for obtaining marketing approval under an nppr where it is allowed varies though it usually requires the advice of local counsel and is therefore costly and time consuming this has resulted in a number of us private equity funds particularly smaller firms that do not have the necessary compliance and fundraising infrastructure in place to be disadvantaged by the complexity and cost especially where there is no certainty of raising capital further the minimum requirements noted above and if applicable the appointment of a depositary create an ongoing administrative and compliance burden for the life of the fund or until registration is terminated notwithstanding these obstacles for some non eea aifms npprs have facilitated the repeated raisings of large funds they has proven to be a reliable and predictable process that is minimally disruptive to the sponsor s existing business model as costs are known many are one off ongoing compliance for annual reports and regulatory reporting is incremental and it does not involve a long term or open ended commitment to an establishment in the eea or to complying with eu laws as they may evolve or be extended in the future hosted solutions the main disadvantages to npprs are it is either not permitted or not practical in certain key countries in western europe there is currently no common meaning of pre marketing for gauging interest before formally registering under an nppr npprs have a patchwork of notification and application procedures across the member states where they are permitted and in some cases approval from the regulator can take months and annex iv reporting must be submitted in different formats through different electronic portals to each member state where the alternative investment fund is registered for marketing the main alternatives to npprs are forming an entity to become authorised as an eea aifm and engaging a hosted solution forming a legal entity in an eea member state and obtaining authorisation as an aifm is a significant business commitment although a small number of us managers have established or acquired authorised aifms it is not a plausible alternative for most sponsors and is not often considered further a hosted solution involves engaging an authorised eea aifm that agrees to manage and market a fund sponsored by a non eea aifm typically a new alternative investment fund is established in the eea commonly in luxembourg or ireland the eea aifm the host agrees to manage the alternative investment fund and market the fund in selected member states under its marketing passport the eea aifm will typically either delegate management to the non eea aifm or engage the non eea aifm to provide investment advice increasingly delegation seems to be more popular than an advisory arrangement even though it may subject the delegate to certain remuneration rules the marketing passport is only available for the marketing of an eea alternative investment fund and then only if the eea fund is not a feeder fund to a non eea master or not a feeder fund to an eea master that is not managed by an authorised eea aifm for this reason the hosted solution is commonly used in a parallel investment structure with an non eea aif which avoids a master feeder structure the right to market under the passport is that of the eea aifm the aifm has access to the marketing passport but that does not allow the non eea aifm to market on its behalf in the eea the most straightforward solution to this problem is to engage a placement agent authorised in the eea to act as an intermediary to the market on behalf of the aifm eea investors are familiar with the hosted solution model and there is no indication that the involvement of a third party aifm adversely affects their investment decision possibly the opposite is the case for some institutional investors insofar as they prefer to invest in an eea alternative investment fund with the full protections of the aifmd for a similar reason regulators may prefer the model to an nppr for example because the alternative investment fund and aifm are within the regulatory perimeter and eu investors receive the full protection of the aifmd a hosted solution addresses most of the shortcomings of marketing under npprs but most importantly it allows access to all countries in the eea however it does entail negotiating a set of service agreements with the aifm and possibly with the depositary and fund administrator establishing an eea alternative investment fund working with or under an entity that is itself subject to all of the requirements of the aifmd establishing a parallel investment structure and engaging a marketing intermediary these factors do mean that the costs which continue for the life of the fund may only be justified if the marketing effort results in the raising of a significant amount of capital from investors from whom capital could not otherwise be raised under nppr in summary the aifmd contemplated marketing by non eea aifms under npprs while npprs are workable and preferable for some non eea aifms the advantages of the marketing passport combined with the attractiveness to some institutional investors of investing in an eea alternative investment fund managed by an authorised eea aifm has spawned an industry of hosted solution platform providers 13 what are the major tax issues that private equity faces in your jurisdiction how is carried interest taxed do you see the current treatment potentially changing in the near future us tax rules are very complex and tax matters play an important role in both fund formation and the structure of underlying fund investments tax issues that have been given some focus in recent years include the implementation of the numerous changes related to the tax cuts and jobs act see question 6 the implementation of due diligence information reporting and withholding rules pursuant to the foreign account tax compliance act the proper tax treatment including deductibility of monitoring fees paid by underlying portfolio companies to a private equity fund s investment adviser and the partnership audit rules which may impose liability for adjustments to a partnership s tax returns on the partnership itself consultation with dedicated tax advisers with respect to specific transactions and issues is highly recommended private equity sponsors and their portfolio companies have also considered the impact of the tax relief provisions of the recently enacted coronavirus aid relief and the economic security act including suspending the 80 per cent net operating loss nol limitation this allows 2018 2019 or 2020 nols to be carried back five years temporarily increasing the limitation on the utilisation of business interest expense deductions to 50 per cent of adjusted taxable income excluding cancellation of debt income attributable to certain small business administration loan forgiveness from gross income and delaying employer payroll tax payments among other changes additionally in light of the covid 19 pandemic many portfolio companies have repurchased debt at a discount or had their debt repurchased by a private equity sponsor or related party at a discount which can result in the cancellation of indebtedness income to the borrower and raise other tax considerations for both issuers and sponsors special consideration is given to structuring the carried interest such that it is treated as a partnership allocation eligible for taxation on a flow through basis it is sometimes desirable to separate the gp namely the recipient of the carried interest and the investment manager namely the recipient of the management fee into separate entities for state tax and other purposes the tax cuts and jobs act typically requires the gp of a private equity fund to hold an investment for three years in order for the carried interest related to such an investment be treated as capital gains for tax purposes additionally congress has previously considered legislation that would subject carried interest and gain on the sale of investment services partnership interests to higher rates of us federal income tax than under current law and president trump expressed his support for such legislation private equity sponsors must also be aware of tax issues relating to management and employee compensation which will be relevant to structuring management s investment and post closing incentives an example of one such tax issue is that compensation triggered by a change of control including certain severance and consideration for equity holdings may be excess parachute payments which are subject to a 20 per cent excise tax in addition to ordinary income taxes and may not be deducted by the target another example involves the tax treatment of different types of stock options if an option is an incentive stock option under typical circumstances no income is realised by the recipient upon grant or exercise of the option and no deduction is available to the company at such times employees recognise tax at capital gains rates when the shares acquired upon option exercise are ultimately sold if the applicable holding period requirements are met and the company takes no deduction if the award is a non qualified stock option no income is recognised by the recipient at the time of the grant and no deduction is available to the company at such time rather income is recognised and the deduction is available to the company at the time of option exercise there are a number of limitations on incentive stock options and private equity sponsors generally prefer to maintain the tax deduction accordingly non qualified stock options are more typical a final example involves non qualified deferred compensation if a deferred compensation plan is non qualified all compensation deferred in a particular year and in prior years may be taxable at ordinary income rates in the first year that it is not subject to substantial risk of forfeiture unless payment is deferred to a date or event that is permitted under tax code section 409a s rules governing non qualified deferred compensation 14 looking ahead what can we expect what might be the main themes in the next 12 months for private equity deal activity and fundraising building on the significant rebound during the second half of 2020 us private equity deal flow has continued to increase the second quarter of 2021 for example witnessed a year over year increase of 465 per cent in value and 98 per cent in volume as compared to the same period during 2020 reaching us 181 1 billion over 1 164 deals refinitiv large deals have contributed significantly to this continued growth as the largest 10 announced or completed deals during the first half of 2021 contributed a total of us 103 2 billion during 2020 the covid 19 pandemic disrupted private equity fundraising disproportionately impacting first time funds and funds that had not yet begun fundraising nevertheless large blue chip sponsors with strong pre existing limited partner relationships and fundraisings in process at the beginning of 2020 remained successful we expect that the trends and developments witnessed in 2020 with respect to fund formation will continue as the consolidation in the private equity industry continues too we believe competition for investor capital among private equity funds will persist with alternative fundraising strategies and strategic relationships continuing to play a substantial role likewise we believe that allocation decisions by risk averse limited partners will continue to favour larger established sponsors with strong track records and the ability to absorb the incremental burdens associated with today s market environment as well as the continued scrutiny and enhanced regulation of the private equity industry in addition we believe that private equity funds will encounter valuation issues as uncertainty and volatility within the markets remain particularly for those firms relying on public company comparisons and discounted cash flow valuations finally a decline in public market values could result in an imbalance in investors portfolios causing such investors to sell their private fund stakes to maintain certain asset allocations and it is possible that funding defaults by such investors will increase in conclusion with deal activity levels remaining elevated and cheap financing continuing to be readily available we would expect that during the second half of 2021 private equity sponsor activity levels will remain elevated as in the first half of the year though indications of potential increases in regulatory scrutiny and taxation by the united states china and other governments suggests that the regulatory environment may become less hospitable to private equity sponsor activity high levels of dry powder which preqin reports have reached us 1 6 trillion during the first half of 2021 combined with continued easy access to debt financing are likely to incentivise dealmaking but uncertainty regarding valuations and future performance of many companies as well as of the regulatory landscape and potential worsening of the covid 19 pandemic will remain a fundamental challenge political regulatory and economic uncertainty exacerbated by the continuing covid 19 pandemic which may dampen private equity sponsor activity as variants may emerge and conditions may backslide may also temper deal flow the outlook for the remainder of 2021 however remains optimistic though these expectations remain subject to the aforementioned risks and uncertainties the inside track what factors make private equity practice in your jurisdiction unique overall the united states continues to rank as the top market for private equity as the traditional base of private equity the united states has attracted the lion s share of capital over the years and 2021 has been no different as north america accounted for 56 per cent of total funds and 46 per cent of total capital raised according to preqin through the years the private equity industry has matured and the experience of fund managers has broadened such that investors continue to view the united states as an attractive jurisdiction for their investment what should a client consider when choosing counsel for a complex private equity transaction in your jurisdiction depth of experience in the private equity sector and a creative and commercial approach to problem solving practical experience combined with industry acumen is also critical and counsel should have insight into the needs of every participant as such a client would benefit from counsel that offers cross practice excellence what interesting or unusual issues have you come across in recent matters even as private equity deal activity has rebounded from the economic effects of the covid 19 pandemic and hit record highs in the first half of 2021 private equity firms in the united states have continued to shift much of their focus to the continued use of add on acquisitions to boost the profiles of their existing portfolio companies gp led secondary sales of portfolio companies to newer funds established by the same gp or to continuation funds established by gp private investment in public equity and spac investments as a means to deploy capital although the volume of spacs appears to have begun to diminish during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the frenzy during 2020 we expect private equity firms to continue their use of spacs in the second half of 2021 these blank check companies grew tremendously popular during 2020 due to the flexibility that they afford spacs have provided an opportunistic avenue for investors to deploy capital and take advantage of target companies that look for liquidity in the near future but may choose not to pursue a traditional ipo path we will see how this area develops

images traditionally used in financial services literature would have us believe that everyone s perfect idea of retirement involves sitting in a beach chair soaking up the sun with a book in hand and toes wiggled into the sand but does this unilateral perception reflect the reality of what your client base wants or needs probably not when it comes to planning no one can be put in a solution box but have you thought about how cultural background affects an individual s retirement if not the time is right to begin weighing this consideration into your practice data has shown that a person s retirement vision can be shaped by their ethnicity culture whether they were raised in the u s or abroad or learned family upbringing among other factors to help your clients prioritize what s critical for their success it s important to sync up your retirement planning suggestions with cultural expectations adopting a multicultural planning strategy could help diversify and expand your roster by creating a more connected experience for your prospective and existing clients the financial gap for retirement savers underlying disparity has formed uneven wealth accumulation for white versus non white retirement savers according to the federal reserve s 2019 survey of consumer finances scf study white families 68 have more widespread access to employer sponsored retirement plans a proven driver for accumulating retirement dollars than black 56 hispanic 44 or other non white families 61 for accumulating retirement dollars than black 56 hispanic 44 or other non white families 61 only 44 of black families and just 28 of hispanic families have at least one retirement account compared with 65 of white families when building a financial nest egg nearly 30 of white families have received an inheritance or gift to help them get started this is compared with about 10 of black families 7 of hispanic families and 18 of other non white families among young families younger than age 35 white families have between 11 900 and 24 800 more in median wealth than black hispanic or other non white families for families older than age 55 this gap widens to between 101 700 and 261 100 particularly for white families for some individuals a general distrust of an historically unfair financial system presents a major barrier to investment and retirement saving death of the 60 40 portfolio these are the decade s top performing balanced funds expected retirement age understanding your clients time horizon is a fundamental aspect of retirement planning and a major determinant of anticipating future retirement costs how could cultural attitudes affect an individual s retirement age data shows that the age when a person expects to retire and when they actually do may correlate with their ethnicity according to the employee benefit research institute ebri s 2021 retirement confidence survey roughly 3 in 10 workers questioned expected to retire before age 62 although the median expected retirement age for workers of each ethnicity black hispanic white is 65 a different picture emerged when retirees were asked if they retired earlier later or when planned of black and hispanic retirees 53 were more likely to report they had retired earlier than planned compared with 46 of white retirees when asked about reasons for retiring earlier than expected the top response among white retirees was they could afford to retire earlier than planned the top response among black and hispanic retirees was they had a health problem or disability unrelated to covid 19 family matters when you quiz clients or prospects about their financial goals most probably express a desire to provide for their family in retirement but the meaning of family may have different connotations depending on your client s culture according to the massmutual state of the american family study black and hispanic families are more likely to include extended family 47 and 43 respectively and friends 24 and 15 respectively of asian indian families 41 include non nuclear members and 44 include their parents your critical role according to the ebri study black and hispanic americans are less likely than white retirement savers to work with a personal financial advisor possibly as a result of not knowing where to get good financial or retirement planning advice black and hispanic workers are also more likely to get retirement planning information via an employer plan suggesting you could make a critical difference by providing financial advice and education to culturally diverse workforces understanding how cultural perspectives shape your clients retirement dreams can help you better serve them and employing an all inclusive strategy as part of your overall practice mindset could open the door to a growing segment of prospects and clients this article was originally published in the commonwealth business review a publication of commonwealth

the latest trend sweeping through wealthtech is providing independent advisors with digital access to structured investments but some worry they may be overly simplifying the complex expensive and often risky products envestnet last week announced plans to integrate simon markets a structured investments fintech company that spun out of goldman sachs in 2018 across its technology and managed account ecosystem for advisors to provide structured investments as fee based portfolio solutions fidelity institutional followed suit with a connection between simon and wealthscape fidelity s digital dashboard for rias becoming the first custody and clearing firm to integrate with the wealthtech company simon also partnered with annuities provider financial independence group earlier this year on a new product that unites insurance and structured notes the announcements come on the heels of alternative investments firm icapital network s september acquisition of axio financial another structured note fintech halo investing another startup focused on the market raised 100 million in a series c funding round led by owl capital in october the companies say the new technology is in response to surging advisor demand for access to structured products which are debt securities that use derivatives to provide exposure to an underlying asset like an etf or basket of stocks issuance has jumped from effectively nothing in 2020 to 100 million in early 2021 with jpmorgan chase and morgan stanley being some of the most prolific according to bloomberg we ve seen growing activity in structured investments and clients have been looking for solutions like the one we ve announced said scott bohlen vice president of transaction solutions at fidelity institutional structured products can give an advisor or customer the ability to express a market view that can otherwise be challenging to implement the products have a history of raising eyebrows with the sec expressed concern in 2015 about how structured investments are sold to retail investors jpmorgan faced scrutiny in 2016 for overstating the value of structured notes to clients some worry that new fintech is making it too easy for advisors and clients to access the investments without properly understanding the associated risk structured investments tend to be expensive due to embedded fees and require the purchaser to take on the credit risk of the issuer said amy arnott a portfolio strategist with morningstar the risks can be dramatic lehman brothers structured notes cost investors huge sums of money when the bank filed for bankruptcy in 2008 i would be extremely wary of structured products arnott said a lot of them are callable if the underlying index depreciates you no longer own the note or have the advantage of the coupon structured investments are also plagued with inaccurate pricing and are illiquid due to the lack of a secondary market said scott salaske ceo of first metric a troy michigan based ria with 250 million in assets under management each one is different requiring investors to read through hundreds of pages of prospectus documents to understand a product something few advisors and even fewer clients will ever do salaske said once you get into the instruments themselves you have a whole host of problems salaske said i m never going to recommend a structured note product those behind the software say they re simplifying the experience of researching buying and holding the notes for those who find them useful technology also delivers more education for advisors and their clients evaluating whether the investments are an appropriate fit for a portfolio said tim bonacci president and ceo and luma financial technologies a digital marketplace of structured products and annuities our mission is to simplify the complex drive transparency and objectivity and make sure these products are easier to understand explain and use for advisors around the world bonacci said in an email fidelity also emphasized the educational and training material simon provides as well as portfolio construction analytics to align performance with a client s investment objectives the firm has brought along new trading capabilities and enhancements including an update to its bond beacon fixed income platform to help advisors make more informed portfolio construction decisions said bohlen by integrating with the tamarac wealth dashboard and moneyguide planning software advisors can access simon within envestnet s existing planning analytics portfolio construction and investment management workflows to provide comprehensive wealth management said simon ceo jason broder the products themselves have also evolved over the last decade helping to cast structured investments in a different light broder said you ve seen the industry evolving where everything whether it s the payouts or the fees it s completely transparent broder said these are tools that if used appropriately can be very valuable for clients especially in this market environment specifically low interest rates are impacting yields in fixed income allocations broder said advisors are looking for income and downside protection products for clients nearing or already in retirement added tom sipp head of envestnet s solutions group digital marketplaces for structured investments annuities and alternatives are eliminating traditional impediments and changing the landscape of available products for independent advisors sipp said there is a material demand to include annuities in a diversified portfolio he said the demand has been there and now that we have transparency it s much easier for advisors to meet that demand but improved transparency doesn t always lead to more informed investment decisions salaske said for example how many clients actually read through all of an advisor s disclosures as the recipient of cold calls from banks trying to sell structured investments salaske also worries how they are being marketed to both advisors and clients sales people imply without actually stating that structured investments which are not government insured can replace an fdic insured savings account a distinction that may be lost on retail investors or overlooked by advisors feeling the pressure from yield hungry clients they re just making it too easy to promote products that have significant risks to people don t understand what they re getting into salaske said if something is complex and you don t understand it then people shouldn t be investing in it that unfortunately goes for advisors as well

the move were unimpressed with the details oil prices actually rose on the news it was just the latest step biden has taken to show he is doing everything he can to combat inflation as gasoline and

financial predicts that inflationary pressures will ease as supply chains sort themselves out i expect to see inflation slow in 2022 he said what can presidents do the white house has limited tools for reversing higher prices that task belongs more to the fed which can raise borrowing costs to cool a sizzling economy during the 1960s and 1970s though presidents increasingly felt pressure to do

the result of illegal conduct the white house is also stepping up anti trust enforcement of the meatpacking industry seeking to increase competition and drive down meat prices his decision to re nominate powell to lead the fed was meant in part to reassure the financial markets of washington s resolve to prevent consumer prices from spiraling out of his control the other likely contender for the job lael brainard a member of the fed s board of governors was perceived as less hawkish toward inflation why did biden tap the strategic petroleum reserve tuesday the idea was that by putting more oil on the market prices would fall that hasn t happened but depending on what happens in the rest of the world there s still a chance it could work america s petroleum reserve holds about 605 million barrels of oil in underground caves in texas and louisiana it was designed in the 1970s in response to the arab oil embargo to store oil in case there was a supply disruption or emergency but the dynamics of the global oil industry changed dramatically in recent years and now the u s exports more oil than it imports the 50 million barrels that biden promised to release will likely be sold slowly at a rate of about 1 million barrels per day meaning that the new influx of oil could last about two months adding even a small amount of oil to the market can tip it into surplus and potentially lower the price said jim burkhard of ihs markit the immediate price reaction is not the final judgment on the effectiveness of this of the effort he added it will really be in the months

the job lael brainard a member of the fed s board of governors was perceived as less hawkish toward inflation why did biden tap the strategic petroleum reserve tuesday the idea was that by putting more oil on the market prices would fall that hasn t happened but depending on what happens in the rest of the world there s still a chance it could work america s petroleum reserve holds about 605 million barrels of oil in underground caves in texas and louisiana it was designed in the 1970s in response to the arab oil embargo to store oil in case there was a supply disruption or emergency but the dynamics of the global oil industry changed dramatically in recent years and now the u s exports more oil than it imports the 50 million barrels that biden promised to release will likely be sold slowly at a rate of about 1 million barrels per day meaning that the new influx of oil could last about two months adding even a small amount of oil to the market can tip it into surplus and potentially lower the price said jim burkhard of ihs markit the immediate price reaction is not the final judgment on the effectiveness of this of the effort he added it will really be in the months

price inflation is affecting everything from entertainment and electronics to things like food and clothing according to reader s digest a shortage of shipping containers a labor crisis shortages of raw materials and even climate change are to blame for this you may have heard of the microchip shortage when the pandemic first began factories that manufacture microchips for electronics and vehicles shut down while orders continued to come in these factories are still playing catch up and struggling to meet demand gas prices rose 42 7 in the last year the pandemic shutting things down for a while and the resurgent demand for oil after lockdowns cop producers off guard and they raised prices to compensate for low supply clothing prices rose 4 2 in august this is due in part to former president trump s trade policies with china making the price of cotton rise according to npr airfare and hotel prices are on the rise as more americans are encouraged to get vaccinated and we ll start traveling again advertisement president biden aims to do what presidents often can t beat inflation share copy link copy lbj tried jawboning richard nixon issued a presidential edict the ford administration printed buttons exhorting americans to whip inflation now over the years american presidents have tried and mostly floundered in their efforts to quell the economic and political menace of consumer inflation now president joe biden is giving it a shot confronting a spike in gasoline and other consumer prices that s bedeviling american households biden on tuesday ordered the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the u s strategic petroleum reserve the move done in coordination with several other major nations is intended to contain energy costs oil markets having anticipated the move were unimpressed with the details oil prices actually rose on the news it was just the latest step biden has taken to show he is doing everything he can to combat inflation as gasoline and food prices in particular have imposed a growing burden on american households on monday he announced that he would reappoint jerome powell as chair of the federal reserve a move meant in part to reassure financial markets that washington is serious about containing consumer prices last month he announced a deal to ease supply backlogs at the port of los angeles by extending operations there to 24 hours a day seven days a week yet none of the president s actions is considered likely to make a meaningful dent in surging prices anytime soon i don t think the president has many levers to pull to bring down the rate of inflation any time soon said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the things he is doing are positive and there s no downside to them but they are on the margins they re not going to move the dial very much inflation is always a tough foe made even more complicated by the unusual recovery from the pandemic recession with shortages of supplies and workers and shipping bottlenecks forcing up prices what is happening to consumer prices the government s consumer price index skyrocketed 6 2 in the 12 months that ended in october the sharpest such jump since 1990 coming after nearly four decades of more or less stable prices the cpi news represents a once in a generation uptick in inflation said sarah binder a george washington university political scientist who studies the fed the problem is pretty stark because it s something that voters notice it s hard to escape the impact of a spike in inflation on your daily life whether it s buying milk or buying gas the average price of regular gasoline has shot up to 3 40 a gallon from 2 11 a year ago according to aaa compounding the pain and heightening the pressure on biden inflation has been outpacing americans income adjusted for price increases average hourly wages were actually down 1 2 last month compared with a year earlier inflation is painful and it s always political said diane swonk chief economist at the accounting and consulting firm grant thornton what s behind the price spike it s partly the consequence of very good news the world economy and america s in particular rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from last year s brief but intense recession it was a result of super low interest rates massive government spending and eventually the broad rollout of vaccines that allowed more of the economy to reopen the swiftness of the rebound caught businesses off guard a year and a half ago they were bracing for the worst laying off workers letting shelves and warehouses go bare reducing investment and factory output and energy companies did the same they cut production of oil and gas as demand for transportation fuels plummeted once demand came roaring back they were unprepared they found themselves scrambling to call back workers and buy enough to fill customer orders ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic countries competed over boatloads of overpriced liquid natural gas periodic covid 19 outbreaks shut down asian ports and factories global supply chains broke down as costs rose many businesses found that they could pass the burden along to consumers in the form of higher prices in the meantime many families had banked their government relief checks and built up their savings some critics also blamed biden s 1 9 trillion emergency aid package for overheating the economy and contributing to inflation pressures economists are divided over how long the inflation spike will last gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial predicts that inflationary pressures will ease as supply chains sort themselves out i expect to see inflation slow in 2022 he said what can presidents do the white house has limited tools for reversing higher prices that task belongs more to the fed which can raise borrowing costs to cool a sizzling economy during the 1960s and 1970s though presidents increasingly felt pressure to do something about inflation because it had become a serious political threat president lyndon johnson tried to persuade companies to forgo price increases and labor unions to limit wage demands a practice known as jawboning when bethlehem steel raised steel prices in 1965 johnson criticized its executives as unpatriotic and they backed down according to robert samuelson s book the great inflation and its aftermath when egg prices rose in 1966 johnson ordered america s surgeon general to highlight the health hazards of cholesterol in eggs with the intent of lowering egg sales and therefore prices nixon imposed wage and price controls in 1971 and 1973 which briefly stifled inflation only to see prices soar once the controls were lifted gerald ford s whip inflation now program encouraged americans to grow their own vegetables reduce their food waste and consume less americans responded mostly by mocking the program some wore the president s win buttons upside down explaining that the resulting nim stood for no immediate miracles what has biden done biden last week signed into a law a 1 trillion public works program which pours money into fixing roads bridges

the job lael brainard a member of the fed s board of governors was perceived as less hawkish toward inflation why did biden tap the strategic petroleum reserve tuesday the idea was that by putting more oil on the market prices would fall that hasn t happened but depending on what happens in the rest of the world there s still a chance it could work america s petroleum reserve holds about 605 million barrels of oil in underground caves in texas and louisiana it was designed in the 1970s in response to the arab oil embargo to store oil in case there was a supply disruption or emergency but the dynamics of the global oil industry changed dramatically in recent years and now the u s exports more oil than it imports the 50 million barrels that biden promised to release will likely be sold slowly at a rate of about 1 million barrels per day meaning that the new influx of oil could last about two months adding even a small amount of oil to the market can tip it into surplus and potentially lower the price said jim burkhard of ihs markit the immediate price reaction is not the final judgment on the effectiveness of this of the effort he added it will really be in the months
