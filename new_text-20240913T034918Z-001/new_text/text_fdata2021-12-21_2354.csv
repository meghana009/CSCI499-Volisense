spot gold is struggling to make use of risk averse market conditions on monday and remains subdued under 1800 an on the day rise in real yields is the main reason why gold is struggling update the price of gold xau usd is down on the new york session by some 0 35 at the time of writing the price has fallen from a high of 1 804 17 to a low of 1 791 78 so far spot trades at 1 792 as it move sin toward what would be expected to be a strong area of support as per the daily chart s structure below meanwhile us stocks are lower in midday trading as the spread of the omicron variant of covid 19 amid peak holiday travel and a setback for us president joe biden s spending plans hit investor sentiment the s p 500 slumped 1 7 to 4 540 89 the nasdaq composite fell 1 8 to 14 891 14 and the dow jones industrial average declined 1 8 to 34 725 21 the netherlands entered a full lockdown sunday in an effort to stem omicron s spread while several other european countries including the uk were contemplating similar restrictions before christmas omicron is now present in 45 of 50 us states according to data from the us centers of disease control and prevention xau usd 15 min and daily charts the price is embarking on the support are on the short term charts with 1 790 guarding the way to 1 780 as per the daily chart s support area end of update despite a broadly risk off market tone and an underperforming us dollar spot gold xau usd prices are struggling to make headway on monday prices are currently flat on the session but have slipped back from earlier session highs in the 1805 area to current levels around 1797 in recent trade the 50 day moving average at 1795 provided support earlier in the session but if this level goes xau usd is likely to slip back to test early mid december highs and the 200dma in the 1790 area gold s lackluster performance on monday owes itself to the fact that real yields in the us have been advancing 10 year tips yields to which gold is very sensitive are up about 2bps on the day and back to the north of the 1 0 level but that still leaves the 10 year tips yield well within recent late november december ranges of about 1 1 to 0 9 5 year tips yields are current up about 4bps but are also within recent week s ranges whether the most recent rally in real yields can build into a broader move higher is the key question that of course would be bad for gold remember that as real yields rise the opportunity cost of holding non yielding gold also rises the recent hawkish shift on the fed has some strategists betting on a move higher in real yields recall last week that the fed doubled the pace of its qe taper which fed member christopher waller said indicated that the march meeting was live for a rate hike and recall that the bank pointed to three rate hikes in 2022 longer term nominal yields have remained subdued in recent weeks despite this hawkish shift amid concerns for the longer term outlook for growth it only takes inflation expectations to fall at a greater rate than long term growth expectations for this to cause real yields to rise something a hawkish fed could trigger gold traders should thus be on notice that market conditions could turn increasingly bearish for the precious metal in 2022

feared outcome is that it could push inflation even higher if it leads to closures at ports factories and other key points of the long global supply chains leading to customers already ensnarled operations could worsen such troubles helped drive prices at the consumer level in november up 6 8 from a year earlier the fastest inflation in nearly four decades but some economists argue that omicron could have the opposite effect if the variant leads to lockdowns or scares consumers into staying home economic activity could slow and with it the surging demand that has overwhelmed supply chains and driven up consumer prices there s been a lot of pent up demand that s been satisfied and i think the consumer is becoming much more price conscious said christopher harvey head of equity

given high inflation that has lasted longer than expected the fed last week targeted an earlier end for its program to buy billions of dollars of bonds each month which is meant to keep long term interest rates low many of its members also said they expect the fed to raise short term rates which would be a more impactful move three times in 2022 ultralow rates engineered by central banks

markets were hammered monday as investors grew more concerned the covid omicron variant could have a significant impact on the global economy five experts weigh in on what they think may be ahead for u s stocks chris hyzy chief investment officer at bank of america private bank says the stock market has come back to fundamentals get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters coming off the extraordinary gains of 2020 and 2021 we re almost back to the basics again you have to take a position on earnings growth and profit growth from our perspective should be better than expected consensus is out there with a 7 or 8 move but when you look at some of the trends particularly consumer spending despite the growth worries we re all talking about right now when we look back on all this and we go to the summer of next year we think this is an opportunity to reposition portfolios the growth worries the growth shocks that are being repriced right now we would fade that we think growth is actually going to be better than expected despite the latest worries steve weiss founder of short hills capital says the federal reserve may be making the right move at the wrong time it s very clear evidence that the market is most concerned about covid and the variants and not that concerned about not passing build back better and not as concerned about the fed in terms of raising rates except for the fact i m going to modify that and modify it importantly that the fed is tightening monetary policy at the wrong time so it s growth fears that are hitting everything and it s pretty indiscriminate liz young head of investment strategy at sofi focuses her forecast on how 2021 could close out we have uncertainty obviously heading into the end of the year we keep asking ourselves is the santa claus rally at risk it s already not happening the santa claus rally usually starts to take shape about mid month we re here on the 20th there s no rally i think that we could go lower from here maybe we rally into the end of the year but that s going to have absolutely nothing to do with santa claus it has everything to do with the idea that we have uncertainty over covid and we have a fed that isn t going to save us this time and frankly they shouldn t save us they are tightening at the right time in the sense that the economy is still pretty strong regardless of what the market is saying the economy is doing ok inflation is hot they have to control that in order for the economy to continue growing through 2022 joe terranova senior managing director at virtus investment partners says it all comes back to risk i struggle with a lot of these short term calls i think what is so important and really missing at all times from these conversations what s the most important word to all of us if we re investors if we re speculators short term long term it s the word risk it s the primary word in the financial services vocabulary and it s one that s reshaping itself right now why risk is always present and we are now coming off of 2021 that has the highest risk adjusted return for investors in decades you have low realized volatility strong performance for the s p now you have a pivot on the part of the federal reserve the abundant liquidity the oceans of liquidity they re pulling back on that and in that process a lot of the riskier strategies whether it was allocating to hyper growth stocks or high valuation technology stocks or small caps that were correlated to this roaring 20s narrative that never actually unfolded risk is now being reshaped and it s being exchanged from weaker hands into stronger hands and i think the right thing to ask yourself is is this the onset of the bear market absolutely not in my opinion credit markets are trading fine today this is a correction that is going to provide an opportunity and that opportunity presents itself depending upon where you sit on the risk curve jon najarian co founder of marketrebellion com explains his current strategy i ve been active for the last three days i guess i ve been converting stock positions into simulated long stock positions by getting into options just because the volatility was cheap enough when we had the cheaper volatility last week i thought it was prudent to get out of stocks which i d been doing for the better part of two weeks and getting into call spreads to simulate that same long exposure so i was doing that in a host of stocks everything from jpmorgan to lululemon to bank of new york that just seemed like a prudent thing to do if vol gets high enough and i don t really think that we re going to see too many days where we see joe manchin shutting down build back better where we see davos being canceled and omicron cases exploding in new york and other parts of the country all at the same time i don t think we re going to see too many more days like this so if we get that significant pop in volatility i d be willing to get right back into these stocks and then sell those higher valued pumped up options against them

with homicides shootings and carjackings rising and her reelection prospects dimming mayor lori lightfoot on monday demanded an immediate moratorium on electronic monitoring for the most violent offenders and a surge in federal prosecutors and atf agents to prosecute gun crimes in a speech designed to reassure frightened chicago residents and visitors lightfoot also promised to dramatically expand the reach of cameras with license plates readers and renewed her push for city council approval of her stalled gang asset forfeiture ordinance public safety has been is and will continue to be my highest priority keeping you safe is my priority i wake every morning with this as my first concern and i push myself every day and all involved to step up and do more because we cannot continue to endure the level of violence we are now experiencing she said although she claims to have been aggressively executing on a comprehensive plan lightfoot acknowledged that chicago will end the year far short of the expectation that we all had when the year began that is a great disappointment to me personally the superintendent and all involved no excuses we must do better she said we have taken stock analyzed the data and will be making the necessary changes going into the new year none of us will rest until we bring peace to our city the mayor s pre christmas address about the surge of violent crime that threatens to undermine chicago s economic future was delivered before a friendly audience at the gold dome fieldhouse at garfield park 100 n central park ave reading from a teleprompter lightfoot sounded familiar themes but unveiled no new policing strategies too many guns too many gangs too many people being murdered by offenders out on electronic monitoring with virtually no supervision or community interventions the cook county electronic monitoring system is fundamentally broken in a way that is making our city unsafe the cook county courts need to get the balance back and reserve electronic monitoring for only non violent offenders the mayor said but until that happens i am calling for an immediate moratorium on electronic monitoring for offenders where the lead charge is murder attempted murder aggravated gun possession felons in possession sex crimes illegal gun possession vehicular carjacking kidnapping or attempted kidnapping or other crimes of violence before the pandemic lightfoot argued that there were around 1 200 offenders on electronic monitoring now the number is almost 3 400 with violent dangerous criminals accounting for much of the increase she said as of monday the sheriff s office had 2 706 offenders on electronic monitoring that s up from 2 417 before the pandemic the time for talk is over we need concrete and definitive steps to be taken as a city we cannot make progress on combatting violence in our neighborhoods if the county is not doing its part she said matt walberg a spokesperson for cook county sheriff tom dart declined to comment on lightfoot s moratorium demand mary wisniewski a spokesperson for chief cook county judge tim evans said monday in an email statement we have been informed that the mayor made a statement regarding electronic monitoring however we have not yet received her request we share the concerns about the tragic violence in our community this is both a local and a national problem we look forward to continuing to work with our partners in finding solutions to this complex issue cook county public defender sharone mitchell said monday the mayor s solutions were based on fear the mayor s regressive proposal calls for the pretrial detention of thousands of people who haven t been convicted of anything and the plan could only be achieved by exploding the population of cook county jail in the middle of a pandemic according to an email statement it s clearly unconstitutional given that everyone is entitled to an individualized hearing on the specifics of their case but more importantly it would result in the incarceration of an untold number of people who did nothing but get accused of a criminal offense to increase the number of gun investigations and gun seizures lightfoot asked u s attorney general merrick garland to detail additional atf agents to chicago for six months along with yet another increase in federal prosecutors and atf agents although it comes as cold comfort to victims families lightfoot reiterated that chicago s crime surge is part of a national trend being duplicated in new york los angeles atlanta washington d c philadelphia st louis and denver what she failed to mention is the fact that chicago once again has nearly twice as many murders as new york and l a combined lightfoot touted the 48 percent homicide clearance rate she called improved but not good enough but that figure was also misleading the city s own data portal shows there were 169 arrests out of 774 homicides this year the 337 homicides that lightfoot counted as solved include cases that were closed exceptionally because prosecutors wouldn t approve charges or detectives say they know who did it but can t get enough evidence to seek charges it also includes murders from previous years that were solved this year so only about 22 of the 2021 homicides listed in the city s data portal have resulted in arrests according to the city s own data lightfoot devoted a healthy chunk of her speech to highlighting her efforts to confront the entrenched poverty and decades of neglect that she firmly believes are the root causes of crime violence and crime are the manifestations of deeper problems they are the offspring of poverty and neglect and the psychological trauma that comes with it she said i have and will commit every bit of law enforcement muscle to fighting this fight but i also know that lasting peace and safety will only come to this city when the underlying root causes of violence and crime are also addressed once and for all through dec 20 there have been 812 homicides chicago s highest total since the 789 homicides recorded in 1995 according to records compiled by the cook county medical examiner s office that s up from 504 homicides in 2019 and 762 homicides last year at least 4 360 people have been shot in chicago this year compared to 4 038 shooting victims in 2020 and 2 573 in 2019 carjackings are at their highest point ever according to records going back to 2001 they re up from 552 in 2019 to 1 324 last year and 1 734 through dec 12 of this year as chicago inched toward the dreaded homicide mark she tried desperately to avoid lightfoot acknowledged that unless the chicago police department produces the results that reduce that fear factor nothing else matters but the mayor has also tried without success to shift the blame away from demoralized and overworked chicago police officers and toward prosecutors judges and retailers in recent weeks everyday residents business and political leaders have started fighting back to lightfoot s chagrin bucktown residents hired their own private security firm at their own expense to combat the epidemic of carjackings in the neighborhood ald george cardenas 12th the mayor s own deputy floor leader told the chicago sun times that lightfoot should give her top cop a few more months to get a handle on chicago s crime pandemic but if he can t she should dump police supt david brown and his leadership team business leaders have also turned up the heat on city hall illinois retail merchants association president rob karr accused lightfoot of abdicating responsibility for the retail crime wave sweeping chicago and instead pressuring merchants to implement their own costly unworkable and racially insensitive security measures jack lavin president and ceo of the chicagoland chamber of commerce said chicago was at a crossroads because of rising crime and skyrocketing commercial property taxes with the low murmur now becoming a loud roar last week the chicago sun times added even more fuel to the fire by shining a spotlight on our city our safety the mayor s ambitious plan to flood chicago s 15 most violent community areas with resources not just violence intervention programs but help with jobs and housing and health the newspaper disclosed that nearly a year into the effort gun violence is up in at least nine of the areas lightfoot closed her anti crime address by appealing to chicago s business and philanthropic communities to do even more by donating their money and their time to what she called the most urgent and noble cause of our time ladies and gentlemen we need you no one mayor or police superintendent can do this alone we need partners and partnerships that are broad and deep she said there is no greater or higher calling than to be relentless in our shared mission to bring peace to our communities i need all of you to be on this journey with me there is no problem that we cannot tackle if we lock arms and do it together contributing frank main

peter navarro discusses soros who and what he is in this clip you can see more at the first watch soros swinging elections in swing states most now know that soros funded da ag and sheriff s races around the country to destroy our justice system but most don t realize what he did to corrupt our election process the secretary of state project was an american non profit progressive 527 political action committee it focused on electing reform minded progressive secretaries of state in battleground states they hold an important role in overseeing the election process the group was co founded in july 2006 by james rucker formerly director of grassroots mobilization for moveon org political action and moveon org civic action rucker is also a co founder of color of change a race baiting left wing hate group this project one of so many like it was funded by george soros and members of soros tied democracy alliance in 2008 democrat house outlet politico ran a story about the obama campaign calling the secretaries of state the democrat firewall in anticipation of a photo finish presidential election democrats have built an administrative firewall designed to protect their electoral interests in five of the most important battleground states the bulwark consists of control of secretary of state offices in five key states iowa minnesota nevada new mexico and ohio where the difference between victory and defeat in the 2004 presidential election was no more than 120 000 votes in any one of them with a democrat now in charge of the offices which oversee and administer their state s elections the party is better positioned than in the previous elections to advance traditional democratic interests such as increasing voter registration and boosting turnout rather than republican priorities such as stamping out voter fraud perhaps more important in those five states democrats are now in a more advantageous position when it comes to the interpretation and administration of election law a development that could benefit barack obama if any of those states are closely contested on election day the effort began in 2006 when a group of liberal california activists created an independent 527 group designed to elect secretaries of state the secretary of state project ran independent ads of its own and ensured that donors many of whom were affiliated with democracy alliance a network of wealthy fundraisers that channels money to liberal causes across the country knew which candidates deserved donations members of the democracy alliance include billionaires george soros and tom steyer in 2017 and 2018 alone democracy alliance members spent 600 million on various far left causes the president of democracy alliance is gene lemarche a long time soros friend before joining atlantic in 2007 he served as vice president and director of u s programs for the open society foundations osf launching the organization s pivotal work on challenges to social justice and democracy in the united states the chairman of the board of democracy alliance is or was at the time john stocks a senior advisor to the nea the nation s largest union representing 3 million teachers he is very far left the secretary of state project is allegedly gone but the goal and efforts of groups like the democracy alliance continued unabated democracy alliance one of their successes was getting democrat mark ritchie elected as minnesota secretary of state in 2006 ritchie used his authority as secretary of state to keep the vote count open in the razor close contest between norm coleman and al franken in 2008 on november 14 2008 two weeks after the election with all the votes counted coleman looked to be the winner by 215 votes a mandatory hand recount of all ballots then took place and with a willing ritchie overseeing the effort canvassing boards in liberal minnesota decided that nearly 1000 absentee ballots had been wrongly rejected as part of the initial vote count and when those ballots were included al franken and not norm coleman was certified as the winner by ritchie it was very corrupt the michigan secretary of state is jocelyn benson a 43 year old harvard educated attorney she is a progressive activist on voting rights issues benson lived and worked in montgomery alabama where she worked for the southern poverty law center as an investigative journalist researching white supremacist and neo nazi organizations she also worked as a summer associate for voting rights and election law for the naacp legal defense and educational fund when elected in 2018 she became the first democrat to occupy the secretary of state s office in michigan since 1994 it was in detroit where election observers were kept at a distance and their ability to watch the vote counting was obscured by paper placed in windows the pennsylvania secretary of state is katherine bookvar also elected in 2018 this woman said about donald trump only 6 weeks after he took office in 2017 using the title president before the word trump really demeans the office of the presidency in august 2019 she was named co chair of the elections committee of the national association of secretaries of state just like with benson boockvar s professional life has not been directed at free and fair elections but rather elections that draw in the absolute maximum number of votes whether valid or not standardization and transparency of election practices across all 50 states and the political subdivisions within each state make vote manipulation more difficult you won t hear one democrat calling for it other secretaries elected thanks to funds from the sos project were mentioned at the spectator the strategic targeting of the sos project yielded astounding results in 2008 and 2006 in 2008 sos project backed democrats linda mcculloch montana natalie tennant west virginia robin carnahan missouri and kate brown oregon won their races only carnahan was an incumbent the center for public integrity reported that the group performed this electoral feat in the 2008 election cycle with a mere 280 000 in 2006 along with minnesota s ritchie sos project endorsed jennifer brunner ohio who defied federal law last year by refusing to take steps to verify 200 000 questionable voter registrations trounced her opponent 55 to 41 democrats supported by the group also won that year in new mexico nevada and iowa the group claims it spent about 500 000 in that election cycle there were others mentioned at politico
the value versus growth debate and its effect on performance has dominated headlines for years but new research from morningstar shows that company size drove stock returns in 2021 in fact the largest u s stocks beat their small company peers by 13 percentage points according to the chicago research firm that s the biggest gap in 11 years the outperformance is particularly notable given that small stocks beat larger ones for the first five months of 2021 the takeaway for investors however might be to emphasize smaller companies in their portfolios because the lead that big stocks have enjoyed is unlikely to last small value is the least expensive segment as a group currently trading at 91 percent of its morningstar fair value estimate wrote lauren solberg in a morningstar post large growth and large blend companies look the most overvalued as a group trading at approximately 20 percent above their average fair values solberg argues that small companies which are riskier than their larger counterparts do well when economies are recovering at the beginning of the year people were optimistic that businesses would reopen and flourish given the efficacy and availability of covid 19 vaccines at the same time central bank policies were accommodative in an attempt to keep interest rates low morningstar s small cap index was up 17 percent compared to 11 percent for the firm s large cap benchmark through june 1 in the second half of the year however challenges posed by new covid 19 variants inflation pressures supply chain glitches and forecasts about interest rate increases outweighed the good news in early 2021 since june 1 morningstar s small cap index has lost 3 9 percent while large cap stocks gained 12 4 percent this suggests that investors are gravitating to larger less volatile stocks such as apple and microsoft looking at the year the morningstar u s large cap index was up more than 25 percent as of december 17 many of these stocks benefited from megatrends such as remote work and the surge in online shopping the u s small cap index meanwhile was up 11 29 percent as of the end of last month
new research outlines extensive carbon emissions recovery period for ecosystems affected by bushfires two years ago vast swathes of australia particularly along the east coast were engulfed in a bushfire crisis while the impact was immediate and devastating for the environment flora and fauna the long term effects of the extreme drought and raging bushfires on australia s carbon cycle have been captured by an international team of researchers including researchers from the university of wollongong and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl in the united states in a paper published last week 9 december in agu advances the research team including dr nicholas deutscher senior professor david griffith professor clare murphy paton walsh dr voltaire velazco and dr nicholas jones from uow found the bushfires on australia s east coast combined with drought released an amount of carbon that is nearly double australia s annual fossil fuel emissions using three satellites orbiting carbon observatory 2 tropomi and modis along with uow s atmospheric gas measuring instrument positioned at the wollongong campus the researchers tracked the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide omitted by the bushfires and the process of photosynthesis and regrowth in areas impacted by drought and bushfires dr nicholas deutscher from uow s centre for atmospheric chemistry said the drought that preceded the bushfires had laid the groundwork for the unprecedented bushfires that would burn for months as 2019 gave way to 2020 the conditions prior to the bushfires were so dry droughts suppress photosynthesis reducing the amount of co2 absorbed from the atmosphere which meant that carbon uptake had already been disrupted by the time the bushfires occurred dr deutscher said bushfires release co2 into the atmosphere through combustion the immense amount of carbon dioxide that was released during the bushfires was more than an entire year of fossil fuel emissions one other thing we can conclude is that bushfires do not appear to be net neutral from a greenhouse gas perspective which contradicts many earlier and popular opinions professor clare murphy and dr nicholas deutscher with uow s atmospheric gas measuring instrument dr brendan byrne a postdoctoral fellow at jpl and lead researcher on the paper said the new satellite measurements allowed the researchers to track the carbon cycle response from space and demonstrate that cooler conditions are necessary to enable the environment to recover from such events the researchers estimate it will take 20 years for australia s east coast ecosystems to make a full recovery from the bushfires a timeline that would be extended if more bushfires were to occur during that period heat and drought events driven by climate change may increase the frequency of bushfires and the recovery time of ecosystems which threatens the carbon stocks of the region dr byrne said using these satellite measurements we were able to track how ecosystems lost or gained carbon during this event we were able to see that ecosystems that were impacted by drought but did not burn quickly recaptured carbon when conditions became cooler and wetter however in the areas that burned we saw that the carbon losses in just one year wiped out many years of carbon sequestration this has implications for the future of carbon stocks in regions like this which are expected to warm as a result of climate change and may take longer to recover from bushfires the researchers said the findings highlighted the ability to use multiple satellites to track the carbon cycle process from space supported by on the ground measuring instruments uow s atmospheric measuring instrument has been in place for 25 years

houston dec 20 2021 prnewswire voss capital llc voss a significant shareholder of griffon corp nyse gff griffon or the company issued the following public statement in opposition to griffon s planned acquisition of hunter fan company for 845 million in a transaction announced earlier today voss has nominated several highly qualified candidates for election as directors at the company s upcoming annual meeting in mid february in our opinion griffon s ill advised decision to buy hunter fan company from midocean partners demonstrates the board s continued disregard for shareholders and causes us to further question whether griffon s directors are protecting griffon s shareholders best interests the sheer size of this acquisition places tremendous risk squarely on the company s shareholders for management s ability to integrate and execute adding insult to injury the griffon board is not putting this significant hunter transaction up for a vote of shareholders quite frankly management and the board have not earned the right nor have the credibility or track record to engage in such a high stakes deal we believe this acquisition is wrong for shareholders for many reasons a few of which are detailed below unattractive valuation griffon says their 845 million purchase price1 is attractive we disagree griffon is paying 9 4x their estimate of fiscal 2023 ebitda2 for hunter fan company griffon currently trades at under 8x ev fy 2023 ebitda and is paying a far higher multiple to acquire hunter fan company than griffon s current or recent valuation given griffon is trading near a 5 year low valuation and building products transaction valuations are hitting record highs we believe the company should be selling not buying also why is the company citing a multiple of their projected fy 2023 ebitda what is hunter fan s ebitda for the last twelve months and what assumptions is griffon management making to reach their fy 2023 figure griffon claims that the deal will add 0 50 to eps this is irrelevant this metric ignores return on invested capital and is purely the result of the company using debt to finance the acquisition execution risk all the facts and figures show that griffon s current management team has operated its existing businesses poorly if they can t effectively manage the company s existing businesses why add complexity this ineptitude is shown by griffon s total shareholder return tsr consistently lagging that of its own self selected peer group for example over the five years ending on dec 20 2021 griffon generated a tsr of 8 53 below the median tsr of 61 for the 21 peers griffon disclosed in its most recent proxy statement the hunter fan company acquisition will be the largest in griffon s history and is immense relative to the company s current size the 845 million purchase price is more than 55 of griffon s market cap and more than 35 of its enterprise value 3 griffon s weak tsr and low roic clearly demonstrates that its management has not earned the right to invest more capital especially in a new unrelated business the board expects to close this huge acquisition by the end of january 2022 an ambitious target to complete a deal of this magnitude our view is that this deal was structured and the company s balance sheet leveraged specifically to prevent shareholders from voting on the acquisition therefore it seems the board may have been concerned that shareholders would reject this deal the board likely understood how poorly this deal would be received especially given underlying shareholder discontent as shown by low shareholder support for say on pay and individual directors as well as our ongoing proxy contest conflict of interest finally we have serious questions about the deal process griffon s lead independent director kevin sullivan is a managing director at midocean partners the private equity firm who has owned hunter fan for 14 years and is rumored to have struggled to sell the company mr sullivan s connection strikes us as an inherent conflict of interest irrespective of what safeguards griffon might claim were put in place this deal has all the hallmarks of another instance of incestuous insider dealing we will be delivering to griffon a books and records demand under delaware law requesting that they provide us with information that will allow us to further investigate the relevant facts and circumstances leading up to and including the process and diligence that led to the acquisition of hunter fan for the aforementioned reasons this deal is wrong for griffon shareholders it exemplifies the long standing issues with the current board and provides yet another reason why shareholders should elect voss capital s qualified nominees at griffon s upcoming annual meeting in february this year s vote represents an opportunity to finally add truly independent directors to the griffon board who will work to dissolve griffon s outdated conglomerate structure and realize value for all shareholders a process we estimate will yield over 45 share in net cash proceeds for griffon shareholders this compares to the current status quo of allowing the management team to empire build receive outlandish compensation and destroy shareholder value it remains our steadfast view that poor corporate governance has been a key contributor to the flat griffon stock price since 2005 and a 10 return for shareholders since january 2017 we hope our fellow shareholders will embrace a step in the right direction by electing our proposed slate in order to break away from the archaic boardroom culture at griffon stockholders can call saratoga proxy consulting llc at 212 257 1311 or 888 368 0379 if they have any questions with the voting process the last day to buy stock

gross margin decreased from our prior year period by 3 6 million or 58 6 operating income for the twelve month period ended october 3 2021 decreased by 3 4 million to a loss of 0 5 from income of 3 9 million during the prior year the erosion in the gross margin and operating profit is primarily due to lower revenue across both segments unfavorable manufacturing overhead adjustments on reduced production volume and some shifts in product mix toward less profitable product groups general and administrative expenses decreased by 0 2 million as compared to the prior year offsetting a small portion of the gross margin decline as of october 3 2021 the company had working capital of 12 9 million as compared to 11 7 million as of september 27 2020 during the twelve months we generated operating cash flow of 0 5 million received proceeds from the exercise of warrants of 0 3 million paid down our line of credit by 0 4 million spent 0 9 million for the purchase of 449 088 shares against our previously announced stock repurchase plans and 0 3 million on acquisitions of property and equipment we ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of 3 9 million as compared to 4 7 million as of the fiscal year end 2020 as of october 3 2021 the company had an outstanding payable balance of zero against our working line of credit the line of credit allows for borrowing up to a maximum of 2 3 million as of october 3 2021 our outstanding accounts receivable was 3 2 million danny schoening ceo of optex systems holdings inc commented the pandemic and covid had an undeniable effect on our business with almost a 30 reduction in revenue the past year we focused on two areas first we took the operational steps necessary to preserve cash while continuing to invest in key technology programs required for long term growth second we stayed extremely close to our customers maintained our strong market share position and were successful in building the backlog to position us well for 2022 with a slow return to normalization our business is recovering briskly as we begin to execute on our 67 5 year over year increase in backlog we will strive to regain the momentum we had in 2019 and 2020 and intend to exit 2022 with a broader product and process offering while having maintained each and every customer our key performance measures for the twelve months ended october 3 2021 and september 27 2020 are summarized below during the previous eighteen months through october 3 2021 we experienced a reduction in new orders and ending customer backlog in our optex richardson segment we attribute the lower orders to a combination of factors including a covid 19 driven slow down of contract awards for both u s military sales and foreign military sales fms primarily during the second half of fiscal year 2020 combined with significant shifting in defense spending budget allocations in us military sales and fms away from army ground system vehicles toward other military agency applications in addition the pandemic has caused several program delays throughout the defense supply chain as a result of plant shutdowns employee illnesses travel restrictions remote work arrangements and similar supplier chain issues our applied optics center segment experienced a significant decline in orders during the second half of fiscal year 2020 however during the last twelve months the segment has seen a sizable increase in new orders as a result of increased military spending in army infantry optical equipment and an increased customer base backlog as of october 3 2021 was 27 3 million as compared to a backlog of 16 3 million as of september 27 2020 representing an increase of 67 5 during fiscal year 2021 optex systems holdings received new orders totaling 29 2 million a 65 9 increase as compared to new orders of 17 6 million during the prior year the 2021 orders consist of 7 6 million in support of our periscope product line 19 6 million attributable to the applied optics center and 1 2 million attributable to sighting systems and support and 0 8 million in other products we are seeing increases in demand and proposal activity for both laser coated filters and optical assemblies and anticipate additional order bookings for both our commercial and military products for deliveries beginning in fiscal year 2022 on august 2 2021 the company announced a contract award of 8 4 million with a new customer as part of a twenty four month purchase order for laser filter units and on september 21 2021 the company announced a 3 million commercial order for optical devices we use adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda as an additional measure for evaluating the performance of our business as net income includes the significant impact of noncash valuation gains and losses on warrant liabilities noncash compensation expenses related to equity stock issues as well as depreciation amortization interest expenses and federal income taxes we believe that adjusted ebitda is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance because it permits period over period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before the excluded items which we do not consider relevant to our operations adjusted ebitda is a financial measure not required by or presented in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap the table below summarizes our three month operating results for periods ended october 3 2021 and september 27 2020 in terms of both the gaap net income measure and the non gaap adjusted ebitda measure we believe that including both measures provides information that is useful in evaluating our financial results across periods our adjusted ebitda decreased by 3 3 million to 0 0 million during the twelve months ended october 3 2021 as compared to 3 3 million during the twelve months ended september 27 2020 the decrease in ebitda is primarily driven by a decrease in revenue of 7 7 million resulting in lower operating profit of 3 4 million and other changes of 0 1 million on august 26 2021 3 936 391 outstanding warrants expired worthless

when people take out student loans for themselves certain risks are involved the debt can negatively affect a person s mental emotional and even physical well being it can also harm a person s financial well being but when taking out a student loan for one s child the risk is even higher that the loan could be associated with lower financial well being this is what economics scholar charlene kalenkoski and i found in our peer reviewed study published in the journal of personal finance the study which used a nationally representative federal dataset on household economics and decision making involved nearly 12 500 american adults ages 18 and over with an average age of 48 it is not known whether the parents had taken out private or government loans for their children by lower financial well being we mean that these parents were more likely to report feeling as if they will never be able to have the things they want in life or that they are just getting by financially they also report feeling a lack of control over their financial situation these statements are part of what the u s consumer financial protection bureau uses to measure financial well being lower financial well being decreases overall well being our findings remained consistent even after we took into account several other factors such as the education levels of the parents whether or not they work how much they earn per year and how they spend their money we also considered their financial literacy and their current financial strain the consumer financial protection bureau offers people a financial well being score on a scale of 0 to 100 taking out a student loan is associated with a lower financial well being score for everyone but our research found that it is associated with an even lower score when the loan is for the borrower s child for instance taking out a loan for oneself is likely to lower the score by 1 44 points and taking out a student loan for one s spouse likely lowers the score by 1 37 points however taking out a student loan for one s child was likely to lower financial well being scores by 1 88 points most students rely on loans in public policy discussions about people who take out student loans it s not always clear whether the loan is for themselves or someone else such as the borrower s spouse or child knowing this information provides insight into how student loan debt relates to the borrower s well being if the loan is for their children in 2020 64 of of college graduates financed their education via student loans accumulating an average debt of us 29 927 the combined amount of federal and private student loans as well as the number of borrowers continues to increase the total amount of student loan debt reached 1 75 trillion as of nov 30 2021 and the total number of borrowers stood at 47 9 million negative effects on households these student loan debts have adverse effects on individuals households and the u s economy consequently the federal government is considering federal student loan forgiveness in a december 2021 letter several democratic lawmakers urged president biden to extend the pause on student loan payments which ends in january and to act to cancel student debt the lawmakers call attention to significant disparities that contribute to the racial wealth gap twenty years after starting college the median black borrower still owes 95 of their loans compared to only 6 for the median white borrower the lawmakers note citing a 2019 brandeis university study studies have shown that student loan debt influences household decisions and outcomes this includes delayed homeownership lower likelihood of stock ownership lower probability of life satisfaction and lower financial wellness compared with those without student loan debt our study used a dataset for 2017 the long term effects on parents financial well being after taking out loans for their children s college education are not known having datasets for longer periods of time would enable us to examine whether the loans cause lower financial well being at different stages in parents lives such as when their children finally move out or when the parents retire

markets were lower during the day but these two companies reported their latest earnings results the stock market lost ground on monday with investors responding negatively to ongoing worries about the omicron covid 19 variant as well as news over the weekend that the build back better spending bill in washington d c was unlikely to move forward in its current form the dow jones industrial average dji 1 24 s p 500 gspc 1 46 and nasdaq composite ixic 1 62 didn t finish at their worst levels of the day but all three nevertheless fell by more than 1 index daily percentage change daily point change dow 1 23 433 s p 500 1 14 53 nasdaq 1 24 189 after the closing bell a couple of stocks that have a substantial following within the investing community reported their latest quarterly results both micron technology mu 3 91 and nike nke gained ground in after hours trading as investors seemed generally comfortable with the reports below we ll go into more detail about what these two companies said and how it could affect investor sentiment on tuesday micron has a good memory shares of micron technology were up nearly 7 in after hours trading as of 4 45 p m est the memory chip specialist reported strong results for its fiscal first quarter and its outlook suggested that micron could see record sales and solid profits throughout the fiscal year micron s numbers were impressive revenue jumped 33 year over year to 7 69 billion although that was down somewhat from the 8 27 billion that micron brought in during the fiscal fourth quarter three months ago adjusted net income came close to tripling from year ago levels to 2 31 billion and that produced adjusted earnings of 2 16 per share topping expectations ceo sanjay mehrotra pointed to several powerful trends helping micron 5g wireless network technology artificial intelligence and electric vehicle adoption are all driving demand for micron s chips and none of those trends seem likely to slow down anytime in the near future micron expects fiscal second quarter results to be reasonably good with sales likely to be between 7 3 billion and 7 7 billion and adjusted earnings of 1 85 to 2 05 per share that was enough to satisfy shareholders and if micron can top those expectations yet again it could leave more room for the stock to rise nike does it nike shares were up more than 3 in after hours trading the athletic shoe and apparel giant s fiscal second quarter financial report had some good news for longtime investors in the stock at first glance nike s numbers didn t seem all that impressive revenue of 11 4 billion was up just 1 from prior year levels and flat on a currency adjusted basis gross margin rose almost three percentage points to 45 9 and nike direct sales climbed 9 year over year on a 40 rise in north american digital sales however earnings of 0 83 per share were up just 6 from year ago levels nike pointed to continuing difficulties operationally including the ongoing effect of supply chain challenges results in the greater china and asia pacific and latin america segments were poor with low inventories due to pandemic related factory closures higher wages contributed to an 8 rise in overhead expense and nike boosted its brand campaign and digital marketing spending enough to push selling and administrative costs higher by 15 year over year all in all nike has handled pandemic related challenges well and investors seem to be applauding that fact that doesn t mean things will get easier for nike in the immediate future but the company has confidence it can overcome its obstacles and perform well in the long run
investors don t know what to think of the latest covid headlines what happened the pandemic continues to make headlines and investors are struggling to figure out what to make of it on a day when cases surged throughout the united kingdom and european countries are reinitiating lockdowns airline stocks were all over the place with spirit airlines save 3 69 and azul azul 10 73 both falling more than 5 on monday while american airlines group aal 3 45 at one point was up 4 9 so what it has been a long two years for airline stocks the early days of the pandemic all but wiped out travel demand leaving much of the global industry scrambling to pay its bills and even as demand has slowly returned airline balance sheets remain fragile the last thing the industry needs is a return to the lockdowns and travel restrictions that marked the early stages of the pandemic but the new omicron variant threatens to do just that over the weekend israel added the united states to a list of destinations banned because of high pandemic cases and the netherlands returned to a lockdown state germany and france are weighing new restrictions and in the united kingdom new cases are spiking so far u s president joe biden has resisted calls for new lockdowns encouraging vaccinations instead but if we ve learned anything over the past two years it s that the pandemic is tough to predict and investors sent stocks tumbling on monday morning on fears things are going to get worse before they get better spirit is a low cost discounter seen as a good bet to recover first assuming a resurgence in demand is led by cost conscious tourists and not business travelers azul meanwhile is under pressure because its home country of brazil has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic although azul is one of the healthier carriers in its home region latin american airlines are more reliant on international travel than their u s counterparts meaning that new lockdowns could hit it particularly hard american is the outlier though the company traded down more than 2 in premarket hours and began the day in the red it is possible the stock is up because short sellers those who bet a stock is headed down are taking their gains and covering american as of the end of november was the most shorted airline stock according to cowen with about 15 of its shares sold short the stock is up on monday on unusually high volume now what if nothing else omicron is a reminder of how little we know about how the coming months will play out but it does seem clear that vaccines will not quickly get us out of this predicament and that covid will remain with us in some form or another well into 2022 it will be hard for the airline industry to fully recover until the threat of lockdowns and restrictions is behind us and until that time comes investors should expect continued volatility and stocks that move higher and lower based on the latest headlines for those with a long enough time horizon there is reason to be bullish that travel will eventually return but little reason to believe that will happen anytime soon of these three stocks azul looks like the most intriguing long term option because of its powerful position in brazil but brazil also could take longer to normalize than the u s market meaning there is still plenty of time to sit on the sidelines as monday s trading shows airline stocks are liable to move around a lot in the months to come without actually going anywhere at all

injection given one month apart for two consecutive months after the second initiation injection the recommended continuation injection dose is a single 600 mg 3 ml injection given every two months vocabria cabotegravir oral tablets may be administered for approximately one month before initiating the first injection to assess the tolerability of the medicine deborah waterhouse ceo viiv healthcare said people who are vulnerable to acquiring hiv especially those in black and latinx communities who are disproportionately impacted in the us may want options beyond daily oral pills that s why viiv healthcare is proud that apretude was studied in one of the most diverse and comprehensive hiv prevention trial programs to date which also included some of the largest numbers of transgender women and black men who have sex with men ever enrolled in an hiv prevention trial with apretude people can reduce the risk of acquiring hiv with as few as six injections a year today s approval is the latest example of viiv healthcare s commitment to developing long acting medicines that offer consumers a different choice us fda approval is based on the results from two international phase iib iii multicenter randomised double blind active controlled trials hptn 083 and hptn 084 which evaluated the safety and efficacy of cabotegravir long acting for prep in hiv negative men who have sex with men transgender women and cisgender women who were at increased risk of sexually acquiring hiv in these trials which included more than 7 700 participants across 13 countries combined the blinded randomised portions of both trials were stopped early by an independent data safety monitoring board after cabotegravir long acting for prep was shown to be superior to daily oral emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tdf ftc tablets in preventing the acquisition of hiv in study participants clinical trial participants who received cabotegravir long acting for prep experienced a 69 lower incidence of hiv compared to ftc tdf tablets in hptn 083 and a 90 lower incidence of hiv compared to ftc tdf tablets in hptn 084 the most common adverse reactions all grades observed in at least 1 of clinical trial participants receiving cabotegravir long acting for prep were injection site reactions diarrhoea headache pyrexia fatigue sleep disorders nausea dizziness flatulence abdominal pain vomiting myalgia rash decreased appetite somnolence back pain and upper respiratory tract infection adverse events led to discontinuation in 6 of participants in hptn 083 and 1 of participants in hptn 084 in hptn 083 participants in the us were inclusive of the black african american and latinx communities of men and transgender women who have sex with men who are disproportionately affected by the hiv epidemic and comprise the greatest percentage of new hiv diagnoses in hptn 084 all participants were cisgender women from sub saharan africa women in this region bear a disproportionate burden of the hiv epidemic and may be twice as likely to acquire hiv as their male counterparts richard elion md director of research at washington health institute said we have the tools to end the hiv epidemic through the implementation of effective antiretroviral treatment and hiv prevention prep has played a vital role in protecting people from acquiring hiv with the availability of cabotegravir long acting for prep as an injection every two months to prevent hiv people now have an important new option besides daily medication this long acting medication offers more options for prevention and now providers and patients will be empowered by choices and the ability to choose the approach that is optimal for each individual hiv continues to be a global public health crisis with an estimated 38 million people living with hiv worldwide and 1 7 million new cases annually prep represents an effective tool to reduce new cases of hiv which in addition to successful hiv antiretroviral treatment will help efforts to end the hiv epidemic however fewer than 25 of the people who could benefit from prep in the us are currently taking it despite the wide availability of daily oral prep it can be limited by inconsistent adherence as well as structural and cultural barriers that lead to underutilisation in key populations gabriel maldonado mba executive director and ceo truevolution said many people who are vulnerable to hiv have complex lives that can make taking a daily pill to prevent hiv a burden this can include stigma fears about accidental disclosure of their medicine as well as general complications from daily living together these issues may contribute to low rates of prep usage and the expansion of the hiv epidemic our community has been in dire need of additional hiv prevention options that may address their evolving needs and cabotegravir long acting for prep represents an exciting new option to help them reduce their risk of acquiring hiv viiv healthcare will begin shipping apretude to wholesalers and specialty distributors in the us in early 2022 viiv healthcare has initiated submissions to other regulatory authorities

as employers struggle to find enough workers many companies municipalities and economic development organizations are focusing on recruiting employees from outside the state and keeping workers in wisconsin but as they seek to fill open jobs and build the state s workforce communities often lack a key recruitment tool quality housing that workers can afford in an effort to combat the issue wisconsin republicans are sponsoring a package of bills aimed at making workforce housing easier and cheaper to build across the state workforce housing is defined as housing that is affordable to households earning between 60 and 120 of an area s median income it targets middle income employees those who often work in fields such as law enforcement manufacturing education health care and retail there s a worker shortage in many of our communities and businesses are trying to attract people to their communities they re trying to find more workers said rep dave murphy r greenville who cosponsored many of the bills and many times it comes back to the fact that there s not enough moderately priced housing so we re trying to help increase the stock of homes that would fit into the budget of the average workforce the package of bills was approved by the state assembly in october and was sent to the senate which has not yet taken up the measures the senate will reconvene for its next session on jan 18 read the series unaffordable no place to call home read the series help wanted exploring wisconsin s worker shortage their sponsors say the bills look to encourage development of new workforce housing by lowering costs making it easier to build and reducing government red tape by creating a 42 million per year workforce housing income tax credit for multi family housing projects creating a certified workforce housing development site program that would pre qualify properties for residential development that have a clean title proper zoning adequate utilities and infrastructure and no wetlands and that the developer can attest to limited per unit development fees and that all required permits can be in place within 60 days of certification requiring larger municipalities to use a portion of their federal pandemic relief funds on one of the following workforce housing projects new infrastructure such as streets sewer water and sidewalks establishing a low interest or no interest loan program for rehabilitating older workforce housing establishing a low interest or no interest loan program for building new workforce housing redeveloping idle commercial property sites of at least 40 000 square feet to workforce housing creating a sales tax exemption for materials used to build workforce housing developments or to conduct workforce housing rehabilitation projects creating a low interest or no interest loan program for homeowners to pay for structural improvements or the removal of lead paint from homes built before 1980 allowing local governments to create housing investment fund programs that would use increased property tax revenue from new housing developments to help fund additional workforce housing the majority of the bills were passed by the assembly by unanimous consent although lawmakers split along party lines on one bill assembly bill 605 which requires municipalities to use a portion of their federal pandemic relief dollars to help fund housing development opponents objected to the lack of state matching dollars for the program in an emailed statement assembly minority leader gordon hintz d oshkosh said the bills do not adequately address the state s housing challenges and could in some instances make the problem worse governor evers original budget proposed 70 million to fight homelessness including 50 million for grants for municipalities to offer affordable housing and i was deeply disappointed when republicans voted to cut these funds hintz said in the statement however republican rep rob summerfield who spearheaded the package said the bills look at the housing issue from a holistic approach we knew from the get go you re not gonna be able to pass one bill to take care of this issue summerfield said you re not gonna have a silver bullet saying we do this one thing and all our problems are alleved this is where talking to the industry talking to community groups talking to everybody who s got a stake in this and taking their idea saying we can do a little here a little here a little there and after a while you start to get a bigger stack of bills that hopefully will make a difference in in this issue rep david armstrong r rice lake who authored several of the bills also works as the executive director of the barron county economic development corp he said he s seen first hand how businesses struggle to find employees which goes hand in hand with the housing shortage armstrong sees the bills as the state legislature s way of giving municipalities tools they need to help developers build in their communities he said what many of the bills aim to do is cut down on government regulations that drive up the cost of housing according to a 2021 study from the national association of homebuilders government regulations account for nearly 24 of the current average sales price 397 300 of a new single family home as a government we can t affect supply and demand we can t affect supply chain really but what we can affect is the cost of what government does and how it impacts the cost of housing said assembly majority leader jim steineke r kaukauna the wisconsin economic development association a statewide trade association for economic development professionals supports several of the bills included in the package i think they certainly can have a significant impact on making wisconsin a more desirable place to live said michael welsh weda s vice president of legislative affairs i think it s good public policy if the bills are passed into law the average wisconsinite likely won t notice any immediate impacts welsh said but over time these bills could help small businesses thrive through employee retention and attraction grow communities and increase municipalities tax bases this is part of an overall effort to address wisconsin s workforce shortage crisis welsh said and i think that no one can deny that we re experiencing that i don t think we re unique in wisconsin i think other states are also feeling that pinch but i think these bills represent an effort to address some of the underlying issues that that speak to our our workforce shortage hopefully in the new year there ll be some action in the senate and get these bills to the governor s desk the bills face an uphill battle in the senate as numerous republcan senators have concerns according to a weda news release related old standards don t work 4 things wisconsin communities can do to increase affordable housing development related the statewide labor shortage could last years here s how employers workers can still succeed contact natalie brophy at 715 216 5452 or nbrophy gannett com follow her on twitter brophy_natalie

biogen is slashing the price of its alzheimer s treatment in half months after it debuted to widespread criticism for an initial cost that could reach 56 000 annually the drugmaker said monday that it will cut the wholesale acquisition cost of the drug by about 50 next month that means the annual cost for a person of average weight will amount to 28 200 the actual amount that person would pay will depend on factors like insurance coverage biogen ceo michel vounatsos said in a prepared statement that too many patients were not being offered the drug due to financial considerations and their disease had progressed beyond the point where aduhelm could help related medical doctor pharmacists and 11 other charged with operating pill mills aduhelm is the first in a line of new drugs that promise to do what no other alzheimer s treatment has managed slow the progress of the fatal brain destroying disease rather than just managing its symptoms the drug received fda approval in june and the agency later said it was appropriate for patients with mild symptoms or early stage alzheimer s but aduhelm s debut has been slowed by concerns over the price and research behind the drug some insurers have balked at paying for the drug while medical centers across the country have been either slow to decide on using the drug or said they weren t planning to prescribe it for now doctors have said concerns over the price were compounded by costs patients also would face for regular testing and scans needed to monitor their progress on aduhelm biogen said in june that it would not raise its price on the drug for four years and the company often touted its financial assistance programs for patients related local online pharmacy saving patients thousands on prescription drugs rbc capital markets analyst brian abrahams said he was not surprised by biogen s price cut he said in a research note that the move was probably necessary and should give aduhelm its best opportunity for success the initial price was a key factor behind planned premium hikes for medicare the federal government s coverage program for people ages 65 and older and for the disabled last month medicare announced one of the largest increases ever in its part b monthly premium for outpatient care it said it would raise the premium nearly 22 from 148 50 currently to 170 10 starting in january the agency said about half of that hike was due to the need for a contingency fund to cover aduhelm medicare is expected to be one main payers for the drug aduhelm clears brain plaque thought to play a role in alzheimer s disease and u s regulators gave their approval based on study results showing the drug seemed likely to benefit patients but they ve asked for more research biogen which developed aduhelm with japan s eisai co said last week the company expects to screen the first patients for their next study in may researchers will aim to enroll about 1 300 people with early stage alzheimer s and expects to complete the research about four years after the study begins concerns about the research behind the drug were a main reason the european medicines agency cited in refusing aduhelm s marketing authorization last week biogen said in october that aduhelm had brought in only 300 000 in sales during its first full quarter on the market the company attributed that figure partly to drug wholesalers drawing down inventory they had purchased the previous quarter biogen also said monday that it will start some cost cutting measures that are expected to yield about 500 million in annual savings most of which will be realized next year the company said it was cutting costs in part because the slow debut of aduhem was affecting its revenue shares of biogen inc based in cambridge massachusetts slipped 1 07 to 236 36 monday morning while broader indexes fell the stock price had soared past 425 in june after the fda approval but shares have since shed nearly half their value

by jonnelle marte reuters some economists expect the u s economy to grow more slowly next year after a key democratic lawmaker dealt a seemingly fatal blow to president joe biden s 1 75 trillion spending plan further clouding an outlook that was facing heightened risk from the rapid spread of the omicron variant of covid 19 goldman sachs nyse lowered its gdp growth forecast for 2022 as did mark zandi chief economist for moody s nyse analytics after u s senator joe manchin said on sunday he could not support biden s ambitious build back better proposal which would expand the social safety net and tackle climate change if bbb doesn t become law the economic recovery will be vulnerable to stalling out if we suffer another serious wave of the pandemic an increasingly likely scenario with omicron spreading rapidly zandi wrote on twitter nyse on monday adding that he expects real gdp growth to be lower by half a percentage point in 2022 if the proposed legislation doesn t become law democrats are absorbing the legislative setback as the biden administration faces criticism from health experts amid a surge in covid 19 infections one shift that economists say could slow growth is the reduction of an enhanced tax credit that sent families monthly payments of up to 300 per child but which is set to expire on dec 31 lawmakers could pass a modified version of biden s spending bill next year or decide to extend the credit retroactively although negotiations could take weeks goldman sachs researchers wrote in a note to clients u s economic output was expected to slow in the early part of next year from the brisk pace seen at the end of 2021 even before omicron emerged as a threat to global growth and biden s spending plan was derailed economists projected earlier this month that growth would slow next year as the lift provided by earlier spending programs faded and the federal reserve reduced its monetary policy accommodation in the face of high inflation the annualized rate of gross domestic product growth was expected to drop to 4 in the first quarter of 2022 from an expected 6 in the final three months of this year according to a reuters poll of economists published on dec 8 growth for all of 2022 was seen decelerating to 3 9 still well above pre pandemic trends from 5 6 this year the fed announced last week that it would double the pace of its bond buying wind down in response to strong employment growth and the surge in inflation and signaled it could raise interest rates three times next year but zandi said it could prove difficult for the u s central bank to roll out three rate hikes if u s economic growth is slower than initially expected goldman too said the apparent demise of biden s spending plan adds risk to its expectation for the fed to deliver its first rate hike in march given that m ost fed officials likely expected the bbb act or something like it to become law the spike in covid 19 infections is beginning to affect some businesses in new york city and elsewhere leading to event cancellations restaurant closings and delays to return to office plans the impact of the omicron variant is not yet visible in the high frequency indicators tracked by jefferies nyse economists though they warned that does not mean it isn t happening it is simply too earlier for it to show in activity data jefferies economist aneta markowska wrote in her weekly take on an array of high frequency data which showed the investment bank s reopening index edging up last week her expectation is that the increase in cases should exert itself more notably come january when it may in fact trigger a contraction in employment similar to that seen in december 2020
biogen is slashing the price of its alzheimer s treatment in half months after it debuted to widespread criticism for an initial cost that could reach 56 000 annually the drugmaker said monday that it will cut the wholesale acquisition cost of the drug by about 50 next month that means the annual cost for a person of average weight will amount to 28 200 the actual amount that person would pay will depend on factors like insurance coverage biogen ceo michel vounatsos said in a prepared statement that too many patients were not being offered the drug due to financial considerations and their disease had progressed beyond the point where aduhelm could help we re making it easier for you to find stories that matter with our new newsletter the 4front sign up here and get news that is important for you to your inbox aduhelm is the first in a line of new drugs that promise to do what no other alzheimer s treatment has managed slow the progress of the fatal brain destroying disease rather than just managing its symptoms the drug received fda approval in june and the agency later said it was appropriate for patients with mild symptoms or early stage alzheimer s but aduhelm s debut has been slowed by concerns over the price and research behind the drug some insurers have balked at paying for the drug while medical centers across the country have been either slow to decide on using the drug or said they weren t planning to prescribe it for now doctors have said concerns over the price were compounded by costs patients also would face for regular testing and scans needed to monitor their progress on aduhelm biogen said in june that it would not raise its price on the drug for four years and the company often touted its financial assistance programs for patients rbc capital markets analyst brian abrahams said he was not surprised by biogen s price cut he said in a research note that the move was probably necessary and should give aduhelm its best opportunity for success the initial price was a key factor behind planned premium hikes for medicare the federal government s coverage program for people ages 65 and older and for the disabled last month medicare announced one of the largest increases ever in its part b monthly premium for outpatient care it said it would raise the premium nearly 22 from 148 50 currently to 170 10 starting in january the agency said about half of that hike was due to the need for a contingency fund to cover aduhelm medicare is expected to be one main payers for the drug aduhelm clears brain plaque thought to play a role in alzheimer s disease and u s regulators gave their approval based on study results showing the drug seemed likely to benefit patients but they ve asked for more research biogen which developed aduhelm with japan s eisai co said last week the company expects to screen the first patients for their next study in may researchers will aim to enroll about 1 300 people with early stage alzheimer s and expects to complete the research about four years after the study begins concerns about the research behind the drug were a main reason the european medicines agency cited in refusing aduhelm s marketing authorization last week biogen said in october that aduhelm had brought in only 300 000 in sales during its first full quarter on the market the company attributed that figure partly to drug wholesalers drawing down inventory they had purchased the previous quarter biogen also said monday that it will start some cost cutting measures that are expected to yield about 500 million in annual savings most of which will be realized next year the company said it was cutting costs in part because the slow debut of aduhem was affecting its revenue shares of biogen inc based in cambridge massachusetts slipped 1 07 to 236 36 monday morning while broader indexes fell the stock price had soared past 425 in june after the fda approval but shares have since shed nearly half their value
canada s main stock index slid along with other north american markets monday as governments around the globe tightened covid 19 restrictions in response to surging case counts of the new omicron variant the s p tsx composite index was down 200 97 points at 20 538 22 in new york the dow jones industrial average plummeted 433 28 points to 34 932 16 the s p 500 index dropped 52 62 points to 4 568 02 while the nasdaq composite was down 188 74 points at 14 980 94 it is a pretty rough day no doubt about it said michael currie vice president and investment adviser at td wealth everyone s talking about omicron markets have bounced up and down ever since the omicron variant was discovered in november as investors appear to be weighing the potential severity of a fifth wave of covid 19 and the impact it could have on economic activity inflation and existing supply chain challenges on monday quebec brought in a new round of capacity restrictions for bars restaurants and gyms while in the u s president joe biden will announce on tuesday new steps he is taking to combat the virus the dutch government began a tough nationwide lockdown on sunday while a u k official on monday said he could not guarantee new restrictions would not be announced this week we re seeing a lot of restrictions or lockdowns come into place which of course are bad for business currie said so even if omicron itself isn t as devastating as some people think the fact that all of these lockdowns and restrictions are coming into place will have the same effect markets were also being dragged down by the potential death blow over the weekend to a proposed 2 trillion spending program by the u s government when an influential senator said he could not support it in addition markets are still absorbing last week s move by the federal reserve to more quickly remove the aid it s throwing at the economy because of rising inflation sectors most affected by monday s stock slump were the industrials sector which was down 2 5 per cent as airlines and travel related companies fell on omicron fears and health care and technology which were down 2 73 per cent and 1 76 per cent respectively currie said investors were moving away from high valuation high growth companies over fears that inflation could be a drag on them two of the hardest hit stocks for example were cannabis companies canopy growth corp which was down 8 7 per cent in the day s trading and tilray inc which was down 5 95 per cent in spite of the rough trading day currie said it s important to note that while there have been up days and down days this month both the tsx and the new york stock exchanges are heading into the last week of december very close to where they were at the end of november at least for the month it s been pretty flat or just slightly down so nothing to panic about yet he said although this is typically a very good time of year for markets december is typically one of the stronger months it s billed as the santa claus rally time of year and we re clearly not seeing that the canadian dollar traded for 77 27 cents us compared with 77 85 cents us on friday the february crude contract was down 2 11 at us 68 61 per barrel and the march natural gas contract was up almost 11 cents at us 3 64 per mmbtu the february gold contract was down us 10 30 at us 1 794 60 an ounce and the march copper contract was down a fraction of a cent at us 4 29 a pound also on monday bmo financial group announced it had signed a deal with french bank bnp paribas to buy its u s subsidiary bank of the west for us 16 3 billion but currie said the deal appeared to have little affect on bmo s stock price which closed down 1 92 per cent as other financial stocks also trended downward monday it hasn t had a dramatic impact on markets but just the size of it stands out currie said of the bmo deal the fact that it is i believe the largest acquisition by a canadian bank in the last 20 years certainly makes it a story with files from the associated press this report by the canadian press was first published dec 20 2021 companies in this story tsx gsptse tsx cadusd x amanda stephenson the canadian press
markets were hammered monday as investors grew more concerned the covid omicron variant could have a significant impact on the global economy five experts weigh in on what they think may be ahead for u s stocks chris hyzy chief investment officer at bank of america private bank says the stock market has come back to fundamentals get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters coming off the extraordinary gains of 2020 and 2021 we re almost back to the basics again you have to take a position on earnings growth and profit growth from our perspective should be better than expected consensus is out there with a 7 or 8 move but when you look at some of the trends particularly consumer spending despite the growth worries we re all talking about right now when we look back on all this and we go to the summer of next year we think this is an opportunity to reposition portfolios the growth worries the growth shocks that are being repriced right now we would fade that we think growth is actually going to be better than expected despite the latest worries steve weiss founder of short hills capital says the federal reserve may be making the right move at the wrong time it s very clear evidence that the market is most concerned about covid and the variants and not that concerned about not passing build back better and not as concerned about the fed in terms of raising rates except for the fact i m going to modify that and modify it importantly that the fed is tightening monetary policy at the wrong time so it s growth fears that are hitting everything and it s pretty indiscriminate liz young head of investment strategy at sofi focuses her forecast on how 2021 could close out we have uncertainty obviously heading into the end of the year we keep asking ourselves is the santa claus rally at risk it s already not happening the santa claus rally usually starts to take shape about mid month we re here on the 20th there s no rally i think that we could go lower from here maybe we rally into the end of the year but that s going to have absolutely nothing to do with santa claus it has everything to do with the idea that we have uncertainty over covid and we have a fed that isn t going to save us this time and frankly they shouldn t save us they are tightening at the right time in the sense that the economy is still pretty strong regardless of what the market is saying the economy is doing ok inflation is hot they have to control that in order for the economy to continue growing through 2022 joe terranova senior managing director at virtus investment partners says it all comes back to risk i struggle with a lot of these short term calls i think what is so important and really missing at all times from these conversations what s the most important word to all of us if we re investors if we re speculators short term long term it s the word risk it s the primary word in the financial services vocabulary and it s one that s reshaping itself right now why risk is always present and we are now coming off of 2021 that has the highest risk adjusted return for investors in decades you have low realized volatility strong performance for the s p now you have a pivot on the part of the federal reserve the abundant liquidity the oceans of liquidity they re pulling back on that and in that process a lot of the riskier strategies whether it was allocating to hyper growth stocks or high valuation technology stocks or small caps that were correlated to this roaring 20s narrative that never actually unfolded risk is now being reshaped and it s being exchanged from weaker hands into stronger hands and i think the right thing to ask yourself is is this the onset of the bear market absolutely not in my opinion credit markets are trading fine today this is a correction that is going to provide an opportunity and that opportunity presents itself depending upon where you sit on the risk curve jon najarian co founder of marketrebellion com explains his current strategy i ve been active for the last three days i guess i ve been converting stock positions into simulated long stock positions by getting into options just because the volatility was cheap enough when we had the cheaper volatility last week i thought it was prudent to get out of stocks which i d been doing for the better part of two weeks and getting into call spreads to simulate that same long exposure so i was doing that in a host of stocks everything from jpmorgan to lululemon to bank of new york that just seemed like a prudent thing to do if vol gets high enough and i don t really think that we re going to see too many days where we see joe manchin shutting down build back better where we see davos being canceled and omicron cases exploding in new york and other parts of the country all at the same time i don t think we re going to see too many more days like this so if we get that significant pop in volatility i d be willing to get right back into these stocks and then sell those higher valued pumped up options against them

new york reuters former u s president donald trump s new venture inked the second largest ever private placement with convertible stock for a merger with a blank check acquisition firm according to spac research thanks to its unusually favorable terms and despite not having yet launched its social media app none of the 36 investors that participated this month in the 1 billion capital raise many of them hedge funds and family offices have revealed their identities many of them fretted about publicly associating with trump who was banned from facebook and twitter for encouraging the protests that preceded the jan 6 attack on the u s capitol sources have told reuters the structure of the so called private investment in public equity pipe was atypically favorable to these investors even though they could end up paying more than three times what investors in the blank check acquisition firm s initial public offering in september paid according to industry experts this is because they will be allowed to sell their shares right after the merger of the former president s trump media technology group tmtg and the blank check acquisition firm digital world acquisition corp is completed rather than a few months later as is customary they will be entitled to buy the shares at a 40 discount to where the shares have traded on average in the 10 days following the deal s completion with a ceiling of 33 60 per share and a floor of 10 per share according to the terms of the deal those investors can sell the shares immediately once the deal closes to lock in a profit that selling would exert downward pressure on the share price if the stock falls enough they could get more shares based on the deal s formula which they can sell again in a trade that wall street refers to as a death spiral for the company s stock the merger however has proved popular with day traders and trump supporters who invest in so called meme stocks it s possible that enough of them will buy the stock to cancel out the impact of the pipe investors dumping their shares another perk afforded to the pipe investors that is not seen in other such deals is the right to short the stock that also allows them to lock in profits because they can borrow shares sell them instantly and then receive the shares they are entitled to at a discount after the merger closes so they can close out their positions reporting by jessica dinapoli and echo wang in new york editing by paul simao

and acquire and advise a business that can benefit from their expertise and disciplined approach to capital allocation and investment oversight we intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering ipo and the private placement of the private placement warrants our shares debt or a combination of cash shares and debt the issuance of additional shares in a business combination may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in the ipo which dilution would increase if the anti dilution provisions in our class b ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of our class a ordinary shares on a greater than one to one basis upon conversion of our class b ordinary shares may subordinate the rights of holders of our class a ordinary shares if shares of preferred shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our class a ordinary shares could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our class a ordinary shares are issued which may affect among other things our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards if any and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our class a ordinary shares and or warrants 17 similarly if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt it could result in default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant our

equivalents from the proceeds derived from the ipo after the ipo we expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company for legal financial reporting accounting and auditing compliance as well as for due diligence expenses we expect our expenses to increase substantially after the closing of the ipo the company has selected december 31 as its fiscal year end for the three

securities within the meaning set forth in section 2 a 16 of the investment company act of 1940 as amended the investment company act with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of rule 2a 7 of the investment company act as determined by the company in addition as of november 12 2021 1 366 943 of cash is not held in the trust account and is available for working capital purposes we intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes which interest shall be net of taxes payable and excluding deferred underwriting commissions to complete our business combination we may withdraw interest to pay taxes if any our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account we expect the only taxes payable by us out of the funds in the trust account will be income and franchise taxes if any to the extent that our ordinary shares or debt is used in whole or in part as consideration to complete our business combination the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies we will use the funds held outside of the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses travel to and from the offices plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses structure negotiate and complete a business combination and to pay taxes to the extent the interest earned on the trust account is not sufficient to pay our taxes in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our directors and officers may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required working capital loans any such loans would be on an interest free basis if we complete our business combination we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us in the event that our business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to 1 500 000 of such loans may be converted into warrants at a price of 1 00 per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account on november 12 2021 the company borrowed 449 765 from the sponsor under the working capital loans as defined in note 5 of the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements we expect our primary liquidity requirements prior to our business combination to include approximately 280 000 for legal accounting and consulting costs in connection with any business combinations 150 000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements and 240 000 for administrative financial and support services 19 these amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses in addition we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a no shop provision a provision designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses with respect to a particular proposed business combination although we do not have any current intention to do so if we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a no shop provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time our forfeiture of such funds whether as a result of our breach or otherwise could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for or conducting due diligence with respect to prospective target businesses we do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following the ipo in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business however if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business undertaking in depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination moreover we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares as defined in note 1 of the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements upon completion of our business combination in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination subject to compliance with applicable securities laws we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination if we do not complete our business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account in addition following our business combination if cash on hand is insufficient we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangement as of september 30 2021 contractual obligations as of september 30 2021 we did not have any long term debt capital or operating lease obligations critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our unaudited financial information we describe our significant accounting policies in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to financial statements included in this quarterly report on form 10 q our unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u s gaap certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant judgments in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates on an ongoing basis management reviews the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with u s gaap judgments are based on historical experience terms of existing contracts industry trends and information available from outside sources as appropriate however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates recent accounting standards in august 2020 the fasb issued asu no 2020 06 accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity s

instruments and introducing other changes as a result of asu no 2020 06 more convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost and more convertible preferred stock will be accounted for as a single equity instrument measured at its historical cost as long as no features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives the amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2023 including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after december 15 2020 including interim periods within those fiscal years the company adopted asu no 2020 06 upon its incorporation the impact to our balance sheet statement of operations and cash flows was not material 20 management does not believe that any other recently issued but not effective accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the company s financial statements jobs act the jumpstart our business startups act of 2012 the jobs act contains provisions that among other things relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act and are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private not publicly traded companies we are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards and as a result we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non emerging growth companies as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates additionally we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the jobs act subject to certain conditions set forth in the jobs act if as an emerging growth company we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to among other things i provide an independent registered public accounting firm s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 ii provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non emerging growth public companies under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act iii comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board united states regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the independent registered public accounting firm s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements auditor discussion and analysis and iv disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation these exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of the ipo or until we are no longer an emerging growth company whichever is earlier

biogen is slashing the price of its alzheimer s treatment in half months after it debuted to widespread criticism for an initial cost that could reach 56 000 annually the drugmaker said monday that it will cut the wholesale acquisition cost of the drug by about 50 next month that means the annual cost for a person of average weight will amount to 28 200 the actual amount that person would pay will depend on factors like insurance coverage biogen ceo michel vounatsos said in a prepared statement that too many patients were not being offered the drug due to financial considerations and their disease had progressed beyond the point where aduhelm could help get a weekly recap of the latest san francisco bay area housing news sign up for nbc bay area s housing deconstructed newsletter aduhelm is the first in a line of new drugs that promise to do what no other alzheimer s treatment has managed slow the progress of the fatal brain destroying disease rather than just managing its symptoms the drug received fda approval in june and the agency later said it was appropriate for patients with mild symptoms or early stage alzheimer s but aduhelm s debut has been slowed by concerns over the price and research behind the drug some insurers have balked at paying for the drug while medical centers across the country have been either slow to decide on using the drug or said they weren t planning to prescribe it for now doctors have said concerns over the price were compounded by costs patients also would face for regular testing and scans needed to monitor their progress on aduhelm biogen said in june that it would not raise its price on the drug for four years and the company often touted its financial assistance programs for patients rbc capital markets analyst brian abrahams said he was not surprised by biogen s price cut he said in a research note that the move was probably necessary and should give aduhelm its best opportunity for success the initial price was a key factor behind planned premium hikes for medicare the federal government s coverage program for people ages 65 and older and for the disabled last month medicare announced one of the largest increases ever in its part b monthly premium for outpatient care it said it would raise the premium nearly 22 from 148 50 currently to 170 10 starting in january the agency said about half of that hike was due to the need for a contingency fund to cover aduhelm medicare is expected to be one main payers for the drug aduhelm clears brain plaque thought to play a role in alzheimer s disease and u s regulators gave their approval based on study results showing the drug seemed likely to benefit patients but they ve asked for more research biogen which developed aduhelm with japan s eisai co said last week the company expects to screen the first patients for their next study in may researchers will aim to enroll about 1 300 people with early stage alzheimer s and expects to complete the research about four years after the study begins concerns about the research behind the drug were a main reason the european medicines agency cited in refusing aduhelm s marketing authorization last week biogen said in october that aduhelm had brought in only 300 000 in sales during its first full quarter on the market the company attributed that figure partly to drug wholesalers drawing down inventory they had purchased the previous quarter biogen also said monday that it will start some cost cutting measures that are expected to yield about 500 million in annual savings most of which will be realized next year the company said it was cutting costs in part because the slow debut of aduhem was affecting its revenue shares of biogen inc based in cambridge massachusetts slipped 1 07 to 236 36 monday morning while broader indexes fell the stock price had soared past 425 in june after the fda approval but shares have since shed nearly half their value
sen joe manchin s fellow democrats weren t the only ones in mourning after his announcement opposing the build back better act likely killed hope for the legislation to be passed at least without significant rewrites and cuts to some provisions goldman sachs cut its economic forecast for the us on sunday in light of the news with the bank s chief economist stating bluntly in a note to clients that mr manchin s decision to kill the bill or at the very least put it in serious jeopardy would stifle economic growth in 2022 bbb enactment had already looked like a close call and in light of manchin s comments we are adjusting our forecast to remove the assumption that bbb will become law read the note from jan hatzius according to multiple news outlets a failure to pass bbb has negative growth implications the note continued the downturn could be offset by some positive effects in the stock market it went on but on monday the stock market appeared to be reacting to the news coupled with growing fears about the omicron variant of covid 19 with dismay the dow plunged more than 430 points while the s p 500 and nasdaq also saw losses mr manchin s decision ignited a war of words between the west virginia senator and the white house which essentially accused him of not telling the truth in conversations with the president press secretary jen psaki called his decision a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position and a breach of his commitments to the president and the senator s colleagues in the house and senate in a statement on sunday the move could have dire consequences as well for democrats seeking to hold their seats in swing districts such as rep cindy axne who previously told the independent that she planned to campaign alongside mr biden on the passage of the build back better act in her district which was won by former president donald trump in the last two presidential elections in a move many saw as a signal regarding his political leanings mr manchin made his announcement on sunday in an interview with fox news before which an aide alerted the white house of his plans the senator did not speak personally with either the administration or democratic congressional leadership before doing so i cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation i just can t i ve tried everything possible i can t get there he told fox news sunday guest host bret baier you re done this is a no asked mr baier in response this is a no mr manchin confirmed the senator explained his decision in more detail in a radio interview on monday claiming he was never going to support some of the proposals in the bill and claiming that white house staff had drove some things and they put some things out that were absolutely inexcusable which pushed him over the edge ms psaki pointed reporters to her sunday statement when asked about the issue at monday s press conference and reiterated that while the president and mr manchin remained friends her statement had made clear what the course of events were over the last couple of weeks
spread the love there has been a wave of price increases of basic commodities mostly groceries thereby dampening the festive mood the past week has seen several shops including big supermarkets increasing prices of basic commodities such as mealie meal cooking oil sugar meat rice fish and potatoes among others government paid civil servants their bonuses in united states dollars and businesses have responded by increasing prices of basic commodities thereby reducing the government workers purchasing power what is surprising is that even foreign currency prices have been increased which means the price hikes have nothing to do with the exchange rates the confederation of zimbabwe retailers czr association has already raised the red flag warning consumers against panic buying businesses are saying the price increases have been triggered by a combination of factors including the firming of the united states dollar against the local currency especially on the parallel market but as already stated even prices in forex have increased the consumers are saying prices are now beyond the reach of the majority of people and prices of meat products which are usually in high demand during the festive season are among the products that have been increased by very high percentages a snap survey of the prices in shops within the bulawayo central business district revealed that a 2kg packet of chicken which used to sell for an average 1 000 now sells for between 1 200 and 1 300 the price of bread which was 143 is now 170 a kilogramme of fresh kapenta sardine shot up to an average of 500 for a kilogramme in most retail outlets a two litre bottle of cooking oil has risen from 500 to 700 while the price of boom washing powder increased from 450 to 600 a crate of eggs has risen from about 700 to around 900 a two litre coke has increased to around 309 from 250 while the price of a 10kg bag of mealie meal which was selling for 540 has increased to 659 one shopper mrs primrose hadebe a teacher who was buying ingredients to bake cakes said the price hikes were shocking prices of most commodities have gone up we got paid our bonuses in forex but we have not enjoyed the cushioning because of the price hike madness we are witnessing in some cases prices have more than doubled compared to last month said mrs hadebe another shopper mr tafadzwa dube said the price hikes had dampened the festive mood as most consumers can no longer afford the food items they usually buy at christmas we can only buy selected items because of the exorbitant prices being charged by retailers the merry making we had planned for this year following the payment of bonuses in forex is no longer possible said mr dube from hillside suburb in bulawayo there were however other shoppers who were pushing trolleys full of goodies and looked unfazed by the price hikes well i was part of a grocery club and we were paying us 30 per month and as such i have enough to spoil my family this christmas it wasn t easy paying that amount but now we are among the few families that are going to enjoy themselves this christmas said a woman who only identified herself as buhle many consumers have however called on the government to intervene and stop the price hike madness which they say is eroding their buying power each day i am a teacher and have just withdrawn my forex bonus but it can only buy very little because of the exorbitant prices in both local currency and forex only two weeks ago the bread price was 150 but now its 160 this is just one of the many food items whose price has been increased said mrs marie ncube from mkoba 9 suburb in gweru another consumer miss amanda moyo said the increase in prices of basic commodities had spoiled this year s christmas festivities these price increases are eroding salaries and something should be done to stop this she said the czr association president mr denford mutashu attributed the rise in commodity prices to the firming of the united states dollar against the local currency he said in some cases the increases could also be attributed to profiteering the increases are directly related to the continued firming of the united states dollar against the local currency on the parallel market he said mr mutashu urged consumers to avoid panic buying saying there are enough commodities in the shops consumers should avoid panic buying but should instead take their time to compare prices so that they get the best bargains suppliers and manufacturers have assured us of sufficient stocks beyond the festive season he said zimbabwe national chamber of commerce president dr tinashe manzungu said price increases will likely push up inflation and stifle consumer spending the price increase is everywhere at hardware shops they have also increased prices even for products pegged in united states dollars the firming of the united states dollar against the local currency has nothing to do with price hikes he said the minister for public service labour and social welfare professor paul mavima said it was unfortunate that prices of basic commodities have increased at a time when people were preparing for the festive season he said there was a need to stabilise the exchange rate so that salaries are not eroded yes there has been an increase in prices of basic commodities as a nation we need to put in place fundamentals that stabilise the exchange rate he said prof mavima said in zimbabwe dollar terms no matter how much workers are paid the salaries would be eroded by exchange rate fluctuations meanwhile the consumer council of zimbabwe ccz said the country has recently witnessed a steep increase in the prices of most commodities it said the prices of most basic goods have significantly increased since the start of the festive season as retailers take advantage of increased holiday spending the ccz also said the country s latest lpg gas price increase which took effect on december 7 from 270 a kg to 400 a kg also had a ripple effect on prices the energy price increase feeds directly into rising food and transport costs both of which have an impact on consumers during the festive season consumers are paying a little bit more for just about everything than they did a month ago and significantly more than they did for the same goods and services last year

also invited people to wear masks saying they are appreciated but few took the hint no one has shown up in masks in the last three weekends said pedersen in an interview with forum news service on friday dec 17 by god s grace i ve never had an overflow crowd across south dakota a state with hospitals packed with covid 19 patients most unvaccinated a state weary for christmas cheer has returned to holiday office parties attending dickens plays and listening to live choirs and orchestras most if not all took last year off the black hills symphony orchestra did a small virtual performance of a chamber group the popular hegg holiday jam scrapped their slate of shows across the state for a virtual show broadcast from sioux falls down in nora a 45 minute drive south of sioux falls pedersen only opened for private performances in 2020 advertisement in a private group it s their own kind said pedersen they know who they re coming with but the return to events in 2021 has like the year s start stop start stop stagger been aided by vaccines but complicated by their slow uptake add new variants from delta to omicron and it s an ambiguous spot for performers and event organizers there are some members of the community who are not ready to be in a crowded theater and there are some who won t come if they have to wear masks kirsten hollenbeck executive director of the black hills symphony orchestra in early december augustana university in sioux falls returned with its annual christmas vespers at gloria dei lutheran church with a mask requirement for students but not the audience augustana is still doing masks and for our students protection we extend mask policies off campus when students are involved said chad carder director of marketing and operations for augustana university school of music carder said the school respected gloria dei s masking policy and had facial coverings readily available though not mandatory for the audience out in rapid city it s a similar delicate dance kirsten hollenbeck executive director of the black hills symphony orchestra said the annual new year s eve concert will return to the performing arts center in the historic downtown central high school in 2021 the crowds have grown at the symphony s shows this year but the mask wearing which is required by the venue s request can be a contentious line for some supporters there are some members of the community who are not ready to be in a crowded theater said hollenbeck and there are some who won t come if they have to wear masks proof of vaccination is required for broadway theatre in new york city at minneapolis first avenue music venue proof of a negative test within 72 hours is needed for an unvaccinated patron to attend a show for many in rural parts of south dakota where just over half the state is fully vaccinated covid 19 infection rates can feel like crop prices or a stock ticker esoteric numbers that rattle in the background with little impact on the day to day however the pandemic is not going anywhere advertisement on monday the state surpassed more than 100 deaths in december a grim total not seen since february last week the state s major hospitals pleaded with south dakotans to get vaccinated and continue wearing masks in public to limit the virus s spread caught in the middle are performers some whose livelihood depends on holiday shows in 2020 when case counts spiked and virtually no one was vaccinated by december the hegg holiday jam a jazz infused ensemble playing christmas standards played only a live virtually broadcast show to a small audience in sioux falls and another performance in sioux city to no audience it was a very strange process said co founder jeremy hegg we were all in pods on the stage and had dividers of plexiglass with everyone taking extreme precautions this year the sioux falls based group returned with a seven show tour that wound up in sheldon iowa on sunday dec 19 what hegg calls about a half tour compared to the 2019 tour still it s very welcome compared to doing no tour said hegg last year for a radio play adaptation of it s a wonderful life the premiere playhouse in sioux falls followed covid 19 protocols to a t and hardly anyone came to the show said the playhouse s executive and artistic director robin byrne this year they broke box office records with the playhouse s inaugural run of charles dickens christmas carol they d encouraged masks though staff acknowledged most went without during december byrne and other playhouse officials took a trip to see the omaha community playhouse s version and was asked per the event s requirement to put on a mask advertisement every audience member wore a mask and i didn t hear anybody complain said byrne so goes a thorny debate now nearly two years into the pandemic many agree the show from music to drama must go on but with audiences returning wishing to reawaken traditions organizers feel hewn to the communal virus protocols accepted or tolerated by what audiences bring into shows this year christmas at the cathedral a night of sacred music and performance at st joseph s cathedral in sioux falls returned with a weekend of nearly sold out shows ellen keena a marketing and communications specialist for the catholic community foundation for eastern south dakota noted the event reduced the number of available seats in the cathedral but like attendance at mass mask wearing was voluntary they re offered but not required said keena out on the rolling hill country of eastern union county attendees are coming again too to pederson s store for open houses but many move forward as gingerly or wide eyed about the consequences of once again living during a pandemic we kind of quit paying attention to all those numbers because it s enabled a little more fear in my children said emily colt a mother of four from akron iowa who attended the nora store over the weekend with her family her daughter playing saxophone and mother playing piano and organ just as she had in past years i call it our quiet tradition even though there s singing advertisement colt noted the weekend show was busy though not as packed as pedersen s performances in previous years she has been coming for a generation and noted the big crowds help pedersen keep current with the old store repairs i really really hope we re back to some kind of normalcy next year
