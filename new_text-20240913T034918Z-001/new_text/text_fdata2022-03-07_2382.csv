financial markets that were already unsteady after two years of the pandemic and the threat of central banks pulling back on stimulus investors have grown leery of owning riskier assets as surging commodity prices exacerbate inflationary pressures that could force policy makers to tamp down growth the longer oil prices and inflation remain elevated and thereby threaten an early demise of this economic expansion and bull market the more investors will trim their exposure to equities wrote sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra investor uncertainty should elevate the angst markets

struggling with high inflation due to the pandemic the federal reserve and other key central banks now face the tricky task of tightening monetary policy to contain the cost of living without upending

is needed to some degree to generate positive returns in any environment investors however are concerned that this latest market disruption could hasten the end of the cycle comments the most obvious interpretation of the russia ukraine situation is that extended disruptions to global commodity markets will push inflation higher for longer while economic growth slows as global trade and supply chains remain constrained such conditions could lead to stagflation said lisa shalett chief investment officer at morgan stanley wealth management the moves are definitely a reflection of sentiment which is deteriorating quickly anastasia amoroso chief investment strategist at icapital said in a phone interview but i would say it s more than just sentiment we re looking at potentially meaningfully higher inflation in the coming months and potentially a much slower growth because of it some of the main moves in markets stocks the s p 500 fell 3 per cent as of 4 p m new york time the

how my career was cancelled by the woke warriors who have taken over publishing dropped for supporting jk rowling this children s author now works as an hgv driver here she reveals the dystopian world where writers are obliterated overnight once upon a time in a halcyon era that now seems like a distant golden age writing books was a creative endeavour a job in which you let your imagination take flight various points of view were allowed to flourish stories were peopled by both heroes and villains the offensive the reprehensible even the downright evil coexisted with the noble and good fiction was as multi faceted as the world we live in and writing was a realm of free expression in which authors had licence to provoke thought illuminate discussion even dare i say it voice unfashionable opinions without fear of being pilloried and cancelled white authors such as alexander mccall smith could invent black characters as he did in his wildly successful botswana based the no 1 ladies detective agency without being accused of cultural appropriation thomas harris could conjure from his fertile mind the grotesque dr hannibal lecter in the silence of the lambs without being accused of celebrating cannibalism and he could invent the chilling serial killer buffalo bill who murdered and skinned overweight females to make a woman suit out of their skin without being cancelled for transphobia in that not so distant past jk rowling could have freely expressed a belief that a biological male with a man s body and genitalia could not become a woman simply because he felt like one once upon a time in a halcyon era that now seems like a distant golden age writing books was a creative endeavour a job in which you let your imagination take flight writes gillian philip today all that has changed our freedom to think expansively and creatively even to express our own views is being undermined as surely as it would be in a totalitarian state books are literally being pulped if their authors refuse to toe the line it is as if the communist red guard has taken over and some of us myself among them who have challenged the prevailing orthodoxy on anything from transgender issues to race have been summarily dropped by our publishers chilling isn t it the change has crept up on us insidiously today we live in a dystopian world where writers are cowed terrified of causing offence before we even put fingers to keyboard we are thinking about the all powerful lobby of censors who might construe something we have written as objectionable i know this because i am a writer or more specifically was one who fell prey to publishing s woke agenda when two years ago i offered my support to jk rowling on twitter for the stand she had taken against transgender people being allowed to identify as male or female at will i shared her concern that there should be checks on potential predators who might take advantage of the relaxed rules i added the hashtag istandwithjkrowling to my twitter handle in response to the author s essay in which she revealed that she was a domestic abuse survivor and argued that letting any self identifying trans woman into single sex spaces without appropriate checks could present a danger to females i was subjected to a torrent of abuse on social media like rowling even though i am not remotely transphobic i was called everything from a transphobe to a piece of s i was labelled a terf trans exclusionary radical feminist the derogatory term used by transgender activists for the women they believe don t back their cause the hue and cry this provoked was unimaginable i was subjected to a torrent of abuse on social media like rowling even though i am not remotely transphobic i was called everything from a transphobe to a piece of s i was labelled a terf trans exclusionary radical feminist the derogatory term used by transgender activists for the women they believe don t back their cause my successful career as an author one of a team writing animal fantasy novels for children between eight and 12 under the name erin hunter was obliterated overnight the company i worked for working partners a book packager that sells concepts and series to different publishers issued a pious email to all those who had complained to the firm about me the worlds created by erin hunter are meant to be inclusive for all readers and we want to let you know that gillian philip will no longer be writing any erin hunter novels they wrote to the anonymous trolls who had sent me death threats my career was literally cancelled although the job was one i loved i had won awards and made eight promotional tours of america where the erin hunter series is huge i have felt too traumatised to begin writing another novel since my husband ian had died a month before i was dropped by my publishers in may 2020 leaving me a widow with two teenage children the firm sent flowers and a note of condolence weeks later they were ruthlessly ending my job the combination of grief and stress almost floored me kate clanchy was criticised for using racist tropes in her description of pupils as having chocolate coloured skin or almond eyes yet the woke brigade who cancelled me often use the hashtag be kind it seems to me that their humanity is selective only those they consider deserving of it are offered compassion which tells us just how morally bankrupt they really are i now work as an hgv driver a job i find more congenial actually more intellectually liberating because my workmates do not mind what opinions i have and are happy to discuss them with me they are also much less misogynistic than i have found the publishing industry to be it is ironic too that the cadre of self appointed censors in the book world who feel it is their role to defend every minority group from the tiniest slight is largely white privileged and middle class these self appointed ethical guardians have appropriated and warped a term woke that was originally coined by black african americans to describe people who are awake to racism and prejudice but of course the publishing zealots are blind to such anomalies cultural appropriation is not a transgression that applies to them they take their order from bloggers social media users no matter how venomous and unhinged and the growing army of sensitivity readers who are employed to scrutinise every pre publication text for even the most minor infractions it is as if we can t trust children to have their own moral compass any more their thoughts have to be directed and channelled in an approved way stock image so ludicrously inflated has the role of these scrutineers become that whole teams are employed to pore over proofs the results can be farcical what is praiseworthy to some readers offends others and it s not only professional readers that can derail your career the critically acclaimed author and former teacher kate clanchy was forced to part company with her publisher pan macmillan earlier this year after her orwell prize winning memoir some kids i taught and what they taught me was subjected to a trashing from goodreads a forum in which readers review and give star ratings to books clanchy was criticised for using racist tropes in her description of pupils as having chocolate coloured skin or almond eyes one sensitive reader objected to clanchy s use of disfigure to describe the effects of spoil heaps on a landscape another quibbled that she should not use handicap in its ordinary sense of impede despite clanchy s former pupils springing to her defence and endorsements on her book s dust jacket praising its inclusiveness and humanity she and her publisher parted by mutual consent last month she acquired a new publisher swift press which is to reissue her book with amendments in a more benign era we authors used to joke about goodreads we d urge each other not to look at it because it was damaging to the ego to read a one star review there was even a twitter account dontgoodreads dedicated to the thought but that is as far as our concerns reached how extraordinary then that today goodreads reviewers have such a stranglehold over publishers that they have the power to destroy established writers who do not conform to woke views in the transwoman grace lavery s newly published memoir please miss there is a reference to the author s penis as a miscarried foetus many modern authors would mock the victorians attitude to children s literature which decreed that stories should be morality tales encouraging good citizenship and reinforcing the accepted ethics of the day yet the woke lobbyists are doing just that encouraging didactic preachiness at the expense of free imagination and empathy it is as if we can t trust children to have their own moral compass any more their thoughts have to be directed and channelled in an approved way publishing has become censorious nannying overbearing authors consciences or even those of their editors are no longer trusted and the young adult side of the industry has capitulated to the tyranny completely the stifling outsourcing to sensitivity readers the indignation of the fresh faced privileged and entitled juniors of the publishing world who insist that every email is signed off with their favoured personal pronouns all of it is deeply concerning i try to make light of it by adopting hi vis as my personal pronouns on my twitter page it s my joke because i now wear a luminous yellow jacket for work i hope i infuriate the publishing interns the bloggers and the twitterati who take these matters so seriously the stifling outsourcing to sensitivity readers the indignation of the fresh faced privileged and entitled juniors of the publishing world who insist that every email is signed off with their favoured personal pronouns all of it is deeply concerning stock image but we have reason to be afraid for the publishing industry because it s destroying itself many senior people know there s a problem but they are too scared to address it i expect that the only way i will write again is if i self publish a route once derided as the last resort of amateurs but is now quite possibly the only outlet for honest direct and emotional writing i could list dozens of examples of privileged white middle class writers who bully other writers into changing their work to suit their own prejudices such a clique has driven my friend the children s author rachel rooney out of publishing rachel is an autistic author who is devoted to child development and safeguarding and her writing was critically celebrated yet a bullying campaign by other children s writers forced her to stop writing rachel s delightful picture book my body is me was labelled transphobic simply because it celebrated the fact that no child s body is wrong i expect that the only way i will write again is if i self publish a route once derided as the last resort of amateurs but is now quite possibly the only outlet for honest direct and emotional writing pictured ms philip her transgression was to write a book to counteract what she described as an explosion of titles promoting the idea that children who felt confused about their gender may be trapped in the wrong body and the persecution goes on even now only this week prominent children s writers whipped up an abusive mob against her forcing her off twitter a few weeks ago onjali rauf a muslim woman writer who campaigns against modern slavery and human trafficking and was shortlisted for the phoenix book award was snubbed by the agent of another nominated author for being a terf this agent simply cut onjali s name out of the image she posted on twitter of shortlisted authors she did so because she knew she could without censure from the publishing industry onjali s transgression is a familiar one she had criticised trans activists for drowning out the voices of the very women who laid the foundations of the freedoms they enjoy it is curious to me that in today s topsy turvy world some people s sensitivities simply don t matter in the transwoman grace lavery s newly published memoir please miss there is a reference to the author s penis as a miscarried foetus i find this offensive as i am sure it would also be to many women who

a strategic partnership through a debt deal could be the much needed boost for two underperforming weed stocks health care is the second worst performing sector thus far in 2022 thanks to underperforming cannabis stocks industry leaders canopy growth and tilray brands tsx tlry nasdaq tlry are losing year to date however the latter announced a strategic partnership with hexo tsx hexo nasdaq hexo once tilray secures shareholders approval it will have a significant minority stake 37 in its rival through a debt deal the transaction calls for hexo to sell us 211 million of its senior secured convertible notes to tilray at 90 cents on the dollar besides the debt deal tilray and hexo will enter into and launch a joint venture jv each company will produce pre rolls beverages and edibles within the next two years the tandem expects to realize 50 million in cost savings tilray and hexo trade at 7 35 and 0 73 per share respectively and are down by an identical 17 year to date the two cannabis producers have yet to report net profits their priorities are to cut costs to help improve cash flows the future partners need a boost badly to lift their sagging fortunes market share opportunities tilray s ceo irwin simon said the deal will strengthen both companies not only in canada but also in europe s medical cannabis market they are also awaiting the federal legalization of marijuana in the united states he said doing this with hexo creates tremendous market share opportunities with consumers and helps get the right message out to the market simon expects a lot of change to happen in the market place if the companies work together according to scott cooper hexo s resident and ceo the partnership is the most optimal agreement to strengthen the balance sheet it should also preserve value for shareholders and provide capital to execute hexo s path forward plan cooper adds that the strategic alliance will help lower costs and preserve hexo s stand alone optionality simon is confident to secure shareholder approval within 90 days from the announcement critical first step hexo s board chairman mark attanasio said restructuring hexo s debt is a critical first step in allowing the company to move forward with its path forward strategy and to begin to unlock significant shareholder value he adds that the company has been through a crippling overhang for the past 12 months the punitive redemptions and discounted dilutive financings were the problems that need solutions attanasio said fortunately the new deal with tilray can place hexo solidly on a path to growth an agreement between hexo and kaos capital is in place kaos will provide 180 million in equity to ensure hexo maintains a strengthened balance sheet the equity should also cover all interest and operational costs in the near term financial and strategic benefits the parties to the jv cite three financial and strategic benefits hexo will have operational flexibility with the purchase of the notes it will likewise free previously restricted us 80 million in cash as mentioned earlier the substantial synergies will result in 50 million in cost savings third tilray and hexo commit to leveraging their innovation brand building and operational efficiencies sharing of expertise and know how should strengthen market positioning while capitalizing on growth opportunities not a buy the benefits sound interesting if not exciting however weed stocks are risky investments and highly speculative investors were burned before by empty promises

aviation s owning v renting debate is a rite of spring best enjoyed while listening to stravinsky on your sixty eight firebird s 8 track in the fbo parking lot as you consider whether to buy a cirrus sweet or rent a cessna dependable tough decision but perhaps a sprig of fractured hamlet will clarify the choice to be or not to be an airplane owner whether tis nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortunes showered on insurance maintenance and hangars or eschew the thousand unnatural shocks that ownership is heir to and give pause to mask the true costs by renting from the fbo who is painfully aware of reality that is the question which will never be answered but let s throw down the gauntlet to see who retrieves it over the past 45 years i ve owned 6 2 airplanes which is one airplane every 87 months included in the madness bonanza stitts cherokee marquart tripacer no snickering damn fine airplane citabria and champ the tripe had five partners sharing ownership duties meaning one guy did all the work allowing the rest of us to fly and complain when something broke as sole owner of the citabria and champ i assume all costs and despite my experience i have yet again managed to schedule both to be down for simultaneous annual inspections you d think i d learn but i don t and likely never will when asked why i own two airplanes i reply with a straight face not easy when you have bell s palsy as i do one needs a second airplane in order to retrieve parts for the other there s nothing rational about flight but once we accept that premise and i wholeheartedly do then embracing the many lunacies that accompany an unfettered passion becomes routine love has that power for instance i recently spent 13 000 on my champ s annual inspection i realize cessna 210 owners shrug at such a low bill but that s more than double what i paid for the airplane in 1982 granted inflation deflates my indignation and included in the 13k are four new millennium cylinders that so far are performing well curiously when you rebuild a vintage engine even using new parts performance enhancement is negligible it s still a 65 hp champ practically perfect in every way provided i keep replacing parts which lances a long festering aviation boil i can t list all the stc d gewgaws i ve installed in my airplanes that came with explicit or implicit claims of being direct replacements for original equipment just pop out the old slide in the new season to taste and you re back in the saddle before the mechanic can say um this doesn t fit consider two recent examples the new millennium cylinders look great work fine and are legitimate replacements for the original continental 65s which are difficult to find and more challenging to find shops willing to hone new life into worn out jugs millenniums are stc d as direct replacements except as we discovered during installation the heads are slightly larger than the originals requiring modifications to the baffling and lower cowling cut snip file patch grumble repeat until the new cylinders directly replaced the old billable time consuming but doable the champ has returned to service and everyone s happy especially the mechanic who gets to roll that juicy 210 into the shop meanwhile the parallel universe citabria maintenance got a little out of hand at the completion of previous budget defying annuals i ve muttered to amused mechanics at least next year it won t be this extensive or expensive that s rarely the case the 7eca citabria has been eating up rubber engine mount bushings since i bought it five years ago american champion aircraft aca provides good tech support and suggested i buy a new beefier conical engine mount not too expensive but unfortunately not in stock so give us four weeks to fabricate one in any color so long as its black into the third week of waiting but hope and rationalization spring eternal and with luck i ll fly before spring 2023 after placing the order i felt giddy with fantasies of flight behind an engine that wouldn t lose its grip when the law of unintended consequences poked its beak into my euphoric bubble every action in aircraft ownership causes an equal and unforeseen reaction after ordering the new hardware we realized that the additional curved tubing that gives the mount its beef also blocks engine baffling vent tubes there to cool the magnetos aca tech support anticipated my follow up call and added appropriately modified baffling to the order during the downtime we decided to replace the incandescent position light in the rudder with a new whelen led position light and strobe combo that i inferred was a direct replacement for the old fixture simply unfasten two rusty screws remove the current unit reconnect the forty year old wires and slide in the direct replacement which didn t come close to fitting no problem aircraft spruce is excellent about returns and within days i had a smaller tso d aeroleds suntail that resembles the backup light on a fifty six mercury it fits the aperture and after hours of rewiring directly replaced the old so while i await aca s mas macho engine mount which i m certain will slide into place without any adjustments i can flash the fifties retro tail strobe at hangar wags who taunt an annual inspection is intended to be performed every year not all year let them laugh i ll sleep perchance to dream of sunset flights with my new strobe blinding those who dare get on my six firing salvos of unwelcome reality aviation has always required blending lofty expectations with bucketsful of unknowns tossed into the slurry i offer no insight to the owning v renting discussion because rationalizing ownership is a fool s errand but here s the rub no bigger fool than i will repeatedly take up that gauntlet and fly with dogged optimism into the sunlit uplands of delusion see you up there

democracy starts with us the pennsylvania legislature is among the largest and highest paid in the country unfortunately democracy is not measured by how many state and federal representatives we have or even by how much we pay our representatives it is what they do pennsylvania s full time legislators in the house met 69 days and senate members only 52 days during the last calendar year true some of their time was spent in travel to the bahamas for off site discussions but we need to do better pennsylvania s essential role in the founding of our country earned it the nickname the keystone state that s a lot to live up to our state legislators have a decisive role in democracy but we have the most important role democracy starts with us we select our representatives to act for us make your preferences known now is a great time to meet with our representatives to understand redistricting gerrymandering the electoral college win without a majority of total votes foreign interference and new voter id laws that s our responsibility we have to understand the issues tell our representatives what we think and be sure our representatives understand for example we can discuss under resourced cities gun violence the pandemic and mask mandates school inequalities the health of our natural environment unionization and voter suppression the mid term election in 2022 is very important yes we hold our politicians accountable for democracy but we have the most important role carl evensen ferguson township benninghoff and the blame game state house majority leader kerry benninghoff s op ed in thursday s cdt is a prime example of using a non partisan issue the ukraine invasion for partisan purposes representative benninghoff writes about the importance of pennsylvania s natural gas resources in a global energy market that is in the throes of dramatic geopolitical change fair enough unfortunately he omits any mention that pennsylvania is already the natural gas producing state with the lowest taxes in the industry strangely he goes on to blame the democrats and the wolf administration for a failure of leadership even though pennsylvania is the second largest producer of natural gas in the country following only texas which by the way levies a 7 5 extraction tax to pennsylvania s 0 extraction tax instead pa charges an annual impact fee for every gas well that s drilled resulting in much lower revenues but in the most egregious and blatantly self serving portion of his piece he blames our state and federal leaders for policies that will embolden vladimir putin nice try mr benninghoff but your reasoning is full of gas and your argument doesn t hold water ronald filippelli state college business tax reductions don t create jobs a common false narrative pushed by republican politicians is that reducing an employer s income tax will lead to job creation not true the theory is that employers upon learning that their tax liabilities are being reduced will be so overjoyed that they will rush right out and hire a bunch of additional people ain t gonna happen employers altruistic as they might be do not hire more people just because they can afford to they hire more people when they need them to meet an increased demand for their products or services this erroneous theory called supply side economics or trickle down economics has been around for a long time at least since the reagan administration hence the alternative term reaganomics which george h w bush called voodoo economics it was repeated twice by the bush 43 administration and again by the trump administration the historical data shows that the promised jobs creation never occurred in any of those four cases and there is no reason to expect it should have of course the tax reductions left more after tax profits in the business coffers what did they do with the extra money they increased dividends to shareholders and retired treasury stock both of which enriched the investor class they also quite likely returned some of it to the very politicians who provided them with the tax reduction in the first place in the form of campaign contributions could this have been the intent all along but they did not create jobs ed satalia state college
russian president vladimir putin chairs a security council meeting via video conference at the novo ogaryovo residence outside moscow last year an investing movement that promotes itself as a protector of people and the planet has somehow found itself providing capital to the autocratic regime behind europe s worst military conflict since world war ii funds labeled esg an acronym that denotes a commitment to environmental social and governance interests own shares of russia s state backed energy behemoths gazprom and rosneft as well as its biggest lender sberbank the funds also hold russian government bonds providing money that ultimately helped pad the coffers of president vladimir putin s autocracy advertisement paul clements hunt who led a group that coined the term esg back in the mid 2000s said it s now clear that esg investors have failed esg is being used ineffectively said clements hunt founder of advisory firm blended capital group investors should be measuring risks across entire systems not just corporate risks but instead the obsession with easy moneymaking is overriding everything he said russia s invasion of ukraine is rapidly laying bare unexpected exposure in much of the esg universe industry researchers at morningstar inc estimate that 14 of sustainable funds globally held russian assets right before the war that s as sustainable investing morphs into a 40 trillion industry embraced by the financial behemoths of wall street where funds that track benchmark indexes are ubiquitous advertisement ukraine is one of the most important esg issues we ve ever had said philippe zaouati chief executive of mirova the 30 billion sustainable investing unit affiliated with natixis investment managers it s a vital issue for energy and human rights and questions whether we still want to live in a democracy or not but those representing the more mainstream side of esg investing argue the term is widely misunderstood it is in fact just a screening tool to protect investments from environmental social and governance risks according to some of the biggest firms working with and analyzing esg data there are still people who inappropriately conflate sustainability and ethics said hortense bioy morningstar s global head of sustainability research sustainable and esg funds aren t the same as ethical funds advertisement for that reason esg funds can buy a wide variety of companies including makers of conventional weapons and producers of fossil fuels the world s biggest esg focused exchange traded fund blackrock inc s 23 7 billion ishares esg aware msci usa holds shares of companies such as raytheon technologies corp and exxon mobil corp bioy said esg portfolio managers just like any other managers holding russian assets or not will be evaluating the situation and trying to understand the broader implications of the conflict and impact on their portfolios the war has broader implications for esg investors than just ethical ones she said others point out that rejecting russian assets entirely also can mean cutting off good companies these often include technology firms that are actively trying to provide transparency in defiance of putin s restrictions advertisement rachel robasciotti founder of adasina social capital in san francisco which runs an 89 million etf that focuses on social justice issues said that unless a business is clearly an instrument of a despotic regime it s important to differentiate between companies and the countries in which they operate we don t punish companies for the actions of the country where they are headquartered she said boston common asset management one of the oldest socially responsible investors owned shares of russian search engine yandex because it seemed to be contributing positively to democracy in russia said kevin hart the firm s head of marketing the tech company had even adopted a code of conduct that addressed human rights and supply chain issues he said but the 6 billion investment firm ended up selling its stake in yandex last month advertisement mirova s zaouati said this should be a moment of recalibration for esg investors we have to decide what we do with the russian government and all companies linked to the russian government he said we have to decide what we will do with other autocratic regimes asking that question has led mirova to exclude not just russian but also chinese assets felix boudreault managing partner at research firm sustainable market strategies in montreal said he s been warning clients to stay out of russia since 2018 and is now giving the same advice about china as an investor you have to consider not just the company but the environment in which they operate boudreault said and we are saying the same for china it s uninvestable from any esg perspective by a strike of a pen a bureaucrat in beijing can really kind of wipe out an entire sector like they did with education technologies recently advertisement clements hunt who was among a group of esg pioneers that included the now deceased united nations secretary general kofi annan said the answer is clear if you don t factor in autocracy and a malevolent government then you have failed in your esg assessment he said bloomberg writer natasha white contributed to this report

it s sweet times in southwest michigan as the sap is rising and sugar shacks are busy producing the state s oldest agricultural crop and for those who are up for a road trip the michigan maple syrup association is again hosting its michigan maple syrup weekends the further north you go the later the sap runs and so the event is divided into three regions the southern lower which is everything south of u s 10 which runs from ludington to bay city northern lower peninsula north of u s 10 and the upper peninsula across the mackinac bridge michigan maple syrup weekends run in the southern lower michigan region which includes southwest michigan on march 19 and 20 northern lower on the following weekend and end the weekend of april 2 3 in the upper peninsula ty kat sugar shack in galien michigan a small village just across from the indiana state line is one of the 24 members of the michigan maple syrup association that are participating in the michigan maple syrup weekends this year it s a good place to start for those from northwest indiana denise klopfenstein started ty kat as both a way to return to the family roots her grandparents owned a sugar shack that was destroyed by a tornado in the 1940s and to give her son tyler who was 12 at the time a way to enjoy the outdoors on march 19 and 20 they will be doing syrup or liquid gold as it is often called demonstrations if you can t make it then text or call or send a message on facebook to find out when they ll be boiling sap in the future as they welcome visitors ty kat maple syrup is sold year round at the family s payne heritage country store located on their farm right next to their sugar shack the family owned store is open on saturdays and sundays year round and also sells the honey they harvest and the meat they raise we only carry items made from family based businesses such as crystal springs creamery ebel s little town jerky and walnut creek product says klopfenstein noting they also have handmade goat s milk soap and bath products as well as candy we also make gift baskets from our products they also sell freakin pickles made in a family run gourmet pickle business in gres michigan that currently comes in 12 flavors including old fashioned dill garlic dill and hot garlic dill so shopping there is a way to stock up on indiana and michigan artisan products according to the association michigan ranks 5 in the nation for maple syrup production with more than 3 6 million gallons of sap harvested annually the sap produced by tapping maple trees when the weather is just right in the spring is then boiled down to make the syrup it takes about 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of syrup overall michigan typically produces about 90 000 gallons of syrup annually like wine the terroir or soil where the trees grow gives the syrup its flavor so does the type of maple tree sugar maples are the best because they have the highest sugar content 2 but other maple trees can be tapped for sap including black red silver and ash leafed even though their sap only contains about one percent sugar luckily michigan has an abundance of sugar maples more than three times the amount of vermont the number one producer of maple syrup in the u s and quebec another major producer but michigan maple syrup is in demand as local wineries breweries and distilleries come up with different ways to use it when crafting their drinks to check that out stop at the journeyman distillery just a short drive from galien once the home to the revolutionary featherbone factory where they made corsets out of turkey feathers instead of whale bones the large building is now a restaurant bar and distillery one of the ingredients in the journeyman fig old fashioned is their journeyman bourbon maple syrup though ty kat is the only southwest syrup maker participating in this year s michigan maple syrup weekends there are other sugar camps in southwest michigan john newell of primal woods in hartford harkens to the past but also uses the technologies of today during sugar time newell who moved to a wide patch of woods surrounding a lake from napierville illinois to escape the corporate life may wear an ear pod to handle the constant stream of calls he gets every day he goes online checking the 10 day weather forecast to determine what days the sap will be rising and uses a state of the art evaporator to process the sap to syrup but when it comes to collecting the sap he is decidedly old fashioned i thought why not do it like they used to says newell who hires elmer beechy an amish farmer who lives nearby beachy along with several of his sons brings along two large belgians and hitches them to the sap collecting cart that newell built the horses as huge as they are navigate through the trees stopping while the beechys gather the sap buckets hanging from the oaks and empty the buckets of sap into the large container sitting on top of the cart we re weather dependent he says as the wood fire of the evaporator heats up the evaporator to 219 degrees the boiling temperature of sugary sap indeed sap really starts to flow when the outdoor temperatures are above freezing during the day and below freezing at night people can visit the farm to watch the entire process but it s best to call ahead to make sure the sap is rising an interactive map listing the participating in the michigan maple weekend along with directions can be found online at michiganmaple org each of the 24 farms offers a variety of activities that are designed to be family friendly and educational besides the chance to watch the process of producing syrup from sap many of the farms offer tapping demonstrations and sampling of maple candies and other foods made from syrup as well because the woods in spring can be a mucky business it s important to wear boots primal woods is located at 60734 46th ave hartford mi 269 222 0101 primalwoods com newell welcomes visitors but calling first is a must

news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters disney rides and attractions are the number one then food and beverage are really neck and neck with why people go to the parks dennis speigel president of international theme parks services said it s just a fact and what parks have seized on in the last 20 years is building their new attractions around areas that offer food and beverage disney has taken this a step further with its new star wars galactic starcruiser experience unlike its themed lands like pandora galaxy s edge and avenger s campus the halcyon is a two day immersive experience guests aren t strolling in for a bite or a drink they are living a star wars story for 48 hours that means chef brian piasecki and his team had to create an all inclusive program of food that would be delivered to guests over the course of two days onboard the halcyon disney is showcasing some of its more ambitious and delectable food and beverage creations piasecki worked to create dishes for breakfast lunch and dinner that were accessible to guests but also upscale the lunch buffets for example feature familiar dishes such as grilled cheese and tomato soup peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and salads but with a distinctly star wars spin sarah whitten the food trays which are used for the breakfast and lunch buffets are uniquely shaped with three rectangular depressions so that dishes can slide into place snugly and not move when being carried into the crown of corellia dining room the main eating hall onboard the halcyon they have a distinct sci fi aesthetic but are also incredibly functional especially for those who want to try a little bit of everything it s so important to the experience and it s something that is really under the microscope now in our industry speigel said everybody is looking at ways to improve and that s quality service style plating everything i think that s going to be with us forever now a history of innovation while disney has long used food design as a way of elevating its traditional fare it entered a new phase of innovation in 2017 when it launched its theme park land based on the planet pandora from james cameron s film avatar with this new land disney had the opportunity to create its own cuisine it wasn t translating foreign dishes and recreating them at epcot it was taking inspiration from a film about an alien planet chefs used spices found in argentinian brazilian and chinese cooking to bring a distinct flavor profile to its food it expands the experience said bill coan president and ceo of itec entertainment disney is playing this out and playing it up to advance the visitor experience and at the same time generate incremental revenue guests tend to be less stringent about their diets while on vacation and will opt to try out menu items that they cannot get anywhere else coan said at satu li canteen guests make their own grain bowls choosing between a base of quinoa and vegetable salad red and sweet potato hash mixed whole grain and rice or romaine and kale salad then they add either grilled chicken roasted beef shrimp or chili spiced tofu on top as well as a variety of dressing options disney the menu also features pods better known as bao buns inside these steamed buns is either a cheeseburger or vegetable curry the culinary team also designed unique desserts for the themed land there is a blueberry cream cheese mouse with passion fruit curd and a chocolate cake with crunchy cookie crumbs and banana cream topping disney each has been designed to have an out of this world look that is both appetizing and photographable instagram has become a place for parkgoers to share their food experience at the parks with others and to get ideas of what they should try in the future pandora also has an array of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks available from pongu pongu a themed tiki bar located near the canteen taste a galaxy far far away disney continued this innovation when it opened its two galaxy s edge locations one in florida and one in california in 2019 the main dining location is docking bay 7 here guests can sample the braised shaak roast beef with pasta or the felucian garden spread vegan meatballs with hummus among other items there s also ronto roasters which is home to the famed ronto wrap it s a grilled sausage and roasted pork wrap with a spicy slaw make sure you have a drink if you decide to bite into this one it s got a kick kent phillips disney parks if you are in the california park you can wash it down with a glass of phattro from the docking bay it s a play on a half lemonade half iced tea drink and features a dash of pear juice oga s cantina is a place for star wars fans to embrace their inner scoundrel here guests can order alcoholic drinks that are both familiar and foreign with names like fuzzy tauntaun jedi mind trick and bloody rancor those looking to skip the booze can try out mixed drinks like the carbon freeze and the hyperdrive which feature fruit juices popping pearls and dry ice reservations for oga s fill up quickly and often purchasable specialty drink mugs are out of stock understands that if you do it and you do it right the theming and the quality of what you are serving the guests will buy it speigel said kent phillips disney parks additionally throughout the themed land parkgoers can purchase special bottles of coca cola products the beverage company worked with disney to create stylized coke sprite and dasani bottles that fit into the world of batuu the sodas are reminiscent of thermal detonators from the star wars films and feature the name of each brand in aurebesh the fictional language of star wars down to earth food for disneyland s avengers campus which opened in 2021 the theme park was faced with a new challenge innovating traditional american food disney s culinary team decided to lean into its superhero theme and rely on ant man and the wasp to create unique menu items the main dining area within avengers campus is called pym test kitchen here scientists use growing and shrinking technology to make monstrously large and surprisingly small creations guests can enjoy chicken sandwiches with massive chicken patties spaghetti and meatballs with one large meatball and soft pretzels that are the size of a head among other items disney next door is pym tasting lab a place for adults to enjoy craft beers and signature cocktails the mixologists play with flavor offering a variety of ingredients that range from habanero and mango to lemon and vanilla disney there are two food carts the first is shawarma palace a nod to the iconic mid credits scene from the avengers the other is called terran treats this booth is located near the guardians of the galaxy ride and features items that play on traditional human foods circular rainbow churros and bright purple cream puffs are just a few of the delicacies available venturing back to space in creating the star wars galactic starcruiser experience disney took everything it had learned from pandora galaxy s edge and avengers campus and set the bar higher as part of the total cost of the two day experience all meals are included so for breakfast and lunch guests are treated to buffet style meals they can pick and choose from a dozen or so options and eat as much or as little as they want it fills you up and you have fun eating it speigel said disney the dining room is equipped with a traditional soda fountain as well as free blue milk and green milk which is featured in the galaxy s edge park land special alcoholic beverages are the only menu items that need to be purchased separately disney for dinner there is a set menu and on the first night on board the halcyon dinner comes with a show while guests are enjoying colorful bao buns and noodles the galactic songstress gaya begins her performance a mix of pop jazz and rhythm and blues chef piasecki pointed out that the different colored bao buns reflect the colors in gaya s outfit disney the second course was served family style at each table and consisted of bantha beef tenderloin tip yip chicken stewed shrimp green herbed fluffy rice and surabat spiced flora the beef tenderloin was glazed with tamarind and came alongside potatoes the chicken was glazed in bourbon and lightly fried the shrimp was cooked with lemon grass and served with coconut lime foam the rice was cooked with herbs and the flora was vegetables roasted with harissa spice dinner on the second night was a taste of the galaxy featuring dishes based on different planets in the star wars universe it was during this meal that disney s culinary prowess was on full display disney each course was served simultaneously with dozens of crew members descending into the dining room at once to deliver plates there was a dish of cheeses and bread inspired by the molten planet mustafar blue shrimp from the jungles of felucia that arrives billowing in cool smoke and a beef and seafood plate drawn from the wookie home world of kashyyyk the galactic starcruiser does have other options on its menu for those with less adventurous palates or dietary restrictions alcoholic beverages can be purchased in the crown of corellia dining room as well as at the sublight lounge guests will recognize many of the signature cocktails as they are based on traditional drinks but they have been elevated the hoth icebreaker for example is reminiscent of a lemon drop martini but is served in a unique glass colored blue and features a vanilla and lemon foam as well as an isomalt sugar garnish what disney has done with the starcruiser and that menu and what they are putting out i think that will trickle down in many many different ways throughout the whole industry speigel said

menafn caribbean news global washington usa the international monetary fund imf executive board met on march 4 in a meeting chaired by managing director kristalina georgieva staff briefed the board on the economic impact of the war in ukraine and on possible fast tracked financial assistance for affected countries the war in ukraine is resulting in tragic loss of life and human suffering as well as causing massive damage to ukraine s physical infrastructure it has sent a wave of more than one million refugees to neighbouring countries unprecedented sanctions have been announced on russia while the situation remains highly fluid and the outlook is subject to extraordinary uncertainty the economic consequences are already very serious energy and commodity prices including wheat and other grains have surged adding to inflationary pressures from supply chain disruptions and the rebound from the covid 19 pandemic price shocks will have an impact worldwide especially on poor households for whom food and fuel are a higher proportion of expenses should the conflict escalate the economic damage would be all the more devastating the sanctions on russia will also have a substantial impact on the global economy and financial markets with significant spillovers to other countries in many countries the crisis is creating an adverse shock to both inflation and activity amid already elevated price pressures monetary authorities will need to carefully monitor the pass through of rising international prices to domestic inflation to calibrate appropriate responses fiscal policy will need to support the most vulnerable households to help offset rising living costs this crisis will create complex policy tradeoffs further complicating the policy landscape as the world economy recovers from the pandemic crisis in ukraine in addition to the human toll the economic damage is already substantial seaports and airports are closed and have been damaged and many roads and bridges have been damaged or destroyed while it is very difficult to assess financing needs precisely at this stage it is already clear that ukraine will face significant recovery and reconstruction costs ukraine has already requested emergency financing of 1 4 billion under the imf s rapid financing instrument staff anticipates bringing this request to the executive board for consideration as early as next week the sanctions announced against the central bank of the russian federation will severely restrict its access to international reserves to support its currency and financial system international sanctions on russia s banking system and the exclusion of a number of banks from swift have significantly disrupted russia s ability to receive payments for exports pay for imports and engage in cross border financial transactions while it is too early to foresee the full impact of these sanctions we have already seen a sharp mark down in asset prices as well as the ruble exchange rate countries that have very close economic links with ukraine and russia are at particular risk of scarcity and supply disruptions and are most affected by the increasing inflows of refugees moldova has requested an augmentation and rephasing of its existing imf supported program to help meet the costs of the current crisis and imf staff are actively discussing options with the moldovan authorities staff will continue to monitor the spillover effects on other countries in the region in particular those with existing imf supported programs and those with elevated vulnerabilities or exposures to the crisis the ongoing war and associated sanctions will also have a severe impact on the global economy the fund will advise our member countries on how to calibrate their macroeconomic policies to manage the range of spillovers including via trade disruptions food and other commodity prices and financial markets the imf will continue to assess the evolving situation and provide timely policy advice financial support and technical assistance to our member countries as needed in close collaboration with our international partners
tarek sakr is a former investment banker and ceo of kuwait s largest classifieds company 4sale market participants are now watching the united states anxiously as the federal reserve has committed to a roadmap of raising interest rates after its more relaxed policy of the last two years the debate about pitfalls of loose monetary policy sparked by unprecedented monetary easing on a global scale during and since the 2008 great recession has found its way from the pages of the business press into the public consciousness a fast rising rate of inflation has woken everyone up well not quite everyone the continued middle east tech boom is riding a wave of digitisation catalysed by a pandemic that forced life and business online paradoxically as inflation manifests itself in rising equity valuations unsustainable business models are given flawed vindication rather than being deterred by the high risk environment after more than forty years with a relatively tame rate of inflation pandemic pressures on supply chains labour shortages due to illness and restrictive policies and trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary stimulus in the world s leading economies have hiked inflation in many countries for consumers the perilous chain reaction of rising prices is a reasonably well understood phenomenon simply put flexible prices of everyday goods climb faster than sticky wages and this strain on household budgets contributes to a general economic contraction which depending on the sensibility of policy might spiral into recession the stance of business vis à vis inflated prices is however more complicated while the economy has suffered under pandemic conditions an unexpected global trend has been the almost continuously strong run of stock markets around the world growth stocks traditionally associated with technology companies especially realised outsized returns during one of the worst global crises in modern history the main reason for the stock market s unhampered charging ahead is an unprecedented flow of money into equities while there are arguments about the sources of these inflows and their respective shares in this development cheap money lent out under historically low interest rates in combination with gigantic pandemic stimulus packages is a top contender what is more the tendency predates the immediate pandemic situation having been building up for about a decade high and increasing equity prices being partly a function of stimulus have the merit of encouraging economic activity they are attractive to investors and entrepreneurs alike contributing to a climate of economic risk taking beneficial to growth at least for a time while economic common sense might suggest inflationary movements at some point necessarily entail a deflationary countereffect this does not always have to be the case the whole principle of stimulating lending to consumers and businesses by easing access for banks to central bank money is justified by the idea of creating growth that outpaces collateral inflation to understand the downside to inflation in the equity market a comparison with the problems of businesses which are part of funding frenzies or speculative bubbles is instructive business profitability is key to generating wealth and adding value to the economic system profitable businesses put out goods with a value higher than the cost needed to produce them or they go out of business in a speculative bubble this mechanism ceases to work because profitability stands back behind growth subsequently when profitability is replaced by valuation as the litmus test of successful businesses entrepreneurs have an incentive to embrace ultimately unsustainable but fast growing business models the almost certain prospect of a well paid exit funded with abundant resources of equally inflated venture funds disbalances the risk reward relationship while public and private markets have different fundamentals and drivers the perils of the growth over profitability model can be manifested in some mena startups too especially if the default read across is to silicon valley valuations the us is a unified market of 331 million people with a common language and a single currency while mena is a highly fragmented market of around twenty nations with many languages and multiple currencies accounting for 400 million people the best mena startups who are clearly profitable will deserve silicon valley style premium valuations but there is a tail of regional startups who don t indeed the risk for the booming technology sector especially in the middle east is a direct consequence of these factors inflated equity valuations at the stock exchange are the macroeconomic expression of the same rigged scale of prices present in individual businesses valued at millions of dollars but without any positive future cash flows to be expected any time soon we have reached a point where artificially high valuations in equity markets have become detrimental for sustainable economic activity with consumer price inflation for the first time in years alerting politicians and central bankers to reverse their monetary and fiscal policy stances all ingredients for a comprehensive meltdown are present under such circumstances the first businesses to go bust are cash burning non profitable tech companies business leaders are well advised to brace for strong headwinds and vet their business models venture capitalists and investors should ask themselves whether their stakes in technology businesses are worth what an overheated market has made them believe and what their strategy will be for the perhaps less euphoric but also more healthy economic environment after equity markets return to valuations borne out by market fundamentals

food and beverage innovation developing unique park favorites like mickey mouse shaped ice cream bars and pretzels as well as dole whips and themed candied apples and cookies get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters disney rides and attractions are the number one then food and beverage are really neck and neck with why people go to the parks dennis speigel president of international theme parks services said it s just a fact and what parks have seized on in the last 20 years is building their new attractions around areas that offer food and beverage disney has taken this a step further with its new star wars galactic starcruiser experience unlike its themed lands like pandora galaxy s edge and avenger s campus the halcyon is a two day immersive experience guests aren t strolling in for a bite or a drink they are living a star wars story for 48 hours that means chef brian piasecki and his team had to create an all inclusive program of food that would be delivered to guests over the course of two days onboard the halcyon disney is showcasing some of its more ambitious and delectable food and beverage creations piasecki worked to create dishes for breakfast lunch and dinner that were accessible to guests but also upscale the lunch buffets for example feature familiar dishes such as grilled cheese and tomato soup peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and salads but with a distinctly star wars spin sarah whitten the food trays which are used for the breakfast and lunch buffets are uniquely shaped with three rectangular depressions so that dishes can slide into place snugly and not move when being carried into the crown of corellia dining room the main eating hall onboard the halcyon they have a distinct sci fi aesthetic but are also incredibly functional especially for those who want to try a little bit of everything it s so important to the experience and it s something that is really under the microscope now in our industry speigel said everybody is looking at ways to improve and that s quality service style plating everything i think that s going to be with us forever now a history of innovation while disney has long used food design as a way of elevating its traditional fare it entered a new phase of innovation in 2017 when it launched its theme park land based on the planet pandora from james cameron s film avatar with this new land disney had the opportunity to create its own cuisine it wasn t translating foreign dishes and recreating them at epcot it was taking inspiration from a film about an alien planet chefs used spices found in argentinian brazilian and chinese cooking to bring a distinct flavor profile to its food it expands the experience said bill coan president and ceo of itec entertainment disney is playing this out and playing it up to advance the visitor experience and at the same time generate incremental revenue guests tend to be less stringent about their diets while on vacation and will opt to try out menu items that they cannot get anywhere else coan said at satu li canteen guests make their own grain bowls choosing between a base of quinoa and vegetable salad red and sweet potato hash mixed whole grain and rice or romaine and kale salad then they add either grilled chicken roasted beef shrimp or chili spiced tofu on top as well as a variety of dressing options disney the menu also features pods better known as bao buns inside these steamed buns is either a cheeseburger or vegetable curry the culinary team also designed unique desserts for the themed land there is a blueberry cream cheese mouse with passion fruit curd and a chocolate cake with crunchy cookie crumbs and banana cream topping disney each has been designed to have an out of this world look that is both appetizing and photographable instagram has become a place for parkgoers to share their food experience at the parks with others and to get ideas of what they should try in the future pandora also has an array of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks available from pongu pongu a themed tiki bar located near the canteen taste a galaxy far far away disney continued this innovation when it opened its two galaxy s edge locations one in florida and one in california in 2019 the main dining location is docking bay 7 here guests can sample the braised shaak roast beef with pasta or the felucian garden spread vegan meatballs with hummus among other items there s also ronto roasters which is home to the famed ronto wrap it s a grilled sausage and roasted pork wrap with a spicy slaw make sure you have a drink if you decide to bite into this one it s got a kick kent phillips disney parks if you are in the california park you can wash it down with a glass of phattro from the docking bay it s a play on a half lemonade half iced tea drink and features a dash of pear juice oga s cantina is a place for star wars fans to embrace their inner scoundrel here guests can order alcoholic drinks that are both familiar and foreign with names like fuzzy tauntaun jedi mind trick and bloody rancor those looking to skip the booze can try out mixed drinks like the carbon freeze and the hyperdrive which feature fruit juices popping pearls and dry ice reservations for oga s fill up quickly and often purchasable specialty drink mugs are out of stock understands that if you do it and you do it right the theming and the quality of what you are serving the guests will buy it speigel said kent phillips disney parks additionally throughout the themed land parkgoers can purchase special bottles of coca cola products the beverage company worked with disney to create stylized coke sprite and dasani bottles that fit into the world of batuu the sodas are reminiscent of thermal detonators from the star wars films and feature the name of each brand in aurebesh the fictional language of star wars down to earth food for disneyland s avengers campus which opened in 2021 the theme park was faced with a new challenge innovating traditional american food disney s culinary team decided to lean into its superhero theme and rely on ant man and the wasp to create unique menu items the main dining area within avengers campus is called pym test kitchen here scientists use growing and shrinking technology to make monstrously large and surprisingly small creations guests can enjoy chicken sandwiches with massive chicken patties spaghetti and meatballs with one large meatball and soft pretzels that are the size of a head among other items disney next door is pym tasting lab a place for adults to enjoy craft beers and signature cocktails the mixologists play with flavor offering a variety of ingredients that range from habanero and mango to lemon and vanilla disney there are two food carts the first is shawarma palace a nod to the iconic mid credits scene from the avengers the other is called terran treats this booth is located near the guardians of the galaxy ride and features items that play on traditional human foods circular rainbow churros and bright purple cream puffs are just a few of the delicacies available venturing back to space in creating the star wars galactic starcruiser experience disney took everything it had learned from pandora galaxy s edge and avengers campus and set the bar higher as part of the total cost of the two day experience all meals are included so for breakfast and lunch guests are treated to buffet style meals they can pick and choose from a dozen or so options and eat as much or as little as they want it fills you up and you have fun eating it speigel said disney the dining room is equipped with a traditional soda fountain as well as free blue milk and green milk which is featured in the galaxy s edge park land special alcoholic beverages are the only menu items that need to be purchased separately disney for dinner there is a set menu and on the first night on board the halcyon dinner comes with a show while guests are enjoying colorful bao buns and noodles the galactic songstress gaya begins her performance a mix of pop jazz and rhythm and blues chef piasecki pointed out that the different colored bao buns reflect the colors in gaya s outfit disney the second course was served family style at each table and consisted of bantha beef tenderloin tip yip chicken stewed shrimp green herbed fluffy rice and surabat spiced flora the beef tenderloin was glazed with tamarind and came alongside potatoes the chicken was glazed in bourbon and lightly fried the shrimp was cooked with lemon grass and served with coconut lime foam the rice was cooked with herbs and the flora was vegetables roasted with harissa spice dinner on the second night was a taste of the galaxy featuring dishes based on different planets in the star wars universe it was during this meal that disney s culinary prowess was on full display disney each course was served simultaneously with dozens of crew members descending into the dining room at once to deliver plates there was a dish of cheeses and bread inspired by the molten planet mustafar blue shrimp from the jungles of felucia that arrives billowing in cool smoke and a beef and seafood plate drawn from the wookie home world of kashyyyk the galactic starcruiser does have other options on its menu for those with less adventurous palates or dietary restrictions alcoholic beverages can be purchased in the crown of corellia dining room as well as at the sublight lounge guests will recognize many of the signature cocktails as they are based on traditional drinks but they have been elevated the hoth icebreaker for example is reminiscent of a lemon drop martini but is served in a unique glass colored blue and features a vanilla and lemon foam as well as an isomalt sugar garnish what disney has done with the starcruiser and that menu and what they are putting out i think that will trickle down in many many different ways throughout the whole industry speigel said

in a first pass at gauging the economic impact from the ukraine invasion forecasters say the u s will grow more slowly with higher inflation europe s economy will flirt near recession and russia will plunge into a deep double digit decline the cnbc rapid update the average of 14 forecasts for the u s economy sees gdp rising by 3 2 this year a modest 0 3 markdown from the february forecast but still above trend growth as the us continues to bounce back from the omicron slowdown inflation for personal consumption expenditures the fed s preferred indicator is seen rising by 4 3 this year 0 7 percentage points higher than the prior survey in february cnbc rapid update get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters forecasters cautioned however that much remains unknown about how the u s economy will respond to an oil shock that has seen crude prices surge quickly above 126 a barrel and the national average gasoline price over 4 per gallon most see risks to their forecasts skewed toward higher inflation and lower growth a complete removal of russian oil from global supply could mean a far more grim outcome economists said the consequences of a complete shut off of russia s 4 3 million barrels per day of oil exports to the us and europe would be dramatic jpmorgan wrote over the weekend to the extent that this disengagement gathers steam the size and length of the disruption and thus the shock to global growth will build the cnbc rapid update shows u s growth accelerating to 3 5 in the second quarter from 1 9 in the first but that second quarter estimate is down 0 8 percentage points from the prior survey so the economy is still seen bouncing back from the omicron wave but not as strongly as inflation takes a bigger bite inflation estimates are 1 7 percentage points higher for this quarter and 1 6 percentage points for next inflation is expected to decline from 4 3 this year to 2 4 by year end cnbc rapid update overall u s economic growth is seen enduring energy prices are spiking and they may remain higher persistently but i expect much of the run up seen in recent days to recede within a few months which means mainly a short term impact on growth and inflation said economist stephen stanley with amherst pierpont consumers have massive liquidity income growth and wealth to draw on one factor that makes this price shock different from others is how much oil the u s produces with u s production and demand in rough balance money is transferred from consumers to producers inside the economy rather than from the u s to foreigners that will hit individual american families and certain regions of the country harder but boost the profits of u s energy companies oil companies in turn will likely boost growth by using profits to increase drilling still some are pessimistic that the drag from higher prices will lead to a bigger drag on u s growth the us is on the cusp of a recessionary inflation with energy and now food prices potentially soaring significantly further said joseph lavorgna of natixis europe to be hit harder most agree that effect will be worse in europe barclays marked down its growth forecast for europe this year to 3 5 from 4 1 last month soaring commodity prices and risk aversion in financial markets are the main contagion channels implying a global stagflationary shock with europe being the most exposed region the investment bank said jpmorgan took off nearly a full percentage from european growth this year and now forecasts gdp will increase by 3 2 but the second quarter has been filled in at zero russia is forecast to get hit hardest of all jpmorgan forecasts a 12 5 decline in gdp as the country s economy buckles under the weight of unprecedented sanctions that have frozen its 630 billion in foreign exchange reserves and cut its economy off from the rest of the world the institute for international finance sees a 15 contraction double the decline from global financial crisis we see risks as tilted to the downside russia will never be the same again wrote iif s chief economist robin brooks

a large scale recall of possibly contaminated infant formula highlights food companies common practice of giving out free samples of infant formula through the mail through hospitals and in other settings these and other marketing practices have caused controversy for decades critics argue the free samples and other tactics push women away from breastfeeding which is generally considered healthier many countries around the world restrict the marketing of infant formula the boxes of infant formula arrived at our home before the baby did two different companies learned that my wife and i were expecting a child it may have happened when my wife created an online baby gift registry we didn t ask for formula but late last year the companies sent colorful boxes of coupons and milk powder to us in memphis one box held envelopes of the brand enfamil the other box contained three big cans of similac formula i put the free formula samples in a kitchen cabinet figuring we might use them later weeks passed and the baby was born then news broke on feb 17 of babies sick from bacterial infection after drinking similac and related brands one of the babies had died i opened the cabinet and checked the serial numbers on the three similac cans against a recall website baby formula recall 2022 fda warns consumers not to use select similac alimentum and elecare every one of the cans in the colorful free sample box was part of the recall fortunately we hadn t tried to give this formula to our newborn on tuesday 12 days after the recall was announced we received a letter from the company alerting us to the possibility of contamination the situation highlights food companies common practice of giving out free samples of infant formula through the mail through hospitals and in other settings these and other marketing practices have caused controversy for decades critics have argued that the marketing of infant formula around the world pushes mothers away from breastfeeding which is generally considered the healthiest option for children the world health organization adopted guidelines in 1981 that restrict the advertising of infant formula and bar tactics such as giving free samples to mothers and promoting formula in health care settings many countries have put all or part of the guidelines into law but the u s does not regulate the marketing of infant formula researchers with the university of connecticut and new york university wrote in a 2020 article that leads to promotions like the boxes sent to our home and to other tactics such as the free samples routinely made available at hospitals in cities like memphis when the recall hit some memphis hospitals had to throw out their stock of the formula some hospital representatives said the fda has not confirmed any cases of illnesses related to the formula in tennessee similac is a product of healthcare company abbott we value the trust parents place in us for high quality and safe nutrition and we ll do whatever it takes to keep that trust and resolve this situation abbott spokesman jonathon hamilton wrote in an email if product is affected by the recall do not use it and go to similacrecall com or call 1 800 986 8540 to obtain a refund or replacement abbott has sent written and email correspondence to those who received samples from the company with instructions on how to return the samples our field employees are also visiting hospitals and doctors offices to recover the product in response to questions about marketing practices the abbott spokesman sent a further statement we support parents in their feeding choices whether they choose to breastfeed use formula or use a combination of both we believe that parents need science based factual information if they are interested in formula to have more informed conversations with healthcare providers the communications we deliver about our products follow all local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate enfamil manufacturer mead johnson company didn t respond to requests for comment on their free sample practices memphis area hospitals identify recalled formula discard it the recall of the

voluntary le bonheur children s hospital doesn t have a maternity unit but sometimes admits young babies as patients and the hospital sometimes provides formula le bonheur stopped passing out the formula the day the recall hit and subsequently got rid of all the formula spokesman david henson said we reached out to all our community partners and pediatrician offices and anyone that might have

multiple patients as well as other one off scenes all in the downtown area more expected from officials later bryce newberry bryce_newberry march 4 2022 in an update on saturday morning the travis county office of the chief medical officer said hospital partners had identified the agent as xylazine an analog of clonidine an opiate analog the medical officer said xylazine is used in veterinary medicine as a sedative and analgesic with muscle relaxant properties it is also used to cause vomiting human studies on the drug were halted because of serious side effects naloxone can be used as an antidote for the drug the medical officer has advised ems medics and providers to have adequate stocks of naloxone airway management and suctioning equipment to help contain the outbreak and prevent further harm to the community in a march 8 press conference atcems cpt darren noak said first responders are finding they need to use a higher dosage of naloxone to bring those on xylazine back to a state where they re breathing on their own and their respiratory rate is back to normal an increase in opiate overdose incidents and naloxone use has been noted in the system over the last few days hospital posted by office of the chief medical officer city of austin travis county on saturday march 5 2022 police initially believed fentanyl a synthetic opiate similar to heroin was involved in a few of the incidents fentanyl can be in a pill powder patch solid or liquid form it can also be lethal in small amounts investigators are currently working to confirm the drugs involved the source of those drugs and any connections between the victims the apd said the community needs to be aware of this public health risk and the dangers associated with the drug fentanyl officials said the patients were all over the age of 18 sgt tracy gerrish with the apd homicide unit said in a friday afternoon press conference that she believes the two people that died were people experiencing homelessness going back and looking at stats it looks like about 20 to 25 of our overdoses are in the people experiencing homelessness community so this fentanyl reaches all aspects of life and all

overdose related articles us drug overdose deaths hit never before seen level we re definitely seeing a lot more overdoses and it is a fentanyl crisis right now gerrish said gerrish also said it is possible that the overnight incidents could be attributed to a particular batch of the drug being distributed daniel comeaux with the drug enforcement agency dea houston division said these drugs are not bought at the store or prescribed but made illegally and can be sold as counterfeit pills that drug users believe is a pill like ritalin xanax or something else they will make any counterfeit pill

the us and european nations have imposed tough sanctions on the russian economy in response to its invasion of ukraine they started by freezing 630 billion of russia s foreign currency reserves some capital controls were imposed blocking russians from depositing money in foreign accounts and restricting planned investments in russia and by it russia has also been shut out of the swift payment system which makes its isolation from the global financial system more severe the effect of these sanctions can be seen already the ruble fell over 30 russia s stock market has crashed and its rate of inflation is rising in addition its government external debt to gdp ratio has risen its central bank has increased interest rates from 9 5 to 20 in an attempt to tame inflation but that increased the cost of borrowing in the weeks and months ahead the impact of increased sanctions on the russian economy will alienate its financial system from the global monetary system even further to get a sense of this here are some numbers the crashing ruble is creating panic amongst russian citizens who have to stand in long atm queues if depositors start pulling all their money out this could cause a run on some of the country s banks and wreck its banking system inflation is already rising which will cause the purchasing power of the ruble to decrease every day making the cost of essentials soar a high inflation rate often creates distrust in the government and could change public opinion about russian president vladimir putin driving protests on the streets against the ruling autocrat russia s rate of inflation has already touched around 9 very quickly its central bank responded by increasing interest rates which increases the cost of borrowing from banks this makes it even more difficult for households and firms to obtain credit the freezing of credit and the higher cost of accessing money will make business in and with russia even more difficult the effects of these trends are evident in the consumer and business confidence which is precariously low it signals that even for a military superpower like russia most of its people and businesses were not prepared to understand or factor in the potential consequences of war at this time it is worth recalling that economies around the world are still recovering from the covid 19 lockdowns this hurt businesses firms households and governments due to high fiscal expenditures as a result russia s medium to long term scenario could include persistently high inflation a poorly valued currency triggering low trust in its banks further driving high costs of borrowing this could dry up private investment which according to bloomberg estimates could affect more than 1 5 of the gdp causing a deep long recession which seems inevitable despite the volatility seen in global stock market trends and in terms of oil prices given that russia is a significant crude producer the global impact of the crippling russian and ukraine economy from a war is still likely to be limited russia s current account to gdp ratio is also very low as evident from the figure below it accounts for less than 2 of world exports and has a gdp of less than 1 of world stock market capitalisation ukraine s share in these aggregates is even lower at 0 01 0 3 respectively financing a war no matter how strong a nation is militarily stretches the fiscal limits of any nation it also balloons a government s debt obligations to the rest of the world from loans to government bought debt in the form of bonds as the value of the ruble falls the external value of all debt will rise and so will the value of all interest payments in a post covid scenario when the capacities of states to spend more have been precariously weak russian capabilities will be tested too the spike seen in fiscal expenditure over the last few months paints a grim future with a collapsing ruble the real cost of financing increased military operations could take its toll on russian coffers impact on india russia economic relations as per indian figures bilateral trade during april 2020 march 2021 amounted 8 1 billion see figure below indian exports amounted 2 6 billion while imports from russia amounted 5 48 billion for the same period as per russian figures bilateral trade amounted to 9 31 billion with indian exports amounting to 3 48 billion and imports amounting to 5 83 billion russia is one of india s largest arms suppliers and a key strategic ally indian prime minister narendra modi recently invited putin to india which was seen as a way of maintaining russia s close strategic alliance with india despite new delhi s increasing warmth towards washington one reason for doing so could be to also avoid a closer russia china relationship which now under the financial pressure of sanctions may become more closely knit on defining the nature of russia india military relationship as sameer lalwani et al recently argued the breadth of russian origin platforms in the indian military which our analysis suggests composes 85 percent of major indian weapons systems rather than the 60 percent figure often cited have created a lock in effect while the depth of relative support to india s technology base and strategic systems have engendered a relatively high degree of indebtedness and trust in key strategic circles yet the quantity and sensitivity of russian contributions to the indian arsenal features that could reinforce and sustain the relationship much to the chagrin of us policy makers have largely been underappreciated in other words both india and russia share a path dependent relationship that continues from their historic cold war ties in the near future however it will not be easy for india to continue doing its business with an economically damaged and sanction hit russian economy but finding trade substitutes for relatively inelastic or essential russian imports in areas of defence procurement and arms supplies would be extremely difficult putin s predicament some wonder why putin failed to see all this coming given what he was planning to do he should have known about what sanctions could do to the russian economy or did he miscalculate by assuming the global response to his aggression in ukraine to be like the response after russia s annexation of crimea in 2014 which was far weaker and less well coordinated it s difficult to say but this time seems different the global financial and monetary system too is quite different yes the dollar is still the dominant foreign reserve currency but it doesn t have the same hegemonic role as it did a decade ago or more the chinese government and chinese money will surely play a more critical role in assisting russia in its financial obligations but we do not know to what extent the political economy implications of sanctions on russia could be more catastrophic if there is a will in us and european allies to make russia suffer over the medium to long term there might not be any pipeline deals for instance the nord stream pipeline plan is already in jeopardy there will not be much foreign direct investment in or out of russia after all who would want to invest a long term financial commitment in a country whose leadership is autocratic and has shown a reckless contempt for its own rule of law more importantly though if america and its allies have the persistent will to go directly after the vast overseas wealth of russian oligarchs who have surrounded putin and helped him stay in power the subsequent suffering unleashed on russia could be far worse and put him under pressure as economists filip novokmet thomas piketty and gabriel zucman have pointed out russia has run huge trade surpluses every year since the early 1990s which should have led to a large accumulation of overseas assets yet official statistics show russia with only moderately more assets than liabilities abroad economist paul krugman looking at this has asked the question how is this possible he writes the obvious explanation is that wealthy russians have been skimming off large sums and parking them abroad the sums involved are mind boggling novokmet et al estimate that in 2015 the hidden foreign wealth of rich russians amounted to around 85 percent of russia s g d p to give you some perspective this is as if a u s president s cronies had managed to hide 20 trillion in overseas accounts another paper co written by zucman found that in russia the vast majority of wealth at the top is held offshore as far as one can tell the overseas exposure of russia s elite has no precedent in history and it creates a huge vulnerability that the west can exploit the question is whether democratic governments across the world in a deeply unequal wealth landscape can collectively align against russia to do this many of their own influential business persons have their business and politics deeply entwined with russian kleptocrats this is true not only in the us but also in britain and much of europe if western powers go after some russian oligarchs and their wealth in offshore accounts it is likely to yield adverse consequences for their own oligarchs who have their wealth in these accounts as well and their operations connected with russians deepanshu mohan is an associate professor of economics

in a first pass at gauging the economic impact from the ukraine invasion forecasters say the u s will grow more slowly with higher inflation europe s economy will flirt near recession and russia will plunge into a deep double digit decline the cnbc rapid update the average of 14 forecasts for the u s economy sees gdp rising by 3 2 this year a modest 0 3 markdown from the february forecast but still above trend growth as the us continues to bounce back from the omicron slowdown inflation for personal consumption expenditures the fed s preferred indicator is seen rising by 4 3 this year 0 7 percentage points higher than the prior survey in february cnbc rapid update get south florida local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc south florida newsletters forecasters cautioned however that much remains unknown about how the u s economy will respond to an oil shock that has seen crude prices surge quickly above 126 a barrel and the national average gasoline price over 4 per gallon most see risks to their forecasts skewed toward higher inflation and lower growth a complete removal of russian oil from global supply could mean a far more grim outcome economists said the consequences of a complete shut off of russia s 4 3 million barrels per day of oil exports to the us and europe would be dramatic jpmorgan wrote over the weekend to the extent that this disengagement gathers steam the size and length of the disruption and thus the shock to global growth will build the cnbc rapid update shows u s growth accelerating to 3 5 in the second quarter from 1 9 in the first but that second quarter estimate is down 0 8 percentage points from the prior survey so the economy is still seen bouncing back from the omicron wave but not as strongly as inflation takes a bigger bite inflation estimates are 1 7 percentage points higher for this quarter and 1 6 percentage points for next inflation is expected to decline from 4 3 this year to 2 4 by year end cnbc rapid update overall u s economic growth is seen enduring energy prices are spiking and they may remain higher persistently but i expect much of the run up seen in recent days to recede within a few months which means mainly a short term impact on growth and inflation said economist stephen stanley with amherst pierpont consumers have massive liquidity income growth and wealth to draw on one factor that makes this price shock different from others is how much oil the u s produces with u s production and demand in rough balance money is transferred from consumers to producers inside the economy rather than from the u s to foreigners that will hit individual american families and certain regions of the country harder but boost the profits of u s energy companies oil companies in turn will likely boost growth by using profits to increase drilling still some are pessimistic that the drag from higher prices will lead to a bigger drag on u s growth the us is on the cusp of a recessionary inflation with energy and now food prices potentially soaring significantly further said joseph lavorgna of natixis europe to be hit harder most agree that effect will be worse in europe barclays marked down its growth forecast for europe this year to 3 5 from 4 1 last month soaring commodity prices and risk aversion in financial markets are the main contagion channels implying a global stagflationary shock with europe being the most exposed region the investment bank said jpmorgan took off nearly a full percentage from european growth this year and now forecasts gdp will increase by 3 2 but the second quarter has been filled in at zero russia is forecast to get hit hardest of all jpmorgan forecasts a 12 5 decline in gdp as the country s economy buckles under the weight of unprecedented sanctions that have frozen its 630 billion in foreign exchange reserves and cut its economy off from the rest of the world the institute for international finance sees a 15 contraction double the decline from global financial crisis we see risks as tilted to the downside russia will never be the same again wrote iif s chief economist robin brooks
