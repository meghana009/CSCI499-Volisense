active vs passive which way should you go with your funds mr money maker s guide to etf trackers a history back in 1995 barclays bought a loss making fund management firm called wells fargo nikko it was based in california and had developed a simple investment idea which was eventually going to dominate the investment management world it had merely worked out that by just buying and holding the same companies in the same proportion as the s p500 index the leading us stock index of 500 companies it would probably beat most of the much more expensive fund managers on wall street there have always been tracker funds which as the name implies track a particular index but these were different they were called exchange traded funds etfs which in effect traded as an ordinary stock rather than a fund this meant that they were easy quick and cheap to trade instead of the rather laborious process involving old funds and unit trusts barclays paid over 440m for this company which was seen as huge in those days for an unproven unprofitable investment company this provided barclays with around 200billion of new assets the last figure i saw last year showed that there were now around 7 7 trillion in etfs what can i learn from this etfs have now proliferated around the globe and cover many asset classes and have many variations but at their core is a very cheap way of investing very broadly across the globe and across those asset classes so from main markets to emerging markets access is easy the competition has been fierce and so the competitive charges have come down and made them extremely cost effective there was even one etf that paid investors to own it for a while and a warning be wary though as an etf simply reflects the index it is following and that index can often be skewed by a particular sector such as technology in the nasdaq or miners and oil companies in the ftse 100 also while some etfs directly hold the shares of that index others will merely reflect them and are thus not direct owners they are referred to as synthetic etfs and are not as transparent as the direct ones what can i do warren buffett the highly successful us investor has previously recommended that for most private investors just buying etfs is a very efficient way to develop their investments and i would certainly agree over the past few years an etf in the main us indices would have done extremely well and better than most professional investors and at a lower cost they are not the solution to all our issues for our portfolio but they will provide a very valuable flexible and low cost tool for us all to use

above jessica chastain in the eyes of tammy faye photo via the film s facebook page new york ap in the nearly 10 years it took for jessica chastain to get made a film about the christian televangelist tammy faye messner she studied many of the kinds of things you d expect the hours of television footage fenton bailey and randy barbato s 2000 documentary but one of the most revelatory sources was a largely forgotten wb reality show from 2002 by then messner had fallen from the heights of her televangelist fame after scandals brought down the multimillion dollar ministry she and her longtime husband jim bakker built with the ptl praise the lord network so there she was on the surreal life alongside d list celebrities like vanilla ice and adult film star ron jeremy living in a hollywood hills mansion for two weeks you re thinking what is this i know they put her in there because they thought it would create a lot of drama but it was a beautiful thing to watch says chastain you saw her consistently being who she was not judging anyone but ministering to them to chastain what stood out was messner s steadiness of faith as much as the highly coiffed heavily made up televangelist s appearance fluctuated over the years messner whose finest moment may have been a 1985 show talking to gay minister and aids activist steve pieters about hiv preached god s love to everyone even vanilla ice he later wrote a song about her she just loved everyone and she loved without judgment and she believed everyone was deserving of god s grace chastain said in a recent interview now i wasn t baptized but i think that s supposed to be what christianity is about in the eyes of tammy faye directed by michael showalter which searchlight pictures releases in theaters sept 17 chastain gives perhaps the most ambitious performance of her career so far for the widely admired actor of the tree of life zero dark thirty and the help it s the first time she s tackled a decades spanning biopic with all the transformational trappings the make up the prosthetics the accent it s a big swing one chastain was hungry for there were a number of reasons i wanted to do it says chastain who acquired the rights to adapt the documentary in 2012 but number one was it was the scariest because it s the most far reaching it was during the press tour for 2012 s zero dark thirty that chastain first caught the rupaul narrated doc on tv at the time it seemed like the furthest thing from her cia operative in kathryn bigelow s film the documentary while reveling in the kitsch of the bakkers sought to celebrate the much parodied messner who died in 2007 at the age of 65 at its most popular the ptl club their flagship program reached as many as 13 million households constant appeals for donations from viewers helped swell their ministry including heritage usa a disney style theme park and resort in south carolina but sex and financial scandal toppled their empire bakker played by andrew garfield in the film used ministry funds to pay a woman who said bakker sexually assaulted her bakker denied it he was convicted in 1989 of raising pledges with false promises while also steering millions to pay for the couple s lavish lifestyle messner who filed for divorce while bakker was imprisoned was never indicted but she took more lumps in public opinion she was mocked on saturday night live chastain recognized a complicated woman who was treated unfairly i knew it was important for me in terms of gender in terms of righting a wrong that i felt the media had done to her chastain says we all had a collective memory that wasn t accurate including myself the eyes of tammy faye is the most dramatic film yet for showalter the comedian of the state who has developed a second career as a filmmaker but his movies wet hot american summer my name is doris the big sick have also often blended surreal with painfully real i really like characters that are out of step with the world says showalter i think tammy faye is really compelling in that way she was this sort of laughing stock but time has been really generous toward her we ve been able to look back and realize there was a much more authentic person there than we gave her credit for the film spans three decades and some very drastic fluctuations in period style that made it a particular challenge to make up department head linda dowds not just in charting messner s physical evolution but keeping the extravagant looks from being too over the top we were looking for the subtleties and looking for the less is more even though there s a lot of more says dowds there are some characters that use make up as a mask dowds adds for tammy she said you don t have to be dowdy to be a christian she never quite understood why people made fun of her look she said this is me this is what makes me happy whenever i feel a bit down i just put more on the performance flamboyant and empathetic has immediately put chastain into the academy awards conversation she has twice before been nominated but never won but it s also extended a spiritual journey for chastain one that included terence malick s cosmic existential wonder the tree of life the religious passages madonna paintings and bach that malick fed her she considers a spiritual and faith based course on love that i really had never had in my life and it s clear that chastain feels a particular protective bond with messner a relentlessly upbeat ultimately good hearted woman who made her way in an overwhelmingly male controlled crassly commercial media world part naive dupe part undeserving victim part guilty collaborator in her downfall what chastain perhaps most admires and connects with in messner is her earnestness she is who she is that attitude is similar to how chastain who grew up humbly in sacramento california has tried to navigate the movie industry she s been a vocal advocate for women including in making the upcoming the 355 a female led ensemble spy thriller chastain helped get it made when she noticed the lack of any action film like it as with tammy faye she s a producer on it tammy faye kind of approached everything with let s have a good time i think perhaps that s how i try to approach things too i mean listen i m always up for a fight chastain says laughing i just know everything is possible maybe we re looking at it from a wrong angle it may not be possible with an old formula or an old set of rules so let s do something else and make it possible i never see a wall or a door

a gripping new documentary miniseries is bringing attention to multilevel marketing platforms lularich available on amazon prime chronicles the story of lularoe a clothing empire famous for its buttery soft leggings but accused of being a pyramid scheme and using predatory practices to make money the company has been the subject of multiple lawsuits including a suit in washington state that was settled for 4 75 million in february the four episode series which debuted in early september highlighted the predatory practices of multilevel marketing schemes also known as mlms while mlms are legal in the united states and recognizable companies like herbalife and young living use the business structure experts say they often closely resemble pyramid schemes and victimize sellers what is a multilevel marketing scheme the federal trade commission defines mlms as businesses that involve selling products to family and friends and recruiting other people to do the same mlms are also known as direct marketing or network marketing businesses the ftc also notes that some mlms are illegal pyramid schemes the experts we spoke with were harsher on the business model if you re in an mlm it s a scam said robert fitzpatrick an author of several books about multilevel marketing and president of pyramid scheme alert the first international association aimed at preventing pyramid scheme related fraud almost everybody is going to lose but the people who are at the top of the platform will make a lot of money fitzpatrick said that there are four hallmarks to a multilevel marketing scheme it s an endless chain fitzpatrick said that the most obvious sign of an mlm is that sellers are pressured to recruit other sellers from whom they will then make money this is typically described as a downline the recruiter will get a portion of the sale that the person they recruited sells and the chain continues just pay fitzpatrick said that another hallmark of a multilevel marketing scheme is having to buy merchandise upfront or pay a large fee to join the company this fee is typically described as a starter fee or starter pack of merchandise since sellers have to purchase the clothing before they can sell it it can be financially risky mlms also emphasize meeting a certain sales goal each month and will often recommend sellers buy enough to reach that minimum if they don t have enough sales the third warning sign is a recruiting mandate which ties closely to the endless chain concern fitzpatrick said that multilevel marketing schemes will focus on constantly recruiting more people which makes it difficult to have a sustainable business the fourth hallmark fitzpatrick said is how and what a person gets paid the vast majority of people lose money only about one quarter of people involved in mlms make any money and that money can be quickly eaten up by the need to purchase more merchandise dr william keep a professor at the college of new jersey who is regarded as an expert on multilevel marketing said that another struggle is the mlm industry s unwillingness to be transparent he said that lularich offered an unusual glimpse into the inner workings of such a company and said that the opaqueness of the industry makes it difficult to know how many multilevel marketing platforms are operating like pyramid schemes we know for sure that using that model it s very easy to operate an illegal pyramid scheme the key warning sign is that in order to succeed you are asked to recruit others who will then be asked to recruit others keep said keep added that that emphasis on recruitment which fitzpatrick listed as one of the hallmarks of a multilevel marketing platform is against all competitive models typically found in business since recruited customers will no longer purchase product from a seller he also addressed the financial aspect of multilevel marketing platforms referencing lularoe in particular as part of their settlement with washington state the company revealed its median earnings for sellers typically mlms release the mean or average earnings which can be skewed by high earners with large downlines the median earnings were zero keep said we re talking about people being financially negative after expenses myths about mlms debunked if they were illegal the government would shut them down keep said that many people defending mlms from accusations of being pyramid schemes will turn to this phrase but it s not true referencing the company advocare an mlm that operated for decades and had national spokespeople like drew brees in 2018 after more than 26 years in operation the group was finally prosecuted by the ftc but keep said it took a long time to get there advocare still exists but operates with a different structure now if they have a product they can t be a pyramid scheme keep pointed out that for many organizations the products sold like lularoe s buttery soft leggings are just vehicles to move money naturally you want a product to be viable because it seems more suspicious if not keep said but said that for many companies the product is secondary to the model of recruitment and developing downlines fitzpatrick said that other things like being traded on stock exchanges can also give mlms a sheen of legitimacy people say surely that can t be a pyramid scheme celebrating in plain sight fitzpatrick said but being traded on the stock exchange doesn t mean it s a fair business all businesses have start up costs one of the hallmarks of mlms as explained by fitzpatrick is constantly buying product and that typically starts with a starter fee or by buying a starter pack of merchandise from the company many mlms compare these fees to the costs associated with building an independent business but they re extremely different especially since mlm products are not unique and are sold by other sellers on the platform keep said there s a thing that the industry is really good at doing and that s taking statements and presenting them as if they re individual things to stand on their own keep said many businesses do not make money right away that s true many businesses fail that s true but here the business model if you want to call it a model is that the vast majority of people fail and their failure generates profits for those above them in the upline related
municipals were a touch softer friday as u s treasuries rose and equities sold off as global concerns over china and covid were heightened and participants prepared for the fomc meeting and potential for tapering next week triple a benchmark yields rose a basis point beginning in 2028 while ust were off another three to four on the 10 and 30 year the 10 year ust has risen 9 basis points since tuesday while the 30 year climbed five since its low on tuesday ratios fell on friday as municipals continued to outperform taxables with the 10 year municipal to ust ratio at 68 and the 30 year at 80 according to refinitiv mmd the 10 year ratio was at 71 while the 30 year was at 81 according to ice data services municipals have been distracted by the robust primary market and that trend will

thruway authority in the competitive space rates remain historically favorable from the issuer side noted kim olsan senior vice president at fhn financial she said the low rates set up another 100 billion of new issues between now and the end of the year since 2016 the low end of q4 volume has been 83 billion and as high as 155 billion 2017 and preceding tax changes in 2018 she noted consistent fund flows this year have created a cycle of demand that won t fade but merely adjust to changing rate scenarios she said it would likely take a heavy period of supply to force rates over their 2021 highs which are about 20 basis points away from current levels despite single and low double digit yields the fomc tax financing package storyline will hold reluctant interest in short munis meaning the push for any concession leading to a strong credit spread collapse and demand for short calls will remain in play she added if issuers do pull back on issuance as a result of waiting on the potential for a massive new influx of tools from the 3 5 trillion package being debated in washington participants still see an active investor base we expect the next several weeks to be relatively active in the muni space but in our view the asset class is well positioned especially if supply turns out to be lighter than expected barclays said in a weekly report there is a lot of cash on the sidelines with investors looking to buy the dip consequently even if there is some market volatility we would view this less as a concern and more as a possible buying opportunity secondary trading

near the close economic indicators the university of michigan s consumer sentiment index rose 1 to 71 0 in september from 70 3 in august according to its survey of consumers economists surveyed by ifr markets had expected the index to increase to 72 0 for the month the index which stood at 80 4 in september of 2020 is down 11 7 on the year the steep august falloff in consumer sentiment ended in early september but the small gain still meant that consumers expected the least favorable economic prospects in more than a decade according to richard curtin the survey of consumers chief economist

1 to 67 1 in september from 65 1 in august on the year the index is down 11 2 from september 2020 s level of 75 6 looking ahead consumers could have several potential reactions to inflation curtin wrote in a commentary on the report consumers have initially reacted by viewing the rise in inflation as transitory believing that prices will stabilize or could even fall in the future as a result postponing purchases is seen as a viable strategy this implies a slowdown of spending in the months ahead and a more robust rebound later in 2022 he said the main alternative is that inflation will not be transient but will rise further due to an unprecedented expansion in fiscal and monetary policies curtin said the resulting rise in inflationary psychology will lessen resistance to rising prices and stiffen demands for increased wage gains this reaction takes a long time to fully develop and is contingent on significant increases in long term inflation expectations which have yet to be

committee reviewed clinical data showing a booster dose of comirnaty elicits high neutralization titers against sars cov 2 and all currently tested variants reactogenicity profile within seven days of the booster dose was typically mild to moderate with frequency of reactions similar to or lower than after the primary vaccination series real world data presented by israel ministry of health show additional protection after receiving a booster translated to vaccine effectiveness comparable to levels seen early in the country s vaccine rollout fda expected to make its decision in the coming days pfizer inc nyse pfe and biontech se nasdaq bntx announced today that the u s food and drug administration s fda vaccines and related biological products advisory committee vrbpac voted unanimously to recommend the fda grant emergency use authorization eua for a booster dose of comirnaty covid 19 vaccine mrna in individuals 65 years of age and older and individuals at high risk of severe covid 19 the committee recommended that the additional dose be administered at least six months after the two dose series the panel also agreed that healthcare workers and others at high risk for occupational exposure should be included in this eua this press release features multimedia view the full release here vrbpac is made up of independent experts who advise the fda on scientific and regulatory matters including the evaluation of vaccine safety and efficacy at this time vrbpac did not vote in favor of approval of a booster dose for the full population for which pfizer and biontech submitted their supplemental biologics license application which was individuals 16 and older the same data have recently been submitted to the european medicines agency ema and will be filed with other regulatory authorities in the coming weeks the companies remain vigilant and continue to generate relevant comirnaty booster dose data for evaluation for future licensure in further groups as well as to address emerging variants of concern the fda is expected to make its decision in the coming days this decision could allow comirnaty to be the first covid 19 vaccine with a booster authorized in the u s today the vrbpac reviewed data from our clinical program showing a favorable safety profile and strong immune responses against sars cov 2 after a booster dose of our vaccine these data and the larger body of scientific evidence presented at the meeting underscore our belief that boosters can be a critical tool in the ongoing effort to control the spread of this virus said kathrin u jansen ph d senior vice president and head of vaccine research development pfizer we thank the committee for their thoughtful review of the data and will work with the fda following today s meeting to address the committee s questions as we continue to believe in the benefits of a booster dose for a broader population we are committed to support the ongoing efforts to reduce infections and covid 19 cases the data we submitted to the fda ema and other regulatory authorities underline that a booster induces a strong immune response against all tested variants of concern and may contribute to address a public health need said özlem türeci m d co founder and chief medical officer of biontech vrbpac based its recommendation on the totality of scientific evidence shared by the companies including data from their clinical program evaluating the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of a booster dose of comirnaty a booster dose of the vaccine elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the initial sars cov 2 virus wild type as well as the beta and delta variants when compared with the levels observed after the two dose primary series the reactogenicity profile within seven days after the booster dose was typically mild to moderate and the frequency of reactions was similar to or lower than after dose two the adverse event profile was generally consistent with other clinical safety data for comirnaty real world surveillance data also were presented to the vrbpac by the israel ministry of health providing further support for the public health impact of boosters the data presented from israel included an analysis published this week in the new england journal of medicine the analysis comprised approximately 1 1 million individuals ages 60 years and older who were eligible for a booster dose of the vaccine between july 30 through august 31 2021 no new safety signals were observed and reported adverse events were lower than those observed after dose two the analysis showed that a booster dose restored very high levels of protection against covid 19 infections and severe disease in this period when delta was the dominant strain individuals who received the booster dose were less likely by a factor of 11 3 95 ci 10 4 12 3 to develop a confirmed infection and less likely by a factor of 19 5 95 ci 12 9 29 5 to develop severe illness compared to those who were previously fully vaccinated but did not receive a booster dose the additional protection after receiving a booster translated to vaccine effectiveness comparable to levels seen early in the country s vaccine rollout an estimated 95 when the alpha variant was predominant under the eua of the pfizer biontech vaccine in the u s a third dose was previously authorized for individuals at least 12 years of age who have undergone solid organ transplant or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise this authorization of a third dose for immunocompromised individuals is separate and distinct from the booster dose reviewed by vrbpac today the third dose for immunocompromised individuals is meant to address the fact that these individuals sometimes do not build enough protection after two doses of the vaccine in contrast the booster dose recommended today by vrbpac for eua refers to an additional dose of the vaccine that is given to those who have built enough protection after the primary two dose vaccination series but may have decreased protection over time due to waning of immunity comirnaty which is based on biontech s proprietary mrna technology was developed by both biontech and pfizer biontech is the marketing authorization holder in the united states the european union the united kingdom canada and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the united states jointly with pfizer and other countries submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned u s indication authorized use comirnaty covid 19 vaccine mrna is an fda approved covid 19 vaccine made by pfizer for biontech it is approved as a 2 dose series for prevention of covid 19 in individuals 16 years of age and older it is also authorized under emergency use authorization eua to be administered for emergency use to prevent covid 19 in individuals 12 through 15 years and provide a third dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine has received eua from fda to prevent covid 19 in individuals 12 years of age and older and provide a third dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise the fda approved comirnaty covid 19 vaccine mrna and the eua authorized pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine have the same formulation and can be used interchangeably to provide the covid 19 vaccination series an individual may be offered either comirnaty covid 19 vaccine mrna or the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 caused by sars cov 2 eua statement this emergency use of the product has not been approved or licensed by fda but has been authorized by fda under an emergency use authorization eua to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 for use in individuals 12 years of age and older and the emergency use of this product is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product under section 564 b 1 of the fd c act unless the declaration is terminated or

anticipated timing of regulatory submissions regulatory approvals or authorizations and anticipated manufacturing distribution and supply involving substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements risks and uncertainties include among other things the uncertainties inherent in research and development including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints commencement and or completion dates for clinical trials regulatory submission dates regulatory approval dates and or launch dates as well as risks associated with preclinical and clinical data including the phase 3 data including the possibility of unfavorable new preclinical clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing preclinical clinical or safety data whether and when our phase 3 clinical trial will demonstrate protection from infection or disease following a booster third dose which is the subject of ongoing study the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results including the rate of vaccine effectiveness and safety and tolerability profile observed to date in additional analyses of the phase 3 trial and additional studies or in larger more diverse populations following commercialization the ability of bnt162b2 to prevent covid 19 caused by emerging virus variants the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine will lead to new information about efficacy safety or other developments including the risk of additional adverse reactions some of which may be serious the risk that preclinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments including during the peer review publication process in the scientific community generally and by regulatory authorities whether and when additional data from the bnt162 mrna vaccine program will be published in scientific journal publications and if so when and with what modifications and interpretations whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future preclinical and clinical studies whether and when applications for a potential booster third dose will be filed in any other jurisdictions and whether and when other biologics license and or emergency use authorization applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for bnt162b2 or any other potential vaccines that may arise from the bnt162 program and if obtained whether or when such emergency use authorization or licenses will expire or terminate whether and when any applications that may be pending or filed for bnt162b2 including the sbla for a potential booster third dose in the u s applications that may be pending or filed for a potential booster third dose in other jurisdictions or any requested amendments to the emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations or other vaccines that may result from the

on march 14 2021 marvin scott iii was arrested at a texas mall for possessing less than two ounces of marijuana and taken into custody just a few hours later marvin was dead leaving his family and community reeling scott suffered from schizophrenia and used marijuana to supplement his medication and decrease its side effects over the years he d had multiple interactions with the police in moments of mental distress each time scott was taken to a mental health center given his medication and released instead of bringing him to the mental health center this time police transferred marvin to the collin county jail according to the family while in booking a group of officers violently restrained him he suffered for hours experiencing a whole day of torture they sprayed him with pepper spray forced him into a spit hood and tied him to a restraint bed scott became unresponsive and was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead scott was a kind and loving person who his sister lachay batts described as a gentle giant who would do anything for anybody he had no criminal record his only crime was carrying the marijuana that he used to manage schizophrenia seven officers in texas were fired and one resigned in connection with the in custody death of marvin scott iii who was arrested for possession less than two ounces of marijuana credit wfaa scott s death is heart wrenching one in a seemingly unending stream of stories where marijuana consumption is used as a justification for police violence as a community it feels as if we are continuously mourning the loss of life like philando castile killed in 2016 by an officer who rationalized the shooting by saying the smell of marijuana made him fear for his life or ramarley graham killed in 2012 when an officer felt that his flushing marijuana down a toilet justified shooting the teenager or more recently breonna taylor and george floyd these painful losses are all rooted in the nation s drug policies and the resulting criminalization of our communities that have caused catastrophic harm last year s global black lives matter protests sparked national outcry and calls for police reform congressional policing bills have stalled but the most powerful and immediate impact could come with federal cannabis legalization eliminating the primary pretext for hundreds of thousands of police interactions in our communities our nation s drug laws have long been weaponized against black and brown people starting with marijuana prohibition in the 1930s and through the nixon administration s declared war on drugs in 2016 one of president richard nixon s former advisors went on record to declare that the war on drugs was a political tool to fight blacks and hippies photo adobe stock black and brown communities are on the losing side of this winless war and our casualties continue to pile up in 2019 nearly 40 of the 1 558 862 drug arrests involved marijuana despite similar usage rates across racial groups the aclu reports that black people are almost four times more likely to be arrested for possession than white people disparities exist in every state even those with relatively small black populations in states like montana and kentucky black people are almost 10 times more likely to face arrest while legalization alone will not reform the whole system it could dramatically decrease police violence just by reducing the number of encounters with cops it would also eliminate tax dollars used to harm and incarcerate people freeing up those funds for reinvestment in the black and brown communities destabilized by decades of over policing criminalization and the collateral consequences of cannabis prohibition research puts the cost of enforcing cannabis prohibition at 3 6 billion a year legalizing marijuana which has broad support from most americans would allow our country to reimagine policing without the partisan finger pointing that has hindered progress at the federal level for the victims and the families that have suffered the awful pain of burying a loved one who died at the hands of the police and the millions of black latino and indigenous people harmed by drug policies and their collateral consequences now is the time to end cannabis prohibition legalizing marijuana will finally put an end to one of the most pernicious justifications for the continued harassment arrest incarceration and far too often death of black and brown people in police custody the reform we seek can begin with a bipartisan solution that the entire nation can get behind steven hawkins is the executive director mpp and interim president of the united states cannabis council have you subscribed to thegrio s new podcast dear culture download our newest episodes now thegrio is now on apple tv amazon fire and roku download thegrio today

the world bank s doing business rankings which are followed closely by leaders in china india and elsewhere are supposed to gauge how easy it is to do business in 190 countries but the rankings have instead become a revealing gauge of how the world bank itself does business under political pressure in so doing they have also created a dilemma for the bank s sister institution the imf in january the bank appointed a law firm to investigate allegations that the scores for china and three other countries azerbaijan saudi arabia and the united arab emirates had been altered its findings released on september 16th provide a startlingly frank blow by blow account of the bank s efforts in 2017 to engineer an improvement in china s ranking according to the investigators the amendments reflected pressure from aides to jim yong kim the world bank s president at the time presumably at his direction and the effort was ultimately led by kristalina georgieva who was then second in command at the bank and is now the boss of the imf it was an awkward time for the bank some of its harshest critics were in office in america s treasury department as part of president donald trump s administration many of the bank s biggest clients could borrow larger sums with fewer strings attached from china or the financial markets and the distribution of shares and therefore voting rights in the bank was hopelessly outdated failing to reflect the rise of emerging economies since a country s votes in the bank are tied to its financial contributions a solution seemed obvious the bank should raise more capital from its members with emerging economies contributing a larger share than in the past but to get america and japan to agree to that the bank needed china to accept a smaller increase in its financial contributions and therefore its vote share than the country s economic size would warrant so that it did not become too influential the bank s leaders thus found themselves in a paradoxical position they wanted to keep china happy so that it would agree to stump up less money for the bank than was merited for such a big economy but even as the bank was losing prominence as a lender its doing business rankings were becoming ever more visible grabbing the attention of some of the world s most powerful people both vladimir putin of russia and narendra modi of india had set high profile targets for lifting their countries in the rankings li keqiang china s prime minister had put a team of perhaps 40 people in place to improve china s lowly position 78th at the time at mr li s urging china s reformers set about cutting red tape with some gusto the country s officials told world bank staff how much they were looking forward to seeing china rise in the rankings sadly many of these reforms took place too late to make the cut for the doing business report scheduled for release in late 2017 although china s score had improved it was set to fall to 85th place because other countries did even better i think i m going to cry one aide to mr kim wrote in an email when told that china would drop in october 2017 after the rankings were ready for the printer mr kim s aides discussed ways to improve china s position with the doing business team perhaps china s score could include macau but the bank had no data for the city perhaps hong kong too politically touchy at that point ms georgieva was put in charge of the issue according to the investigators a small group of doing business leaders helped by simeon djankov who had created the rankings in 2003 ultimately found a way to improve china s score on the ease of starting a business obtaining credit and paying taxes they decided for example not to count two procedures opening a bank account and obtaining financial invoices required to start a business and they undid a previous correction to china s score on the legal rights of secured creditors how arbitrary were these tweaks one staff member told the investigators that there was a reasonable question about china s scores on these matters and it is plausible that was what ms georgieva also believed but the investigation makes clear that these tweaks were an attempt to improve china s ranking not an attempt to improve the bank s method and an internal review by the bank itself released in december 2020 said that the tweaks were not justified by the doing business methodology or by any new information provided to the doing business team the investigation s findings pose two immediate questions what should now happen to the rankings and what should happen to ms georgieva the fate of the doing business rankings has already been decided the bank has said it will abandon the exercise that is perhaps inevitable given the damage to their reputation and credibility this is not their first scandal paul romer resigned as the bank s chief economist in 2018 after saying he could not defend the integrity of the rankings still the project s demise is a pity ranking countries against each other was gimmicky but it won the attention of leaders in pursuit of bragging rights by measuring concrete regulations that governments can feasibly change the scores helped to galvanise genuine reforms in some big economies including china it is also true that some governments gamed the rankings carrying out superficial reforms designed to improve their score without much improving life for businesses some people see the episode as proof of goodhart s law which states that when a measure becomes a target it ceases to be a good measure but the doing business rankings were always intended to motivate as well as measure to change the world not merely describe it if these rankings had never captured the imagination of world leaders if they had remained an obscure technical exercise they might have been better as measures of red tape but they would have been worse at cutting it and what about ms georgieva i disagree fundamentally with the findings and interpretations of the investigation she said in a statement on september 16th without elaborating when she was picked to run the fund in 2019 some wondered if ms georgieva a life long technocrat had the political nous and diplomatic finesse to handle the more prominent imf role now it seems she was too diplomatic for her own good in helping to keep china happy she may have thought she was helping to salvage multilateralism but critics of multilateralism will have a field day with these findings citing them as proof that international institutions like the one she now runs cannot stand up to china
on 10 september 2021 senate finance committee chairman ron wyden of oregon released a discussion draft proposing changes to partnership taxation and to the taxation of regulated investment companies including mutual funds and exchange traded funds etfs that would have significant impacts in the world of investment funds 1 much of what is included in the proposed legislation would impose more rigid structures on how income gains and losses of a partnership can be allocated among its partners this alert which is the first in a series addresses how the proposed changes would impact regulated investment companies mutual funds and etfs are two types of regulated investment companies that are subject to the same federal income tax rules under these rules when a mutual fund or etf sells appreciated portfolio securities including to meet redemptions it recognizes capital gain that is distributed before year end to shareholders who then must pay income tax on the gain distributed at year end alternatively under section 852 b 6 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code mutual funds and etfs may instead distribute appreciated portfolio securities in kind to shareholders in redemption of their shares without recognizing gain on the securities 2 unlike mutual funds which generally do not distribute appreciated portfolio securities in kind in redemption of shares etfs routinely do distribute securities in kind to shareholders and as a result of section 852 b 6 of the code etfs do not recognize gain on appreciated securities included in the distribution senator wyden s discussion draft proposes to repeal section 852 b 6 which would result in mutual funds and etfs recognizing gain on appreciated securities distributed to shareholders in kind increasing the amount of taxable gain that etfs will distribute to non redeeming shareholders shareholders of a mutual fund buy their shares directly from the mutual fund and when they no longer want the shares they sell them back to the mutual fund in a redemption transaction just like the purchase price this sale or redemption price for their shares is equal to the value of the shares proportionate interest in the assets of the mutual fund referred to as net asset value or nav in contrast most shareholders of an etf retail shareholders buy and sell their shares on the stock exchange where the price is a market price on the exchange there is a second category of etf shareholders which are securities brokers or dealers known as authorized participants who deal directly with the etf to create and redeem shares in the etf authorized participants contribute baskets of securities in kind to the etf in exchange for aggregations of shares known as creation units and when they redeem their shares they receive an in kind distribution of securities equal in value to the nav of the creation units redeemed the authorized participants activities in acquiring securities to purchase creation units and in acquiring etf shares on the market to redeem creation units establish what is known as the etf arbitrage mechanism which results in the market price for etf shares closely tracking the shares nav the etf arbitrage mechanism results in etfs regularly disposing of appreciated securities currently without recognizing taxable gain that must be distributed to shareholders it is this last point that is the focus of the proposed repeal of section 852 b 6 senator wyden s discussion points accompanying the draft proposal assert that in kind redemptions generally result in etfs making smaller taxable capital gain distributions to their shareholders than do mutual funds senator wyden also claims that etf shares can appreciate even more and with less frequent fund level recognition of gain than mutual fund shares an etf shareholder however does not avoid paying taxes on the gain she merely defers recognizing and paying taxes on the gain until she sells the shares while one result of the repeal of section 852 b 6 would be to cause etfs to recognize more taxable gain than they do currently there may be other unintended consequences twelve million u s households own etfs and 92 of such households have an annual income of less than 400 000 in fact the median household income of etf investors is 125 000 per year 3 thus the proposed tax will affect many u s investors with an annual income well below 400 000 even though the administration s stated goal has been limited to raising revenue from households with an annual income of 400 000 or more 4 section 852 b 6 plays an important role in mitigating the systemic risk potentially posed by a run on mutual funds and etfs and the u s securities and exchange commission as the administrator of the federal securities laws has recognized the potential for in kind redemptions to mitigate such systemic risk in various rules including recently adopted rules 6c 11 and 22e 4 under the investment company act of 1940 in this respect the repeal of section 852 b 6 may be exactly what the doctor didn t order at a time when congress and the administration are seeking to lessen systemic risk in the financial system if section 852 b 6 were repealed many of the tax costs associated with authorized participants short term trading of etf shares will be borne by long term etf shareholders also the etf arbitrage mechanism will be burdened by the increased tax costs as such tax costs may be passed back by etfs to authorized participants in the form of transaction fees resulting in etf shares trading at wider bid ask spreads and discounts to nav in the end retail shareholders will pay these costs in the form of wider bid ask spreads and market prices that are less than nav i e a discount to nav the etf industry is today a us 8 trillion industry 5 which employs a commensurate number of people due in part to retail investors recognizing the favorable tax treatment applied by section 852 b 6 to the etf structure however the repeal of section 852 b 6 could adversely impact the sector the repeal of section 852 b 6 is expected to be included in budget reconciliation legislation being developed in the senate finance committee chairman wyden s stated policy for the proposal is to close loopholes that allow wealthy investors and mega corporations to use pass through entities primarily partnerships to avoid paying their fair share of taxes as discussed above in attempting to achieve this goal the proposal may create unintended consequences particularly for retail investors that outweigh any perceived benefit of the repeal of section 852 b 6 1 staff of s comm on finance 117th cong wyden pass through reform discussion draft comm print 2021 2 section 852 b 6 is an exception to the general rule that a corporation s distribution of property to its shareholders results in the recognition of gain by the corporation with respect to the distributed property this provision helps registered funds avoid adverse tax consequences to their remaining shareholders when a large shareholder redeems its shares in the fund as it allows the fund to meet the redemption demand using a nontaxable in kind distribution of securities rather than selling securities and recognizing gain that would later be distributed and taxed to the shareholders left behind 3 investment company institute 2021 investment company fact book chapter 4 4 compare wyden discussion draft supra note 1 at note 36 citing a law review which claims that section 852 b 6

fortunately so were most of the shelves inside as shoppers looked to replenish their pantries and refrigerators after hurricane ida but some stores have yet to reopen in harder hit areas and the timeline for their return is unclear at zuppardo s family market in metairie clerks restocked aisles as fast soon after shoppers left shelves lean most households near the store didn t have power for more than a week and customers could only bring home basic necessities that would last a day or so now they re back looking to replenish these customers of ours they lost everything proprietor joey zuppardo said they had nothing to eat nothing in their refrigerators so they are coming in and buying everything that s on the shelf just down veterans boulevard the flow of customers was steady at dorignac s food store some indulged in items from the bakery and others wove their way through the wine aisles joe mabey who lives in the broadmoor neighborhood of new orleans said he and his wife had been doing most of their shopping just across the state line in mississippi where they also own a home he was shopping for dinner friday at dorignac s with just a few items in his cart slowly but

packages of meat off the butcher s cart while it was being rolled out before they could be placed in the display cooler the demand has cooled some but dorignac said lots of people are still replacing food they had to throw out for the hurricane the volume we re used to seeing in a day or two we re now seeing that in a half day dorignac said other family owned grocers say they were able to

golden meadow mathews and larose cut off remain closed an opening date could be set soon for golden meadow marketing director tim acosta said and its kenner location will be back in business monday at the rouses market in mid city shelves were largely stocked save for the frozen food section where employees had stacked dozens of boxes that would soon fill the cases acosta said the high demand for frozen items has outpaced the supply which rouses has had to obtain from wholesalers farther away than usual grocers say a critical element in their recovery has been the return of employees dorignac said more than two thirds of his team is back making it possible to keep products in stock and lines short at the register rouses is in constant hiring mode acosta said and there have been enough employees to reopen each store back at zuppardo s the checkout process was fast and easy for dionne browder who evacuated for hurricane ida and has grown tired of the fast food that had become a staple for her family she also depends on grocers for her side gig as a delivery driver it feels better to know the stores are open because when we first came back there wasn t much of anything open browder said although shoppers will find more items on their lists at stores they don t have as much time to fulfill them most locations are still open for limited hours which they attribute to a lack of manpower
the editorial board operates independently from the u t newsroom but holds itself to similar ethical standards we base our editorials and endorsements on reporting interviews and rigorous debate and strive for accuracy fairness and civility in our section disagree let us know the severity of california s housing crisis is difficult to exaggerate families in which spouses both have solid middle income jobs struggle to afford mortgages for condos not just single family homes families in which spouses both have lower income jobs often share apartments with others many single employed people and some families have no choice but to live in their cars the nation s richest state is also perversely its most impoverished advertisement this grim situation got the decisive response it deserved on thursday when gov gavin newsom signed senate bill 9 which effectively eliminates single family zoning by allowing duplexes in most neighborhoods and senate bill 10 which makes it far easier to add housing near transit hubs these measures alarm many homeowners who fear drastic changes in their communities they also have critics who believe they will fuel speculative building by hedge funds and wealthy investors more focused on making money than adding cheaper housing there s no way to know how many new homes will result but in an interview friday a newsom administration official emphasized any measure that increases the amount of available housing stock is ultimately going to be positive economists agree the cost of housing is inevitably going to be high if there is far more demand than supply these bold measures may disrupt and possibly diminish the quality of life in some communities but they have the potential to improve the quality of life of millions of california families who now spend half their income or more on shelter thanks to newsom and state senate president toni atkins d san diego for shepherding them to passage

pleased to present the half yearly financial report to shareholders for the six months ended 30 june 2021 overview and performance against a backdrop of political disruption and covid 19 driven economic volatility and social fragility markets in latin america outperformed the msci emerging markets index over the first half of 2021 with the msci em latin america index up by 8 9 1 compared to a 7 4 1 rise in the msci emerging markets index markets in brazil and mexico performed most strongly up by 10 6 1 and 13 7 1 respectively in contrast the andean countries colombia peru chile largely underperformed the benchmark the company s net asset value per share increased by 7 4 over the period underperforming the benchmark by 1 5 the underperformance was largely driven by stock specific factors as the portfolio managers moved to reduce country risk in the portfolio as political unrest escalated in sterling terms the nav rose by 6 3 over the same period and the benchmark rose by 7 7 the share price rose by 4 9 in us dollar terms 3 8 in sterling terms additional information on the main contributors to and detractors from performance for the period under review is given in the investment manager s report below revenue return and dividends revenue return for the six months ended 30 june 2021 was 8 70 cents per share 2020 2 85 cents per share the increase of 205 1 was largely due to a lower level of dividends received in the prior period for the six months ended 30 june 2020 when the covid 19 pandemic first took hold when compared to the less volatile pre pandemic trading environment of 2019 the current period revenue return per share was 9 8 higher than the 7 92 cents per share recorded for the six months ended 30 june 2019 the company has declared dividends totalling 27 69 cents per share in respect of the twelve months to 30 june 2021 representing a yield of 4 9 under the company s dividend policy dividends are calculated and paid quarterly based on 1 25 of the us dollar nav at close of business on the last working day of march june september and december respectively additional information in respect of the payment timetable is set out in the annual report and financial statements dividends will be financed through a combination of available net income in each financial year and revenue and capital reserves the dividends paid and declared by the company in the last twelve months have been funded from current year revenue and brought forward revenue reserves as at 30 june 2021 a balance of us 0 8 million remained in revenue reserves dividends will be funded out of capital reserves to the extent that current year revenue and revenue reserves are fully utilised the board believes that this removes pressure from the investment managers to seek a higher income yield from the underlying portfolio itself which could detract from total returns the board also believes the company s dividend policy will enhance demand for the company s shares and help to narrow the company s discount whilst maintaining the portfolio s ability to generate attractive total returns it is promising to note that since the dividend policy was introduced in july 2018 the company s discount has narrowed from 14 9 as at 1 july 2018 to 9 6 as at 30 june 2021 dividends declared in respect of the year to 30 june 2021 dividend rate announcement cents per share date pay

months ended 30 june 2021 the cum income discount on the ordinary shares in sterling terms has averaged 9 4 and ranged between 5 4 and 14 2 the board tries to reduce discount volatility by offering shareholders a discount control mechanism covering the four years to 31 december 2021 whereby shareholders are offered a tender for 24 99 per cent of the shares in issue excluding treasury shares at a tender price reflecting the latest cum income nav less 2 per cent and related portfolio realisation costs in the event that the continuation vote to be put to the company s agm in 2022 is approved where either of the following conditions have been met i the annualised total nav return of the company does not exceed the annualised benchmark index being the msci em latin america index us dollar net return by more than 100 basis points over the four year period from 1 january 2018 to 31 december 2021 the calculation period or ii the average daily discount to the cum income nav exceeds 12 per cent as calculated with reference to the trading of the shares over the calculation period in respect of the above conditions the company s annualised total nav return on a us dollar basis for the 42 months from 1 january 2018 to 30 june 2021 was 0 74 underperforming the annualised benchmark return for the same period of 0 85 by 0 11 the cum income discount of the company s ordinary shares has averaged 11 8 for this period and ranged from a discount of 2 0 to 20 6 ending on a discount of 9 6 at 30 june 2021 on these metrics a tender would be triggered if the annualised nav performance relative to the benchmark and the average discount calculations for the 42 months to 30 june 2021 remain unchanged over the remaining six months to 31 december 2021 the making of any tender offer pursuant to the above will be conditional upon the company having the required shareholder authority or such shareholder authority being obtained the company having sufficient distributable reserves to effect the repurchase and having regard to its continuing financial requirements sufficient cash reserves to settle the relevant transactions with shareholders and the company s continuing compliance with the listing rules and all other applicable laws and regulations the company may require a minimum level of participation in any such tender offer to be met failing which the tender offer may be declared void share capital as noted above the directors are mindful of the company s discount to nav the board monitors the company s share rating closely and is committed to making share purchases where appropriate to manage the discount the company has not bought back any shares during the six months ended 30 june 2021 and up to the date of publication of this report no shares were bought back in the year to 31 december 2020 outlook as vaccination rates ramp up globally and economies start to reopen a resurgence in consumer demand is likely to boost global economic growth rates as significant producers to the world of vital food timber minerals and oil supply the latin american region is well placed to benefit from this trend the company s portfolio managers are confident that there are many compelling investment opportunities in the region with equity valuations remaining cheap relative to historic levels and global peers and believe that current operating momentum will lead to upwards earnings revisions from portfolio companies the risk of a significant increase in inflation and continued political disruption have the potential to derail this growth momentum however overall the portfolio managers believe that higher external growth from us and china buoyant commodity prices and a liquidity boost from supportive fiscal policies in developed markets are attractive tailwinds that should support a resurgence in latin american equities over the coming year carolan dobson chairman 17 september 2021 1 calculations on a us dollar net return basis with dividends reinvested investment manager s report latin american equities outperformed the msci emerging markets index in the first half of 2021 and over the last twelve months ending 30 june 2021 both brazil and mexico have posted region leading returns over the past year while the andean countries have largely underperformed at the sector level energy discretionary and materials were the notable performing sectors in the first half of 2021 markets in latin america favoured smaller companies in the first half of 2021 as small caps outperformed large in brazil quality size and sentiment were the best performing factors whereas in mexico low volatility worked best despite the recent outperformance latin american equities currently trade at an attractive discount to the rest of the emerging markets based on the median price to forward earnings multiple in fact the difference in valuation is one of the widest variances in the last 25 years at the stock level we see positive trends for earnings revisions as economic recovery continues in the region and vaccinations slowly get distributed latin america is a region where political risk creates several challenges and opportunities for investors for 2021 politics has been more of a challenge political uncertainty has been seriously disruptive in peru and problematic in chile colombia has also seen public rioting in relation to proposed tax reform many governments are under pressure to take actions to stabilize deteriorated fiscal accounts doing this while the pandemic is still an issue and social conditions are fragile is politically difficult with upcoming presidential elections in chile in the second half of 2021 and brazil in 2022 we expect politics to have an important influence on markets in the near term our strategy has been to reduce country risk in the portfolio given bifurcated and polarising election outcomes allowing for stock specific factors to drive performance msci indices

pressures having proven persistent the risks for both 2021 and 2022 inflation remain tilted to the upside one thing made clear over the past months is that politics as well as the related fiscal risks will be a key driver of moves in local financial markets in the mid term with the president congress and the judiciary all seemingly focused on institutional battles much needed economic reforms are likely to be put on the backburner and politicians may be slow to address emerging problems like the threat of electricity shortages moreover fiscal risks are likely to build in the run up to the election in october 2022 and possibly after it as neither president bolsonaro nor his main rival lula seem overly committed to fiscal discipline in mexico we remain balanced in our view for recovery in economic growth with a strong bias toward external sectors the country s link to the us is strong but the domestic part of the economy should continue to face growth challenges driven by the reluctance in private investment as well as political and health uncertainty mid term elections were held in the second quarter of 2021 with results mostly in line with the pre election polls ruling party morena had mixed results helping to avoid the market s concern of granting president lópez obrador greater representation in congress to allow for constitutional reform despite a more challenging scenario in congress the federal government continues to move ahead with a nationalistic agenda for the energy sector challenging both existing and future private investments as well as adding to bilateral tensions with the us given both governments opposing environmental views despite the political sideshow economic momentum continues in a favourable direction and the local currency also has room to appreciate given fiscal austerity and rising domestic interest rates for chile the fiscal uncertainty from the constitutional convention has added to the effect of recent hawkishness from the central bank driven by an output gap that is closing and inflation close to target roughly half the population is already vaccinated and spending impulse from the recent pension withdrawals and other fiscal measures should keep the economy well supported for the rest of the year contributors to relative returns at the stock level the largest positive contributors to relative returns were holdings in cemex ternium and santos brasil mexican cement producer cemex increased its full year guidance for profitability in the first half of the year as signs of robust cement demand persist from strong growth related to the residential housing market in the company s main operations in southern united states as well as expectations for buoyant infrastructure spending in the us and mexico ternium is a non index stock and a leading latin american steel producer that has benefited from rising steel prices in north america the company has been investing in a new mexican growth platform and has taken market share from weaker domestic competitors santos brasil is a brazilian port operator that received a favourable renewal of an operating contract with a major global shipping company at a substantial increase in prices in the first half of this year detractors from relative returns the underweight portfolio positioning in respect of two state owned companies in brazil namely petróleo brasileiro petrobrás and centrais elétricas brasileiras eletrobras detracted significantly from the company s relative returns both of these stocks suffered from unexpected changes at key management positions during the first half of 2021 which induced fears of increased government interference in the respective company s operations the outgoing management teams of both companies were well regarded by investors and the abrupt changes at the ceo level created uncertainty regarding the ability for these companies to continue to generate value for shareholders while the stocks have bounced back to an extent off their near term valuation lows responding positively in spite of what we interpreted as bad news we are of the view that political risk will remain elevated for state owned companies ahead of the brazilian presidential election in 2022 and would argue there are greater investment opportunities elsewhere finally shares of mexican media firm televisa spiked in the first half of the year on the back of the announcement that the company agreed to combine its content and media assets with its us partner univision in order to create a combined entity which would be the largest spanish language media company in the world providing the potential to unlock value for televisa s shareholders the company s lack of holding in this security compared to the benchmark led to underperformance on a relative basis portfolio positioning over the six months ending 30 june 2021 we notably managed our brazilian exposure and built up positions in chile and mexico during the period we added to brazilian retail company via varejo as the company saw triple digit growth in online sales and continuation of favourable demand in offline channels despite withdrawal of government stimulus we reduced exposure to brazilian banks earlier in the period in particular we reduced exposure to banco bradesco as the bank faces incremental competition from fintech challengers and increased funding costs from rising domestic interest rates additionally we sold our holding of banco do brasil as the state owned company faced pressure from the government related to their recently announced cost cutting plan later in the period we initiated a position in credicorp a peruvian financial services company on the view that political uncertainty is creating opportunity for long term alpha generation given depressed valuations the country was in the midst of a tightly contested presidential election which created uncertainty and caused sharp depreciation of the currency despite favourable external conditions from high metal prices we believe fears of radical changes to the favourable institutional framework of the company are overdone and hence look to add exposure on political uncertainty induced volatility we also purchased chilean department stores company falabella given the company s position to benefit from gradual economic reopening and improving consumption trends we sold our holding in santos brasil a brazilian logistics company to take profits following the stock s outperformance driven by strength in import and export of commodities the company ended the period being overweight to chile and mexico whilst being underweight to colombia and peru at the sector level we are overweight industrials and consumer discretionary and underweight consumer staples and utilities outlook we expect economic activity to enjoy positive momentum in the region during the second half of 2021 as vaccination rates accelerate and economies reopen amid fiscal and monetary stimuli despite the risk posed by new variants of the virus the appetite for new mobility restrictions seems low we see upside risks to gdp growth forecasts for most of the region given robust global demand for bulk and soft commodities for which many latin countries will benefit from given the abundance of natural resources in latin america s export mix chile brazil and mexico have shown improving economic momentum from vaccine distributions and increased mobility argentina and peru are likely to be the laggards in the region amid high political uncertainty in brazil the economic recovery resumed after a relatively brief interruption following the carnival holiday due to the strong pandemic rebound in march and part of april industrial production was stable in june after rising in may yet it ended the second quarter of 2021 down from the first quarter dragged by the larger drops in march and april it is possible that the slower pace of recovery in the industrial segment is partially explained by insufficient inventories and other temporary bottlenecks and not simply weak demand as confidence indicators have been recovering since april may retail sales data continues to recover throughout the second quarter however the shock from late in the first quarter has not been fully assimilated yet even though retail sales and services grew in april and may they are still below february 2021 levels still as authorities continue to reduce movement restrictions in most states amid record vaccination rates the expectation is that the recovery will gain pace during the second half of the year particularly in services as of early august new daily covid 19 cases and deaths are at their lowest levels since december and january respectively and delta counts remain relatively low although there is some concern that the more contagious strain could still create a new wave nearly 50 of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine while 20 is fully immunized despite the expected near term uplift from economic normalisation on the back of increased vaccine distribution in brazil the country faces a number of headwinds in 2022 including uncertainty around a polarised presidential election next year stubbornly high inflation lingering pressure from high levels of government indebtedness and questions regarding the government s willingness to maintain credible fiscal policy in mexico quarterly gdp reports showed sequential expansion and confirmed the significant recovery in the services sector on the other hand primary and industrial activities grew strongly supported by low base effects from the pandemic shock a year ago we think there might be some upside risks in the second half of the year as the economy benefits from close proximity to the united states supporting mexico s manufacturing export sector although the main risk to our view continues to be the current wave of new covid 19 cases we see limited risks from this as the government has ruled out imposing new mobility restrictions while it continues with its vaccination roll out efforts amid fewer deaths than in previous waves during july some high frequency indicators such as google s mobility reports and opentable reservations continued to improve hence services like sports entertainment and restaurants which are still the most affected sectors might continue to gradually recover despite our optimism we acknowledge risks remain around the deterioration of the covid 19 backdrop high inflation and rising rates which could cap the upside in chile we have seen a consistent trend of upwardly revised growth forecasts and chile should be one of the first countries in the region to see gdp return to levels above pre pandemic readings we expect additional sequential growth in the second half of the year as economic activities continue to reopen as cases decline and the vaccination programme advances the government is implementing a cash transfer program starting in june that is worth 1 percentage point of gdp per month until september implying that the balance of risks to growth forecast remains tilted to the upside benefited by strong levels of consumption coming from such high levels we believe that next year s growth could slow as fiscal stimulus is reduced and the chance for political uncertainty to negatively impact investment increases as the country enters a highly contested presidential election in the fourth quarter of 2021 in colombia we see a mixed balance of risks between the economic reopening and social unrest but generally expect market consensus estimates for growth to keep moving higher activity data recently released showed that the protests over tax reform that took place during may had a smaller than expected economic impact moreover leading indicators suggest that may s temporary social disruptions have been overcome through june and july and the recovery process remains on track the reopening of the economy fiscal stimulus and a rebound of oil production should help sustain the recovery in argentina economic activity has been weaker than seen elsewhere because of lockdowns in the first half of the year however economic activity is likely to rebound sequentially going forward as restrictions have started to be lifted in fact manufacturing and construction have posted sequential monthly expansions recently which is an encouraging leading indicator macroeconomic imbalances continue to pose challenges for a sustained recovery in the country and in this context the country is also facing legislative elections in the fourth quarter that could impact business confidence peru is likely to be the laggard of the region the recovery already started to lose momentum through the second quarter of the year with an estimated contraction amid high political uncertainty generated by the new castillo administration that was inaugurated on 28 july we expect business confidence to deteriorate and investment and consumption decisions to be put on hold the first actions taken by the castillo administration appear to suggest that moderation from radical campaign rhetoric is unlikely for now instead the administration seems headed towards a confrontation with congress in its push to hold a constitutional assembly we expect capital outflows to persist and weakening fundamentals to lead to rating downgrades it is noteworthy to mention that a great deal of uncertainty has already been reflected in weak currency and equity prices which could present a long term opportunity for patient investors amid current discounted valuation of asset prices reasons to invest in latin america it has been a tough period for latin america with many countries hit hard by the covid 19 crisis however we see a strong case for better times ahead for the region as the world rebuilds after the pandemic and latin america may be one of the most important beneficiaries of recovery in the global economy as the region rebuilds it will have some important tailwinds perhaps the most significant is rising commodity prices vast stimulus in the us and economic recovery across the world has pushed up demand for commodities after a period of tight supply global governments have ambitious commodity heavy infrastructure plans particularly for green energy development latin america is also one of the most abundant regions in the world for lithium iron ore and copper with some of the longest life reserves at a low cost in brazil chile and peru there are also broader factors that should support economic growth across latin america a growing middle class is fuelling domestic consumption and after a brief hiatus from the pandemic this spending appears to be resuming as businesses in the us look to diversify their supply chains opportunities are being created in mexico particularly along the northern border in the manufacturing sector importantly a rich seam of new companies listing on the stock market is creating more opportunities all the time the buoyancy of the brazilian ipo market is perhaps the best example 2020 was a bumper year for brazilian ipos 28 companies listed on the main exchange raising brl 43 7 billion us 8 3 billion in spite of the pandemic this was almost four times the previous year s figure and the highest level since the giddy pre crash optimism of 2007 this year looks set to be even more promising over 40 companies have already said they want to list on sao paulo s b3 exchange this year there are sound reasons for this with excess global liquidity favourable macroeconomic conditions and increased financial awareness among brazilian investors all supporting new issuance in brazil this is bringing new sectors and more choice for investors in the region in the company we have exposure to structural growth themes in the region including healthcare e commerce and convenience stores against this positive backdrop we see anecdotal evidence that investors are moving away from china which has a lot of technology names to more cyclical markets latin american markets with their focus on materials energy and financials are a key beneficiary for example the weight of cyclical sectors such as energy and materials in emerging market benchmarks peaked at 37 at the end of 2007 while at the end of 2020 these sectors only represent 13 of the global emerging market index this has been offset by consumer discretionary and technology sectors becoming over half of emerging market indices from a low of 26 at the end of the 2000 s furthermore regulatory scrutiny has been increasingly punitive on chinese tech companies as the government looks to address social imbalances in the country to promote a harmonious distribution of wealth we believe that latin america is a prime destination for a rotation away from the asia tech complex for a number of reasons latin america is lightly represented in emerging market benchmarks and has generally been under owned so it only takes a small change in sentiment to have a significant impact furthermore relative valuations in latin america have rarely been cheaper as the region trades at a large discount to its own history as well as compared to emerging market and developed market peers when looking at traditional valuation metrics such as price to earnings or price to book value multiples as a result we believe latin american equities create an attractive investment destination given the under valued and under owned characteristics of the asset class given the wide valuation discounts in markets and cyclical benefits to the economies we expect more and more investors to rediscover the huge opportunities in this

statement the chairman s statement and the investment manager s report above give details of the events which have occurred during the period and their impact on the financial statements principal risks and uncertainties the principal risks faced by the company can be divided into various areas as follows counterparty investment performance income dividend legal and regulatory compliance operational market financial and marketing the board reported on the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the company in the annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2020 a detailed explanation can be found on pages 40 to 44 and in note 16 on pages 91 to 98 of the annual report and financial statements which are available on the website maintained by blackrock at blackrock com uk brla in the view of the board there have not been any changes to the fundamental nature of the principal risks and uncertainties since the previous report and these are equally applicable to the remaining six months of the financial year as they were to the six months under review going concern the board is mindful of the continuing uncertainty surrounding the potential duration of the covid 19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy the company s assets and the potential for the level of revenue derived from the portfolio to reduce versus the prior year the board believes that the company and its key third party service providers have in place appropriate business continuity plans and will be able to maintain service levels through the covid 19 pandemic there will be a continuation vote at the company s agm in 2022 and the board proposes to offer a tender for 24 99 of the company s ordinary shares in issue excluding treasury shares at the same agm if certain performance and discount conditions are met more details of these conditions are set out in the chairman s statement above the outcome of these events are unknown at the present time notwithstanding these uncertainties the directors are satisfied that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and is financially sound the company has a portfolio of investments which are considered to be readily realisable and is able to meet all of its liabilities from its assets and income generated from these assets ongoing charges excluding finance costs direct transaction costs custody transaction charges vat recovered taxation and certain non recurring items for the year ended 31 december 2020 were approximately 1 14 of average daily net assets to the extent that the tender offer proceeds in 2022 and is fully subscribed the company would remain a viable size and would retain a liquid portfolio with ongoing expenses and liabilities still representing a very small percentage of net assets in addition the company has a 40 million bank overdraft facility in place to meet liquidity requirements subject to a maximum restriction of 30 of net asset value as at 14 september 2021 this facility had an unutilised margin of us 17 6 million for the company to draw on for liquidity purposes therefore for the reasons set

approximation of fair value due from brokers dividends and interest receivable due to brokers accruals cash and cash equivalents and overdrafts section 34 of frs 102 requires the company to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making the measurements the valuation techniques used by the company are explained in the accounting policies note on page 84 of the annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2020 categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset the fair value hierarchy has the following levels level 1 quoted market price for identical instruments in active markets a financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange dealer broker industry group pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm s length basis the company does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments level 2 valuation techniques using observable inputs this category includes instruments valued using quoted prices for similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active or other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data level 3 valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs this category includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs not based on market data and these inputs could have a significant impact on the instrument s valuation this category also includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments where significant entity determined adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments and instruments for which there is no active market the investment manager considers observable data to be that market data that is readily available regularly distributed or updated reliable and verifiable not proprietary and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement if a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs that measurement is a level 3 measurement assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgement considering factors specific to the asset or liability the determination of what constitutes observable inputs requires significant judgement by the investment manager the table below is an analysis of the

as smoke from summer western wildfires spreads all the way to maine the entire country finally realizes what the west has long known america s forest management policies are not working this record breaking fire season has seen more than 5 million acres burn in 81 large fires across 10 states california s dixie fire has torched more than 700 homes and now totals nearly 1 million acres it is approaching the size of rhode island oregon s bootleg fire is now so large it s generating its own weather including lightning in my home state of wyoming 20 000 acres are currently burning in national forest areas with more dry gusty weather on the way the u s forest service usfs is in crisis mode and facing critical resource shortages with 21 000 exhausted federal firefighters on the ground more than double the number a year ago while thousands of the burning acres are grasslands the majority of wildfires raging are in forested areas and regardless of the cause lightning arson a carelessly flicked cigarette federal forest management policies have made these raging infernos even worse for too many years when it comes to federal forests radical environmentalists and beholden political appointees have had an all or nothing don t touch approach this has done far more harm than good and has resulted in unhealthy forests extremist groups regularly file lawsuits to prevent clearing underbrush and harvesting too dense timber which add fuel to fires and bombard their unwitting followers with alerts about logging on federal land as if our national forests were static museum exhibits their policies have resulted in underbrush growing unchecked and forests becoming denser and accumulating more dead biomass which turns them into tinderboxes they are destroying our forests to save them like many laws the national environmental policy act nepa of 1970 which governs the federal government s actions began with good intentions it requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of proposed actions before making decisions but nepa is a study in unintended consequences the act has been weaponized to require expensive and resource consuming environmental analysis for even minor and commonsense solutions that is why i ve introduced the stop catastrophes act in the senate this bill along with a house companion introduced by u s rep dan newhouse r wash will improve forest health and reduce the risk of wildfires under nepa federal agencies are allowed to issue a categorical exclusion from the environmental analysis requirement if an action does not have a significant effect on the environment my bill would expand those exclusions to include the removal of noxious or invasive weeds which often help fuel fires the creation of fire breaks allowing fencing to improve wildlife habitat erecting erosion control devices and managing hazardous fuels it would also exclude from the law the creation of permanent infrastructure such as stock ponds the legislation would also increase acreage caps in these exclusions to 10 000 acres to better allow these forest management activities to be covered this is not reckless logging it s not clearcutting it s not destroying our forests on the contrary simple commonsense actions like those in my bill would actually help save our forests and protect our environment which was the entire point of nepa as my colleagues return from their summer vacations with complaints of smoke obscured vistas i hope they stop and consider what we in the west have known for decades more of our treasured forests are going up in smoke each year and our forest management policies are fanning the flames u s senator cynthia lummis is a republican from wyoming and sits on the senate environment and public works committee

pfizer inc nyse pfe and biontech se nasdaq bntx announced today that the u s food and drug administration s fda vaccines and related biological products advisory committee vrbpac voted unanimously to recommend the fda grant emergency use authorization eua for a booster dose of comirnaty covid 19 vaccine mrna in individuals 65 years of age and older and individuals at high risk of severe covid 19 the committee recommended that the additional dose be administered at least six months after the two dose series the panel also agreed that healthcare workers and others at high risk for occupational exposure should be included in this eua vrbpac is made up of independent experts who advise the fda on scientific and regulatory matters including the evaluation of vaccine safety and efficacy at this time vrbpac did not vote in favor of approval of a booster dose for the full population for which pfizer and biontech submitted their supplemental biologics license application which was individuals 16 and older the same data have recently been submitted to the european medicines agency ema and will be filed with other regulatory authorities in the coming weeks the companies remain vigilant and continue to generate relevant comirnaty booster dose data for evaluation for future licensure in further groups as well as to address emerging variants of concern the fda is expected to make its decision in the coming days this decision could allow comirnaty to be the first covid 19 vaccine with a booster authorized in the u s today the vrbpac reviewed data from our clinical program showing a favorable safety profile and strong immune responses against sars cov 2 after a booster dose of our vaccine these data and the larger body of scientific evidence presented at the meeting underscore our belief that boosters can be a critical tool in the ongoing effort to control the spread of this virus said kathrin u jansen ph d senior vice president and head of vaccine research development pfizer we thank the committee for their thoughtful review of the data and will work with the fda following today s meeting to address the committee s questions as we continue to believe in the benefits of a booster dose for a broader population we are committed to support the ongoing efforts to reduce infections and covid 19 cases the data we submitted to the fda ema and other regulatory authorities underline that a booster induces a strong immune response against all tested variants of concern and may contribute to address a public health need said özlem türeci m d co founder and chief medical officer of biontech vrbpac based its recommendation on the totality of scientific evidence shared by the companies including data from their clinical program evaluating the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of a booster dose of comirnaty a booster dose of the vaccine elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the initial sars cov 2 virus wild type as well as the beta and delta variants when compared with the levels observed after the two dose primary series the reactogenicity profile within seven days after the booster dose was typically mild to moderate and the frequency of reactions was similar to or lower than after dose two the adverse event profile was generally consistent with other clinical safety data for comirnaty real world surveillance data also were presented to the vrbpac by the israel ministry of health providing further support for the public health impact of boosters the data presented from israel included an analysis published this week in the new england journal of medicine the analysis comprised approximately 1 1 million individuals ages 60 years and older who were eligible for a booster dose of the vaccine between july 30 through august 31 2021 no new safety signals were observed and reported adverse events were lower than those observed after dose two the analysis showed that a booster dose restored very high levels of protection against covid 19 infections and severe disease in this period when delta was the dominant strain individuals who received the booster dose were less likely by a factor of 11 3 95 ci 10 4 12 3 to develop a confirmed infection and less likely by a factor of 19 5 95 ci 12 9 29 5 to develop severe illness compared to those who were previously fully vaccinated but did not receive a booster dose the additional protection after receiving a booster translated to vaccine effectiveness comparable to levels seen early in the country s vaccine rollout an estimated 95 when the alpha variant was predominant under the eua of the pfizer biontech vaccine in the u s a third dose was previously authorized for individuals at least 12 years of age who have undergone solid organ transplant or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise this authorization of a third dose for immunocompromised individuals is separate and distinct from the booster dose reviewed by vrbpac today the third dose for immunocompromised individuals is meant to address the fact that these individuals sometimes do not build enough protection after two doses of the vaccine in contrast the booster dose recommended today by vrbpac for eua refers to an additional dose of the vaccine that is given to those who have built enough protection after the primary two dose vaccination series but may have decreased protection over time due to waning of immunity comirnaty which is based on biontech s proprietary mrna technology was developed by both biontech and pfizer biontech is the marketing authorization holder in the united states the european union the united kingdom canada and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the united states jointly with pfizer and other countries submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned u s indication authorized use comirnaty covid 19 vaccine mrna is an fda approved covid 19 vaccine made by pfizer for biontech it is approved as a 2 dose series for prevention of covid 19 in individuals 16 years of age and older it is also authorized under emergency use authorization eua to be administered for emergency use to prevent covid 19 in individuals 12 through 15 years and provide a third dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine has received eua from fda to prevent covid 19 in individuals 12 years of age and older and provide a third dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise the fda approved comirnaty covid 19 vaccine mrna and the eua authorized pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine have the same formulation and can be used interchangeably to provide the covid 19 vaccination series an individual may be offered either comirnaty covid 19 vaccine mrna or the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 caused by sars cov 2 eua statement this emergency use of the product has not been approved or licensed by fda but has been authorized by fda under an emergency use authorization eua to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 for use in individuals 12 years of age and older and the emergency use of this product is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency

as the mid autumn festival approaches asian supermarkets and costcos in metro phoenix have been preparing for the occasion by stocking up on mooncakes called yue bing in chinese 月餅 the dense round cakes are about the size of a hockey puck and are a symbolic part of the festival which is a time of family reunions entwined with the chinese legend of chang e goddess of the moon the festival follows the chinese lunisolar calendar falling on the 15th day of the eighth month this year the mid autumn festival is tuesday sept 21 every year valley resident jason kwan and his parents sit down together for a mid autumn festival meal usually featuring steamed chicken crispy roasted pork and a clear noodle dish made with stir fried tofu baby corn snap peas and other vegetables they then head out to their backyard to look at the full moon together and split a mooncake into four pieces one piece each for kwan and his dad two pieces for his mom kwan said he personally doesn t care for mooncakes as he feels they re too heavy but the mid autumn festival wouldn t be the same without them if you don t get them you feel like you re missing out he said food crawl what to eat at every restaurant and food stall in mekong plaza a gift giving tradition several countries in east asia celebrate the mid autumn festival families in china and vietnam mark the occasion by carrying brightly lit lanterns and eating mooncakes together the round shape symbolizes reunion though mooncakes can come in square shapes the whole salted egg yolk in the middle of the cakes symbolizes the full moon it s tradition to give the sweets as presents to family friends and coworkers though the piling up of extravagantly packaged mooncakes has given the treats the reputation of being the fruitcake of china for chandler resident catherine nguyen the mid autumn festival is a time for family and community bonding as well as generosity when she lived in saigon nguyen made mooncakes every year with her cousins which they shared with neighbors as children she and the other neighborhood kids would walk out in the streets singing songs and carrying candle lit paper lanterns shaped like the animals of the chinese zodiac her mother would also take them to a children s orphanage during the mid autumn festival to distribute the cakes called ba nh trung thu in vietnamese nguyen said that back then they typically ate mooncakes filled with mung bean paste or mixed nuts ground chicken and egg yolk now there are many other fillings available such as taro matcha and durian she said her son enjoys helping her in the kitchen so she hopes to pass down her family s recipes after moving to arizona in 2016 nguyen opened her restaurant max saigon there she sells mooncakes made by her aunt every year and sends the profits back to the orphanage in saigon she said because growing up i was so blessed and so fortunate nguyen said i always have nice memories of my mom giving me nice mooncakes she always

korean corn dogs in metro phoenix making mooncakes at home for his first mid autumn festival during the pandemic kwan was spending more time at home and he learned how to make snow skin mooncakes so his parents wouldn t have to go to the grocery store popularized in hong kong snow skin mooncakes are refrigerated instead of baked made without lard and oil they re supposed to be a lighter and less fatty version kwan said the crust or snow skin is made with glutinous rice flour which gives it a similar texture to mochi kwan mixes his rice flour with tapioca starch to make it less chewy than mochi he said mooncakes were a food he used to take for granted kwan said while researching mooncakes he learned about the symbolism and history behind them i think with the pandemic there s a trend of home bakers and people wanting to make more stuff at home kwan said it gives me an opportunity to take some of the foods that are traditional i grew up with and now just learning how to experiment with them it s an arduous process and gives you an appreciation of the work it takes to make this type of sweets and desserts last year kwan and his parents the taste testers dropped off his homemade

the agency is looking into changing its rules around allowing its staff members to trade stocks after it was revealed that top federal reserve officials had made several large stock trades sen elizabeth warren d massachusetts has called for regional fed banks to stop allowing fed officials to trade stocks altogether on wednesday warren sent letters to 12 regional fed presidents urging them to amend their ethics rules to bar themselves and their staff from trading stocks calling it a matter of reinforcing public confidence in the agency regional fed leaders must ban the ownership and trading of individual stocks by senior officials and impose strong and enforceable ethics and financial conflicts of interest rules for themselves and their staff to restore public trust warren said instating critical ethics rules will send a clear and necessary message to the american people about the importance of government ethics and the integrity of fed officials the fed announced thursday that after outcry over recent fed officials stock trades the agency is now looking into changing its rules regarding stock trading per the direction of fed chair jerome powell because the trust of the american people is essential for the federal reserve to effectively carry out our important mission chair powell late last week directed board staff to take a fresh and comprehensive look at the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activities by senior fed officials a spokesperson for the federal reserve said this review will assist in identifying ways to further tighten those rules and standards it was recently revealed that dallas fed president robert s kaplan and boston fed president eric rosengren both bought and sold significant amounts of stocks and real estate related assets last year as the global economy was being rocked by the pandemic rosengren had stakes in four real estate trusts kaplan meanwhile had made nearly two dozen stock trades of 1 million or more including in companies like johnson and johnson and oil and gas companies that were directly involved in or affected by the covid 19 pandemic many of his oil and gas transactions were made at a time when the role of the industry was being questioned within the finance world these trades appear to be legal and were made outside of the window that would qualify them as insider trading but even if they weren t strictly illegal the fed still has wide sway over the stock market at large and the trades raise questions about whether or not such officials should be allowed to trade stocks at all considering they hold such positions of power and possess a wealth of insider knowledge kaplan and rosengren have both pledged to sell their individual stock holdings by the end of this month but warren said that the practice should be banned altogether for people in positions of vast political power asserting in her letters that the american public should not have to rely on vague and unenforceable promises made amidst an ethics firestorm in order to have confidence that fed officials are acting solely in the public interest not based on their own financial interests the controversy over asset trading by high level fed personnel highlights why it is necessary to ban ownership and trading of individual stocks by senior officials who are supposed to serve the public interest warren continued she asked the leaders of the fed branches to impose a ban on stock trading within 60 days and send her a written plan to do so by mid october the massachusetts lawmaker has been pushing for tighter rules around stock trades for politicians and federal officials overall earlier this year she unveiled legislation that would bar members of congress the president cabinet officials judicial leaders and anyone in a position of influencing financial regulation from trading stocks the bill she said would fight corruption and increase public trust in washington tired of reading the same old news from the same old sources so are we that s why we re on a mission to shake things up and bring you the stories and perspectives that often go untold in mainstream media but being a radically unapologetically independent news site isn t easy or cheap and we rely on reader support to keep the lights on if you like what you re reading please consider making a tax deductible donation today we re not asking for a handout we re asking for an investment invest in a nonprofit news site that s not afraid to ruffle a few feathers not afraid to stand up for what s right and not afraid to tell it like it is copyright truthout may not be reprinted without permission
this year we have witnessed the post pandemic recovery of the global economy despite various challenges such as the recovery of global production the decline of overseas demand and the weak u s dollar index china has maintained rapid although somewhat fluctuating growth in exports in the first half of 2021 with the monthly export volume continuously rising beyond the market expectations there are two reasons for this surge the first is that the structural adjustments in export products have continued and major exports have shifted from anti epidemic supplies and consumer durables to intermediate goods necessary for resumed global production the second reason is that china has expanded its exports to emerging markets especially to southeast asia however some worrying signs has started to appear the year on year ratios of the seasonally adjusted exports and the export delivery value have shown a slowing trend since april the global export rebalancing will lead to a shift from chinese production to global production in addition the full resumption of the overseas economies will drive the substitution effect of the overseas supply and demand foreign trade and foreign invested companies in china are important parts of its economy our survey shows that they are faced with four major challenges today which will put pressure on foreign trade growth in the second half of 2021 headache 1 shipping blockage for foreign trade companies shipping is the most important mode of transportation for goods over the past year the international shipping sector has seen an increase in demand and shortage of supply hurting china s exporters and importers the worldwide spread of covid 19 and the short supply of crew have resulted in the reduced capacity of cargo ships along the international routes meanwhile the global economy and foreign trade demand have generally recovered causing a supply demand imbalance that raises freight rates in addition ports have introduced stricter pandemic prevention and control measures for people and goods actively weakened their handling capacity and lengthened the clearance time resulting in reduced shipping efficiency especially noticeable is the issue of closed hub ports as this forces cargo ships to take longer routes possibly causing the break of the entire shipping chain the global cancellations and delays for ocean shipping routes have gone up since the beginning of the year freight charges have skyrocketed while the on time delivery rate otdr has declined in august the spot rates for the routes from shanghai to new york and to los angeles soared with an increase of over 10 more than doubling the spot rates for major routes to europe increased by more than 3 compared to the previous month more than five times year on year according to sea intelligence s report the otdr of shipping companies around the world has been around 40 since march 2021 but it dropped to 35 6 in july close to the low level at the beginning of the year in july the average otdr of china s major coastal ports has even gone below 20 as a result the continuous rise in freight rates will squeeze their profits notably small and midsize companies lack protection from long term agreements making it difficult for them to get deliveries on time causing them to get caught in delays which further trigger inventory backlog and cash flow shortage because of this they find themselves in a dilemma where they dare not receive orders as they cannot make profit from exports headache 2 short supply of materials key materials for the products of chinese foreign trade companies are in short supply thanks to the unstable industrial transfer and covid 19 for one thing amid covid 19 developed economies like the united states have imposed stricter restrictions and protection on strategic industries and sensitive sectors chinese foreign trade and foreign invested companies have been deeply engaged in the international production network making them more dependent on the resilience and stability of the supply chain in particular when it comes to high tech firms the industrial policies have been restrained by the global economic and trade landscape therefore many companies are making efforts to improve their stocks of key parts and components and further diversify supply channels while transferring production bases closer to home and implementing production transfer in different regions the duration of the covid 19 impact has been beyond expectations the short supply of semiconductor chips has had an especially great impact on enterprise production for example the short supply of chips of upstream enterprises has given rise to the shutdown or production reduction of downstream carmakers ihs markit predicted that nearly 1 million vehicles would be facing forced delays in the first quarter of 2021 according to alixpartners the impact of chip shortage will cause an income loss of 60 6 billion to the global automobile industry in 2021 malaysia is a major manufacturing region for semiconductors in august malaysia s intensified pandemic situation led to the shutdown of some vcu chip lines for electric vehicles further affecting foreign trade in automotive electronics the supply demand imbalance caused by covid 19 cannot be resolved in a short time in the long run to secure the national industrial chain simultaneous layouts at home and abroad should be made to address the raw material issue read more q a how one foreign invested firm is doing in china headache 3 price surge for foreign trade companies the rise in prices of bulk commodities has pushed the prices of industrial raw materials up lowering the profits of exporters at the production end the central government has issued a number of policies such as the promotion of import diversification and the establishment of stable channels for bulk commodities to stabilize foreign trade the general rise in prices of bulk commodities since the beginning of the year has been driven by the global supply demand imbalance and mobility the baltic dry index bdi is a typical indicator for global trade the continuous rise of bdi is mainly attributed to the price surge of bulk commodities in particular the prices of black commodities such as coal have been rising which has led to continuous new highs of freight rates multiple factors like the decline of coal imports and short supply of domestic coal have lead to a negative supply demand relationship in the domestic coal market leading to the sustained high level of the coal price in the first half of this year to control the coal price national authorities including the national development and reform commission ndrc have implemented several measures over the past two weeks to increase the coal capacity and comprehensively implement new strategies for the low carbon energy transition headache 4 workforce crunch foreign trade companies have played an important role in stabilizing chinese employment but the current demographic trend has caused an irreversible rise in labor costs the post pandemic labor market in china is facing a more prominent structural shortage of laborers foreign trade companies especially cost driven processing companies are the worst affected since the outbreak of the pandemic china s labor shortage has worsened especially in the manufacturing industry according to the list of the top 100 occupations with the most acute shortage of labor released by the ministry of human resources and social security as of the second quarter of 2021 the employment gap recruitment needs minus the number of applicants increased rapidly from 850 000 in the first half of 2020 to 1 021 000 a rise of 20 1 the labor shortage of the manufacturing industry accounted for 38 while the gap for general workers with low technical requirements accounted for 55 3 in the manufacturing industry meanwhile the highly skilled talent gap is widening the post pandemic distribution of employment in the shared service industry has also aggravated the labor shortage in the manufacturing industry in china about 830 million actors participated in the sharing economy in 2020 including around 84 million individuals engaged in providing service and 6 31 million employees of digital online platforms a year on year rise of 7 7 and 1 3 respectively as estimated by the sharing economy research center under the state information center the new employment pattern in the platform based sharing economy entails inclusivity and flexibility for workers which not only solves the post pandemic employment pressure but also helps to reduce the uncertainty of the employment market meituan a chinese delivery service platform has absorbed many secondary workers during the pandemic according to the report on the employment of meituan riders released by the meituan research institute over 35 of delivery riders used to work in factories outlook for china s exports as we look into the future exports will gradually drop to pre pandemic levels from the pandemic high given the gradual rebound in industrial production and de china ization in the global industrial chain it is inevitable that china s exports will see a marginal decline from the current high level this year s unexpectedly high exports provide a window for boosting solid and sound economic growth the resilient export is a result of china s supply side fiscal stimulus which aims to ensure security in operations of both market entities and foreign trade entities thus protecting the integrity of the supply chain amid global economic uncertainty there are still sources of hope although the pressure of counter globalization and de china ization still persists market behaviors in some western countries may act entirely different from what the governments and politicians wished for while developed countries which have gone through a period of deindustrialization find it hard to rebuild their manufacturing systems emerging economies fail to absorb the incoming orders great uncertainties driven by vaccine shortages and the lack of binding force of non drug related covid 19 prevention measures have prevented these emerging countries from becoming the substitutions of china luo zhiheng is deputy director of yuekai securities research

ciudad acuña mexico sept 17 reuters haitians made up most of the over 10 000 migrants sleeping on the ground and desperate for food in a squalid camp under a bridge in southern texas on friday in a growing humanitarian and political challenge for u s president joe biden the haitians were joined by cubans venezuelans and nicaraguans under the del rio international bridge connecting mexico to south texas they slept under light blankets while a few pitched small tents with temperatures forecast to go above 100 degrees fahrenheit 38 celsius in coming days officials on both sides of the u s mexico border said most of the migrants were haitians and more are expected to arrive most of the migrants reuters spoke to had not come direct from haiti but had made long and harrowing journeys through mexico and central and south america several of them told reuters they followed routes shared amongst each other on whatsapp del rio mayor bruno lozano said the number of migrants under the bridge that crosses into mexico had jumped from 8 200 thursday morning to 10 503 by thursday evening he said friday he was ordering the bridge closed but it was unclear if he had the authority to do so and traffic across the bridge continued in ciudad acuña in mexico across from del rio two workers at the main bus terminal said at least two dozen buses full of haitians had arrived friday with one putting the estimate of individual arrivals at around 1 100 reuters saw dozens of mostly haitian migrants arriving at the terminal carrying jugs of water tightly packed backpacks and folders where they had carefully stored travel documents with many saying they soon planned to head across the shallow rio grande which divides the united states and mexico most of the migrants at the texas camp were men but women nursing or carrying children also could be seen ali sajous 29 a haitian migrant said u s officials were handing out numbers for immigration processing and she her husband and two year old daughter who arrived monday were no 910 in the families line authorities were processing no 685 at the time she said haiti the poorest country in the western hemisphere has a troubled history in july the president was assassinated amidst a rise in gang violence and in august a 7 2 magnitude earthquake and a powerful storm hit the country many of the haitians interviewed by reuters said they used to live in south america often brazil or chile but decided to head north because they could not attain legal status or struggled to secure decent jobs some haitians also said they were encouraged by videos they saw on social media about obtaining asylum in the united states hundreds wade through rio grande reuters witnessed hundreds of migrants wading through the knee high rio grande back into mexico to stock up on essentials they say they are not receiving on the american side two haitian migrants said a hot meal was provided by u s officials on thursday night paul marie samise 32 said he missed it the u s border patrol said thursday it was increasing staffing in del rio and providing drinking water towels and portable toilets biden a democrat who took office in january has pledged a more humane approach to immigration than that of former president donald trump the situation in del rio is giving ammunition to critics who say biden s policies have encouraged migrants republican texas governor greg abbott whose administration has arrested migrants for trespassing and is planning to build its own border wall after biden halted trump s signature project said thursday he would sign a law to increase border security funding in the state to 3 billion we re trying to fix biden s failure he wrote in a tweet u s authorities arrested more than 195 000 migrants at the southwest border in august according to government data released on wednesday a slight dip from the previous month but still around 20 year highs while biden rolled back many of trump s immigration actions early in his presidency he left in place a sweeping pandemic era expulsion policy called title 42 under which most migrants caught crossing the u s mexico border are quickly turned back the policy issued by the u s centers for disease control and prevention has been criticized by pro migrant groups and some democrats as cutting off legal access to asylum on thursday a u s federal judge ruled the policy could no longer be applied to families the biden administration on friday appealed the judge s order which had been set to take effect in two weeks while more than 90 of all single adults caught at the border from mexico and central america were quickly expelled under title 42 less than 40 of single adults from other countries were expelled according to u s customs and border protection data from this fiscal year which began last october many of those who are not expelled hope to be released into the united states so they can apply for asylum a long process due to a backlogged immigration court system
over more than 40 years while a crisis of homelessness has exploded a narrative has been popularized that sees it largely through stereotypes for a wealthy elite that s advanced a generation of neoliberal reforms it s been critical to cast homelessness in this way as an aberration on the margins of an otherwise healthy society rather than as a startlingly visible indictment of a political and economic order in which homelessness and poverty are at the very core of society in the late 1970s and early 1980s major structural shifts in the global economy were accompanied by deep tax cuts the deregulation of banking and the financial markets the privatization of public utilities and services and anti labor measures in the midst of all this homelessness grew as the government demolished public housing while investing in private urban development projects that fueled gentrification and pushed poor families from their homes up from the streets and out of the shelters poor and homeless people began organizing themselves into communities of mutual aid and solidarity in just a few years the national union of the homeless nuh broke into the national narrative challenging the prevailing notion that its members were poor and homeless because of bad personal decisions and moral failures in their family lives instead they targeted the systems and structures that produced their poverty recently images of the flooding of tompkins square park when what was left of hurricane ida hit downtown new york city received significant attention over the summer the number of homeless people living in that park increased strikingly and neighbors began organizing mutual aid projects to help the unhoused such conditions and projects of survival connect this particular moment to the past specifically to a time decades ago when homeless and formerly homeless organizers from tompkins square first helped form the national union of the homeless in the late 1980s and early 1990s the nuh would organize 25 chapters in cities across the united states representing thousands of homeless people its slogans then included tompkins square everywhere no housing no peace and you only get what you re organized to take and they still resonate today the nuh was known for coordinating housing takeovers those lacking housing moved into abandoned government owned dwellings in a politicized and organized way the spectacle of homeless people directly challenging public property in the name of survival was striking in fact in the 1980s and 1990s these bold actions resulted in the union winning the right of the homeless to vote setting up housing programs run by the un housed themselves in nearly a dozen cities and so shifting the national narrative on poverty and homelessness in the midst of the present pandemic and the eviction crisis that now goes with it the national union of the homeless is taking to the streets again excerpted the moral case for resisting evictions amid a pandemic commondreams org

seem like an obvious question but there is actually a bit more than meets the eye when it comes down to do stock research to land your best investment each investment newsletter is essentially a financial publication that anyone can subscribe to for educational purposes according to securities lawyer 101 there are different kinds of investment newsletters some address general securities topics explaining the qualities of different types of stocks bonds or funds and suggesting why they might be attractive on the other hand some can also offer analysis of specific securities and dish out recommendations but be careful before starting your investment portfolio based on newsletters whatever the type some investing newsletters are legitimate but many are created by investor relations firms to deceive investors into purchasing securities at inflated prices particularly in the penny stock markets investing newsletters offer you key stocks information and are a space for general market discussion some of them report on the market and the economy in general covering trends forecasts analysis and the editor s expert opinion they generally do not recommend specific stocks to invest in instead they are more similar to a normal stock market column in a traditional magazine or newspaper on the other hand investment grades newsletters provide grades scores or rankings for a long list of investments they are sometimes found in mutual fund bulletins but they can also be applied to stocks model portfolio newsletters publish model portfolios that subscribers can choose to reflect on their own accounts these simulated or sometimes real money portfolios are based on investing an initial amount of capital over time they allocate funds to a specific number of shares and notify subscribers each time they perform a trade model portfolio newsletters generally have the highest performance accountability and are the easiest to reproduce this is because they are publishing an established portfolio with clear allocation amounts prices and trades and their performance claims are more likely to be accurate and easy for you as a subscriber to reproduce so if you were to follow the model portfolio on your own account you are much more likely to get the same returns as the newsletter all of these investing newsletters offer specific features such as articles reports analysis and other perks to keep you updated with the latest investment opportunities and trends you can access some of the content for free but most of them require a paid subscription the best investing newsletters are the ones that outperform others for a significant period this means that the newsletter should offer you investments that offer a solid return beyond similar stocks on a comparable index you want a transparent service that shows not only how their picks perform but how the service works to choose stocks or sectors for your investment consideration according to young and the invested the best investment newsletters will also tell you why a stock is likely to outperform the market based on facts a thorough evaluation and actionable signals the portal also asserts the recommendations made must be replicable by you if only the biggest investors can act on these investment recommendations you likely shouldn t subscribe if you want to deploy your own capital the reason behind this is rooted in the fact that your returns can never be comparable to the other stock market players with more capital to invest at advantageous pricing and times a good stock newsletter should pay for itself there are many places where it is worth saving a few dollars and planning your financial future is not one of them if you just want to have fun with a small amount of experimental investment capital perhaps a cheap or free speculative newsletter might be right for you if your goal is to invest your retirement savings using a reputable newsletter with a track record of strong market returns you will probably pay hundreds of dollars for your annual subscription the bottom line is that a good stock newsletter should pay for itself think about how much of your hard earned money you are responsible for investing if the difference between a good newsletter and a great newsletter is an additional 5 return a 10 smaller reduction or a 2 higher dividend yield what would that mean for your financial future savvy investors who understand the power of compounding know that a small return advantage can lead to huge returns in the long run in terms of a newsletter cost you should ask yourself in the long run would that added bonus cover the cost of the newsletter subscription and something else if by choosing a top newsletter you could achieve an additional 5 return per year over the next decade or a 10 lower reduction when a bear market hits during your retirement or a 2 higher dividend yield every year for the next decade should you go for it for most investors the answer is a definite yes planning your financial future is not the place to be cheap is it really worth saving a few bucks on a cheaper newsletter subscription if it means missing out on a newsletter that could have helped you achieve your financial goals whether you are saving time learning new investment techniques or just wanting to make money do not hesitate to pay for the right newsletter for you when it comes to managing your financial future the best is worth paying for educational newsletters teach you a new set of investing skills how to hone your investing strategy

investment needs if you are focusing long term look for the newsletters that offer you related information one of the biggest risks of following an investment newsletter is expecting it to do something it is not meant to do like any tool if applied incorrectly it may not work or worse it can cause harm when it comes to investment newsletters there are actually many different types and many good reasons to sign up leaving aside for the moment the type of security that they follow e g stocks mutual funds options etc there are huge differences between strategies and formats due diligence is the investigation of a potential investment or product to confirm all the facts these facts can include items such as the review of all financial records the past performance of the company in addition to anything else that is deemed material individual investors can implement due diligence on a potential equity investment at will but it is always recommended a number of variables must be contemplated when conducting due diligence on a stock including company capitalization revenue valuations competitors management and risks if you hear tales of high returns without any risk except in exceptional cases that are very difficult to find be suspicious if an investment seems too good to be true it probably will be on the other hand having a certain capacity to overcome risk is important since it is impossible to have profitability without assuming some volatility being able to overcome the suffering caused by the volatility of the markets can be considered a necessary superpower to be able to have the option of obtaining a return on your money the key is to choose the right time and day to invest unlike traditional investing trading has a short term focus the trader buys a stock that he should not hold for gradual appreciation but for rapid change often within a predetermined period of time a few days a week a month or a quarter and of course daily trading as the name implies has the shortest time frame analysis can be divided into days hours and even minutes and the time of day a trade takes place can be a factor important to consider best day of the week to buy stock monday it s called the monday effect for decades the stock market has had a tendency to fall on mondays on average some studies as in glenn n pettengill s a survey of the monday effect literature in the quarterly journal of business and economics 2003 have attributed this to a host of bad news often released over the weekend others point to the bleak mood of investors having to return to work which is especially evident during the early hours of trading on monday best day of the week to sell stocks friday if monday is the best day of the week to buy stocks it follows that friday is the best day to sell stocks before prices drop on monday if you are interested in short selling then friday is the best day to take a short position because stocks tend to be priced higher on friday and monday is the best day of the week to cover your short in the u s fridays leading up to three day weekends are especially good due to the general good feeling stock markets tend to rise before the observed holidays or vacations to decide whether a newsletter is performing worth it you must first ask yourself what you expect to get out of your subscription do you expect to get annual returns that exceed the market or reductions in drawdowns during bear markets or high income sustained by dividends whatever your goal is you ll want to find a newsletter that regularly tracks and reports your performance in that specific area in other words a newsletter focused on dividends should talk a lot about how good they are at earning dividends besides offering you investment advice financial news and a peep into financial markets investors generally look for returns that outperform the market in that case you would be looking for consistently strong historical returns that outperform the appropriate benchmark context matters and it is up to the newsletter to discuss your earnings in a complete and transparent context most investment newsletters work by offering free content or a paid subscription or both once you choose the right one for your investment purposes you can sign up and access all the content in the shape of reports articles analyses and other specific features if you are serious about investment newsletters do your research and pick the one that you feel is right for you the first thing to do is selecting the right newsletter according to your needs for this you must analyze whether you are focused on long term investments fidelity investments and so on the best financial newsletter will be the one that is tailored to your needs and aspirations as an investor as well as your level of knowledge for starters newsletters with educational content are the way to go also if you do not own any stocks at the moment you could start with broad index funds before plunging into individual stocks in all fairness choosing the best investment newsletter comes down to focusing on your investment goals and using common sense this will help you discard the ones that maybe will not meet your needs it is important to remember that each investment newsletter is basically a financial publication that anyone can subscribe to for investing and educational purposes there are many different reasons to sign up for an investment newsletter and there are many different options to choose from and since some are free while others require paid subscriptions it is important to keep in mind that the best investment newsletters should pay for themselves also when it comes to managing a portfolio for consistent long term earnings the model portfolio newsletter is the best because it offers high returns and is easy to replicate once you have carefully narrowed down your potential newsletter subscriptions to a few top options you can also subscribe to all of them for a period of time think of it as taking each one for a test drive

monday it s called the monday effect for decades the stock market has had a tendency to fall on mondays on average some studies as in glenn n pettengill s a survey of the monday effect literature in

which is especially evident during the early hours of trading on monday best day of the week to sell stocks friday if monday is the best day of the week to buy stocks it follows that friday is the best day to sell stocks before prices drop on monday if you are interested in short selling then friday is the best day to take a short position because stocks tend to be priced higher on friday and

financial publication that anyone can subscribe to for educational purposes according to securities lawyer 101 there are different kinds of investment newsletters some address general securities topics explaining the qualities of different types of stocks bonds or funds and suggesting why they might be attractive on the other hand some can also offer analysis of specific securities and dish out recommendations but be careful before starting your investment portfolio based on newsletters whatever the type some investing newsletters are legitimate but many are created by investor relations firms to deceive investors into purchasing securities at inflated prices particularly in the penny stock markets investing newsletters offer you key stocks information and are a space for general market discussion some of them report on the market and the economy in general covering trends forecasts analysis and the editor s expert opinion they generally do not recommend specific stocks to invest in instead they are more similar to a normal stock market column in a traditional magazine or newspaper on the other hand investment grades newsletters provide grades scores or rankings for a long list of investments they are sometimes found in mutual fund bulletins but they can also be applied to stocks model portfolio newsletters publish model portfolios that subscribers can choose to

final thoughts showwhat s an option options are contracts that give the bearer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell underlying assets at a predetermined price before the expiration date of the options contract therefore unlike futures options traders do not have to exercise their right to buy or sell if they do not wish to and they must come up with their own options trading strategies pros of trading options leverage according to merrill edge options can provide leverage as option buyers can pay a relatively small premium for market exposure in relation to the contract value usually 100 shares of the underlying stock investors can obtain considerable gains from comparatively minor favorable percentage moves in the underlying product the bank of america company says additional income trading options is certainly an exciting alternative to those looking for additional income but do not have the time or flexibility to start studying the forex market options trading is about just assuming or predicting if an asset currencies or commodities is rising or falling or if the asset s price will be above or below a specific price at a certain time in the future customized risk profiles according to benzinga trading options allow you to modify your risk profile when trading to adapt to a specific market view for example if apple s stock price rises to 140 by its december expiration date then you will have made 20 less the 7 premium you paid or 13 times 100 shares for a net profit of 1 300 on the option or 2 200 had you purchased the stock otherwise should the stock hit 110 then you will just lose the 700 you initially paid for the option while you would have lost 800 had you instead purchased 100 shares of the stock itself cons of trading options no dividends to receive dividends in options trading you need to exercise the stock and be holding it on the stock s date of record which is generally several weeks before the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date benzinga says expiration all options have an expiration date after which they cease to exist and have no value options can be freely bought and sold until the close of the session on the expiration date this is one of the fundamental differences between buying an option and buying the underlying asset complexity options have specific characteristics that make them complex the main one is their price is strongly influenced by the expiration date the underlying price and the implied volatility if you think you can master it and outsmart the market you are likely to have a rude awakening quickly but through education and experience you can make sense of the complexity and learn to trade options with confidence stocks vs options stocks the good shares can be sold quickly and easily in the capital market at a fair price which is called liquidity also each share title offers investors a combination of expected profitability and risk associated with the economic sector in which the company s activities take place and with the characteristics of the company the future profitability of a share is uncertain therefore the decision to buy or sell stock is based on the expected return also investors can create an investment portfolio with different stocks in such a way as to compensate for the volatilities of one another adequate diversification is not only achieved by choosing different shares of the same risk class but also several shares of different risk classes the bad the main risks are linked to the uncertainty about returns since return is never predictable the behavior of the stock in the past does not guarantee its future evolution so the evolution of a share depends in addition to the company itself on external factors such as the economic situation the evolution of markets interest rates inflation and other variables neither do they have a maturity period so the investment can only be disposed of by selling the shares options the good it is possible to start trading with very small capital most brokers that offer options require a very low minimum deposit therefore it becomes an excellent way to enter this world of trading for those who prefer to risk just a little money they also allow for trading several instruments with different underlying assets markets such as stocks commodities currencies and cryptocurrencies can be targeted and some brokers offer more than 100 contracts with different underlying assets options can also offer big and fast profits between 70 and 90 opening operations that can close in a matter of minutes the bad many options brokers do not follow regulations also although options are very accessible for small investors many brokers limit the amount of money to trade restricting operations of several thousand dollars another disadvantage is that unlike brokers that offer forex options brokers generally limit demo accounts there is also lots of biased information and scammers many gurus lead people to believe that it is a quick way to generate money even the same traders seeing that they can trade in this market easily think that they also have everything to be profitable in a matter of minutes how are options different from stocks dividends according to benzinga when trading options you do not receive any dividends paid out to holders of the underlying stock when you hold a call option on a stock people can receive the dividend when they exercise the stock and hold on to it on the stock s date of record regarding stock the dividend is a distribution of benefits through which a public limited company distributes to shares released from the issue itself or shares of public limited companies owned by the company own part of a company unlike options trading with stock you own a part of the company each investor in a company owns a certain number of shares so they will own the percentage that these titles represent of the company the value of all shares in the company is its market capitalization buy and hold in stock buy and hold b h is a long term investment strategy based on buying shares in stable companies that pay dividends and holding on to them indefinitely of course on specific occasions shares will be sold such as in the event of an irreparable deterioration of the company why investors trade options income potential do not follow regulations says that options allow for potential profit during both volatile times and when the market is quiet or less volatile this is possible because the prices of assets like stocks currencies and commodities are always moving and no matter what the market conditions are there is an options strategy that can take advantage of it cost efficiency investors can obtain an option position similar to a stock position but at huge cost savings for example to purchase 200 shares of an 80 stock an investor must pay out 16 000 however benzinga says if the investor were to purchase two 20 calls with each contract representing 100 shares the total outlay would be only 4 000 2 contracts x 100 shares contract x 20 market price the investor would then have an additional 12 000 to use whichever way they see still the person must pick the right call to purchase wto mimic the stock position properly however this strategy known as stock replacement is not only viable but also practical and cost efficient according to benzinga different option types calls and puts example of a call option call options is a very important concept when it comes to options trading an investor has a call option on t mobile us inc nasdaq tmus s shares with an exercise price of 20 expiring on march 25 the price of this option is 1 and each contract represents 100 t mobile us shares the investor with a call option must pay 100 1 per share x 100 shares that each contract represents and in return will have the right not the obligation to buy the 100 shares at 20 until march 25 regardless of the company share price in the market if by march 25 the t mobile us shares are trading below 20 for example at 19 50 the buyer will not be interested in exercising the call since they are able to buy them at 19 50 in the market example of a put option a put option on t mobile us shares has an exercise price of 20 expiring on march 25 the price of this option is 1 and each contract represents 100 company shares the investor who buys this option must pay 100 1 per share x 100 shares that each contract represents and in return will have the right not the obligation to sell 100 company shares at 20 until march 25 regardless of the price in the market if by march 25 the t mobile us shares are trading above 20 for example at 20 50 the buyer of the put will not be interested in exercising it since they will be able to sell those 100 company shares at 20 50 in the market options terms to learn derivatives the financial derivative originates from the underlying asset the underlying asset can be financial for example a stock or bond or non financial like the financial future on gold or oil premiums according to investopedia a premium is the price of a bond or other security above its issuance price or intrinsic value a bond might trade at a premium because its interest rate is higher than the current market interest rates spreads in general terms spreads are the difference between the bid

by martin armstrong with all the conspiracy theories that somehow the bankers are the real culprits in creating excess money supply there has been an evolution in central banks that has finally crossed the line since 2019 the federal reserve was once upon a time responsible the fed was originally designed as an authority to create money which was an elastic money supply that made perfect sense when the fed was designed in 1913 yes the bankers owned the shares because the fed was actually designed to do what jp morgan did in herding the bankers together to save the day during the panic of 1907 morgan convinced the bankers that if they did not chip in money to bail out the troubled banks panic would unfold and all the banks would be hit as a contagion they listened and joined his effort to stem the panic of 1907 the design of the fed was to recreate what jp morgan put together the shareholders were the bankers because it was a bail out fund for the bankers and taxpayer money should not be used to bail out the bankers democrat president woodrow wilson signed the 1913 act creating the federal reserve as well as the income tax wilson signed the revenue act of 1913 which lowered average tariff rates from 40 percent to 26 percent it also established a one percent tax on income above 3 000 per year the tax affected approximately three percent of the population the federal reserve as designed was independent and thus there was the fed policy v fiscal policy set by congress the elastic money was a brilliant idea where the fed would buy in corporate paper to provide lending of the last resort when the bankers could not lend due to the hoarding of cash in a crisis the corporate paper was typically 90 days when world war i came congress ordered the fed to buy its paper because they would need to issue a lot of debt they never returned the fed to its original design to stimulate the economy by directly purchasing corporate paper to prevent companies from laying off employees therefore the structural alteration of the federal reserve for world war i transformed the theory of quantitative easing into an indirect stimulus rather than direct when the fed bought only corporate paper it directly stimulated the economy when it was instructed only to buy only government paper which the government never pays off any idea of the stimulus was wiped out for at best it became indirect then roosevelt came and he wanted to control everything he seized the federal reserve and took the power of all the branches and consolidated it into washington section 203 of the banking act of 1935 changed the name of the federal reserve board to the board of governors of the federal reserve system roosevelt s banking act of 1935 also made major structural changes increasing the number of members of the board appointed by the president from six to seven to ensure he now controlled the fed he created for himself the authority to designate one of the persons appointed as chairman of the board and one as vice chairman of the board each to serve in such role for a term of four years we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us as i have explained in manipulating the world economy there was a huge confrontation between the federal reserve and the white house the fed was directed during world war ii to maintain par on us government bonds to fund the war the fed was ordered to engage in what we call quantitative easing then the korean war came and the fed rebelled they refused to continue to engage in quantitative easing the fed asserted its original independence over politics politics began to creep back in during the financial crisis of 1998 the federal reserve then stepped in to bail out long term capital management in 1998 a failed hedge fund because if it did not it would have taken down goldman sachs so instead of allowing that the fed bailed out the hedge fund when they really had no authority to do so that abuse of power led the fed to then support the bankers who were engaged in manipulating markets to create guaranteed trades the bankers warned if they failed then the government would be broke for it was the bankers who bought the new debt and resold it then the financial crisis of 2007 2009 took place when the bankers got aig to guarantee their dodgy mortgage backed securities when that all collapsed the federal reserve again bailed out aig an insurance company that was operating from london instead of the us banks they claimed they did not have the authority to bail out bear stearns and lehman brothers which were competitors of goldman sachs and investment banks but they apparently had the authority to bail out an insurance company in london which again saved goldman sachs i believe they deliberately let two of the 5 investment banks fail to help goldman sachs rise to the top now the automated clearinghouse ach system is changing to allow direct deposits from non banks i e big tech in repayment for censorship on december 23 2019 the board approved modifications to the federal reserve banks national settlement service and fedwire funds service to support enhancements to the same day ach service preparing for digital currencies on september 25 2020 the board amended the implementation date for certain modifications they are preparing for a digital currency but this means two things by this fed expansion they are planning for the long term for the elimination of public debt in which case there will no longer be primary dealer banks and hence no need to bail out the banks when they blow up on trading assuming they will still be allowed to trade in the future once the fed moves to create its own digital currency it is no longer the independent entity it was once supposed to be welcome to the new 21st century of a hybrid central bank end of primary dealers and the elimination of government debt all for your security so you do not revolt when the government system collapses

in recent years the increase of remote work as a result of covid 19 has played a key role since then cities such as austin or the el paso juárez conurbation have exacerbated the trend in addition to lower tax and regulatory pressure the border region competes against silicon valley with a variable increasingly cited by employers in technology companies infinitely more affordable costs of living
