this june valencia vee gunder s organization the smile trust organized its first hurricane preparedness event gunder and her staff prepared 200 kits full of supplies like water battery operated fans and first aid kits they planned to give these away to neighboring families of its miami headquarters we ran out of supplies gunder laughed people were asking when are you all going to come back people generally know the list of things they re supposed to have stocked up for a storm gunder explained but for low income people and people in marginalized communities getting those supplies is sometimes an unreachable goal she is just one of many in florida who are working to make hurricane preparedness more inclusive to all regardless of cost or accessibility for gunder she considers much of the traditional hurricane preparedness advice floridians hear every year to be outdated she feels it is too inaccessible for people without money to spare or transportation to find those goods go get food for this many people for this many days that s easy to say when you have a grocery store in all the proper places gunder said so when someone offers a list of supplies you need to prepare it also needs to go through a lens of class access and mobility if i m already paycheck to paycheck if i already don t have access to a grocery store if i already don t have access to move around what do you think i am able to do if a storm is on its way she asks she worries every year for those who will inevitably be caught without crucial supplies after a storm south florida is playing hurricane roulette she said and we will be caught slipping i can only imagine the amount of harm that will come the national survey from the federal alliance for safe homes flash found that americans are looking for ways to prepare on a reduced budget nearly 30 of respondents reported being willing to spend 50 dollars or less on hurricane preparedness that s double the number from 2021 around 57 report they plan to prepare for this hurricane season down from 80 who responded in 2021 only 47 plan to strengthen their home before a storm which is down from 65 in 2021 the flash survey concludes that this change may reflect tightening family budgets it s evident preparing for a storm that may or may not come has become a lesser priority for many americans david peaton wants emergency managers to catch up to the times peaton is the assistant director of emergency management for alachua county i think we have been talking about hurricane preparation to the public in the same way for so long for decades we have been giving people the same message and we need to understand that not everyone absorbs the information in the way they used to because they don t have the same amount of resources he said so that s the problem we keep continuing the same message and yet disasters are getting larger in scale peaton wants people to focus on what he calls common sense prep which are simple low cost alternatives to the typical bulk purchase of hurricane supplies before a storm hits for example instead of buying bottled water he suggests saving soda and juice bottles filling them up with tap water and storing them well before the threat of a storm arrives he also advocates for rotating extra food in and out of your pantry instead of spending a large amount of money to buy a seven day supply of food you may or may not touch this year he said to buy a little extra with each grocery trip use it and then replenish it over time peaton also said that keeping your yard free of debris and other large objects that can come loose is a zero cost way of reducing the chance of damage to your home during a storm peaton is particularly concerned for those without the resources to evacuate for many filling up their gas tank finding a hotel and so on is a cost they can put on their credit card and move on from but for a lot of people they just don t have a way to pay for this this makes personal preparedness even more important if they won t be able to avoid the storm we want personal safety to be something regardless of income and regardless of financial needs he said peaton also emphasizes the importance of food banks and other local aid during a hurricane scenario they often help fill in the gaps when people cannot make their own food purchases before or after a hurricane our food banks don t get enough credit he said robin safley is the executive director of feeding florida an association of 12 food banks that serve all 67 counties in florida the organization works with smaller local partners to distribute the food feeding florida plays a large role before and after a hurricane and works closely with the florida division of emergency management in blue skies we distribute six million pounds of food on a weekly basis we have the capability to respond to a natural disaster by ramping up to 300 in a short time safely said like peaton safley said the main concern is for those who cannot safely evacuate those who have the wherewithal are the ones who can vacate safley said so we know the population we serve is those who have to stay in place though anyone can access benefits from feeding florida most of the people they serve work paycheck to paycheck safley said they focus on handing out shelf stable foods that don t require cooking before a storm so people can stock up in the immediate aftermath they distribute mres or meals ready to eat we want to stabilize the family once they get back into their area we come in with that food so they are not searching on a daily basis she said the family who cannot afford to leave has a longer haul to get to where they were before the storm but safley wants floridians to know they are not alone there will be food you should do a lot to prepare but if you find yourself in need we will be there on the other side of the storm though large organizations like feeding florida can effectively serve a huge amount of people after a hurricane smaller scale operations practicing community based hurricane preparedness can make a significant impact too when hurricane irma was on its way to florida in 2017 gunder was looking for a way to bring aid to her own community in miami she had been doing climate advocacy for many years but realized we needed more than just advocacy we needed an alternative for our communities to respond after a storm it started out of her house just a small operation but within four or five days gunder said the smile trust collaborated with 10 organizations in 18 communities ultimately serving around 23 000 families this kind of grassroots effort evolved into the community emergency operations center or the ceoc the ceoc is a model of community based hurricane response gunder has taken the model and trained other organizers on how to become first responders in a storm event for example gunder uses wellness checks in a natural disaster in which organizers call local residents and ask for what supplies they need and then contact the organizations on the ground to deliver those supplies for gunder the most effective way to help is to just get people what they need the best way is to bridge the gap she said a combination of government and grassroots aid may be the answer to that gap in hurricane preparedness nkosi muse is a third year ph d student at the university of miami studying climate hazards especially for vulnerable communities he also sits on the climate resilience committee for the city of miami he says community based action such as sharing supplies information and hurricane education can make a more immediate impact than something on the municipal level it has to go through being passed has to be written into city code the mayor has to sign off on it it has to be recognized in a community it doesn t have to be recognized this is something that can happen amongst individuals informally muse said having people like that in your corner that you can reach out to are so important because they will never turn you down however he also emphasized the need to put pressure on local governments and continue to push for better resources for those in need keeping our foot on the gas making sure we are being heard eventually it will make a change nkosi said this is even more important regarding the climate in the long term climate change and hurricane preparedness now go hand in hand because these storms are getting stronger ultimately both emergency managers and community organizers want people to feel empowered by information before a storm arrives once you can get stocked up make a plan peaton said knowing who to contact before and after a disaster for aid and getting signed up for alerts from your local emergency management are critical steps the number one thing you can do is get educated before a disaster hits peaton said that won t cost you a dime

along scenic routt county road 80 wildflowers are in bloom and sheepherder wagons stand in fields in contrast significant amounts of bagged trash and discarded camping equipment are piled up alongside the roads in adams park a result of the 50th anniversary rainbow gathering about 25 miles north of hayden multiple attendees called the gathering beautiful and amazing however many rainbows said the hype of the gathering attracted a significant percentage of a young festival goers who did not pack out everything they packed in approximately 100 campers remained on site friday july 15 at the gathering that brought a peak of about 10 000 people and at least 2 000 vehicles this is about the ugliest part of the clean out said gathering attendee scott parker all of the trash it s out of the woods volunteers hauled out abandoned tents buckets tarps camp chairs collapsible wagons sleeping bags shoes clothes small fuel canisters coolers a guitar and a bike that was locked to a tree i would definitely put in the paper to pack it in pack it out so that hippies don t have to do it for you said butterfly using her rainbow name it s not a festival it s a gathering the 50 inch wide multi use trail 1144 in adams park is indicated for foot horse motorcycle and atv traffic wear on the trail now includes more vehicle ruts suzie romig steamboat pilot today it s the festival kids with a lack of awareness said oats also his rainbow name he said real rainbow family attendees follow the guidelines of peace love freedom and respect butterfly oats and other campers were part of one of two groups remaining along adams park trail 1144 the stock pot camp about one mile from the south trailhead included an estimated 24 people who were working on cleanup and rehabilitation efforts the 50 inch wide multi use trail provides foot horse motorcycle and atv access to the bears ears system of trails the trail showed obvious signs of increased wear including tire ruts compared to mid june u s forest service district ranger michael woodbridge walked the perimeter of the gathering with colleagues on friday and met with rainbows some of whom pledged to stay up to one month if necessary to clean up get the area s top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning sign up here steamboatpilot com newsletter woodbridge said he was full of mixed emotions after the electronic mapping of a spiderweb of social trails and campsites he said staff left location flags for rainbows that noted no work meaning cleanup was sufficient and flags marked needs repair woodbridge said the damage ranged from soil compaction that inhibits plant regrowth to holes dug to compost leftover food that were not covered with soil and canine waste left in the forest from hundreds of dogs i m glad to see there s a lot less people living in the woods here and a lot of trash and structures removed woodbridge said i m concerned how long it s going to take it s hard for everything to get found and restored in an overall footprint of approximately 1 300 acres woodbridge said the estimated expenditure for this year s gathering stands at 700 000 including the forest service s national incident management team and local costs he said forest service resource specialists will continue to visit the site to help direct rainbows in fulfilling responsibilities outlined in a 10 page resource protection plan nothing is made for 10 000 people on a national forest woodbridge said it s created a lot of work for us even if all 10 000 people were super conscientious you can t come out here to an undeveloped area with 10 000 people and not leave an impact of some kind district ranger michael woodbridge the district ranger said forest service officials are counting on rainbows to remove all remaining trash and debris and are not planning to bring in any more dumpsters the agency paid for two industrial sized dumpsters that were filled by july 7 woodbridge made that decision because he was concerned about the amount of trash accumulating in the various camps that might attract and habituate wildlife and because of past reports that rainbows deposited excessive trash in nearby towns some rainbows said they will take as much trash as possible as they leave some planning to transport it 100 miles before dumping other rainbows said trash was being hauled out on a trailer and a small rental moving truck to be taken to a landfill piles of trash remain that were carried out of the woods at the north trailhead for adams park 1144 after the rainbow gathering in northern routt county suzie romig steamboat pilot today justin from connecticut who rode his bike to attend his third gathering was the last person at the handicamp for older or disabled rainbows as he pulled a mosquito net over his head to protect against the many bugs he was surrounded by the trash various supplies and food left by others i think it s a really beautiful event i was hoping to find a girlfriend here i got 10 rejections justin said with a smile resting after working to aerate soil in the main meadow with a pickaxe justin said he loves that the gathering is open to everyone but unfortunately not all of those attendees follow leave no trace ethics anybody can come here and not everybody has that ethos he said

ba 5 is now the dominant covid 19 subvariant in the united states here s why it s capable of causing more reinfections according to experts example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video throughout the covid 19 pandemic new variants and subvariants have emerged as the virus continues to mutate president joe biden s administration said on july 12 that omicron subvariants ba 4 and ba 5 make up 80 of covid 19 cases in the nation with ba 5 accounting for a majority of cases as awareness of ba 5 spreads some people on social media are claiming that the subvariant is more likely to reinfect those who have already had covid 19 after successfully avoiding covid for 2 5 years my husband tested positive for covid 3 weeks ago cleared the infection and then tested positive again yesterday 3 weeks ba5 immune evasion is no joke one person wrote on twitter the question is the ba 5 omicron subvariant of covid 19 more likely than previous subvariants to reinfect people the sources the answer yes the ba 5 omicron subvariant of covid 19 is more likely than previous subvariants to reinfect people what we found the omicron variant surfaced at the end of 2021 leading to a wave of new covid 19 infections since then health experts have identified multiple subvariants of omicron including ba 5 though data suggest that omicron generally causes less severe illness than prior variants it spreads more easily and often evades immune response among people who have been previously infected or vaccinated against covid 19 ba 5 is the most contagious variant or subvariant of covid 19 we ve seen so far world health organization who covid 19 technical lead maria van kherkove said during a recent press briefing a recent study looked into the effectiveness of a prior covid 19 infection in preventing a new infection from the virus a spokesperson for the who said the study showed that prior to omicron those who had recovered from a covid 19 infection had 90 immune protection from reinfection when omicron subvariants ba 1 and ba 2 became dominant the immune protection from a prior infection dropped to an estimated 50 according to the who now a prior infection only gives a person an estimated 40 immune protection from the ba 4 and ba 5 and ba 5 subvariants ba 5 made up an estimated 65 of covid 19 cases in the u s from july 3 9 compared to about 16 of cases attributed to the ba 4 subvariant according to data from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the ba 5 subvariant is immune evading meaning people with prior infection or vaccination are likely still at risk for ba 4 or ba 5 cdc director rochelle walensky said during a white house covid 19 response team briefing on july 12 mutations in both the ba 4 and ba 5 subvariants appear to help them escape immunity from both vaccination and prior infection sheldon campbell a professor of laboratory medicine at yale school of medicine said joseph fauver an assistant professor in the epidemiology department at the university of nebraska s college of public health told verify that the ba 5 subvariant is absolutely capable of causing reinfections and has already done so researchers with the beth israel deaconess medical center a teaching hospital of harvard medical school also evaluated antibody responses to multiple omicron subvariants in 27 people who received their primary covid 19 vaccine series and booster shot and 27 people who had previously contracted covid 19 their research was published in a letter to the new england journal of medicine on june 22 2022 they found that antibody responses to ba 4 and ba 5 were approximately three times lower than to the omicron subvariants ba 1 and ba 2 meaning ba 4 and ba 5 are substantially more likely to evade immunity from either a vaccine or prior infection there is no evidence right now to suggest that ba 4 or ba 5 cause more severe disease compared to other omicron subvariants according to public health leaders and experts who spoke with verify
nashville tenn wtvf tennessee democrats have three choices on the ballot to pick from to face gov bill lee in the november general lee doesn t face an opponent in the primary newschannel 5 asked each candidate the same questions about their campaigns and platforms here s what each had to say these answers haven t been edited in any way dr jason martin what made you want to jump into the governor s race as a physician with experience in public health working at nashville general hospital one of our great safety net hospitals in middle tennessee i saw how a lack of access to adequate healthcare was detrimental to people s lives and how in some cases it cost people their lives i know we can do better to take care of one another than our current governor and during the covid pandemic while we were able to help so many people survive our team lost over 400 patients in sumner county and i know we could have done better for many of those patients if governor lee had clearly spoken the truth and been a leader i know that the lack of leadership is not just related to covid it s prevalent across the enterprise in state government and it s the reason we underfund our schools lock people up for small cannabis offenses neglected economic growth in rural tennessee and not expanded medicaid what makes you qualified to take on this position first and foremost i have a heart for service i ve been a public servant in tennessee for 20 years in the healthcare profession and i want to take my role as a healer as a consensus builder to state government in the course of my job in the icu i deal with high stakes problems with literal life and death consequences every day i want to bring the same steady calm collaborative approach that i use in the hospital to state government where we need strong consistent principled leadership don t be fooled some people will tell you that you have to be a lawyer or a career politician before stepping into the governor s office gov lee was a failure not because he wasn t a career politician but because he is more interested in chasing national political ambitions and towing the party line than he is taking care of the hard working people of tennessee you have three elements you could change about tennessee what would they be i think the team sport mentality to politics is bad for tennessee and bad for our country we need to turn down the volume focus on what we have in common and work together to succeed we must expand medicaid medicaid expansion not only is the right thing to do to take care of our brothers and sisters here in tennessee it s the right thing to do economically not expanding medicaid has contributed to being 1 in the nation in hospital closures per capita and number on in the nation in medical bankruptcies per capita we are breaking our families with medical debt with medicaid expansion we could decrease the uninsured in tennessee by 50 which would support greater access to healthcare particularly in rural tennessee better access to healthcare would support economic growth we need to legalize cannabis for medical and recreational use we could use the hundreds of millions of dollars of tax revenue from this regulated market to support causes like education healthcare and infrastructure we should stop locking up primarily black and brown tennesseans for small cannabis drug offenses and use those law enforcement resources more appropriately we should give our farmers a new crop to save the family farm we should have access to cannabis for medical purposes for cancer patients and chronic pain patients states with legalized cannabis have fewer opioid deaths too what is the biggest challenge you think tennesseans face and how would you change it the biggest challenge we all face is finding a way to come together for a common purpose i believe after visiting every corner of the state that we have so much more that unites us than that which divides us we need to focus on these issues like education healthcare access broadband infrastructure and thrive together some politicians see political points in dividing us up into regions west middle or east races or political affiliations we need to reject the politics of division and work together for a stronger tennessee this state is primarily entrenched in republican politics how do you think you could sway voters to consider you for the position of governor while running against an incumbent governor lee s fend for yourself approach has been a failure he s abandoned teachers healthcare workers women workers his lack of leadership has hurt so many people are hungry for a leader who is focused on their needs rather than personal political ambitions or washington d c talking points j b smiley jr what made you want to jump into the governor s race tennessee is going in the wrong direction in almost every major statistical category tennessee has the highest bankruptcy rate in the country 3rd highest violent crime rate and the 4th lowest median income but it does not have to be that way i am running for governor because i understand the issues tennesseans face firsthand as i currently live in close proximity with them in addition to understanding the plight of working families i have experience in government and a legal background which sets me apart but it is my passion to put people in a better position that has served as the driving force for seeking office i believe that when we rally around common beliefs we can build a tennessee to be proud of together what makes you qualified to take on this position we have already seen what it is like when someone with no government experience tells us they are going to fix our government it was a disaster with former president trump it is a disaster with gov bill lee i have government experience both as a current member of the memphis city council and as a former policy advisor in the shelby county government additionally i have a legal background which is extremely useful when you are advocating for laws and pushing back against harmful and unconstitutional ones equally important to the fact that i am the only candidate with relevant work experience my lived experience sets me apart as well tennesseans deserve a governor just like them i come from a working class family and i am currently a part of the working class tennesseans deserve a governor that is in close proximity to the problems that working class people face not someone who has to pick up a book or hire someone and ask them what they believe to be the problem you have three elements you could change about tennessee what would they be if you visit our website votejbsmiley com you will see several issues it is hard to narrow it down to just three when most of the issues we face in tennessee are urgent and pressing be that as it may i would say the top three priorities that come to mind are education healthcare and women s rights education children who learn more earn more as adults as tennessee s next governor we will work to strengthen and fully fund our public education system this includes investing in pre k expansion vocational training wraparound services to help parents and working to eliminate barriers to accessing quality childcare and education across the state we will focus on the whole child physical mental and emotional well being as part of my plan we will fight to increase teacher pay and per pupil funding so educators and school districts can focus on delivering high quality instruction instead of making ends meet children who learn more earn more as adults as tennessee s next governor we will work to strengthen and fully fund our public education system this includes investing in pre k expansion vocational training wraparound services to help parents and working to eliminate barriers to accessing quality childcare and education across the state we will focus on the whole child physical mental and emotional well being as part of my plan we will fight to increase teacher pay and per pupil funding so educators and school districts can focus on delivering high quality instruction instead of making ends meet healthcare tennessee deserves a governor who is about us as governor i will advocate for affordable and accessible health care while also addressing disparities which will lead to better health outcomes for everyone who calls tennessee home at the core of my healthcare plan is my belief in a holistic approach to addressing healthcare the major elements are medicaid expansion improving access to care addressing dietary needs and expanding mental health resources tennessee deserves a governor who is about us as governor i will advocate for affordable and accessible health care while also addressing disparities which will lead to better health outcomes for everyone who calls tennessee home at the core of my healthcare plan is my belief in a holistic approach to addressing healthcare the major elements are medicaid expansion improving access to care addressing dietary needs and expanding mental health resources women s rights as governor i will fight to protect a woman s right to choose and laws that establish bodily autonomy and work to eliminate pay inequality in tennessee the smiley administration will stand against any law or policy that serves as an attack on women we can drastically improve the quality of life for every woman in tennessee by respecting a woman s right to choose decreasing maternal mortality rate and eliminating the wage gap disparity what is the biggest challenge you think tennesseans face and how would you change it tennessee currently has the fourth lowest median income in the country approximately one million people in our state live in food deserts we have the number one bankruptcy rate in the country in light of these staggering statistics it is abundantly clear that the number one challenge tennesseans face is the lack of resources and or poverty the simplest way to address this problem is by establishing a living wage promote economic opportunities and invest in workforce development carnita atwater what made you want to jump into the governor s race first and foremost i was motivated to enter into this gubernatorial race for various reasons 1 to place tennesseans back into politics 2 to bring back transparency and instill hope of our democracy in our beloved citizens again 3 to address the political and judicial corruption that have caused genocide on our people thus having the opportunity to perform a forensic investigation all financial dealing upon my successful election 4 to circumvent abusive tax incentives going to large corporations while every citizens are struggling to make ends meet 5 to make sure all citizens have an opportunity to have a seat at the table of prosperity regardless of race creed nationality religion gender identity disability social status or zip code 6 to assure that all citizens receive the promise of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness i am the people s governor what makes you qualified to take on this position first my extensive record speaks for itself i am the only gubernatorial candidate that received the prestigious award from governor bill lee for being the outstanding leader for all citizens in the state of tennessee on june 30 2020 during a pandemic i qualify for this position because i have the will of the people in the center of my gubernatorial aspiration i am the epitome of what is needed to be the voice of the people and bring true democracy back to our governmental process i am qualified because i am a life long servant leader of the people with the right temperament life experience and credentials to move the state of tennessee to a more inclusive and diverse state for a healthy and thriving environment for all tennesseans and not just the rich i have extensive working knowledge of governmental procedures a vast history of working with governmental agencies and i have been responsible for overseeing copious billion dollar budgets and personnel my innovative holistic approach to this political position would transcend all barriers that our beloved citizens may be experiencing to achieve greatness in our volunteer state every citizen will be at the table of opportunity in my administration i would be a governor who view our economic social inequities and racial disparities with a new humanistic lens of equity and fairness for all i would indeed be the boots on the ground governor with an in sensitivity to the needs of the people by listening to their concerns and being accessible as their people s governor you have three elements you could change about tennessee what would they be to place we the people back into our governmental process thus giving all citizens a voice in our democracy our constitution states we the people not we the politicians addressing systemic racism head on to promote a more inclusive and diverse canvas of unity and prosperity as the next governor i would rescind all discriminatory laws as it relates to criminalizing homeless individuals attacking women s reproductive health care truth in sentencing lgbtq inequities and the right to work atrocities that keep citizens living in poverty and assure that they will never be part of our great state of prosperity for all the employment system we have today is a modern day sharecropper s system which penalized the poor and sustain the rich as the next potential governor i would employ the bottom up scale of economic justice because trickling down is not working for the working poor i would revisit tax incentives to the large corporations because it has not benefited the everyday taxpayers especially the underserved and marginalized communities across the state of tennessee every large corporation that receives tax incentives pilot in lieu of taxes government bonds or any other economic benefit should incorporate a community benefit agreement to assure that a fair portion of the jobs are set aside for the undeserved and marginalized communities as the next potential incoming governor i will be committed to addressing tax incentives for the farmers small businesses and minority contractors to bring economic balance in our beloved state i am absolutely against tax incentives which to me is a form of capitalism and backdoor shenanigan to pad rich people s pockets until tax incentives are equitable to every taxpayer they should be discontinued until more accountability and foresight are placed on the community benefits of these incentivized strategies study after study shows that tax incentives do not pay off in real economic gains and often fail to produce the jobs that were promised therefore who does it benefit when managed correctly however they can build on local strengths tif plans and pilot payment in lieu of tax have not served the underserved and marginalized black brown and poor white communities well therefore taxpayers have not received their account receivables what is the biggest challenge you think tennesseans face and how would you change it the biggest challenge tennesseans face is political and judicial corruption until this aspect of tennessee is addressed we will not be able to address systemic racism budget is a moral document taxation without representation poverty homelessness economic disparities health care inequities school inequalities attacks on women s rights housing disparities livable wages inadequate rural economic development farmers neglect and accessibility to funding abusive mass incarceration environmental injustice and epidemic of out of control crime as a potential incoming governor my first priority is to implement a tennessee code orange accountability task force tcoatf which would be a third party operational task force to perform an initial forensic investigation into political and judicial corruption review term limits and qualified immunity as it relates to police officers political and judicial actors investigate abusive tax incentives rescind discriminatory laws such as hb 1895 sb 2153 hb 0978 hb 2143 hb 2657 sb 2012 and sb 2683 perform an analysis of local state and federal funds allocation across the 95 counties violations of the public finance management act pfma misappropriation of ppp distributions covid distribution funding abuse of medicaid expenditures analysis of federal funding and no bid contracts and privatization of prison system the second priority is implementing universal health care third priority is to incorporate a state of tennessee livable wage plan to entail a 15 00 incremental minimal wage and incorporate a teacher loyalty plan the political discourse is unhealthy for democracy and as a whole we need to move pass underline systemic racism and address the root cause head on systemic racism is baked into every facet of our governmental policies economic development practices housing disparities health care disparities and environmental injustice this discourse in our beloved country will never change unless antiquated mindsets change and we implement progressive diversified governmental policy changes that are sensitive to every citizen regardless of their race nationality zip code gender identity economic status or educational level the pandemic of systemic racism will not change overnight and apparently it would have to be regulated with progressive action to curtail the manifestations of individuals that insist on divisive manipulation to exert their abuse of power on citizens across this county we can achieve political cohesiveness in tennessee by being intentional with a new set of cultural lenses one tennessee what is the biggest challenge you think tennesseans face and how would you change it i feel tennesseans are ready for a change regardless of what your political affiliation may be we have a duty to the generation to be intentional about bringing our beloved volunteer state to a healthy and more inclusive footprint of love respect and tolerance therefore my lifelong community cohesiveness and outreach could be the stepping stone to bringing tennessee back together presently i have already swayed numerous republican voters to cross over and vote for me i have been instrumental in meeting with democrats republicans socialists independents green party and many others to sit down and listen to their concerns we are in a state of emergency in the state of tennessee and our greatest concern should be placing people back into politics in the state of tennessee we must go back and address human rights instead of political rights tennesseans should be the center of any political parties and not the politicians or individual pushing their personal political agenda which often cause harm to the citizens as the next potential governor my ultimate goal is making my new administration people centered community driven and assuring that no tennesseans is left behind in the economic and social equation of justice for all i am the people s governor

commentary the volcker recession of 1981 82 crushed inflation out of the economy and presented economists with a new challenge rather than high and rising inflation their new dilemma was low and falling inflation this was a dilemma they were happy to have and in fact they took credit for it they eventually labeled this period of not merely low inflation but also for a time falling levels of unemployment see bottom chart in figure 1 as the great moderation volcker s successor from 2006 till 2014 ben bernanke waxed lyrical in october 2004 saying that the sources of the great moderation remain somewhat controversial but there is evidence for the view that improved control of inflation has contributed in important measure to this welcome change in the economy paul volcker and his colleagues on the federal open market committee deserve enormous credit both for recognizing the crucial importance of achieving low and stable inflation and for the courage and perseverance with which they tackled america s critical inflation problem then the global financial crisis hit in august 2007 and that comfortable pat on the back explanation for low inflation and unemployment went out the window or it should have inflation of 5 percent in 2006 collapsed into deflation of 2 percent in 2007 unemployment exploded from 5 percent to 10 percent and the central bank inflation problem turned weird having spent decades trying to get inflation down to their target of 2 percent after the global financial crisis they struggled to get it up to that target until that is inflation blasted right past 2 percent in 2021 and reached over 8 percent in june faced with this unexpected shock economists are wheeling out the tools that they think caused inflation to fall back in the 1980s a sharp rise in interest rates to tame inflationary expectations having set its target interest rate at 0 25 percent since march 2020 it started hiking the rate in march 2022 it is currently at 1 75 percent and most economists are expecting further hikes to 3 5 percent by the end of 2022 the mainstream economist paul krugman believes that the job of taming inflationary expectations is already done he notes that the bond markets are forecasting inflation at 3 6 percent in 2023 well below the current 8 5 percent and declares that the message we re getting from the markets is don t panic inflation is not in fact out of control although the pain many consumers are feeling right now is he wrote for the ny times i wish i could agree but instead i think inflation is out of control and the cause has nothing to do with the chimeras of inflationary expectations or other mainstream economics fantasies like the non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment nairu which the columnist michael pascoe satirized well in a recent column data federal reserve economic data st louis fed chart steven keen the markup that manufacturers put on their input costs in order to make a profit the input costs they have to pay kalecki focused on wages but this can also include energy inputs minerals etc basically anything not made in the manufacturing sector and the productivity of those inputs basically the ratio between the output in terms of goods and the inputs in terms of units workers tonnes of oil etc sticking just with workers that identifies three factors that can lead to rising prices rising markups rising wages or falling productivity instead we can use a much more realistic approach by the polish engineer turned economist michal kalecki when he divided the factors that cause inflation into three categories sticking just with workers that identifies three factors that can lead to rising prices rising markups rising wages or falling productivity we can pretty rapidly rule out rising wages as a cause of today s unemployment even with the tightest labor market in decades wage growth is lagging well behind the rate of inflation the first factor rising markups is a potential factor today markups are fundamentally restrained by the degree of competition that manufacturers feel in the aggregate in their markets when demand is buoyant as it is now markups are likely to rise but that buoyancy is largely due to the enormous and necessary deficits that countries ran at the beginning of the pandemic if governments reverse direction now to focus on budget repair another neoclassical chimera then that buoyancy will disappear and markups could fall but the key factor that makes inflation today totally different from inflation in the past is the last one falling productivity right now this is being driven by three primary factors covid the russia ukraine war and declining productivity from fossil fuels and mining covid induced absences by critical staff are hampering production in the world s factories and lengthening the time it takes to ship goods from the world s factory nations to its consumer nations a division that has been created by the globalization of production over the last four decades on top of the damage done to manufacturing a covid affected workforce in the west is hitting transportation and services there hypothetically covid could be a transient factor there could be some miracle cure that removes it from the world making a return to a pre covid environment possible the same could happen with the russia ukraine war russia is the world s no 1 wheat exporter and ukraine is no 5 the war has drastically reduced their exports and is driving food costs higher but if it ends then perhaps their grain exports could resume but no such fantasy is possible for the next factor which is brilliantly captured in the graphic shown in figure 2 from australian mining engineer simon michaux an associate professor of geometallurgy at the geological survey of finland he has a doctorate in mining in the past a tiny amount of energy was needed to mine oil and coal the energy return on energy invested was huge equally mineral deposits were rich and easily processed using cheap energy graphic created by simon michaux which illustrates the declining quality of energy and mineral resources over time reproduced with the permission of michaux original is figure 59 in the mining of minerals and the limits to growth we have drastically improved the efficiency with which we mine energy and process minerals today but the physical constraints of much more difficult to mine energy and much lower quality minerals can t be eliminated by ever rising productivity these two factors also multiply together the energy is more expensive and more of it is needed to process lower quality ores into final goods one problem amplifies the other since this is also happening in the context of dangerous global warming and fossil fuels still provide over 80 percent of our energy inputs there is no possibility of replacing fossil fuels with renewables or nuclear power in time to address these cost pressures the likely prospect therefore is rising prices not because of wage demands or excessive markups but because of a sheer increase in the cost of turning raw materials into finished goods the neoclassical cure for this disease rising interest rates and cutbacks on government spending are as effective as 18th century medicine was against cancer they will probably cause a recession which may reduce markups and thus some inflation but with real wages falling rising unemployment on top of falling real wages could break the west s already brittle social compact inflation is therefore likely to be a permanent feature of society the question is not how to eliminate it but how to avoid it causing social breakdown

goals step 3 get acquainted with various stocks and funds now it s time to start doing research on what to invest in there are different ways to invest in the stock market and there s a lot to know so doing your research is well worth your time as a regular person who is investing not a professional trader accredited trader or institution you re what s called a retail investor stocks are a good option to consider if you want to invest in specific companies just keep in mind that you should look into the company itself and how it s performing over time stocks a stock is a security that gives stockholders the opportunity to buy a fractional share of ownership in a particular company there are many different types of stocks to choose from such as blue chip stocks growth stocks and penny stocks so make sure you understand your options what they offer and what matches with your budget and investing goals if you re going to pick a stock look at the financial statements and select the stock based on the bucket you re trying to fill in your portfolio for example are you looking for a dividend stock look at the dividend history are you looking for a growth stock look at the earnings per share is it showing consistent growth how these indicators measure against peer group says amy irvine a cfp professional at rooted planning group so you want to take steps to look at your income and expense balance sheets and make sure you re hitting the right bucket which refers to the grouping of related assets or categories for your investing needs for example investing in small cap mid cap or large cap stocks are a way to invest in different sized companies with varying market capitalizations and degrees of risk if you re looking to go the diy route or want the option to have your securities professionally managed you can consider etfs mutual funds or index funds exchange traded funds etfs etfs are a type of exchange traded investment product that must register with the sec and allows investors to pool money and invest in stocks bonds or assets that are traded on the us stock exchange there are two types of etfs index based etfs and actively managed etfs index based etfs track a particular securities index like the s p 500 and invest in those securities contained within that index actively managed etfs aren t based on an index and instead aim to achieve an investment objective by investing in a portfolio of securities that will meet that goal and are managed by an advisor mutual funds this investment vehicle also allows investors to pool their money to invest in various assets and are similar to some etfs in that way however mutual funds are always actively managed by a fund manager most mutual funds fall into one of four main categories bond funds money market funds stock funds and target date funds index funds this type of investment vehicle is a mutual fund that s designed to track a particular index such as the s p 500 index funds invest in stocks or bonds of various companies that are listed on a particular index quick tip wondering just how much certain mutual funds will cost you you can use finra s fund analyzer tool to help you examine and compare the costs of owning funds you want to get familiar with the various types of investing vehicles and understand the risks and rewards of each type of security for example stocks can be lucrative but also very risky as we mentioned before mutual funds are actively managed whereas index based etfs and index funds are passively managed this is important to keep in mind because your costs and responsibilities vary depending on an active versus passive approach mutual funds are professionally managed and may have higher fees with etfs and index funds you can purchase them yourself and may have lower fees having a diverse portfolio can help you prepare for the risk and not have all of your eggs in one basket you can choose to invest in individual stocks a stock mutual fund or an etf etfs are somewhat similar to mutual funds in that they invest in many stocks but trade more similarly to an individual stock explains kenny senour cfp professional at millennial wealth management for example let s say you open a brokerage account with 1 000 you can use that money to purchase a certain number of shares in abc company the underlying price of which fluctuates while the stock market is open or you could choose to invest it in a stock mutual fund which invests in many different stocks and is priced at the close of each market at the end of the day quick tip building a diversified portfolio with individual stocks can be time consuming especially for people just starting out that s why experts recommend beginner investors focus on mutual funds index funds or etfs

gains by buying and selling more frequently and at specific times quick tip be aware of any fees or related costs when investing fees can take a bite out of your investments so compare costs and fees step 5 choose your investing account after choosing your investment strategy you want to choose an investing account that can help you get started decide if you want to do it yourself or get a professional to help out if you want to be a passive investor and diy you can look into robo advisors like betterment or wealthfront which uses algorithms to invest for you open a brokerage account

considering active versus passive investing and if you should diy it or get a professional you want to consider several factors look at total fees the time commitment involved and any account minimums as well the easiest way for many people to get started with investing is to utilize their employer sponsored 401 k talk to your employer about getting started and see if they ll match part of your contributions the key is to choose an investment account that fits with your budget and investment strategy open an account and then submit an initial deposit just know that when you submit money it s

buying stocks etfs or index funds with their appropriate codes from your account that is when your money is actually invested but it doesn t stop there you also want to continue to add to your portfolio so consider setting up auto deposits each month you can also re invest any earnings or dividends to help build growth over time diversify your portfolio by investing in different types of investment vehicles and industries a buy and hold approach is typically better for beginner investors it can be tempting to try out day trading but that can be very risky quick tip to limit risk avoid day trading penny stocks and industries you don t understand lastly you ll want to rebalance your portfolio at least once a year as your portfolio grows and dips your asset allocation or how much you ve invested in stocks bonds and cash will have shifted rebalancing is basically resetting that to the proportion you want rebalancing is the practice of periodically selling and buying investments in your underlying portfolio to make sure certain target weights are stable over time for example let s say you are an aggressive investor with 90 of your portfolio in stocks and 10 of your portfolio in bonds over time as stocks and bonds perform differently those weights will drift explains senour without periodic rebalancing your portfolio could become 95 stocks and 5 bonds which may not be in line with your intended financial goals for the account there s no perfect time frame for rebalancing as some financial professionals suggest doing so every quarter but conventional wisdom says at a minimum rebalancing at least once per year can make sense continuing to invest money and rebalance your portfolio periodically will help you keep your investments in good shape best stocks for beginners choosing stocks can be overwhelming for beginners but you don t have to just invest in individual stocks it can be less risky and good for diversifying your portfolio to invest in funds you may choose to invest in an index fund which is a group of assets that tracks an index such as the s p 500 or the dow jones industrial average investing in individual stocks can be useful however you

money in an inflationary environment assets with fluctuating interest rates give your money more of a fighting chance as they ll also rise with inflation growth stocks vs value stocks growth stocks are shares of companies that are expected to experience high growth rates in both their revenue and returns to investors growth stocks are those that investors believe will have higher than average returns in the short term while value stocks are those that investors feel are overlooked by the market at large they are more volatile than value stocks but they also have the potential to generate higher returns value stocks on the other hand are shares of companies that trade at a lower price relative to the company s financial performance they are measured and defined by their financial performance such as sales earnings and select financial ratios another way of looking at the difference between the two growth stocks would be the expensive designer jacket value stocks would be the jacket at the thrift store how interest rates affect the stock market the fed meets eight times per year to discuss the federal funds rate and investors tend to react to what occurs once the notes of the meeting have been released during these meetings the fed uses economic data like the consumer price index cpi the unemployment rate and more to determine what the fed funds rate should be the stock market reacts to the changes in the interest rates because it generally signals whether or not the economy is strong it could also have an impact on a company s cost to doing business thus changing how investors may value a company this is because of the impact that interest rates have on the stock market here are the ways interest rates affect the stock market 1 when rates rise stocks tend to fall when rates fall stocks rise when interest rates are low companies can assume debt at a low cost which they may use to add team members or expand into new ventures says harrison when rates rise it s harder for companies to borrow and more costly to manage what debt they already have which impacts their ability to grow he adds these higher costs may result in lower revenues thus negatively impacting the value of the company also keep in mind that as rates fall on savings accounts and certificates of deposit investors generally seek out higher paying investments like stocks and are generally seen as a catalyst for growth in the market in a rising rate environment investors tend to shift away from stock to places with less risk and safer returns 2 the rates impacts bonds most traditional bonds pay a fixed interest rate through maturity for example if you own a 10 year bond paying 3 per year the 3 annual payment will not fluctuate however if interest rates are cut during the life of the bond the value of the bond rises this is because as new bonds are issued it is unlikely that they will be as attractive financially the opposite is true in a rising rate environment 3 investor expectations can cause volatility in some cases how investors feel about the prospects of an interest rate hike or cut can cause the market to swing due to announcements by the fed and other economic data investors may anticipate a threat of rising rates and begin selling causing short term volatility this was the case at various points in 2018 and 2021 investors can do the same and expect a drop in interest rates in either case the market can react simply to these expectations of a change in rates without the fed actually making a move stock trading vs investing trading and investing are two different ways of approaching the stock market with trading you re hoping to earn quick returns based on short term fluctuations in the market long term investors in contrast tend to build diversified portfolios of assets and stay in them through the ups and downs of the market trading can be a thrilling way to earn quick cash however like with gambling it can also quickly lead to big losses investing usually means smaller short term wins but also fewer severe losses if you re comfortable with the risks trading with a portion of your money can be enjoyable and could lead to profits if reducing risk and exposure to volatility are your main goals you ll want to stick with long term investing but if you re saving for a financial goal you hope to reach by a specific

commentary the reality of record high inflation combined with a hawkish monetary policy is slowing the economy sharply and has led to the current u s recession two back to back quarters of negative growth the economic contraction should soon cause inflation to roll over along with bond yields but that isn t necessarily indicative of a new bull market it is much the same process that occurred leading up to the global financial crisis of 2008 the major difference is that the level of inflation today is much greater than it was 15 years ago a white hot 9 1 percent for june of 2022 which is actually close to 20 percent if calculated using the methods in place in 1980 that level is much greater than the 4 1 percent we saw in december of 2007 inflation may be peaking but it is peaking at over 4 5 times the fed s target this means the federal open market committee fomc will find it very difficult to give up its inflation fight anytime soon it would be a different story if the effective federal funds rate was trading close to the fed s neutral range which mr powell believes is close to 2 5 percent not the 1 58 percent seen today with the consumer price index cpi at 9 1 percent and its balance sheet at 8 9 trillion it is untenable for the fed to remain stimulative to inflation indeed the fomc wants the interbank lending rate at 3 5 4 0 percent by the end of 2022 nevertheless the cpi s apogee is probably here and a falling second derivative of inflation would be great news for the stock market as long as it didn t also come along with crashing economic growth and if the fed were to slow down its rate hiking or even stop hiking completely it would not necessarily be a panacea during the last three recessions the fed had to significantly reduce interest rates and or undergo quantitative easing qe programs to boost the market even after taking on such monetary endeavors the results were not immediately manifest during the dot com recession the fed had to reduce borrowing costs by 475 basis points bps before the market bottomed that process took nearly two years during the global financial crisis the fed took rates down by 525 bps before stocks found support that process took a year and a half and was aided by a massive qe program even during the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic it took the start of unlimited qe and a return to zero interest rate policy before markets turned around newsflash for wall street monetary policy works with a rather long lag peak inflation maybe but that s not the issue the intractable inflation seen in the june cpi print isn t all about some aberrant spike in food and energy prices core cpi excluding food and energy spiked 0 7 percent month over month that is a faster rate than the previous month and was higher by 5 9 percent from the previous year can one honestly compare today s situation with the debt levels and asset bubbles in existence leading up to the tech and real estate bubbles no the current situation is actually much worse see my commentary here for more data on our hyper leveraged economy the intractable inflation seen in the june cpi print isn t all about some aberrant spike in food and energy prices core cpi excluding food and energy spiked 0 7 percent month over month that is a faster rate than the previous month and was higher by 5 9 percent from the previous year and if you want to understand why consumer confidence is so dour look at real hourly earnings which decreased 3 6 percent year over year in spite of this a plunging growth rate of m2 money supply and the nascent destruction of the fed s balance sheet should send the rate of change of inflation lower in the months ahead for now however extraordinarily high inflation is undermining the economy and evidence of the recession is all around us for example according to outplacement firm challenger gray christmas job cuts in the united states came in at 32 517 in june rising by 57 percent on a monthly basis and by 59 percent on an annual basis and let us briefly visit the labor department s fantasy island also known as the establishment jobs survey the report shows june payrolls increasing by 372 000 however the institute for supply management s service and manufacturing surveys both showed that these sectors actually lost jobs in june meanwhile the all important household survey showed that 315 000 jobs were actually lost furthermore the national federation of independent business said its small business optimism index fell 3 6 points last month to 89 5 the lowest level since january of 2013 but back to the issue at hand just because inflation and bond yields may be peaking this does not sound the all clear signal to buy stocks the benchmark 10 year u s treasury note topped out at 5 2 percent in july of 2007 the official start of the global financial crisis was a few months later in december of 2007 and the cyclical bottom in the benchmark treasury yield did not occur until the very end of 2008 if you had bought stocks in july of 2007 because the fed was done tightening and the top of bond yields were in you would have made a tragic mistake between july of 2007 cyclical top in yields and december of 2008 cyclical bottom in yields the s p 500 shed 43 percent this is because the high water mark in bond yields not only signaled the top of year over year changes in the rate of inflation but more importantly it also signaled a dramatic steepening in the decline of economic growth and earnings while there is still more room to the upside of the federal funds rate long term bond yields and inflation have most likely put in their cyclical high nevertheless those conditions do not lead to an imminent bottom for the stock market for that to occur liquidity and credit conditions need to improve significantly therefore for the time being it is still best to ignore those bottom pickers

hanover county va virginia bourbon and whiskey chasers were not terribly surprised when a former virginia abc employee and another man were charged with allegedly selling internal information on rare spirits to bourbon enthusiasts one richmond bourbon lover said it was somewhat of an open secret in online forums the guy was actually in a couple of the groups or what not he would kind of talk about it brag about it brian houchen who began bourbon hunting a few years back said last month a multi jurisdictional grand jury indicted edgar smith garcia a former virginia abc sales manager and robert williams adams who did not work for abc with felony embezzlement and computer trespassing the alleged scheme involved accessing and selling the abc management of inventory products mips list to bourbon chasers court documents show prosecutors told the richmond time dispatch garcia would provide adams with the list who would in turn provide the information to online subscribers for 300 the virginia mercury also reported on the alleged scheme this spring virginia abc implemented a randomized approach to distributing limited availability spirits in order to cut down on enthusiasts following supply trucks or camping outside of stores abc officials said they also wanted to help more virginians have access to rare products which sell out quickly when chasers get word of stock a lot of people were complaining to the abc and i m sure they got tired of hearing about it and decided to put an end to it houchens said while some people flip the rare bottles to make a profit on secondary markets houchens said many of the people he knows in the virginia bourbon chasing community do it for the spirit of camaraderie some people call it crazy i even sat out for my first bottle of this for 15 hours he said referring to a bottle of george t stage for me it s just about meeting new guys it s never really about the juice it s more so about the conversation virginia abc said the best way to track down rare bottles is through their spirited virginia social media feeds and email subscription list which is 130 000 strong already as the sole provider of spirits in virginia we want to ensure that every customer has a fair chance at acquiring highly sought after products a virginia abc spokesperson said in a statement to cbs 6 we are committed to this standard and are confident that our current random process to distribute limited availability products addresses the issues identified in our investigation that led to the arrest of these two individuals we will continue to ensure the process is fair and equitable to all who wish to have the chance to buy a limited availability product it continued attorneys for both defendants and the commonwealth could not be reached for comment at this time cbs 6 legal analyst todd stone said the case could present an interesting dilemma for a judge or jury should it reach that point for either man charged the item alleged to have been stolen is not the bourbon but rather the information about how to acquire the bourbon at trial a judge or jury will need to determine whether the defendants alleged conduct to sell that information is sufficient to sustain a criminal conviction stone said if so they will need to further determine the value of that information in order to decide whether it meets the threshold for a felony conviction cases that involve unique issues like these can sometimes be more problematic for the prosecution to prove both garcia and adams who do not live in central virginia were released on bond last month pending future court appearances this is a developing story so anyone with more information can email newstips wtvr com to send a tip
the husband of rep nancy pelosi just bought 20 000 shares of nvidia stock what happened less than a month before nvidia s nvda 2 48 second quarter earnings are due out shares of the semiconductor giant closed 2 2 higher on monday investors seemed to be continuing to react positively to the news that as business insider reported on thursday speaker of the house nancy pelosi s husband paul pelosi exercised millions of dollars in nvidia call options according to a new congressional financial disclosure so what over the weekend news website the daily caller noted that pelosi s purchase which was noted in the filing as being between 1 million and 5 million came days ahead of a possible senate vote that might allocate billions in government subsidies to semiconductor production in the united states in that article dated july 15 it says that pelosi had possessed 200 call options for the purchase of the nvidia stock that were due to expire on june 17 instead of letting that happen he paid the cash necessary to exercise the options adding further fuel to the fire and this may be why the shares continued to rise today this news was further amplified when noted investor louis navellier picked up the story on his morning podcast as navellier pointed out the house has already approved the subsidies so if the senate agrees this week and the president signs the bill then that means the money spigot will be well and truly turned on now what nvidia is one of several semiconductor stocks that would be expected to benefit from the government boosting the industry and the vote on that could happen as early as tomorrow investors seem optimistic about the fact that a high profile politician or in this case her husband has enough faith to invest millions in nvidia ahead of the vote and ahead of nvidia s aug 16 earnings report as well time will tell whether the optimism is well placed analysts are forecasting that nvidia will report a profit of 1 01 per share on 8 1 billion in sales for the quarter up 7 and 24 year over year respectively

the fallout from the covid 19 pandemic and the ongoing war in ukraine has led to a significant economic slump in 2022 prices for some common commodities are reaching record levels economic growth is slowing and inflation is rising as a result recession will be hard to avoid for many countries world bank president david malpass said in june not since the 2007 2009 financial crisis the largest slump after the great depression of 1929 has there been a global economic event of this scale but what is a recession and how do we decide if one is happening the definition of a recession there is no official globally recognized definition of a recession in 1974 the us economist julius shiskin described a recession as two consecutive quarters of declining growth and many countries still adhere to that however the us has since opted to use a more open definition the national bureau of economic research nber looks at a variety of factors when deciding whether or not america is in recession the institution defines the event as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months normally visible in production employment real income and other indicators a recession begins when the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends when the economy reaches its trough the definition of a global recession like national recessions a consensus on the definition of a global recession has yet to be reached the world bank s main indicator of a worldwide downturn is multiple major countries economies contracting at the same time as well as other evidence of weak global economic growth the world economy has gone through four major downturns over the past seven decades in 1975 1982 1991 and 2009 recessions typically last for about a year in advanced economies according to the imf the nber s data supports this from 1945 to 2009 the average recession lasted 11 months signs of a recession besides a prolonged decline in gross domestic product gdp one of the most obvious measures of a recession is unemployment rate when this begins to rise it can trigger a domino effect of economic consequences as demand for goods and services slows down during the last global recession unemployment hit 9 5 in the us according to the bureau of labor statistics although employment is currently high in many major economies sentiment is low on the consumer confidence index another key indicator this is due to factors such as the cost of living crisis leading to less spending which can subsequently cause the economy to contract and tax revenues to decline stock markets are also likely to struggle during recessions as consumer confidence and spending decreases companies may be forced to lay off workers which can lead to poor investment performance and panic in the market in the 12 recessions following world war ii the us index of stocks the s p 500 contracted by a median of 24 according to goldman sachs how do recessions end central banks can lower short term interest rates this can increase consumer confidence and stimulate spending as the cost of borrowing is lower meaning the cost of buying items such as cars and homes is also less to keep unemployment at bay governments can introduce policies such as tax cuts to help consumers or launch infrastructure programmes including construction of roads and railways recessions end when growth resumes again no matter how slowly this happens during the great recession of 2008 for example governments introduced a number of quantitative easing measures pumping trillions into the global economy in an attempt to resuscitate it following this unprecedented level of stimulus markets began to recover although lingering scars like higher unemployment and lower average income levels remained many years later source world economic forum

in april twitter accepted american billionaire elon musk s offer to buy the social media service for 44 billion but earlier this month musk withdrew his offer twitter reacted by bringing a legal case against musk to force him to buy the company why did twitter take musk to court legal experts say twitter wants to complete the deal that both sides agreed to the company said musk s reasons for backing out are just a cover for changing his mind in april musk offered to pay 54 20 a share for twitter the company accepted the offer after opposing the sale earlier musk accused twitter of not giving him enough information about how many spam accounts appear on the service but twitter argues that musk is refusing to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests musk agreed to pay 38 percent above twitter s stock price at the time he offered a take it or leave it deal the legal case states but soon after the stock market suffered a big drop many stocks lost value this led to shares of electric carmaker tesla which musk owns to lose more than 100 billion in value most of musk s personal wealth comes from his holdings of tesla stock what happens next if the two sides do not reach a settlement out of court the case will go to trial and a judge could start making decisions this summer twitter has told its employees it asked for an expedited trial to be heard in september the company said it is critically important to get the case tried quickly but experts say a trial could last weeks or longer twitter would probably want to get things done fast elon i don t know lawrence cunningham told the associated press he is a law professor and corporate legal expert at george washington university in washington d c how has musk reacted musk reacted officially to twitter s legal case or lawsuit on friday his lawyers gave a written request to the court hearing the case in the northeastern state of delaware in the request musk again accused twitter of keeping spam account data from him the document also disputed twitter s request for an expedited trial musk s lawyers said it would take months to gather information from twitter on the spam account issue and to identify and speak to witnesses the document also repeated several other accusations musk has made in the past they include a claim that twitter violated terms of the deal when it dismissed two high level company officials without first informing musk what are the sides arguing about the spam account question will likely be a central part of the case that is the main reason musk gave for backing out of or withdrawing from the deal twitter claims in its lawsuit that musk started saying he wanted to buy twitter to remove crypto spam musk said he considered it a major blight on the user experience but twitter claims that when the stock market dropped musk shifted his narrative the company said the billionaire then demanded proof that spam was not a serious problem on the service the court will examine whether the spam issue presents a material breach of twitter s obligation in the deal as musk claims on the other hand it will look at whether musk violated his obligation to follow through with the contract that he signed could musk be forced to buy twitter legal experts say it is possible that a court could force musk to buy twitter but others say the court may not go that far another outcome could be for the court to force musk to pay 1 billion that is an amount each side agreed to if musk fails to complete the deal or musk might have to pay another amount without buying the company for 44 billion i m bryan lynn the associated press reported this story bryan lynn adapted the report for voa learning english _________________________________________________________________ words in this story spam n unwanted internet messages obligation n something a person does because it is their duty or they feel they have to irony n a situation in which the opposite happens than what was expected expedite v to make a process of action happen more quickly blight n something that has a very bad effect on something shift n change a course of action narrative n a story or description of events breach n an action that breaks a rule agreement or law _________________________________________________________________ what do you think of this story we want to hear from you we have a new comment system here is how it works 1 write your comment in the box 2 under the box you can see four images for social media accounts they are for disqus facebook twitter and google 3 click on one image and a box appears enter the login for your social media account or you may create one on the disqus system it is the blue circle with d on it it is free each time you return to comment on the learning english site you can use your account and see your comments and replies to them our comment policy is here
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video ba 5 is now the dominant covid 19 subvariant in the united states here s why it s capable of causing more reinfections according to experts throughout the covid 19 pandemic new variants and subvariants have emerged as the virus continues to mutate president joe biden s administration said on july 12 that omicron subvariants ba 4 and ba 5 make up 80 of covid 19 cases in the nation with ba 5 accounting for a majority of cases as awareness of ba 5 spreads some people on social media are claiming that the subvariant is more likely to reinfect those who have already had covid 19 after successfully avoiding covid for 2 5 years my husband tested positive for covid 3 weeks ago cleared the infection and then tested positive again yesterday 3 weeks ba5 immune evasion is no joke one person wrote on twitter the question is the ba 5 omicron subvariant of covid 19 more likely than previous subvariants to reinfect people the sources the answer yes the ba 5 omicron subvariant of covid 19 is more likely than previous subvariants to reinfect people what we found the omicron variant surfaced at the end of 2021 leading to a wave of new covid 19 infections since then health experts have identified multiple subvariants of omicron including ba 5 though data suggest that omicron generally causes less severe illness than prior variants it spreads more easily and often evades immune response among people who have been previously infected or vaccinated against covid 19 ba 5 is the most contagious variant or subvariant of covid 19 we ve seen so far world health organization who covid 19 technical lead maria van kherkove said during a recent press briefing a recent study looked into the effectiveness of a prior covid 19 infection in preventing a new infection from the virus a spokesperson for the who said the study showed that prior to omicron those who had recovered from a covid 19 infection had 90 immune protection from reinfection when omicron subvariants ba 1 and ba 2 became dominant the immune protection from a prior infection dropped to an estimated 50 according to the who now a prior infection only gives a person an estimated 40 immune protection from the ba 4 and ba 5 and ba 5 subvariants ba 5 made up an estimated 65 of covid 19 cases in the u s from july 3 9 compared to about 16 of cases attributed to the ba 4 subvariant according to data from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the ba 5 subvariant is immune evading meaning people with prior infection or vaccination are likely still at risk for ba 4 or ba 5 cdc director rochelle walensky said during a white house covid 19 response team briefing on july 12 mutations in both the ba 4 and ba 5 subvariants appear to help them escape immunity from both vaccination and prior infection sheldon campbell a professor of laboratory medicine at yale school of medicine said joseph fauver an assistant professor in the epidemiology department at the university of nebraska s college of public health told verify that the ba 5 subvariant is absolutely capable of causing reinfections and has already done so researchers with the beth israel deaconess medical center a teaching hospital of harvard medical school also evaluated antibody responses to multiple omicron subvariants in 27 people who received their primary covid 19 vaccine series and booster shot and 27 people who had previously contracted covid 19 their research was published in a letter to the new england journal of medicine on june 22 2022 they found that antibody responses to ba 4 and ba 5 were approximately three times lower than to the omicron subvariants ba 1 and ba 2 meaning ba 4 and ba 5 are substantially more likely to evade immunity from either a vaccine or prior infection there is no evidence right now to suggest that ba 4 or ba 5 cause more severe disease compared to other omicron subvariants according to public health leaders and experts who spoke with verify
stocks closed lower on wall street monday after an early rally evaporated by midafternoon marking a choppy start to a week full of updates on the two things that set stock prices how much profit companies are making and where interest rates are heading the s p 500 fell 0 8 after having been up 1 in the early going the index broke a five day losing streak at the end of last week gains in energy producers big retailers and other companies that rely on consumer spending were outweighed by a pullback in health care and technology stocks goldman sachs rose after reporting better profit for the spring than expected the dow jones industrial average fell 0 7 and the nasdaq composite lost 0 8 it was a pretty big gain earlier today and it s all gone said liz young head of investment strategy at sofi young expects the market to remain volatile through july mainly because of earnings season johnson johnson american airlines and tesla are among the dozens of s p 500 companies that are scheduled to issue quarterly snapshots this week this is the first earnings season in the cycle where we re probably going to get some pretty negative guidance and we re going to hear about where companies are being squeezed and they re going to be changing their outlook she said brand connections the s p 500 fell 32 31 points to 3 830 85 the dow slid 215 65 points to 31 072 61 and the nasdaq gave up 92 37 points to 11 360 05 the russell 2000 index of smaller companies also fell it dropped 5 96 points or 0 3 at 1 738 42 the afternoon reversal is the latest bout of volatile trading for the market which has been lurching mostly lower for weeks on worries that the federal reserve and other central banks around the world will slam the brake too hard on the economy in hopes of bringing down high inflation if they re too aggressive with their interest rate hikes they could cause a recession the fed wants inflation data to come down and it s not going to retract its claws until that happens young said pretty quickly the narrative is going to shift to will the fed go too far still some on wall street are seeing signs for at least temporary optimism oil prices have come off their highs though u s crude rose 5 1 monday a key report released last week also indicated expectations are easing for inflation among households that could prevent a more vicious cycle from taking root and ease the pressure on the federal reserve expectations have come down for how aggressively the federal reserve will raise interest rates at its meeting next week traders are now betting on a roughly one in three chance for a monster hike of a full percentage point with the majority favoring a 0 75 percentage point increase as recently as thursday the heavy bet was on a hike of a full point economists at goldman sachs are among those forecasting a 0 75 point increase which would match last month s hike instead of a more aggressive one they cited in particular the softening of inflation expectations after chair jerome powell said last month that the fed pays close attention to them across the atlantic ocean later this week investors expect the european central bank on thursday to raise interest rates for the first time in 11 years to combat inflation many investors expect an increase of 0 25 percentage points but more is not unthinkable economists wrote in a bofa global research report interest rates are one of the two main levers that set prices for stocks the other is corporate profits which are under threat given high inflation and slowdowns in parts of the economy for the moment at least analysts are still forecasting continued growth earnings season kicked off last week and banks have dominated the early part of the schedule for reporting how much they earned from april through june goldman sachs was among the latest to report and it rallied 2 5 after its profit and revenue were better than analysts expected synchrony financial rose 0 3 after it

in the bond market the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 2 98 from 2 96 late friday the two year yield which rose to 3 17 is still above the 10 year yield some investors see that as an ominous sign that could presage a recession in a year or two underscoring worries about a recession have been recent reports showing slowdowns in parts of the economy because of the fed s rate hikes the housing market in particular has felt the effect of more expensive mortgage rates a measure of sentiment among home builders released monday weakened more than economists expected and sank to its

the standard poor s 500 index fell 32 31 points to 3 830 85 the dow jones industrial average slid 215 65 points to 31 072 61 associated press stocks closed lower on wall street on monday after an early rally evaporated by midafternoon marking a choppy start to a week full of updates on the two things that set stock prices how much profit companies are making and where interest rates are heading the standard poor s 500 index fell 0 8 after having been up 1 in the early going the index broke a five day losing streak at the end of last week gains in energy producers big retailers and other companies that rely on consumer spending were outweighed by a pullback in healthcare and technology stocks goldman sachs rose 2 5 after reporting better profit for the spring than expected the dow jones industrial average fell 0 7 and the nasdaq composite lost 0 8 it was a pretty big gain earlier today and it s all gone said liz young head of investment strategy at sofi young expects the market to remain volatile through july mainly because of earnings season johnson johnson american airlines and tesla are among the dozens of s p 500 companies that are scheduled to issue quarterly snapshots this week this is the first earnings season in the cycle where we re probably going to get some pretty negative guidance and we re going to hear about where companies are being squeezed and they re going to be changing their outlook she said the s p 500 fell 32 31 points to 3 830 85 the dow slid 215 65 points to 31 072 61 and the nasdaq gave up 92 37 points to close at 11 360 05 the russell 2000 index of smaller companies also fell it dropped 5 96 points or 0 3 at 1 738 42 the afternoon reversal is the latest bout of volatile trading for the market which has been lurching mostly lower for weeks on worries that the federal reserve and other central banks around the world will slam the brake too hard on the economy in hopes of bringing down high inflation if they re too aggressive with their interest rate increases they could cause a recession the fed wants inflation data to come down and it s not going to retract its claws until that happens young said pretty quickly the narrative is going to shift to will the fed go too far still some on wall street are seeing signs for at least temporary optimism oil prices have come off their highs though u s crude rose 5 1 on monday a key report released last week also indicated expectations are easing for inflation among households that could prevent a more vicious cycle from taking root and ease the pressure on the federal reserve expectations have come down for how aggressively the federal reserve will raise interest rates at its meeting next week traders are now betting on a roughly 1 in 3 chance for a monster increase of a full percentage point with the majority favoring a 0 75 percentage point increase as recently as thursday the heavy bet was on a hike of a full point economists at goldman sachs are among those forecasting a 0 75 point increase which would match last month s boost instead of a more aggressive one they cited in particular the softening of inflation expectations after chair jerome h powell said last month that the fed pays close attention to them across the atlantic ocean later this week investors expect the european central bank on thursday to raise interest rates for the first time in 11 years to combat inflation many investors expect an increase of 0 25 percentage points but more is not unthinkable economists wrote in a bofa global research report interest rates are one of the two main levers that set prices for stocks the other is corporate profits which are under threat given high inflation and slowdowns in parts of the economy for the moment at least analysts are still forecasting continued growth earnings season kicked off last week and banks have dominated the early part of the schedule for reporting how much they earned from april through june

yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 2 98 from 2 96 late friday the two year yield which rose to 3 17 is still above the 10 year yield some investors see that as an ominous sign that could presage a recession in a year or two underscoring worries about a recession have been recent reports showing slowdowns in parts of the economy because of the fed s rate increases the housing market in particular has felt the effect of more expensive mortgage rates a measure of sentiment among home builders released monday weakened more than economists expected and sank to its lowest level in more

for college grads who want to make money and live in new york city landing a job at goldman sachs is a golden ticket and it is still harder to get hired by goldman than it is to get into harvard university this week we have about 3 500 undergraduates who are starting their careers here says ceo david solomon in an interview with npr that s 3 500 out of over 300 000 people that applied for those jobs something those new hires are sure to notice is that many of their colleagues are also young half our organization is in its 20s says solomon who moonlights as dj d sol next week he will perform at lollapalooza alongside dua lipa doja cat and metallica solomon notes he will donate his performance fee to charity and he also plans to meet with clients in chicago craig barritt getty images getty images david solomon who performs as dj d sol at the fontainebleau hotel in miami beach florida on feb 1 2020 since he became goldman s ceo in 2018 solomon has implemented some changes to the bank s culture including a relaxed dress code and more flexibility when it comes to taking vacation days but early in the pandemic solomon drew a line in the sand and he hasn t budged solomon does not want his employees to work from home in their pajamas in perpetuity he believes they need to be in the office they come to work at goldman sachs so they can be trained they can be mentored they can learn they can grow says solomon and that just doesn t happen at the same velocity if they re not present sharing the experience with others banking analysts who watch the bank s performance closely say that as the business environment sours goldman s emphasis on in person work is going to be an advantage or at least a differentiator the culture of goldman is very important says gerard cassidy managing director of bank equity research at rbc capital markets it s an esprit de corps it s eat what you kill and it works very effectively but it really has worked because of everybody being in the office it certainly ensures goldman employees especially the newer ones get a deep understanding of business broadly a wide range of clients from around the world from governments and corporations to institutions and individuals seek the bank s advice as the bank s ceo solomon has a bird s eye view of the global economy and right now he sees a lot of uncertainty the federal reserve is raising interest rates aggressively to fight high inflation and while goldman s in house economists are betting there is a 50 chance of a recession in the next two years solomon fears the odds are worse it doesn t preoccupy me but i think the chance of a recession some time in the next 24 months is high he says goldman sachs is taking steps to prepare for a deeper economic downturn when it reported earnings for the second quarter on monday it said it has set aside 667 million to cover potential losses and the company s cfo announced the bank plans to slow hiring mike mayo a banking analyst at wells fargo securities says the current market environment is especially difficult for wall street banks this year he notes we are experiencing the biggest decline in stocks and bonds in over 50 years but according to mayo goldman is able to move nimbly when circumstances change goldman sachs is the antithesis of the oil tanker analogy he says this week solomon is headlining the 10 000 small businesses summit in washington in response to a recent survey conducted by goldman sachs 93 of small business owners who responded said they are worried about a recession in the next year solomon says that being nimble and flexible is going to be the key for all businesses in the coming months including his own he says what he admires most about the small business owners he will address is their optimism in the face of economic uncertainty they are optimistic they work hard they are ambitious he says they are fiercely independent in what they do copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

ba 5 is now the dominant covid 19 subvariant in the united states here s why it s capable of causing more reinfections according to experts example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video throughout the covid 19 pandemic new variants and subvariants have emerged as the virus continues to mutate president joe biden s administration said on july 12 that omicron subvariants ba 4 and ba 5 make up 80 of covid 19 cases in the nation with ba 5 accounting for a majority of cases as awareness of ba 5 spreads some people on social media are claiming that the subvariant is more likely to reinfect those who have already had covid 19 after successfully avoiding covid for 2 5 years my husband tested positive for covid 3 weeks ago cleared the infection and then tested positive again yesterday 3 weeks ba5 immune evasion is no joke one person wrote on twitter the question is the ba 5 omicron subvariant of covid 19 more likely than previous subvariants to reinfect people the sources the answer yes the ba 5 omicron subvariant of covid 19 is more likely than previous subvariants to reinfect people what we found the omicron variant surfaced at the end of 2021 leading to a wave of new covid 19 infections since then health experts have identified multiple subvariants of omicron including ba 5 though data suggest that omicron generally causes less severe illness than prior variants it spreads more easily and often evades immune response among people who have been previously infected or vaccinated against covid 19 ba 5 is the most contagious variant or subvariant of covid 19 we ve seen so far world health organization who covid 19 technical lead maria van kherkove said during a recent press briefing a recent study looked into the effectiveness of a prior covid 19 infection in preventing a new infection from the virus a spokesperson for the who said the study showed that prior to omicron those who had recovered from a covid 19 infection had 90 immune protection from reinfection when omicron subvariants ba 1 and ba 2 became dominant the immune protection from a prior infection dropped to an estimated 50 according to the who now a prior infection only gives a person an estimated 40 immune protection from the ba 4 and ba 5 and ba 5 subvariants ba 5 made up an estimated 65 of covid 19 cases in the u s from july 3 9 compared to about 16 of cases attributed to the ba 4 subvariant according to data from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the ba 5 subvariant is immune evading meaning people with prior infection or vaccination are likely still at risk for ba 4 or ba 5 cdc director rochelle walensky said during a white house covid 19 response team briefing on july 12 mutations in both the ba 4 and ba 5 subvariants appear to help them escape immunity from both vaccination and prior infection sheldon campbell a professor of laboratory medicine at yale school of medicine said joseph fauver an assistant professor in the epidemiology department at the university of nebraska s college of public health told verify that the ba 5 subvariant is absolutely capable of causing reinfections and has already done so researchers with the beth israel deaconess medical center a teaching hospital of harvard medical school also evaluated antibody responses to multiple omicron subvariants in 27 people who received their primary covid 19 vaccine series and booster shot and 27 people who had previously contracted covid 19 their research was published in a letter to the new england journal of medicine on june 22 2022 they found that antibody responses to ba 4 and ba 5 were approximately three times lower than to the omicron subvariants ba 1 and ba 2 meaning ba 4 and ba 5 are substantially more likely to evade immunity from either a vaccine or prior infection there is no evidence right now to suggest that ba 4 or ba 5 cause more severe disease compared to other omicron subvariants according to public health leaders and experts who spoke with verify
john kelly desantis correspondent houma courier and thibodaux daily comet hundreds of houma s public housing tenants remain displaced nearly a year after hurricane ida bayou towers the 300 apartment high rise for the elderly or disabled has been declared unsafe and off limits a few residents are living in the senator circle complex but almost all of the 217 apartments remain uninhabitable attorneys for tenants and the houma terrebonne housing authority say they are working together on solutions struggles continue for hundreds of low income tenants displaced from two public housing sites nearly a year after devastating damage from hurricane ida attorneys for tenants and the houma terrebonne housing authority which oversees the apartment complexes say they are collaborating to produce solutions but for tenants forced to relocate far from home away from doctors who treat them and schools their children attended relief can t come soon enough i am believing that no one really cares about the situation i am dealing with because it s not them having to deal with it said ursula ward a senator circle resident now living in metairie i m not winning no kind of way and it s very stressful ward is one of the residents from more than 500 apartments combined at the low income senator circle housing site the bayou towers senior citizen buildings on west park avenue who had to make alternate living arrangements due to storm damage housing vouchers through the u s department of housing and urban development were made available to many but a shortage of housing locally due to the storm has resulted in many like ward having to move elsewhere it s not getting better at all houma public housing tenant typifies struggles after ida related how repairs are progressing on terrebonne and lafourche schools damaged by hurricane ida a lawsuit against the housing authority was filed feb 25 in u s district court in new orleans on behalf of eleven tenants including ward they had faced eviction from senator circle but maintain that once electric power was restored more than two months after the storm they should be allowed to remain in their otherwise livable apartments or return after repairs are made among other complaints in the lawsuit is an allegation from tenants that they were not permitted to file grievances with the housing authority in accordance with hud procedures attorneys at the nonprofit southeast louisiana legal services were successful in blocking evictions of tenants from senator circle but that was only one facet of a complex web of issues said legal services lawyer hannah adams adams and other attorneys representing the tenants as well as attorneys representing the housing authority said they are working together hoping a cooperative approach will result in more formidable problem solving the housing authority is committed to housing its families and will do everything possible to ensure that the families have safe quality housing whether it is on a temporary or permanent basis following the disaster that is known as hurricane ida said brandon decuir a baton rouge attorney who represents housing agency decuir said because there is ongoing litigation he is limited in what he can say about the case adams said an important issue under discussion for senator circle residents is rent being charged for damaged apartments that cannot be occupied we are trying to work with the housing authority to come up with a solution to make sure tenants are not being charged rent and make sure tenants who have nowhere to go have somewhere to go adams said fema has been working to house tenants whose apartments need to be repaired but the larger problem is that in the aftermath of the storm these tenants were provided with section 8 housing choice vouchers and there is nowhere to use those housing vouchers locally due to depleted housing stock rising rents and discrimination against voucher holders similar problems attorneys acknowledge are being faced by seniors who had lived in bayou towers currently none of the bayou towers apartments can be lived in the louisiana fire marshal s office issued a cease and desist order barring any occupancy at the bayou towers site due to dangerous conditions read this south lafourche hospital damaged by hurricane ida plans to open interim facility by spring in other news lake charles woman accused of scamming hurricane ida victims in terrebonne parish the complex has not been condemned however no lawsuits have been filed at this point on behalf of bayou towers residents discussions regarding the complex however are ongoing as well as the housing authority and its attorneys those for the tenants and representatives from other agencies such as the u s department of housing and urban development and the federal emergency management agency seek solutions to the plight of terrebonne s vulnerable public housing tenants they are keenly aware of a fact worthy of great concern the 2022 hurricane season is less than 2 months old and as it wears on representatives say the potential threat of future storms looms with last year s disaster effects nowhere

for college grads who want to make money and live in new york city landing a job at goldman sachs is a golden ticket and it is still harder to get hired by goldman than it is to get into harvard university this week we have about 3 500 undergraduates who are starting their careers here says ceo david solomon in an interview with npr that s 3 500 out of over 300 000 people that applied for those jobs something those new hires are sure to notice is that many of their colleagues are also young half our organization is in its 20s says solomon who moonlights as dj d sol next week he will perform at lollapalooza alongside dua lipa doja cat and metallica solomon notes he will donate his performance fee to charity and he also plans to meet with clients in chicago since he became goldman s ceo in 2018 solomon has implemented some changes to the bank s culture including a relaxed dress code and more flexibility when it comes to taking vacation days but early in the pandemic solomon drew a line in the sand and he hasn t budged solomon does not want his employees to work from home in their pajamas in perpetuity he believes they need to be in the office they come to work at goldman sachs so they can be trained they can be mentored they can learn they can grow says solomon and that just doesn t happen at the same velocity if they re not present sharing the experience with others banking analysts who watch the bank s performance closely say that as the business environment sours goldman s emphasis on in person work is going to be an advantage or at least a differentiator the culture of goldman is very important says gerard cassidy managing director of bank equity research at rbc capital markets it s an esprit de corps it s eat what you kill and it works very effectively but it really has worked because of everybody being in the office it certainly ensures goldman employees especially the newer ones get a deep understanding of business broadly a wide range of clients from around the world from governments and corporations to institutions and individuals seek the bank s advice as the bank s ceo solomon has a bird s eye view of the global economy and right now he sees a lot of uncertainty the federal reserve is raising interest rates aggressively to fight high inflation and while goldman s in house economists are betting there is a 50 chance of a recession in the next two years solomon fears the odds are worse it doesn t preoccupy me but i think the chance of a recession some time in the next 24 months is high he says goldman sachs is taking steps to prepare for a deeper economic downturn when it reported earnings for the second quarter on monday it said it has set aside 667 million to cover potential losses and the company s cfo announced the bank plans to slow hiring mike mayo a banking analyst at wells fargo securities says the current market environment is especially difficult for wall street banks this year he notes we are experiencing the biggest decline in stocks and bonds in over 50 years but according to mayo goldman is able to move nimbly when circumstances change goldman sachs is the antithesis of the oil tanker analogy he says this week solomon is headlining the 10 000 small businesses summit in washington in response to a recent survey conducted by goldman sachs 93 of small business owners who responded said they are worried about a recession in the next year solomon says that being nimble and flexible is going to be the key for all businesses in the coming months including his own he says what he admires most about the small business owners he will address is their optimism in the face of economic uncertainty they are optimistic they work hard they are ambitious he says they are fiercely independent in what they do
ba 5 is now the dominant covid 19 subvariant in the united states here s why it s capable of causing more reinfections according to experts example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video throughout the covid 19 pandemic new variants and subvariants have emerged as the virus continues to mutate president joe biden s administration said on july 12 that omicron subvariants ba 4 and ba 5 make up 80 of covid 19 cases in the nation with ba 5 accounting for a majority of cases as awareness of ba 5 spreads some people on social media are claiming that the subvariant is more likely to reinfect those who have already had covid 19 after successfully avoiding covid for 2 5 years my husband tested positive for covid 3 weeks ago cleared the infection and then tested positive again yesterday 3 weeks ba5 immune evasion is no joke one person wrote on twitter the question is the ba 5 omicron subvariant of covid 19 more likely than previous subvariants to reinfect people the sources the answer yes the ba 5 omicron subvariant of covid 19 is more likely than previous subvariants to reinfect people what we found the omicron variant surfaced at the end of 2021 leading to a wave of new covid 19 infections since then health experts have identified multiple subvariants of omicron including ba 5 though data suggest that omicron generally causes less severe illness than prior variants it spreads more easily and often evades immune response among people who have been previously infected or vaccinated against covid 19 ba 5 is the most contagious variant or subvariant of covid 19 we ve seen so far world health organization who covid 19 technical lead maria van kherkove said during a recent press briefing a recent study looked into the effectiveness of a prior covid 19 infection in preventing a new infection from the virus a spokesperson for the who said the study showed that prior to omicron those who had recovered from a covid 19 infection had 90 immune protection from reinfection when omicron subvariants ba 1 and ba 2 became dominant the immune protection from a prior infection dropped to an estimated 50 according to the who now a prior infection only gives a person an estimated 40 immune protection from the ba 4 and ba 5 and ba 5 subvariants ba 5 made up an estimated 65 of covid 19 cases in the u s from july 3 9 compared to about 16 of cases attributed to the ba 4 subvariant according to data from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the ba 5 subvariant is immune evading meaning people with prior infection or vaccination are likely still at risk for ba 4 or ba 5 cdc director rochelle walensky said during a white house covid 19 response team briefing on july 12 mutations in both the ba 4 and ba 5 subvariants appear to help them escape immunity from both vaccination and prior infection sheldon campbell a professor of laboratory medicine at yale school of medicine said joseph fauver an assistant professor in the epidemiology department at the university of nebraska s college of public health told verify that the ba 5 subvariant is absolutely capable of causing reinfections and has already done so researchers with the beth israel deaconess medical center a teaching hospital of harvard medical school also evaluated antibody responses to multiple omicron subvariants in 27 people who received their primary covid 19 vaccine series and booster shot and 27 people who had previously contracted covid 19 their research was published in a letter to the new england journal of medicine on june 22 2022 they found that antibody responses to ba 4 and ba 5 were approximately three times lower than to the omicron subvariants ba 1 and ba 2 meaning ba 4 and ba 5 are substantially more likely to evade immunity from either a vaccine or prior infection there is no evidence right now to suggest that ba 4 or ba 5 cause more severe disease compared to other omicron subvariants according to public health leaders and experts who spoke with verify

the political repercussions of sunday s by poll win for former prime minister imran khan and his pti will take time to play out but the word from the markets is already in the stocks recorded a precipitous 1 69 per cent slide and the rupee faced a similar bloodbath against the greenback dollar at the interbank touched record highs closing at rs215 19 marking a gain of rs4 24 in the open market the greenback gained rs5 to reach a record high of rs216 50 the markets are acting on the fears that the new round of political uncertainty may derail pakistan s multibillion dollar imf bailout again the increased political uncertainty in the wake of the punjab by poll could impact the economic decision making of the present government these fears are largely based on the past actions of khan whose government derailed the imf programme choked other sources of financing and ate into the country s forex reserves months before his ouster the omissions and commissions of his administration weakened the rupee piled up foreign debt and caused the current account deficit to balloon on top of it all his anti american narrative tended to push foreign investment away pakistan s imf programme has been on the rocks since february 2022 precisely because the past government was unable or unwilling to take the decisions timely any hiccup in the imf programme however sends the economy in a tailspin when prime minister shehbaz sharif took over in april his work was cut out for him economic stabilization the process that subsequently put the country s economy back on an even keel was both time consuming and painful only last week finance minister miftah ismail announced his government s success in averting default now those gains seem set to erode any change in the political setup should not derail economic stability there should be no doubt that the imf can hold talks with any government including a caretaker government however pakistan has to meet all imf conditions upfront and with the imf board due to meet in the last week of august to approve the revival of pakistan s extended fund facility eff islamabad cannot afford any delays in implementing the agreed prior actions the implementation of pakistan s economic reform agenda under the imf programme requires political ownership and how eager the sharif administration can be to provide that ownership after losing the punjab by polls is anybody s guess the bottom line is that pakistan is stuck with the imf for now it is immaterial if sharif is in the hot seat or a succeeding or caretaker prime minister for a country teetering on the brink of default the only thing that matters is that the reforms agreed with the fund are implemented in letter and spirit and on the dot any attempts to stall or delay an agreed prior action will push pakistan towards sovereign default and averting that again may not be easy or even possible any misadventure of un budgeted subsidies for political gains could again be a recipe for disaster

emphasis on party unity ahead of the once every five year party congress conclusion over the long term whether xi can extend his tenure matters less than the sustainability of the chinese way of running the economy and the country if fiscal indicators continue to deteriorate it is possible that the supreme leader could double down on beijing s policy of brandishing the sword over sovereignty disputes in the south china sea and the east china sea an invasion of taiwan would allow the ccp not only to divert the attention of a disgruntled public but would also enable beijing to declare martial law in order to tamp down the increasingly frequent and daring acts of rebellion by chinese from all backgrounds a china that is even more bellicose in its projection of hard and soft power would also tend to enhance the status and potency of a beijing originated axis of likeminded authoritarian states such as russia north korea thailand and myanmar the headwinds buffeting the economy are expected to grow stronger particularly given the clear u s readiness to slap sanctions on more chinese firms as well as to deny chinese it firms access to key high technology components cn nytimes com july 6 carnegie endowment april 25 moreover political stability another top priority of the party may be further jeopardized by angry citizens who have lost money due to mismanagement in the financial and real estate sectors despite the relative likelihood that xi will be able to rule for five or even ten more years the supreme leader might be presiding over the inexorable decline of the authoritarian china model which has now fully exposed the cracks in its armor dr willy wo lap lam is a senior fellow at the jamestown foundation and a regular contributor to china brief he is an

suggested but then it looked like a big sell order hit the market sending the index back to be up only 10 points half an hour later but with the order cleared it was all systems go with the big cap banks and resource sectors leading the charge the banks were buoyed by their us counterparts following big moves up post result for citigroup and bank of america floating all boats in the us sector anz bank anz didn t participate as it went into a trading halt on the announcement of its intention to acquire suncorp s sun banking division requiring a big capital raise at a sizeable discount suncorp jumped 6 1 but the deal is pending treasurer accc approval which is not a given anz bank also took the opportunity to provide a trading update indicating growth in both margins and loans in the june quarter the financials sector closed up 1 4 on the day but arched rivals the resource sectors also posted strong gains off arguably oversold levels some stability in the iron ore price

through seems misplaced but the futures are down 21 points this morning one bad apple it was all going along swimmingly on wall street last night as the dow reached a gain of 350 points then the wheels fell off mixed metaphor sorry apple announced it plans to slow hiring and spending growth in some divisions next year in anticipation of a potential economic downturn apple is not the first big company to make such an announcement google did so recently amazon not so long ago but given the biggest company is considered by the market of some sort of rock of gibraltar ever reliable as more a seller of things rather than just ephemera the impact was felt not only in market cap influence but in sentiment apple only fell 2 but is one of only two mega techs in all three major indices microsoft and appears in a wealth of etfs nor is apple the first company to warn of an economic slowdown a couple of weeks ago zuckerburg meta warned of the worst downturn in recent history and earlier dimon jpmorgan warned of a hurricane approaching it dampens the mood as us earnings season ramps up ibm dow reported after the bell this morning beat on both earnings and revenues and is currently down 4 the issue there is likely a significant drag on earnings from the strong us dollar as reported and the warning it sounds for other multinationals fortunately it means australia has the opposite problem before the bell goldman sachs dow posted a solid result enough to send it up another 2 5 on top of the banks all taking off on friday night on earnings from citigroup and wells fargo yet aside from the impact apple had on the technology and communication services sectors the worst performer was healthcare 2 1 which is a bit hard to connect otherwise the wash up was not dissimilar to our market yesterday healthcare staples utilities and real estate were all down while energy outperformed and materials snuck into the green it was also notable that nyse volumes closed roughly two to one to the buy side highlighting last night was really just about big tech netflix reports tonight we recall that last quarter the stock was absolutely carted when it announced a big miss on subscriber growth confirming the pull forward of earnings so many companies enjoyed during lockdowns and most of which are now right back where they started we might also note the odds of the
