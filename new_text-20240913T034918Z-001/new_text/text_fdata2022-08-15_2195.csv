75 cents and you feed yourself we usually took the meal he said todd s schooling to a back seat to work it was long hours out in the field and it was hot he remembered advertisement article continues

glimpse of the north african shoreline advertisement article continues below this ad it looked so beautiful there was so much color he said noting that the brick and stucco buildings in north africa were often painted in bright and varied colors the distant colorful visage turned out to be mere fragments of the city that had been when we got there not a building was left in town they d all been

ukraine since before the start of russia s demilitarisation operation there several eastern member states have managed to demilitarise themselves without moscow having to lift a finger poland has sent 232 t 72 main battle tanks almost half its entire tank fleet over the border into the ukraine the donbass militias have already captured some examples with almost no miles on the clock warsaw has ordered 1 000 k2 black panther tanks from south korea and 366 m1 abrams from the us as replacements but deliveries won t be completed until 2026 the czech republic has reportedly handed over all 15 of its mi 24 helicopter gunships one of the types russia is using to pound the ukrainian army along with 56 infantry fighting vehicles 40 self propelled artillery vehicles and 20 grad style 122mm multi launch rocket system mlrs trucks after donating an s 300 surface to air missile sam system neighbouring slovakia is weighing up sending its one squadron of 11 mig 29 fighter jets the government is seeking guarantees from neighbouring countries that their air forces will defend its airspace until it can find replacements if it decides to give up its entire fixed wing combat capability meanwhile the defence ministry has ordered 14 f 16 multi role fighters from the us an aircraft from the 1970s that the mig 29 was built to outfly but the first aircraft won t arrive until 2024 at least the slovaks had the sense not to give up 30 t 72s after germany only offered them 15 leopard 2 tanks to replace them and just last week it emerged that north macedonia one of the newest balkanised statelets in the balkans transferred four su 25 ground attack jets it bought from the ukraine in 2001 back there along with 31 russian t 72s disbanding its army s only armoured battalion in the process in return the us will give the country s army some joint light tactical vehicles an oversized four seat jeep with just enough armour to stop a rifle bullet if russia really did decide to roll the tanks into the former warsaw treaty countries like their increasingly hysterical politicians claim moscow is planning they would likely face little more opposition than infantrymen armed with rifles and machine guns the battalion sized tactical groups of troops from the us uk and other big boy nato members stationed in eastern europe would make no difference they re only there to provide the pretext for escalation to the nuclear threshold as andrei martyanov says scraping the barrel in fact the stream of announced if not yet delivered packages of military aid is really starting to scrape the barrel of nato inventories the uk announced on july 21 it was sending 20 155mm self propelled guns although those had already been accounted for months earlier when they were bought from belgium s reserves the ministry of defence also pledged 36 105mm four inch artillery pieces not even more the much vaunted six inch 155mm m777s partly made in the uk the 105mm shells hold about a quarter as much high explosive as the 155s and can reach a maximum 12 miles compared to 19 for the bigger guns the us has promised four more of the holy himars plus another 72 000 155mm shells for guns which have mostly been bombed already russia also claims to have hit six out of the 12 himars launchers the us has already sent and which have failed to turn the tide of the war the two really high profile attacks launched with these precision weapons so far have been to blow holes in the roadway of a bridge across the dnieper river to kherson which was swiftly substituted with a pontoon crossing and killing 50 azov battalion members at a prison camp in elenovka just south of donetsk city cbs news in the us has hurriedly pulled its arming ukraine documentary that revealed that about two thirds of western military aid disappeared somewhere between the polish border and the front lines then replaced it with a text article claiming everything was ok now honest it doesn t matter because it had already been widely reported that all sorts of gear was turning up for sale on dark web pages and out of the back of car boots all over europe meanwhile the new york times widely recognised as the official newspaper of the ruling party in the us ran an op ed on august 1 distancing the biden regime in washington from its zelensky ite client state in kiev up the arsenal the us military industrial complex has long styled itself the arsenal of democracy but nowadays its more of a bottom half premiership team like southampton as the now famous royal united services institute

lloyd austin s vain plan to weaken the russian armed forces in a war of attrition to the last drop of ukrainian blood it will now take years for the arms industry to replace them due to the shortage of microchips caused by sanctions on russia back on the pr front line crunching the numbers from the russian mod s daily briefings has become increasingly meaningless as they now claim to have destroyed far more of almost every kind of equipment than the ukraine had at the start of the conflict or has received since the best one can do is look at overall trends in those statistics the numbers of fixed wing aircraft helicopters sams and to a lesser extent tanks and other armoured vehicles has noticeably topped out in the past few weeks either the ukrainians are getting better at concealing them or they re keeping them far from the front in reserve for the heavily trailed but yet to materialise counter offensive in kherson or they re just running out of stuff for the russians to blow up kiev is finally admitting its army is taking hundreds of casualties a day in line with the russian claims but only as emotional blackmail to the west to send unfeasible amounts of equipment and munitions it s almost as if the two vlads putin and zelensky conspired together to disarm the us allied former soviet and socialist states and make ukrainian black marketeers a fortune in the

a top economist at morgan stanley has warned it is too soon to see the slight reduction in interest rates as a sign the economy has turned a corner insisting it was way premature to celebrate on wednesday the government released the latest consumer price index report which showed inflation hit 8 5 percent for the month of july down from 9 1 percent in june on a monthly basis prices were unchanged from june to july the smallest such rise for more than two years falling gas prices were credited for last month s relative decline from june but this was driven partly by fewer americans heading to the pumps or filling up less often lisa shalett chief investment officer of morgan stanley wealth management said it was a head fake to believe that the worst was past the idea that inflation may have peaked in our humble opinion may be correct directionally but may also be a little bit of a head fake with regard to this idea that hey game over problem solved the fed has conquered the day and fed credibility is back and all of that she said speaking on friday on bloomberg s what goes up podcast lisa shalett chief investment officer of morgan stanley wealth management spoke on thursday to the hosts of bloomberg s what goes up podcast she said that a lot of things have gone right regarding global demand for energy slowing and supply chain issues easing which has helped bring down the soaring cost of food but for the markets to be celebrating as they have been since the middle of june our guess is we re way premature for that she said she expected jerome powell the chair of the fed to be happy at wednesday s data and said june s inflation of 9 1 percent appeared to be a peak but she warned inflation was still excessively high if i m jerome powell i probably do have a smile on my face and i m glad that energy prices went my way she said but let s get real here people i mean 8 5 percent on your headline and a core that was really unchanged at close to 6 percent is nowhere near a sustainable level it s three times your target of 2 percent federal reserve board chairman jerome powell is seen on july 27 in washington dc falling gas prices pictured gave americans a slight break from the pain of rocketing inflation last month though the surge in overall prices slowed only modestly from the four decade high it reached in june a lack of affordable options is driving down home sales in the us the fastest drops in newly pending sales from may to june happened in san jose 24 3 per cent seattle 23 9 per cent and salt lake city 20 8 per cent shalett described the first six months of this year as a very very textbook bear market noting that some of the sharpest drops were felt in the tech sector folks think the data s going to get more constructive and we get folks thinking that they re going to find some bargains and they go in and they find the bargains where things have sold off the most she said and some of the biggest damage as we know was in the unprofitable tech space some of the meme stock space and some of the more core pieces of the nasdaq and faang and so that s driven this hope that the worst is over she added that there was more bad news to come folks who are true students of the market know that in every bear market we have these retracement rallies they are head fake rallies u s treasury yields dipped on friday after a volatile week as investors evaluated whether an apparent slowdown in inflation increases could reduce the speed of federal reserve interest rate hikes data on thursday showed u s producer prices unexpectedly fell in july it came a day after news from the cpi for july the data has prompted some hopes that the worst of inflation increases may be in the rear view mirror still many analysts and investors say that more proof will be needed before it can be determined how fed policy could be affected the theme here is that if indeed the monthly inflation prints are a little more stable we ll need fewer rate hikes and then long term inflation s unlikely to come down quite as far said guy lebas chief fixed income strategist at janney montgomery scott in philadelphia however lebas echoed shalett in emphasizing that it was too soon to celebrate i would maintain skepticism until we at least see one or two more inflation prints that signal that rate hikes are ready to slow lebas said low liquidity has also added to market volatility with many traders out for summer holidays and as some investors are wary to take positions until there is more clarity on the outlook
the energy market shockwaves from russia s invasion of ukraine mean the world is only getting more dependent on the most polluting fuel and as demand expands and prices surge to all time highs that means blockbuster profits for the biggest coal producers commodities giant glencore plc reported core earnings from its coal unit surged almost 900 per cent to 8 9 billion in the first half more than starbucks corp or nike inc made in an entire year no 1 producer coal india ltd s profit nearly tripled also to a record while the chinese companies that produce more than half the world s coal saw first half earnings more than double to a combined 80 billion also read parliament committee suggests centre to reduce coal import increase local production the massive profits are yielding big pay days for investors but they will make it even harder for the world to kick the habit of burning coal for fuel as producers work to squeeze out extra tons and boost investment in new mines if more coal is mined and burned that would make the likelihood of keeping global warming to less than 1 5 degrees celsius even more remote
17 18 the quorn fermentation and evolution in fermenters in the late 1950s forecasters predicted a worldwide shortage of protein rich foods within 30 years that is by the 1980s it was hoped that single cell protein scp particularly microbes could provide a means of solving the anticipated world food shortage by industrial production of cheap protein alternatives to meat protein potentially using wastes as substrates fungal scp must compete with established animal feeds like soya meal which is a product of conventional farming so a novel microbial protein that requires costly research and development and or unusual and expensive production facilities will not to be able to compete the basic requirements for a protein produced for human consumption as opposed to being a feed material for farm animals are that it should be cheap to manufacture able to be put into large scale production have a high protein content including essential amino acids in 1964 the rank hovis mcdougall rhm research centre set out to develop a way of converting starch which is a waste product from cereal processing into a protein rich food rhm decided to produce its new food from a filamentous fungus because of the long history of man using fungi as food it is relatively easy to harvest fungal mycelia from culture broths it is possible to formulate food products from filamentous fungi which have the appropriate smell taste and texture that is the sensory or organoleptic properties of an acceptable food the market virtues of the material centre on its filamentous structure which enables it to simulate the fibrous nature of meat coupled with the inherent nutritional value of fungal biomass this permits the product to be sold as a low fat low calorie cholesterol free health food initially it was deliberately not compared to meat in any way but sales increased dramatically when marketed as a healthy meat substitute table 12 that can be efficiently produced table 13

the uk foods standards committee to serve as the generic name for a food product resulting from the fermentation of fusarium venenatum the material was produced by marlow foods limited set up in 1984

known as the quorn fungus a ten year study 1970 1980 of the product included toxicology testing involving feeding trials on 11 animal species including pigs calves baboons that showed no adverse effect on animals or offspring trials with 2500 human volunteers which also showed no ill effects or immunological response and demonstration that the bacteriological load was similar to chicken or fish in storage eventually a 2 million word 26 volume report was submitted to the then ministry of agriculture fisheries and food for approval which was granted and the product was first sold to the public in january 1985 additional toxicology testing of quornâ by astrazeneca was completed in december 1996 for submission to the united statesâ food and drug administration fda approval being needed before quornâ could be sold in the usa the fda issued a gras notice gras generally recognized as safe to marlow foods grn 91 for mycoprotein as a food ingredient in january 2002 and frozen quornâ was sold for the first time in the usa in august 2002 no food eaten by humans has been subjected to a more rigorous safety testing than quornâ it is important though to appreciate that all this food safety testing applies to just one rather unusual strain of fusarium venenatum the strain designated a3 5 and specifically the isolate designated a3 5 3 which is derived from freeze dried stock cultures deposited at the international mycological institute uk in 1969 the genus fusarium comprises many plant pathogenic species most of which produce mycotoxins when placed under suitable in vitro growth conditions particularly nitrogen limitation these are primarily fumonisins and trichothecenes a class of sesquiterpenes fig 10 17 but also zearalenone fig 10 21 and gibberellic acids fig 10 18 certain strains even including the production strain a3 5 3 of f venenatum have been shown to produce mycotoxins when grown under severe nitrogen limitation fortunately the fermenter conditions used for mycoprotein production with excess nutrients present do not induce mycotoxin production nevertheless samples of quornâ mycoprotein are taken regularly from the production line to test for the presence of mycotoxins mycotoxins have not been detected in any production run in the long history of mycoprotein production see discussion and references in whittaker et al 2020 although mycoproteinâ was originally conceived as a protein rich food to supplement what was thought to be a declining world supply of conventional foods by the early 1980s the predicted global shortage of protein rich foods had not materialised consequently marlow foods decided to sell quornâ mycoproteinâ as a new healthy food which lacked animal fats and cholesterol is low in calories and saturated fats mycoprotein is also high in dietary fibre it has more dietary fibre fungal cell walls than wholemeal bread a part of the human diet linked to disease prevention colosimo et al 2021 this dramatic change in marketing policy was justified by a survey in 1989 which showed that almost half the uk population was reducing its intake of red meats whilst a fifth of young people were vegetarians in line with current dietary guidelines mycoprotein is high in protein and fibre and low in fat cholesterol sodium and sugar mycoprotein may help maintain healthy blood cholesterol levels promote muscle synthesis control glucose and insulin levels and increase satiety finnigan et al 2019 a more recent independent systematic review of published nutrition studies has confirmed that â overall given growing interest in sustainable proteins and accruing health evidence for mycoprotein firmer embedment with food based dietary guidelines is now worthy of considerationâ derbyshire delange 2021 in the 1990s it was decided to market mycoproteinâ as a meat analogue today quornâ mycoproteinâ is sold in burgers sausages and analogues of sliced meats and as an ingredient in over 50 pre prepared meals one of the simplest quorn foods are the meat like â piecesâ which are mildly flavoured but fully textured and sold for use by the end user as an ingredient in a wide range of home cooked meals we have mentioned the food value of quorn in section 11 4 here we will concentrate on the biotechnology of its production wiebe 2004 finnigan 2011 finnigan et al 2019 whittaker et al 2020 all the production systems described earlier were considered batch and fed batch because they have the advantages of being simple system commonly used in industrial fermentations used for manufacture of â high market valueâ products though they have the disadvantage of being too expensive when the product is the biomass because a new fermentation needs to be set up every few days continuous flow cultures have the advantage of providing continuous production of biomass over long periods of time consequently comparatively cheap the main disadvantages were that the process is technically very difficult and had not previously been implemented with filamentous fungi on an industrial scale a continuous flow culture system was chosen for production of f venenatum a3 5 biomass because much higher productivities can be achieved in continuous culture than in batch culture up to the beginning of 1994 the air lift fermenter used for mycoproteinâ production was a fermenter originally built by ici at billingham to grow the bacterium methylophilus methylotrophus for the production of an animal feed called pruteen this 40 m3 fermenter christened quorn 1 consisted of an elongated loop about 30 m tall and was operated as a glucose stat at a dilution rate of 0 17 to 0 20 h 1 capable of producing 1 000 tonnes of quornâ mycoproteinâ per annum in late 1993 marlow foods commissioned a new 155 m3 air lift fermenter quorn 2 built on the site of the old pruteen fermenter and this was followed by the construction of quorn 3 the twin of quorn 2 this has allowed mycoproteinâ production to be increased to between 10 000 to 14 000 tonnes per annum the new fermenters are the worldâ s largest continuous flow culture systems each cost â 37 5m to build is 50 m tall and weighs over 250 tonnes by 1997 the two new fermenters had enabled sales of quornâ mycoproteinâ to be increased to about â 74m per annum fig 35 schematic representation of the quorn air lift fermenter used for the production of mycoprotein in continuous flow culture adapted from trinci 1991 1992 1994 and whittaker et al 2020 each 155 m3 fermenter is inoculated with 5 1 of a batch culture containing 50 g biomass and continuous flow is initiated 4 days later in an air lift fermenter most of the oxygen transfer takes place near the base of the relatively wide riser where sterile air is introduced fig 35 and where the height of the fermenter creates a high hydrostatic pressure this together with turbulence and consequently small bubble size provides excellent conditions for oxygen transfer from the gaseous to the liquid phase thus the riser contains a two phase mixture of air and culture flowing together so that air bubbles contribute up to 50 of the volume of the fluid the rate of transfer of oxygen from the gaseous to the liquid phase decreases as the culture flows to the top of the riser where the gas contains about 10 oxygen the low pressure region at the top of the riser causes release of co 2 and the culture then enters the downcomer where at the bottom it is directed into the riser and is again charged with air thereby completing the pressure cycle the culture is maintained at about 30â c by a heat exchanger set into the downcomer to prevent oxygen limitation the downcomer is provided with an oxygen supply the difference in specific gravity of the relatively aerated culture in the riser and the relatively air depleted culture in the downcomer creating a hydrostatic pressure differential ensures that the growing hyphal filaments circulate continuously around the fermenter loop at a rate of about one circulation every 2 minutes for quorn 2 and 3 compared to every 6 minutes for quorn 1 the nitrogen supply for growth which is ammonia is fed into the fermenter with the sterile compressed air at the base of the riser the rate of supply of ammonia to the culture is regulated by a ph monitor set to give a culture ph of 6 0 the nutrient solution is fed to the culture to give a dilution rate in the range 0 17 to 0 20 h 1 and is operated as a glucose stat that is glucose is always in excess and the fungus always grows at âµ max at a biomass concentration of 10 to 15 g l 1 the fermenter is manned on a 24 h basis tests for the presence of mycotoxins are made every 24 h using a method sensitive to two parts per billion tests made to date have all been negative as would be expected for the growth conditions employed the fungus is growing at âµ max whereas toxins are secondary metabolites produced by slow growing or stationary cultures product is harvested continuously and quorn 2 and 3 each produce an output of 30 tonnes h 1 the harvested mycelium cannot be used as harvested if human food contains too much nucleic acid blood uric acid values rise and the excess accumulates as crystalline deposits in joints and tissues leading to the disease known as gout and to kidney stones this is a peculiarity of human metabolism in man uric acid is produced by the breakdown of nucleic acids whereas in other vertebrates the sparingly soluble uric acid is converted to the highly soluble acid allantoin because of this the world health organisation who laid down a recommendation for human ingestion of rna from single cell protein scp sources which for adults was defined as 2 g rna per day with total nucleic acid ingestion from all sources not exceeding 4 g per day fusarium venenatum biomass cultured at a specific growth rate of 0 19 h 1 has a rna content of 8 9 w w which would limit the ingestion of mycoproteinâ to not more than 20 g per day consequently a method was developed to reduce the rna content of mycoproteinâ whilst minimising loss of protein though unfortunately protein loss is still substantial and fibrous structure in this process the temperature of the biomass is raised to 68â c for 20 to 30 minutes to stop growth disrupt ribosomes and activate endogenous rnaases which break down cellular rna to nucleotides which diffuse through the hyphal wall into the culture broth importantly rnaases are more heat resistant than proteases so protein loss is minimised this method is carried out in the culture broth with no other adjustments since a ph of 5 to 6 is optimal for rnaase activity rna reduction has a substantial economic penalty attached to it since as well as removing rna other cell constituents are inevitably lost during this process including perhaps up to 30 of the biomass dry weight and a significant amount of protein but it is essential to reduce the rna content after this treatment the mycoproteinâ contains only 1 w w rna similar to that present in animal liver and well within the 2 w w upper limit recommended by who one of the advantages of using a filamentous fungus rather than a bacterium or yeast for scp is the comparative ease with which mycelia can be harvested after rna reduction fungal biomass is harvested to give a product which contains about 30 w w total solids mycoprotein typically contains 44 protein 18 dietary fibre and only 13 fat the values for beef are 68 0 and 30 respectively the rna reduced mycoprotein dough or â pasteâ is produced at the quorn foods belasis site in billingham county durham england then transported a few miles to the quorn foods stokesley site in north yorkshire for texturing creation of meat like texture using mycoprotein plus any of a range of gelling and firming agents is a complex process which is still not fully understood it clearly depends on the hyphal nature of the mycoprotein and material properties of protein gels formed by denaturation of other added proteins egg albumen in original recipes and for vegetarian products plant proteins like pea and potato proteins in vegan products and gel forming agents like alginate agar locust bean gum and calcium the gel is then influenced by freezing about 50 of the overall texture is achieved after initial freezing with the remainder being developed during about 2 weeks further frozen storage beneficial changes during frozen storage are believed to be due to ice crystal growth increasing the bundling of mycoprotein fibres the mycelium electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic bonding of aromatic residues exposed during protein denaturation as well as disulphide bonds between cysteine residues as a result of this processing mycoproteinâ has the same â chewinessâ and succulence as meat but unlike meat it locks in colourings and flavourings even when cooked quality control checks are carried out at every stage of the process to ensure that the end product is of a consistently high quality although fusarium venenatum fermentations were originally intended to run indefinitely in practice they are terminated 1000 h about 6 weeks or less after the onset of continuous flow although the shear forces experienced by mycelia in stirred tank the rhm method and air lift the marlow foods method fermenters differ the morphology and growth of mycelia of fusarium venenatum in the two types of fermenter are similar and highly branched colonial mutants fig 36 arise in both systems at approximately the same time after inoculation fig 36 comparison of the morphology of mycelia of fusarium venenatum a3 5 and three highly branched colonial mutants c106 cc1 1 and mc1 1 now called â c variantsâ that arose spontaneously in experimental laboratory chemostat cultures biomass made up of colonial mutants possesses the same chemical composition and is as nutritious as the parental strain but presence of colonials changes the texture of mycoprotein causing it to become more easily crumbled friable so the product standard cannot be maintained the culture then needs to be ended and a new one started appearance of colonials causes premature termination of the fermentations and consequent loss of productivity but note that there are patents that define the use of the friable mycoprotein for vegan analogues of dairy products â milkâ â creamâ â ice creamâ and spreads similar to butter because the texture of the colonials mimics the fat globules that make up the authentic dairy products when grown in plate culture highly branched mutants form colonies which are much more compact than those of the parental strain and expand in radius much more slowly than the parental strain this is why they are called colonial mutants despite their reduced radial growth rate in turbidostat or chemostat culture at a high dilution rate colonial mutants rapidly supplant the parental strain fig 37 fig 37 colonial mutant population expressed as a percentage of the total population generated during glucose limited laboratory chemostat cultures of f venenatum grown at 0 19 h 1 the colonial mutants appear after about 107 generations range 99 115 prevention or delay in the appearance of colonial mutants in mycoprotein fermentations would enhance productivity and decrease the unit cost of the product understanding how this premature termination of the fermentations might be controlled requires an understanding of the evolution of microbial cultures in chemostat culture gresham hong 2015 when an organism is grown in a chemostat the relationship between its specific growth rate âµ and the concentration of the growth limiting substrate s is described by the monod equation we quoted earlier where âµ max is the maximum specific growth rate of the organism and k s the saturation constant is a measure of the organism s affinity for the limiting substrate k s is the substrate concentration at which the organism grows at half maximal rate if cultivation in a chemostat is prolonged the microbial population adapts to its environment by mutation and natural selection resulting in the appearance of new advantageous strains the competitive advantage of an advantageous mutant relative to the parental strain can be quantified by calculating the selection coefficient s where p t is the concentration of the mutant at time t q t is the concentration of the parental strain at time t and p 0 and q 0 are the initial concentrations of each strain the selection coefficient is a measure of the extent to which selection is acting to reduce the relative contribution of a given phenotype to the next generation it is a number between zero and one if s 1 selection against the phenotype is total and it makes no contribution to the next generation if s 0 there is no selection against the phenotype at all selectively neutral compared to the favoured phenotype for example if the favoured phenotype produces 100 viable progeny and the alternative phenotype produces only 90 then s 0 1 and there is adverse selection pressure against the alternative phenotype an alternative way of expressing this is to describe the fitness of the favoured phenotype as 1 0 and that of the alternative phenotype as 0 9 selective advantages for mutants appearing in chemostat cultures have been divided into two main categories mutants which have a higher maximum specific growth rate âµ max than the parental strain and than the parental strain and mutants which have a lower saturation constant k s for the limiting nutrient than the parental strain the former âµ max mutants are usually selected at high dilution rates in a chemostat or turbidostat and k s mutants are usually selected at low dilution rates in a chemostat in contrast to advantageous mutations mutations that confer neither a selective advantage nor disadvantage to the mutant relative to the parental strain neutral mutations accumulate very slowly in the population maximally at the forward mutation rate and never attain high concentrations unless they are linked to an advantageous mutation periodic decreases in neutral mutant population have been observed in bacterial cultures maintained in the chemostat for very long periods this phenomenon is referred to as periodic selection it is possible to study periodic selection in f venenatum because the fungus produces macroconidia which are formed from uninucleate phialides consequently the nuclei of macroconidia harvested from a culture provide a sample of the nuclei present in the mycelial biomass and periodic selection can be followed in fusarium venenatum by monitoring neutral mutations occurring in macroconidia fig 38 fig 38 periodic selection in a glucose limited laboratory chemostat culture of fusarium venenatum concentrations of biomass total macroconidia and macroconidia spontaneously resistant to 250 âµm cycloheximide in a glucose limited chemostat culture of f venenatum a3 5 grown at 25â c and ph 5 8 at a dilution rate of 0 10 h 1 on modified vogel s medium the decreases in the concentrations of spontaneous cycloheximide resistant macroconidia in the population are associated with the appearance of other advantageous mutants of unknown phenotype this phenomenon is known as periodic selection and similar observations have been made with aspergillus spp although neutral mutants accumulate at a linear rate in a chemostat their concentration decreases when an advantageous mutant arises that does not carry the neutral mutation this phenomenon of periodic selection provides a means of determining when advantageous mutants appear in a population even when the phenotype of the mutant is not known for example the appearance of advantageous mutants in chemostat populations of fusarium venenatum a3 5 has been determined by monitoring increases and decreases in the levels of chlorate and cycloheximide resistant macroconidia in the population at least three advantageous mutants of unknown phenotype appeared in the glucose limited chemostat population of f venenatum a3 5 shown in fig 38 in other glucose limited chemostat cultures of fusarium venenatum a3 5 that were grown at a dilution rate of 0 19 h 1 periodic selection occurred once every 124 h or 34 generations weibe et al 1993 1994 1995 in a glucose limited chemostat culture of f venenatum a3 5 grown at a dilution rate of 0 05 h 1 doubling time of 13 9 h the k s values of some of the populations were determined and found to decrease with evolution of the culture thus growing f venenatum a3 5 in a glucose limited chemostat at a low dilution rate results in the selection of advantageous mutants of unaltered mycelial morphology but which have a higher affinity for the substrate than the parental strain which might mean that they have more efficient uptake systems for glucose in experiments with glucose ammonium and magnesium limited chemostat cultures of fusarium venenatum a3 5 grown at dilution rates of 0 18 or 0 19 h 1 colonial mutants were first detected in glucose limited cultures at 360 386 and 421 h 99 106 and 115 generations after the onset of continuous flow and in ammonium and magnesium limited chemostat cultures at 447 h 115 generations and 260 h 71 generations respectively after the onset of continuous flow whenever the evolution of these cultures was allowed to progress the colonial mutants eventually formed more than 90 of the total population experiment shows that the highly branched phenotype is not responsible for the selective advantage of colonial mutants rather the advantage seems to result from a metabolic alteration which has a pleiotropic effect on branching simpson et al 1998 the development of strategies to prevent or delay the appearance of colonial mutants in industrial mycoproteinâ fermentations is of considerable economic importance three possible strategies have been identified so far operating the fermenter at a low dilution rate periodically changing the selection pressure in the fermenter and isolating or genetically engineering sparsely branched strains of f venenatum which are more stable than a3 5 at least as far as mycelial morphology is concerned however in the production process advantages gained by delaying the appearance of colonial mutants by operating the fermenter at a lower dilution rate would be offset by the decreased rate at which biomass is produced under these conditions similarly periodically changing selection pressure introduces unwelcome complication to the production process with a potential for varying the chemical content of the product however it is possible to select variants of fusarium venenatum which are morphologically more stable than a3 5 in particular in laboratory scale glucose stat trials with diploid strains of a3 5 colonial mutants did not appear until 1 957 and 2 028 h after the onset of continuous flow timings which are equivalent to 540 and 594 generations compared to the 99 to 115 generations for the haploid a3 5 premier foods bought rhm in march 2007 and in january 2011 exponent private equity and intermediate capital group epe icg

which were first filed in 1985 expired in 2010 although it will be difficult to compete with the present ownerâ s 30 plus yearsâ experience with the fermentation method fermentation tower and related equipment a potential competitor company claims to have developed a new biotechnology process to produce mycoprotein cheaper than ever before and with zero waste 3f bio is a technology spinout from the university of strathclyde which is producing a mycoprotein product called abundaâ its own patented technique involves integrating the production of bioethanol with the fermentation of mycoprotein the marlow foods method for producing mycoprotein uses glucose as a feedstock whereas 3f bioâ s process uses hydrolysed starch from one or more cereal grains according to european patent no ep3209789b the 3f bio invention relates to an integrated method for producing and isolating mycoprotein produced by fusarium venenatum on hydrolysed starch feed stock followed by production of ethanol from the spent partially fermented broth by â a micro organisms s â presumably yeast s 3f bio ltd submitted a generally recognised as safe gras notice grn 945 to fda in 2020 â largely based on the fact that this product as produced by the notifier is substantially the same in composition to mycoprotein that is currently on the market which is manufactured by the previous notifier grn 91 under identical conditions of intended use using the same strain and through an equivalent manufacturing process â another process uses edible filamentous fungi to convert a cheap and low nutritional value by product of the pea processing industry into what is called â a vegan mycoproteinâ concentrate for human food applications souza et al 2018 the expectation of major market success for mycoprotein in the near future is very good news for the whole world why this is so derives from the arithmetic that compares the size of the human population constantly increasing with the amount of agricultural land available to feed that population constantly reducing as we build on it and perhaps reducing further as the climate changes as it stands the earth does not have enough land for all its human inhabitants to enjoy an â affluentâ diet which is one that includes meat from the billions of animals see section 17 20 that are farmed each year this is because so much agricultural land is devoted to feeding those animals with grasses and cereals and conversion of these crops to meat protein is very inefficient assessment of the environmental impacts of food production in general is a growing concern poore nemecek 2018 willett et al 2019 but meat free alternatives produced by industrial fermentation like mycoprotein would certainly safeguard the earthâ s resources while satisfying our taste for meat like products updated may 2021

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox there s something about pennsylvania s political dna that s playing out in this year s crucial senate race it s not that we have one unifying statewide identity but we are a state with lots of intense regional identities that can oftentimes breed distrust of out of towners people don t say they re from pennsylvania they say pittsburgh or philly nepa or the lehigh valley western pa or johnstown the philly burbs or delco the dividing lines aren t along our state borders but east vs west wawa vs sheetz city vs rural steelers nation vs go birds and philly vs everybody and it s amid this brand of parochialism that mehmet oz has struggled to quiet an onslaught of attacks about his pennsylvania ties oz a celebrity doctor who moved here from new jersey to run for the seat was likely always going to face challenges appealing to everyday pennsylvanians campaign strategists former politicians and political scientists say but something about pennsylvania s ethos seems to be making it even harder every single thing about our state promotes local identity said ben forstate a democratic political analyst from western pennsylvania more specifically allegheny county more specifically pittsburgh and more specifically the north hills neighborhood the state is carved up into tiny townships municipalities and school districts all with unique tax laws and individual character you vote for everything you expect your politicians to be accessible forstate said we like people from our own regions we re suspicious of people from other regions we don t like outsiders pennsylvania doesn t have a positive personal identity but we definitely have a negative one and that s where dr oz is provoking some sort of weird immune response pennsylvania doesn t have one state fair but dozens of county based ones we list the home counties of candidates right there on the ballot next to their name and those hometowns have ended up swaying elections and while every state has some degree of hometown pride perhaps most notably pennsylvania ranks fourth in states with the most residents who were born where they live that hyper regionalism could be why the carpetbagging attacks against oz resonate in social media posts banner planes billboards and via new jersey celebrities lt gov john fetterman has relentlessly shouted the same message at voters oz isn t from here at the same time fetterman s branded himself as a pennsylvania everyman dressed in shorts and a hoodie whose latest campaign ad proclaimed he has pennsylvania in his blood pennsylvania is not new york oz who grew up in delaware and went to medical and business school at the university of pennsylvania has started crisscrossing the state to campaign but he s struggled to shake the outsider label in a late july poll 37 of voters said they were extremely concerned oz may not be familiar enough with the state of pennsylvania to carry out the job of senator effectively an additional 34 were somewhat or very concerned pennsylvania is dr oz s home campaign spokesperson brittany yanick said he grew up in the greater philadelphia region went to school in pennsylvania met his wife and got married in pennsylvania and currently resides in bryn athyn where his wife s family has lived for a hundred years former gov ed rendell who was born in the riverdale section of the bronx but now lives in the east falls section of philadelphia recalled running for reelection in the late 1990s and being blasted for not being from the state i d lived here for 30 years he said he thinks any candidate moving into pennsylvania might encounter similar issues i think because we re located between new york and washington it builds up a little bit of an inferiority complex which breeds parochialism rendell said we don t like to be used no matter who it is we wouldn t like to be used by hillary or bobby or mehmet oz clinton and kennedy both famously relocated to new york to run for senate seats there new york by contrast is a state where people are constantly moving in and out if you re in a place with a lot of cosmopolitan transplants then being a cosmopolitan transplant doesn t matter so much said robin kolodny a political science professor at temple university that s not this state kolodny also noted pennsylvania s population is older than in other rust belt states which may lead people to be more entrenched where they live and in fetterman born and raised in york and a longtime resident of braddock she said oz has to compete with someone who wakes up looking like he s from pennsylvania rendell also thinks philadelphia s own complex contributes to a feeling of unjustified inferiority that can inspire an us vs them mentality we don t think of ourselves as a significant state when in fact if was located in say kentucky and we had done all the things to contribute to the birth of the country we d be like chicago we d be considered the dominant city in the region rendell said oz isn t moving from just anywhere he came over from new jersey one thing that might unite pennsylvanians trolling our neighbor to the east matt beynon a gop campaign strategist who is from chinchilla a six block area between scranton and clarks summit said the oz new jersey attacks gave him flashbacks to a 2018 congressional race in that contest u s rep matt cartwright went after gop opponent john chrin for having moved from new jersey before the race every ad was jersey john chrin beynon said and i felt bad for chrin because his family actually has really really strong ties here but the attacks were effective beynon said and might speak to a commonality half of your readers might not like this but dislike of the state of new jersey kinda unites republicans and democrats across pennsylvania he said kolodny agreed she thinks pennsylvania s familiarity sometimes rivalry with new jersey might make it easier to poke fun at after all you don t laugh at a joke you don t understand i do think the fact that it s new jersey is key kolodny said if the guy had moved from cincinnati to pittsburgh do you think it would be the same while oz trails fetterman in polling he did win the primary albeit narrowly against pennsylvanians with stronger ties to the state jeff bartos a montgomery county developer who is now co chair of oz s campaign ran against him and attacked him for being a carpetbagger voters didn t care about that he said time after time when i talked about my deep roots and lifelong residency voters came back to me to talk about inflation crime quality of life issues national security make sure you re seen beynon doesn t think oz is getting a particularly fair shake given how oz s wife has deep family roots in montgomery county but he does think oz has the right strategy in aggressively hitting the campaign trail if you re getting branded as an outsider in pennsylvania ingratiate yourself make sure you re seen he said you have to be part of the community just don t gaffe while doing it suggested paul maslin a longtime campaign strategist who lives in los angeles but spent ages 5 to 11 in lemoyne a town across the river from harrisburg maslin can still recite the answer pete dawkins gave to reporters when he was asked if he understood the interests of new jerseyans having only recently moved there it was 1988 and dawkins was running against democratic sen frank lautenberg in the new jersey senate race maslin said dawkins replied that of all the people he d met all over the world nowhere had he and his wife found people as kind and decent as right here in our garden state this is the home of the sopranos maslin said noting that no one in new jersey calls it our garden state it s a version of don t wear gucci loafers to the iowa state fair or order swiss on your cheesesteak and in pennsylvania it s good to know the state s history as well because one unifying theme is pride in how we shaped the country you go to gettysburg that little town that battlefield is everything to adams county beynon said pittsburgh i think rightly views

wesley muller louisiana illuminator tax breaks in the bill would jumpstart green transition in petrochemical industry policy experts say louisiana oil indutry representatives are taking a cautiously optimistic position as it they review changes the bill will usher in to the energy landscape democrats and republicans continue to debate whether the bill will reduce inflation or impact middle income taxpayers louisiana is one of the better positioned states to take advantage of clean energy provisions in the inflation reduction act that won final approval friday in congress some policy experts say with 485 billion in new spending offset by 790 billion in revenue and savings the legislation includes the nation s largest ever investment in clean and renewable energy and significant reductions in health care costs for people covered under the affordable care act and medicare the bill won passage in the house friday president joe biden has backed the bill and is expected to sign it into law with more fossil fuel and petrochemical facilities than most other states louisiana could be at the forefront of significant transformations in energy production and industrial manufacturing the bill would usher in texas and louisiana will be some of the better positioned states said david dismukes professor of environmental sciences at lsu everybody s kind of got their hand in the pie on this from chemical manufacturers pipeline companies to permitting companies and lawyers energy transition oil and gas built port fourchon now the port is finding its role in a future without it related will louisiana lead energy transition or be left behind universities pivot programs to lead among a long list of energy related provisions the bill most notably extends and expands the investment tax credit and production tax credit on clean energy projects they include solar wind hydroelectric geothermal nuclear hydrogen produced by renewables stand alone energy storage such as utility scale lithium batteries and other forms of emission free electricity generation it creates a manufacturing tax credit for equipment such as solar panels wind turbines battery cells and other components produced in the u s extends the carbon capture tax credit to 203 and lowers the requirements to allow more facilities to qualify the bill expands offshore oil and gas leasing while imposing certain fees for the release of excess emissions who will benefit industrial facilities outside the energy sector such as chemical and cement manufacturers can earn tax credits if they use clean energy technologies in their manufacturing processes dismukes said the wide swath of proposed tax credits will be appealing to louisiana s industrial companies and others that support and do business with them there s a lot of different layers in the industry that can benefit from this dismukes said from carbon capture all the way down to storage we re just in a better position to do that compared to other places around the country those tax credits will remain in effect until 2032 or once annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the united states is equal to or less than 25 of current emissions whichever is later companies can receive higher rates on the tax credits if they meet certain wage and apprenticeship requirements if they use materials produced in the u s or by siting projects in low income areas referred to as energy communities in congress house passes inflation reduction act sends it to biden a bad situation more climate action needed to curb louisiana u s emissions goal by 2030 rep troy carter sr d new orleans said the energy communities provision of the bill could benefit black households which spend more of their income on energy and experience a median energy burden 64 greater than white households so this is also an environmental justice concern carter said in an email this bill is the most aggressive action in history to combat the existential crisis of climate change which is threatening louisiana s coast people culture and infrastructure the health of many louisiana communities are threatened by the dangerous pollution and toxins from domestic fossil fuel production what the louisiana oil industry thinks carter said the tax credits could push louisiana s burgeoning wind power industry over the top an opinion shared by southern renewable energy association director simon mahan the ira will turbocharge the renewable energy industries in louisiana mahan said renewables are inflation busters because the fuel is free by being unaffected by global commodity markets ratepayer s electric bills will be lower and more predictable on the consumer side the bill extends tax credits on purchases of new and used electric vehicles energy efficient appliances home solar panels and other so called green home systems the louisiana mid continent oil gas association has taken a cautiously optimistic position as it reviews the changes that the bill will usher into the energy industry lmoga welcomes the positive progress on gulf of mexico lease sales and the inclusion of provisions that address the energy transition creating more operational certainty for our industry and encouraging continued investment in low carbon solutions such as carbon capture and sequestration the group s president tommy faucheux said in a statement faucheux said the association remains cautious about tax policies that might hinder long term investments louisiana and the gulf of mexico are uniquely positioned to provide affordable reliable secure energy to meet american needs while simultaneously reducing our carbon footprint he said louisiana s republican senators oppose bill republicans including both of louisiana s senators have criticized the bill claiming it will raise taxes and do nothing to curb inflation in a statement sen john kennedy called it a massive tax and spending bill and sen bill cassidy said it would hurt average americans this legislation does nothing to decrease inflation but raises the tax bill falling on everyday americans cassidy said in a statement the bill raises taxes only on the nation s wealthiest corporations by implementing a 15 tax on the earnings they report to shareholders it also imposes a 1 tax when companies buy back their own stock to the benefit of wealthy shareholders and executives this proposed tax policy is specifically geared to target a few dozen large corporations such as amazon exxon mobil bank of america and others that have paid little to no taxes on their profits by exploiting loopholes according to a list compiled by the center for american progress will it reduce inflation tax policy experts are divided on whether the legislation will reduce inflation a study by the conservative leaning tax foundation warned that the new tax burden on those corporations could indirectly trickle down to hurt workers and average americans sen joe manchin iii d west virginia who has previously joined with gop senators in halting many other policies proposed by democrats pushed back on the republicans claims telling fox news last week that taxes will not be raised for regular americans how in the world can you be raising taxes when all we re saying is the wealthiest corporations in america 55 of them pay zero to help this great country of ours to defend ourselves said manchin whose vote in favor was critical to passing the bill in the senate other policy experts agree the bill could reduce inflation by stemming the price volatility of fossil fuels such as natural gas which has been a significant driver of inflation the non partisan research group resources for the future conducted modeling that projects a 5 7 drop in retail electricity prices it says the average household will save 170 to 220 over the next decade compared to a scenario without the inflation reduction act a study from the committee for a responsible federal budget a bipartisan group of former congressional budget experts says the bill is likely to ease inflationary pressures over the next decade it says the bill would slash the federal deficit by 305 billion cut net taxes by 2 billion and reduce net spending by 15 billion the bill would reduce deficits by nearly 2 trillion over the next two decades the report said the louisiana illuminator is an independent nonprofit nonpartisan news organization driven by its mission to cast light on how decisions are made in baton rouge and how they affect the lives of everyday louisianians

photo taken on july 11 2022 shows the berlaymont building the european commission headquarters in brussels belgium economists are dusting off the dreaded portmanteau word stagflation to describe the looming crisis that threatens to envelop the eurozone this year most will well remember the economic woes brought on by the great recession of 2007 to 2009 but this new challenge is of a different ilk said iain begg a professor at the london school of economics european institute the former was a financial crisis with no surge in inflation but this is a different sort of crisis largely emanating from the energy market the better parallel is with the mid 1970s begg said the conflict in ukraine has increased gas costs sending consumer prices soaring and efforts to combat this inflation have slowed economic growth economists define stagflation as a period of slow economic growth high unemployment and inflation this scenario qualifies as stagflation investment firm ubs said in a recent client note prompting flashbacks to half a century ago when the term was popularized amid an oil price crisis that plunged the united states and much of europe into recession ubs has downgraded eurozone growth from 2 7 percent to 2 6 percent this year and the european commission recently said inflation in the eurozone will hit 7 6 percent this year a major uptick from the may estimate of 6 1 percent the conflict in ukraine coupled with reliance on russian gas is a key driver behind europe s economic woes the main gas pipeline from russia has reduced capacity to as low as 20 percent at various times over the summer sparking fears of a total cutoff the european union is in a perma crisis which implies a very challenging period ahead said fabian zuleeg chief economist at the european policy center think tank but how and whether the eu manages to deal with all current challenges will depend on difficult political choices in the coming months the situation has been exacerbated by turmoil in two of the region s largest economies germany and italy last month the relatively stable coalition government in italy was upended by infighting over a key relief bill to combat inflation culminating in the resignation of prime minister mario draghi italy has since approved a 17 4 billion euro 17 85 billion package to shield households and consumers from inflation which recently decelerated from a historic high of 8 percent but turmoil in the country remains a headache for the european central bank according to begg there will be a concern that financial markets will target italy in a way that first obliges the european central bank to respond more emphatically and second leads to renewed pressure on other relatively indebted eurozone members begg said political upheaval in italy has the potential to weaken the european union should anti eu parties manage to succeed in upcoming elections and early polling shows these factions gaining ground said angel alonso arroba vice dean in the school of public affairs at ie university in madrid last week deutsche bank said that germany is staring down recession and friedrich merz who is leader of the german opposition party the christian democratic union recently said the nation is facing the worst economic crisis since the founding of the federal republic of germany in 1949 arroba said that since germany is the economic engine of europe recession there is bad news for the rest of the eu i am not sure whether germany is heading for the worst crisis since its founding but certainly we are in a difficult context for the world economy as a whole marked by inflation and the disruptive effects of the conflict in ukraine he added germany can trace its current high reliance on russian gas back to 2011 and a key decision to phase down nuclear energy production following the fukushima disaster germany is now scrambling to diversify its energy mix with new legislation that promises to expedite the country s green energy transition by doubling renewable power capacity over the next eight years in a sense europe is importing the inflation it is experiencing at the moment the good news according to begg is that nations can alleviate this stress by switching to alternative sources of energy the bad news is that this will take time and for now the european community has little choice but to grin and bear it when it comes to stagflation arroba said any response needs to be coordinated at the european level unity and cohesion in the response to the crisis will be critical if european countries engage in competition among themselves they will make things worse

bitcoins afp joseph boyle the bitcoin boom spawned new billionaires and videos of beach parties and lamborghinis the crypto crash brought devastation for small investors and bankruptcy for many companies blockchain technology underpins crypto and has been hailed as a world changing innovation but does it have any use beyond creating speculative financial instruments afp asked crypto critic stephen diehl author of recently published popping the crypto bubble to run the rule over some of the most popular claims made for blockchain technology more secure voting as tension and confusion engulfed the united states after the 2020 election changpeng zhao billionaire founder of crypto firm binance had a suggestion a blockchain based mobile voting app he tweeted would mean we won t have to wait for results or have any questions on its validity fellow crypto billionaire vitalik buterin replied that there were significant challenges but he thought it was directionally 100 percent correct so far experiments have been very small scale for diehl blockchain was more likely to introduce problems than solve them from the american perspective every single district runs its own voting programme said this is seen as a feature because to corrupt any one election you would have to corrupt many many civil servants centralising the voting system in one digital place would be pretty risky then all you have to do is corrupt the blockchain and you could corrupt democracy automated house buying blockchain at heart is a ledger a way of storing transactions that is according to fans secure transparent and permanent those qualities have led countless enthusiasts to propose that the technology could in effect replace paper contracts for things like house buying diehl said it was absurd that the blockchain was going back to things that were solved a millennium ago to justify its own existence this is the system we ve had since the middle ages you have a government registry of land a title and deed that get transferred when the ownership changes he said the blockchain isn t solving anything here payments without banks the blockchain emerged from a 2008 white paper on bitcoin which was conceived as an alternative to fiat currency the opening line reads a purely peer to peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency there are now more than 10 000 others sitting on many different blockchains big firms have been desperate to find ways to accept payments in crypto diehl pointed out that cryptoassets are speculative instruments not suitable for payments when was the last time you paid for your coffee with apple stocks he asked it just doesn t happen you want something that s going to be stable so the price of your coffee is the price of your coffee next week supply chain tracking want to know where your mango came from some supermarkets believe the best way for you to find out is to access a blockchain based system capable of tracking the fruit from the tropics of central america to your cornerstore walmart and carrefour are among the firms trumpeting blockchain systems carrefour told afp earlier this year that shoppers would be able to scan a qr code and discover the provenance of an array of products the shops hope the blockchain will provide security certainty and transparency diehl pointed out that digital supply chain management has been around for years and is perfectly adequate without blockchain blockchain is not adding any incorruptability to the system he said pointing out that people in the supply chain could tell lies on the blockchain as easily as on any other platform if i have a carton of apples and report that i put 100 percent of them on the truck but then i skim off 50 percent for myself the blockchain is not going to prevent that
if you think that people are getting pretty crazy now just wait until the cost of food skyrockets to levels that hardly anyone ever anticipated most people don t realize this but to a very large degree we are still eating the food that was grown in 2021 unfortunately for all of us far less food is being grown in 2022 than originally projected and that is going to cause immense global stress in 2023 nightmarish droughts are absolutely devastating crops in the united states and europe the major war that is happening on the other side of the globe is greatly restricting the flow of agricultural goods from ukraine and the fact that some fertilizers have now more than quadrupled in price is deeply affecting farmers all over the planet in 2023 there is going to be a lot less food to go around and we are all going to pay a lot more for it needless to say this is not good news of course the cost of living has already gotten completely out of control according to zero hedge the median rent in the united states has now surpassed 2 000 a month for the very first time the cost of rent in the u s is moving higher at the highest pace in three decades the report notes blowing past a median of 2 000 per month for the first time ever rents are now above where they were prior to the pandemic in most major cities areas just outside cities which saw a large influx of new renters during the pandemic have seen their rents rise disproportionately higher people returning to large cities post pandemic have also not helped prices cool off who can afford to pay 2 000 a month for rent according to the social security administration the median yearly income for u s workers in 2020 was just 34 612 04 no wonder most families need to have more than one income just to survive these days this is what i mean when i say that our standard of living is being systematically destroyed many people have to work as hard as they possibly can just to pay the bills each month yes the top 10 percent are still doing well but the vast majority of the country is really struggling and that is why the soaring price of food is such a big deal right now the latest numbers that we just got from the government tell us that the cost of food at home has been rising at the fastest rate since 1979 the food at home index which represents food purchased in places like grocery stores for consumption at home jumped by an annual 13 1 percent which is the fastest pace since march 1979 consumers are getting a break at the gas pump but not at the grocery store bankrate chief financial analyst greg mcbride told the epoch times in an emailed statement food prices and especially costs for food at home continue to soar rising at the fastest pace in more than 43 years but the truth is that we haven t seen anything yet what we see at the grocery store right now is largely a reflection of what happened last year let me give you an example that illustrates what i am talking about in the last few days the mainstream media has been buzzing about the fact that there is now a potato shortage in idaho but what most people don t realize is that this shortage was caused by a tremendous heat wave that happened last summer idaho has a potato shortage if you haven t heard about it already or noticed fewer and fewer potatoes in your grocery store s produce section you will soon so what s the problem the weather not this year s weather mind you it s the weather from over a year ago that s to blame i m not sure if you remember last june but we had some just unbelievably hot temperatures here in idaho it did a number on our potato crop said jamey higham president and ceo of the idaho potato commission and so our yields were significantly down last year so did you catch that a bad harvest in 2021 is now being felt in the latter stages of 2022 looking ahead what our farmers are experiencing right now will be felt very keenly in 2023 for example it is being reported that the price of some fertilizers has now more than quadrupled last year was around 270 per ton and now it s over 1 400 per ton meagan kaiser of kaiser family farms and farmer director of the united soybean board told nbc s nightly news with lester holt it s scary it turns my stomach a little bit to think about the amount of risk that our family farm is taking right now farmers are finding themselves forced to pass some of those costs along to customers resulting in higher grocery prices when those cost increases get passed along to us in 2023 a lot of people are going to be screaming bloody murder but at least we will have food to eat on the other side of the globe there simply will not be enough food for everyone for years i have been trying to explain that global famines would inevitably be coming but i still don t think that it is sinking in for many people out there and of course famine is just one of the elements of the perfect storm that we are now facing recently egon von greyerz listed some of the other major elements debts at levels that can never be repaid sovereign corporate private epic global bubbles in stocks bonds property all about to collapse major geopolitical conflicts with no desire for peace major wars likely energy imbalances and shortages most self inflicted food shortages leading to major famine and civil unrest inflation leading to hyperinflation global poverty we have got a giant mess on our hands and conditions are going to get worse and worse and worse in the months ahead as things deteriorate a lot of people out there are going to go completely nuts in fact a lot of people are already going completely nuts let me give you an example that just happened an unidentified man reportedly set his car on fire by driving into a u s capitol barricade early sunday morning he then got out of his car and began firing a weapon indiscriminately before shooting himself police say u s capitol police say officers immediately responded when they heard the sound of gunfire at roughly 4 a m there were no reported injuries aside from the driver the only reason you would do something like that is if you have lost all hope and in the months and years ahead much of the general population will lose all hope let us endeavor to be beacons of hope because hope will be greatly needed during the times that are in front of us it is finally here michael s new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now available in paperback and for the kindle on amazon about the author my name is michael and my brand new book entitled 7 year

kuala lumpur malaysia media outreach 15 august 2022 on the occasion of the international forex broker s 11th anniversary octafx has taken on the exciting task of reviewing what turned out to be a vivid decade for the foreign exchange market let us get right into some specific yet crucial events that helped shape the foreign exchange market2013 made room for a formidable foreign exchange scandal that came to be known as the infamous forex probe upon independent investigation a major corruption chain was uncovered that showed how international banks colluded for at least ten years to temper exchange rates on the forex market as of this writing seven years have passed ever since the international monetary fund imf announced that the people s republic of china has officially climbed to the first place as the world s largest economy the greek economy turned out to be especially fragile and prone to the economic turbulences stemming out of the worldwide financial crisis of 2007 athens state default was almost imminent until the european union stepped in to grant new loans to the tune of 86 billion to greece for it to maintain its due payments this government bailout has been unprecedented in the scope of modern history a close call but still 51 9 of british voters voted to leave the european union in 2016 this has been harshly criticized in the eu itself even though the decision was set british society arrived at a crossroads of economic and political uncertainty the british pound sterling weakened significantly since then when donald j trump offered his republican candidacy for potus back in 2015 there weren t that many who expected him to succeed nonetheless after an outspoken and at times controversial campaign effort he emerged as the winner of the 2016 u s presidential election this sent shock waves through the political social and economic sphere of the country and the entire world at that time crude oil prices made steep price drops the markets got accustomed to crude oil prices trading between 75 usd and 115 usd per barrel for the first half of the 2010s 2014 was the year when the u s marked a doubled oil production in contrast to 2008 a sudden end came in 2016 when the oil price collapsed to 26 usd per barrel a continual trend that defined the last decade s second half so much so that the 26 usd per barrel sank even further to 20 usd per barrel in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic the shale revolution refers to the combination of new technologies and innovative practices in the oil and natural gas industry in the united states the transformative effect of the shale boom has been so dramatic that on 18 december 2015 barack obama the 44president of the u s signed a law that repealed the country s decades long ban on oil exports the united states no longer relies on significant imports of oil and natural gas to bridge the gap between its strong demand and gradually declining production on the contrary the country now plays an active role as a global supplier particularly that of lng one of president trump s main talking points and policy areas was his ambitions to change trade relations with beijing trade imbalances that were disadvantageous to the u s bothered trump since the result was a long standing enormous trade deficit one of trump s strategies was the tariff roll out to directly challenge chinese export on the global markets in economic terms liberal analysts defined trump s presidency as a modern variant of isolationism or protectionism it favoured domestic manufacturing and trade arrangements over global trading habits that had washington at a perceived by trump and his team at least disadvantage hoping to repeat his 2016 victory and enter a second term president trump lost to his democratic challenger joe biden once the results came in controversy followed that led to some discontent in u s society social issues especially were widely contested as well as the role of the media itself which illustrated a huge split in american public opinion one that eventually gave joe biden a very close victory 9 march 2020 marked the stock market crash soon afterwards the dow jones industrial average djia plummeted to a low up to that point all thanks to the relentless covid 19 pandemic that spread like wildfire due to the crash investors the world over feared the coronavirus contagion and its ability to spread and debilitate asset behaviour and prices globally soon anticipations of yet another series of oil price drops and a new recession were confirmed in march 2020 during the so called black swan crypto event bitcoin saw a significantly low price of 4 826 usd coincidently this was during the first huge shock waves of the covid 19 pandemic that hit the world economy bitcoin recovered fast and pushed to 10 000 and towards the conclusion of 2020 to almost 30 000 usd during that time an influx of retail investors and traders flooded the industry in june 2021 bitcoin breached 52 000 usd before flying even higher towards 65 000 usd in october and 67 500 usd in november after that a downtrend crept in that eventually started to turn bearish once 2022 started fears of coronavirus mutations and possible new strains of covid 19 brought renewed uncertainty about the prospects of eventually overcoming the pandemic in 2021 vaccine development and its worldwide administering were officially in process enormous amounts of newly minted currency units flooded the economy to safeguard against the troubles caused by covid 19 restrictions on the job market in the

can stock markets continue to rally what a difference a week makes post last week s weaker than expected july inflation print for the us which saw annual headline cpi fall to 8 5 from 9 1 in june the first positive inflation surprise for quite some time and the market is in risk on mode stock markets reached another milestone last week when the nasdaq composite index rose more than 20 from its mid june low to end its longest bear market since 2008 added to this the dollar has sold off sharply since its mid july peak with the dollar index losing 3 the dollar had been inversely correlated with us stock markets for most of this year thus market bulls are looking for further dollar weakness if the stock markets continue to rally however the question now is will the bull market continue there seems to be two camps out there right now on the one hand those who think that the worst of the year s market sell off is behind us now that us inflation looks like it has peaked and on the other hand those that are still concerned that the fed has not finished its interest rate hiking cycle that inflation is still too high and that the recent uptick in stocks is merely a bear market rally albeit an aggressive one this week s global economic data may determine who is right below we look at three events that could determine the direction of stocks and other risky assets this week 1 fomc minutes there are two main pieces of data that we will be looking at this week including the minutes of the july federal reserve meeting and us retail sales the market had on balance concluded that the fed s press conference after the july meeting was dovish with fed chair powell ditching forward guidance refusing to rule out a smaller rate hike at future meetings and his comment that us interest rates at 2 25 2 5 was within the ballpark of neutral federal reserve interest rates this was surprising to some since at that time us inflation was at a more than 40 year high of 9 1 however last week s cooler than expected inflation rate means that the next fomc meeting will most likely go down to the wire with the fed expected to look closely at august nfps and the august cpi report the market has taken a dovish turn when it comes to the fed s next rate hike there is now a 55 chance of a 50bp rate hike at the september fed meeting and a 45 chance of a 75bp rate hike this is down from a 68 chance of a 75bp rate hike for september just one week ago thus this week s minutes will be important to watch closely does the fed really think that us interest rates are close to neutral and how much do they want to see inflation fall before they stop hiking rates these will be important questions in the week ahead they will determine if the nasdaq can extend its recent 20 rally and if some of the weaker us stocks including meme stocks like amc can also continue their recovery it will also determine the direction for the price of gold along with the dollar after the supposedly dovish press conference at the july meeting the question now is will the minutes throw a hawkish cat among the pigeons if so eur usd s recent rally could be at threat after this pair failed to break 1 0270 resistance at the end of last week 2 us consumer resilience us retail sales released on wednesday will also be watched closely as the market expects a slowdown of sales ex autos to 0 1 in july after a 1 rise in june however the steeper than expected decline in us cpi last month could boost sales added to this there was an increase in the university of michigan consumer sentiment survey that was released at the end of last week longer term inflation rates came down with consumers expecting inflation next year to be 5 down from 5 2 in july interestingly consumers economic expectations edged up in august according to the survey particularly among low and middle income consumers who are sensitive to inflation this doesn t mean that inflation is no longer a problem 48 of respondents to the survey still blamed inflation for eroding their living standards however it suggests that there is a risk of an upside surprise to this week s us retail sale figures on the back of falling gas prices 2 uk cpi unlike the us we do not expect the uk to follow suit and see a sharp decline in inflation for july while economists expect inflation to remain flat on the month at 0 the annual rate of headline cpi is expected to rise to 9 8 from 9 4 in june core consumer prices are also expected to rise to 6 4 from 5 8 in june which is likely to keep the boe on edge about the passthrough effects of rising prices however anyone who buys petrol in the uk may have noticed that prices have come down rapidly in recent weeks thus while the july figure is strong it could essentially be the peak for inflation in the uk at least for a few months w hile the market will use the latest cpi data to decipher what the boe does next the truth is this data is not the only factor at play for the boe due to the way that the uk energy market is structured along with the continuing fall out from brexit the current uk inflation outlook is significantly worse than its g10 peers with inflation expected to stay higher for longer however recent reports suggest that the government are looking at ways to freeze the energy price cap for the next two years if that happens then we could see a significant decline in uk cpi expectations which would lift the pressure from the boe and help the uk economy in the long term thus keep an eye on this week s cpi report but remember that other factors are also at play when it comes to the future direction of uk interest rates and thus the uk economy 4 uk consumer just how hobbled are they we will also be watching uk retail sales report for july that is scheduled for release on friday the market is expecting sales ex autos to fall by 0 2 in july however like the us there is room for an upside surprise although the outlook for the uk consumer is challenging the brc

several major wall street banks have begun offering to facilitate trades in russian debt in recent days according to bank documents seen by reuters giving investors another chance to dispose of assets widely seen in the west as toxic most u s and european banks had pulled back from the market in june after the treasury department banned u s investors from purchasing any russian security as part of economic sanctions to punish moscow for invading ukraine according to an investor who holds russian securities and two banking sources following subsequent guidelines from the treasury in july that allowed u s holders to wind down their positions the largest wall street firms have cautiously returned to the market for russian government and corporate bonds according to emails client notes and other communications from six banks as well as interviews with the sources the banks that are in the market now include jpmorgan chase co bank of america corp citigroup inc deutsche bank ag barclays plc and jefferies financial group inc the documents show the return of the largest wall street firms the details of the trades they are offering to facilitate and the precautions they are taking to avoid breaching sanctions are reported here for the first time bank of america barclays citi and jpmorgan declined to comment a jefferies spokesperson said it was working within global sanctions guidelines to facilitate our clients needs to navigate this complicated situation a source close to deutsche bank said the bank trades bonds for clients on a request only and case by case basis to further manage down its russia risk exposure or that of its non u s clients but won t do any new business outside of these two categories stranded assets some 40 billion of russian sovereign bonds were outstanding before russia began what it calls a special military operation in ukraine in february roughly half was held by foreign funds many investors got stranded with russian assets as their value plummeted buyers disappeared and sanctions made trading hard in may two u s lawmakers asked jpmorgan and goldman sachs group inc for information about trades in russian debt saying they may undermine sanctions the following month the treasury s office of foreign assets control banned u s money managers from buying any russian debt or stocks in secondary markets prompting banks to pull back regulators have since taken steps to help ease the pain for investors the treasury provided further guidance on july 22 to help settle default insurance payments on russian bonds it also clarified that banks could facilitate clear and settle transactions of russian securities if this helped u s holders wind down their positions separately european regulators have also eased rules to allow investors to deal with russian assets by allowing them to put them into so called side pockets on a case by case basis the price of some russian bonds has jumped alongside the renewed trading activity since late july that could make the trades more attractive to investors and also help companies that sold protection against russian default for example u s bond manager pimco which was on the hook for a payout of around 1 billion after russia defaulted on its dollar debt in june could now save around 300 million one investor estimated pimco declined to comment there s some bid emerging for both local and external bonds for the first time in a while said gabriele foa portfolio manager of the global credit opportunities fund at algebris who follows the market for russian securities some banks and brokers are using this bid to facilitate divestment of russian positions for investors that want to get out reuters could not establish who was buying the bonds graphic russian bonds involved in cds auction lots of rules some banks are offering to trade russian sovereign and corporate bonds and some are offering to facilitate trades in bonds denominated in both roubles and u s dollars according to the documents and the investor who holds russian securities but they are also demanding additional paperwork from clients and remain averse to taking on risk in a research update to clients on wednesday for example bank of america declared in capital letters in red bank of america is now facilitating divestment of russian sovereign and select corporate bonds but it added that it would be acting as riskless principal on client facilitation trades meaning a situation where a dealer buys a bond and immediately resells it it also warned there were a lot of rules around the process which remained subject to protocol and attestation the approaches also differ among banks in some cases for example banks are offering clients to help divest their holdings as well as other types of trades that would reduce exposure to russian assets while others are limiting trades to asset disposals only at times they are asking investors to sign documents prior to trade execution that would allow the banks to cancel trades if settlement does not go through and risks leaving the banks with russian paper on their books according to one of the documents and the investor one bank warned clients that settlements would take longer than usual

that s unfamiliar territory for a generation of traders since 1982 growth and inflation risks have gone hand in hand while recessions reset economies with lower prices but now consumer price indexes and growth have decoupled both worsening simultaneously and calling for an entirely new trading paradigm the key themes of such a strategy according to money managers will be domestic growth heroes while stagflation in the us and europe may hamper developing economies relying on exports it could put nations with a strong domestic consumer demand and less reliance on western markets at an advantage that would benefit countries with domestically focused companies and india stands out in this regard the nation which derives just 12 per cent of its gross domestic product from exports is projected to grow the fastest among major economies in 2023 its stock market is one of the few to post an advance this year less globalisation in general nations offering some kind of relative insulation from the western economies are likely to attract investment interest this could take the form of lower vulnerability to imported inflation less need for foreign capital or monetary policy divergence sue trinh the head of macro strategy for asia at manulife investment management identifies indonesia malaysia and vietnam as examples investors have already begun favouring the dollar bonds of these nations sending their sovereign risk premiums to the lowest in seven nine and two months respectively advertisement economies most insulated from the negative demand shock are net food and energy exporters those less reliant on foreign capital and those that still have policy space trinh says economies most capable of mitigating the negative supply shock will have a relatively lower weight for food and energy in their consumer price indexes and import baskets stimulus still matters china s bias toward a looser monetary policy a popular theme for global investors since the start of the year may become even more compelling retreating factory gate inflation a property sector meltdown and a fragile recovery clouded by covid 19 outbreaks are keeping policymakers committed to further easing and the people s bank of china did just that on monday as it unexpectedly lowered the rate on its one year policy loans by 10 basis points to 2 75 per cent in the first reduction of a key rate since january the seven day reverse repo rate was cut to 2 per cent from 2 1 per cent there is potential for some though not all emerging markets to outperform if stagflation hits developed nations says eugenia victorino the head of asia strategy at seb china a key driver of emerging markets will be unique in pursuing a supportive policy amidst the tightening bias around the world advertisement yield advantage brazil is an oasis in latin america a continent where the overall mood is one of gloom over persistent inflation and growth constriction brought on by policy tightening the nation s consumer price growth fell in july responding to one of the most aggressive hiking cycles in emerging markets that s left brazil with a real yield of 3 68 percentage points the highest inflation adjusted rate among countries tracked by bloomberg given that stagflation could leave most countries with anaemic real rates brazil s yield is a potential lure for carry traders china and vietnam may also find their positive returns giving them an edge but none of this means emerging markets are immune to stagflation in advanced economies it will in fact be a blow for the overall asset class sparking portfolio outflows and sending investors to the safety of the dollar it s just that even in that turmoil the only place where investors can eke out some growth some stimulus and some yield is the developing world a proper global stagflation shock is unlikely to spare emerging markets but insofar as stagflation type risks are a spectrum emerging market opportunities can help hedge developed market risks says vishnu varathan the head of economics and strategy at mizuho bank bloomberg

by davide barbuscia new york reuters several major wall street banks have begun offering to facilitate trades in russian debt in recent days according to bank documents seen by reuters giving investors another chance to dispose of assets widely seen in the west as toxic most u s and european banks had pulled back from the market in june after the treasury department banned u s investors from purchasing any russian security as part of economic sanctions to punish moscow for invading ukraine according to an investor who holds russian securities and two banking sources following subsequent guidelines from the treasury in july that allowed u s holders to wind down their positions the largest wall street firms have cautiously returned to the market for russian government and corporate bonds according to emails client notes and other communications from six banks as well as interviews with the sources the banks that are in the market now include jpmorgan chase co nyse bank of america corp nyse citigroup inc nyse deutsche bank ag nyse barclays lon plc and jefferies financial group inc the documents show the return of the largest wall street firms the details of the trades they are offering to facilitate and the precautions they are taking to avoid breaching sanctions are reported here for the first time bank of america barclays citi and jpmorgan declined to comment a jefferies spokesperson said it was working within global sanctions guidelines to facilitate our clients needs to navigate this complicated situation a source close to deutsche bank etr said the bank trades bonds for clients on a request only and case by case basis to further manage down its russia risk exposure or that of its non u s clients but won t do any new business outside of these two categories stranded assets some 40 billion of russian sovereign bonds were outstanding before russia began what it calls a special military operation in ukraine in february roughly half was held by foreign funds many investors got stranded with russian assets as their value plummeted buyers disappeared and sanctions made trading hard in may two u s lawmakers asked jpmorgan and goldman sachs group inc nyse for information about trades in russian debt saying they may undermine sanctions the following month the treasury s office of foreign assets control banned u s money managers from buying any russian debt or stocks in secondary markets prompting banks to pull back regulators have since taken steps to help ease the pain for investors the treasury provided further guidance on july 22 to help settle default insurance payments on russian bonds it also clarified that banks could facilitate clear and settle transactions of russian securities if this helped u s holders wind down their positions separately european regulators have also eased rules to allow investors to deal with russian assets by allowing them to put them into so called side pockets on a case by case basis the price of some russian bonds has jumped alongside the renewed trading activity since late july that could make the trades more attractive to investors and also help companies that sold protection against russian default for example u s bond manager pimco which was on the hook for a payout of around 1 billion after russia defaulted on its dollar debt in june could now save around 300 million one investor estimated pimco declined to comment there s some bid emerging for both local and external bonds for the first time in a while said gabriele foa portfolio manager of the global credit opportunities fund at algebris who follows the market for russian securities some banks and brokers are using this bid to facilitate divestment of russian positions for investors that want to get out reuters could not establish who was buying the bonds graphic russian bonds involved in cds auction lots of rules some banks are offering to trade russian sovereign and corporate bonds and some are offering to facilitate trades in bonds denominated in both roubles and u s dollars according to the documents and the investor who holds russian securities but they are also demanding additional paperwork from clients and remain averse to taking on risk in a research update to clients on wednesday for example bank of america declared in capital letters in red bank of america is now facilitating divestment of russian sovereign and select corporate bonds but it added that it would be acting as riskless principal on client facilitation trades meaning a situation where a dealer buys a bond and immediately resells it it also warned there were a lot of rules around the process which remained subject to protocol and attestation the approaches also differ among banks in some cases for example banks are offering clients to help divest their holdings as well as other types of trades that would reduce exposure to russian assets while others are limiting trades to asset disposals only at times they are asking investors to sign documents prior to trade execution that would allow the banks to cancel trades if settlement does not go through and risks leaving the banks with russian paper on their books according to one of the documents and the investor one bank warned clients that settlements would take longer than usual
this august 14 story refiles to fix typo in para 17 by paresh dave oakland calif reuters america s tech giants are taking a modern day crash course in india s ancient caste system with apple nasdaq emerging as an early leader in policies to rid silicon valley of a rigid hierarchy that s segregated indians for generations apple the world s biggest listed company updated its general employee conduct policy about two years ago to explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of caste which it added alongside existing categories such as race religion gender age and ancestry the inclusion of the new category which hasn t been previously reported goes beyond u s discrimination laws which do not explicitly ban casteism the update came after the tech sector which counts india as its top source of skilled foreign workers received a wake up call in june 2020 when california s employment regulator sued cisco systems nasdaq on behalf of a low caste engineer who accused two higher caste bosses of blocking his career cisco which denies wrongdoing says an internal probe found no evidence of discrimination and that some of the allegations are baseless because caste is not a legally protected class in california this month an appeals panel rejected the networking company s bid to push the case to private arbitration meaning a public court case could come as early as next year the dispute the first u s employment lawsuit about alleged casteism has forced big tech to confront a millennia old hierarchy where indians social position has been based on family lineage from the top brahmin priestly class to the dalits shunned as untouchables and consigned to menial labor since the suit was filed several activist and employee groups have begun seeking updated u s discrimination legislation and have also called on tech companies to change their own policies to help fill the void and deter casteism their efforts have produced patchy results according to a reuters review of policy across the u s industry which employs hundreds of thousands of workers from india i am not surprised that the policies would be inconsistent because that s almost what you would expect when the law is not clear said kevin brown a university of south carolina law professor studying caste issues citing uncertainty among executives over whether caste would ultimately make it into u s statutes i could imagine that parts of an organization are saying this makes sense and other parts are saying we don t think taking a stance makes sense apple s main internal policy on workplace conduct which was seen by reuters added reference to caste in the equal employment opportunity and anti harassment sections after september 2020 apple confirmed that it updated language a couple of years ago to reinforce that we prohibit discrimination or harassment based on caste it added that training provided to staff also explicitly mentions caste our teams assess our policies training processes and resources on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are comprehensive it said we have a diverse and global team and are proud that our policies and actions reflect that elsewhere in tech ibm nyse told reuters that it added caste which was already in india specific policies to its global discrimination rules after the cisco lawsuit was filed though it declined to give a specific date or a rationale ibm s only training that mentions caste is for managers in india the company added several companies do not specifically reference caste in their main global policy including amazon nasdaq dell facebook nasdaq owner meta microsoft nasdaq and google reuters reviewed each of the policies some of which are only published internally to employees the companies all told reuters that they have zero tolerance for caste prejudice and apart from meta which did not elaborate said such bias would fall under existing bans on discrimination by categories such as ancestry and national origin casteism outlawed in india caste discrimination was outlawed in india over 70 years ago yet bias persists according to several studies in recent years including one that found dalit people were underrepresented in higher paying jobs debate over the hierarchy is contentious in india and abroad with the issue intertwined with religion and some people saying discrimination is now rare government policies reserving seats for lower caste students at top indian universities have helped many land tech jobs in the west in recent years reuters spoke to about two dozen dalit tech workers in the united states who said discrimination had followed them overseas they said that caste cues including their last names hometowns diets or religious practices had led to colleagues bypassing them in hiring promotions and social activities reuters could not independently verify the allegations of the workers who all spoke on condition of anonymity saying they feared harming their careers two said they had quit their jobs over what they viewed as casteism some staff groups including the alphabet nasdaq workers union awu at google s parent company say explicit mention of caste in corporate rules would open the door to companies investing in areas such as data collection and training at the same levels as they do to protect other groups significant caste discrimination exists in the united states said mayuri raja a google software engineer who is a member of the awu and advocates for lower caste colleagues over 1 600 google workers demanded the addition of caste to the main workplace code of conduct worldwide in a petition seen by reuters which they emailed to ceo sundar pichai last month and resent last week after no response google reiterated to reuters that caste discrimination fell under national origin ancestry and ethnic discrimination it declined to elaborate further on its policies not good for business adding caste to a general code of conduct is not unheard of the world wide web consortium an industry standards body partly based in massachusetts introduced it in july 2020 california state university and the state democratic party have followed over the past two years in may this year california s employment regulator the civil rights department added caste to its example equal employment opportunity policy for employers yet the move by apple a 2 8 trillion behemoth with more than 165 000 full time employees globally looms large the iphone maker s fair hiring policy now states that apple does not discriminate in recruiting training hiring or promoting on the basis of 18 categories including race color ancestry national origin caste religion creed age plus disability sexual orientation and gender identity by contrast many employers are hesitant to go beyond laws with their primary policies according to three employment attorneys including koray bulut a partner at goodwin procter most companies simply quote from the federal and state statutes that list the protected categories bulut said some companies have however gone further in secondary policies that govern limited operations or serve only as loose guidelines caste is explicitly written into dell s global social media policy for example and in amazon sustainability team s global human rights principles and google s code of conduct for suppliers amazon and dell confirmed they had also begun mentioning caste in anti bias presentations for at least some new hires outside india they declined to specify when why and how broadly they made the addition though dell said it made the change after the cisco lawsuit was filed the companies presentations include explanations of caste as an unwanted social structure that exists in parts of the world according to a reuters review of some of the online training with the dell material referencing a recent lawsuit from the headlines john paul singh deol lead employment attorney at dhillon law group in san francisco said that only including caste in training and guidelines amounted to giving lip service to the issue because their legal force is questionable this characterization was rejected by janine yancey ceo of emtrain which sells anti bias training to about 550 employers and a longtime employment attorney no company wants to have employee turnover lack of productivity and conflict that s just not good for business she said yet explicitly referencing caste would likely invite an increased number of hr complaints alleging it as a bias yancey added whenever you re going to call out something specifically you re exponentially increasing your caseload she said apple declined to say whether any complaints had been brought under its caste provision south carolina law professor brown expects no immediate resolution to the debate over of whether companies should reference caste this is an issue that ultimately will be resolved by the courts he said the area right now is unsettled

stranded with russian assets as their value plummeted buyers disappeared and sanctions made trading hard in may two u s lawmakers asked jpmorgan and goldman sachs group inc for information about trades in russian debt saying they may undermine sanctions the following month the treasury s office of foreign assets control banned u s money managers from buying any russian debt or stocks in secondary markets prompting banks to pull back regulators have since taken steps to help ease the pain for investors the treasury provided further guidance on july 22 to help settle default insurance payments on russian bonds it also clarified that banks could facilitate clear and settle transactions of russian securities if this helped u s holders wind down their positions separately european regulators have also eased rules to allow investors to deal with russian assets by allowing them to put them into so called side pockets on a case by case basis the price of some russian bonds has jumped alongside the renewed trading activity since late july that could make the trades more attractive to investors and also help companies that sold protection against russian default for example u

comment there s some bid emerging for both local and external bonds for the first time in a while said gabriele foa portfolio manager of the global credit opportunities fund at algebris who follows the market for russian securities some banks and brokers are using this bid to facilitate divestment of russian positions for investors that want to get out reuters could not establish who was buying the bonds graphic russian bonds involved in cds auction lots of rules some banks are offering to trade russian sovereign and corporate bonds and some are offering to facilitate trades in bonds denominated in both roubles and u s dollars according to the documents and the investor who holds russian securities but they are also demanding additional paperwork from clients and remain averse to taking on risk in a research update to clients on wednesday for example bank of america declared in capital letters in red bank of america is now facilitating divestment of russian sovereign and select corporate bonds but it added that it would be acting as riskless principal on client facilitation trades meaning a situation where a dealer buys a bond and immediately resells it it also warned there were a lot of rules around the process which remained subject to protocol and attestation the approaches also differ among banks in some cases for example banks are offering clients to help divest their holdings as well as other types of trades that would reduce exposure to russian assets while others are limiting trades to asset disposals only at times they are asking investors to sign documents prior to trade execution that would allow the banks to cancel trades if settlement does not go through and risks leaving the banks with russian paper on their books according to one of the documents and the investor one bank warned clients that settlements would take longer than usual reporting by davide barbuscia in new york additional reporting by rodrigo campos editing by megan

remembers days when a biscuit and syrup were their only meal but everybody was poor so it wasn t anything unusual or spectacular nobody had a surplus i never owned two pairs of shoes at once until i went in the army he said one by one todd s older siblings left sumrall heading west to find work in the southeast texas refineries that had flourished in the wake of the spindletop oil strike nearly 30 years prior for todd his mother and the few others that remained their struggle especially with food intensified advertisement article continues below this ad todd remembers he and his brother would chase rabbits in the nearby cotton patch if it wasn t fat we d let it go but if it was that was dinner by the time he was fifteen todd wasn t just chasing rabbits in the cotton field he was working them helping to bring in money to keep he and his mother afloat at his first farm job todd recalls the offer made to him by the landowner i pay you 50 cents a day and i feed you or i pay you 75 cents and you feed yourself we usually took the meal he said todd s schooling to a back seat to work it was long hours out in the field and it was hot he remembered advertisement article continues below this ad those cotton picking skills would come in handy later when todd and his future wife picked the cotton to stuff their first mattress he and his mother sporadically visited his siblings

was at the post office to mail a letter when he was stopped by an army recruiter the united states had formally entered world war ii following the bombing of pearl harbor and most young men of his age were already being drafted advertisement article continues below this ad todd was signed up as a volunteer before he even left the post office and that night he was on his way to houston then san

his wry sense of humor as sharp as ever noted his youngest daughter marlyn trahan dad would always joke that my mom took husband catching in high school and she was top of the class trahan said advertisement article continues below this ad one thing that really caught todd s attention was audie s cooking that s what i liked about her a lot she was a very good cook and was known for her baked breads todd said the two remained in contact after that first meeting we have a box of letters that he wrote to his mom and our mom while he was in the war trahan said we can t wait to dig into them advertisement article continues below this ad after leave todd was sent to new york where his unit and several others joined a convoy of ships bound for north africa and europe todd s ship was originally a cargo vessel converted to transport troops the ship was so crowded people had to take turns sleeping among the make shift bunks that were strung up inside todd recalled you had to stand in line to take a shower and the food was terrible there was nothing pleasant about that trip as the convoy traversed the straits of gibraltar en route to tunis tunisia todd remembers his first glimpse of the north african shoreline advertisement article continues below this ad it looked so beautiful there was so much color he said noting that the brick and stucco buildings in north africa were often painted in bright and varied colors the distant colorful visage turned out to be mere fragments of the city that had been when we got there not a building was left in town they d all been destroyed by the germans and allied forces todd said todd got his first taste of war the day they landed in tunis as well air raid sirens sounded as german planes flew overhead we always heard that one of the convoy ships was hit but we never saw it he said advertisement article continues below this ad but he doesn t recall feeling scared by the unknowns of war when you re young you don t think about it too much you just went he said todd spent months working at a base in nearby bizerte where he was a mechanic and carpenter outfitting army planes with plastic windshields advertisement

commercializing a new proprietary platform targeting the renal replacement therapy market through its wholly owned subsidiary dialco medical inc dialco today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended june 30 2022 and provided a corporate update chris seto ceo of spectral medical stated we continue to advance our tigris trial evaluating pmx for endotoxemia and septic shock to date we have randomized 40 patients out of the total 150 patients required and we have 14 active trial sites enrolling patients we are also working with the fda in order to potentially permit an increase in the maximum number of participating sites from 15 to 25 in order to accelerate patient enrollment based on the encouraging data received thus far we believe pmx has the potential to address a significant unmet medical need that is currently estimated at 1 6 billion in the united states alone as well as provide hope for the approximately 120 000 patients each year who suffer from endotoxemic septic shock with an estimated 50 mortality rate importantly the fda recently granted pmx breakthrough device designation which is expected to help expedite the regulatory review process

sam brings decades of experience in the medical device and dialysis fields sam has overseen a number of new product launches and built out successful sales teams all of which we believe will positively impact the development of our pipeline following his appointment our sami device was selected by arc dialysis the largest inpatient dialysis provider in south florida for inpatient dialysis services more recently our sami device was selected and added to the approved products list for the united states department of veterans affairs va which provides healthcare services to veterans our

federal courts long have struggled to define the limits of the mail and wire fraud statutes laws famously characterized as the prosecutor s true love for their vast breadth and catch all adaptability after sidestepping opportunities in the past the u s supreme court is now wading into two different and controversial manifestations of that flexibility the first which has proved particularly useful to second circuit prosecutors in recent years is the right to control theory this approach treats the deprivation of complete and accurate information bearing on a person s economic decision as a species of property fraud critics have focused on this theory because it allows federal prosecution of a broad range of conduct that may be unsavory or deceptive like violating ncaa recruiting rules lying in an employment application or retaliating against a political rival by closing entrance lanes to a busy bridge but which does not contemplate the concrete economic harm at which fraud statutes are aimed the second is a line of cases based on the second circuit s 1982 decision upholding the conviction of the former republican leader in nassau county joseph margiotta holding that a private citizen who has informal influence over government decision making can be convicted of honest services fraud the cases the supreme court accepted for review arise from scandals touching new york state government that were the subject of two separate trials in 2018 before judge valerie caproni of the southern district of new york on june 30 the last day before its summer recess the supreme court granted a petition for certiorari in ciminelli v united states no 21 1170 often referred to as the buffalo billion case arising from alleged bid rigging regarding contracts for development projects in buffalo and syracuse that same day the court also granted a petition for certiorari in percoco v united states no 21 1158 which stemmed from a bribery scandal involving one of the defendants in the buffalo billion case and joseph percoco a top aide to then governor andrew cuomo who was not a state employee at the time of the conduct at issue coming in the wake of kelly v united states 140 s ct 1565 2020 the court s unanimous ruling rejecting an expansive construction of the fraud statutes in overturning the bridgegate convictions the court s decision to hear both cases suggests it may take the opportunity to further rein in prosecutors efforts to impose their views of ethical behavior by extending the fraud statutes beyond protecting against classic property fraud the right to control theory wire fraud is defined under 18 u s c 1343 as any scheme or artifice to defraud or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses representations or promises transmits by means of wire radio or television communication any writings signs signals pictures or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice its twin statute 18 u s c 1341 outlaws the same conduct when executed via the mail although stated in the disjunctive since mcnally v united states 483 u s 350 1987 the supreme court repeatedly has held that the statutes reach is limited to schemes that seek to obtain money or property the right to control theory entails a dispute about the statutory meaning of property a line of second circuit decisions holds that a scheme can rise to the level of mail or wire fraud if it intends to deprive the victim of potentially valuable economic information necessary to make discretionary economic decisions united states v binday 804 f 3d 558 570 2d cir 2015 the eighth and tenth circuits have joined the second in recognizing the validity of the theory while the sixth and ninth circuits have rejected it outright ciminelli provides a particularly apt vehicle for the court to resolve this circuit split because unlike prior efforts to obtain high court review the petitioners wire fraud convictions are based solely on the deprivation of potentially valuable information without any proof that the alleged victim suffered economic harm honest services fraud 18 u s c 1346 enacted to overturn the supreme court rejection of the honest services theory of liability in mcnally provides that a scheme or artifice to defraud subject to prosecution under the mail or wire fraud statutes includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services in skilling v united states the supreme court clarified that this section applied only to schemes intended to deprive the public of honest services through bribes or kickbacks not mere ethical breaches or conflicts of interest 561 u s 358 409 10 2010 buffalo billion the bid rigging case both ciminelli and percoco arise out of a wide ranging federal investigation into alleged corruption in new york state government defendants in the buffalo billion bid rigging case were participants in a state program that aimed to invest 1 billion in upstate development projects centered around the buffalo region at the center of this program was the fort schuyler man in ciminelli and percoco the supreme court will have the opportunity to further limit prosecutors use of unduly broad interpretations of the federal fraud laws to impose their own notions of an integrity code onto state government and many other arenas beyond their proper reach agement corporation fsmc a nonprofit entity tasked with awarding the state funded projects to developers before awarding any specific project fsmc would issue requests for proposals rfps and companies would first bid to be selected as a preferred developer granting the right to negotiate first with fsmc notably fsmc was not bound to preferred developers in any way beyond the obligation to first negotiate with them regarding specific projects among others fsmc selected a company controlled by petitioner louis ciminelli and one controlled by petitioners stephen aiello and joseph gerardi as preferred developers for rfps in buffalo and syracuse respectively petitioners companies ultimately won bids for projects valued at 750 million ciminelli and 105 million aiello gerardi investigators discovered that a member of fsmc s board dr alain kaloyeros drafted rfps to favor the selection of petitioners companies as preferred developers for example in 2013 fsmc issued the rfp for buffalo requiring among other things that preferred developers be headquartered in buffalo and have at least 50 years of experience in the construction and operation of mixed use facilities a requirement that strongly advantaged ciminelli s company a similar pattern held for the aiello s and gerardi s company and the syracuse rfp on sept 19 2017 prosecutors charged ciminelli aiello gerardi and kaloyeros with both conspiracy to commit wire fraud and substantive wire fraud based upon their involvement in the alleged rfp bid rigging scheme at trial prosecutors offered no proof that fsmc was deprived of a fair price fair terms or quality in the non binding negotiations following the selection of petitioners companies as preferred developers or in their performance of the contracts they were ultimately awarded the government likewise introduced no evidence that fsmc could have obtained the same services or outcome for a better price from another provider the prosecution s theory was the right to control which were reflected in jury instructions that provided that a deprivation of money or property could include intangible property which could include potentially valuable economic information that an alleged victim would find valuable when assessing a transaction or how to use its assets the jury found each defendant guilty of one count of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud aside from kaloyeros who was found guilty of one count of conspiracy and two counts of wire fraud gerardi also was found guilty of making false statements to federal officers the percoco bribery case investigators also learned that aiello had arranged for his rfp bidding company cor development co to make payments totaling 35 000 for the benefit of percoco a top aide to governor cuomo who had just left state employment and was working on the re election campaign at the time aiello requested percoco s assistance in getting cor a waiver from a labor peace agreement that the state would otherwise require percoco who was due to resume official state employment but had not yet done so reached out to a state official state officials later reversed their prior decision denying cor state funds with the official who received percoco s outreach saying that he felt pressure to do so prosecutors brought charges against aiello percoco and gerardi for bribery and honest services wire fraud that were adjudicated in a separate trial aiello and percoco were found guilty of one and two counts respectively of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud and percoco was also convicted of one count of soliciting bribes or gratuities gerardi was acquitted on all counts and aiello was acquitted of bribery and making false statements the district court sentenced defendants in both cases to multi year prison terms the second circuit affirmed all convictions on appeal all defendants had begun serving their sentences but percoco was released to a halfway house in late 2021 and the remaining defendants were released from prison following the supreme court s grant of review bid rigging petitioners arguments in seeking certiorari the bid rigging petitioners make a forceful case that the right to control theory of fraud conflicts with current supreme court doctrine they begin with mcnally s although many may see the court s grant of review as a signal it is of course too soon to tell what impact these cases will have on prosecutors future ability to deploy their longtime favorite statutes requirement that the alleged scheme seek to obtain money or property and subsequent decisions defining such property to mean only what has traditionally qualified as a property interest including intangible property interests petitioners then address how the right to have accurate information about a potential transaction without any loss of property realized or intended is not analogous to any traditional property interest petitioners also assert that the rightto control theory also fails to satisfy the obtainability transferability requirement of the federal fraud statutes because the property allegedly lost by fsmc potentially valuable information was not and could not be obtained by petitioners petitioners next argue that the expansive and amorphous rightto control theory undermines the court s decision in skilling v united states 561 u s 358 412 13 2010 which limited the honest services theory of fraud to cases involving bribery and kickbacks and specifically rejected its application to undisclosed conflicts of interest because prosecutors can always avoid its strictures by charging such a conflict of interest under the right to control theory petitioners also assert that the right to control theory would render the mail and wire fraud statutes impermissibly vague as it leads to arbitrary and discriminatory prosecutions and assertions of prosecutorial regulation of an expansive range of conduct that constitutes mere deceit without the requisite tie to obtaining money or property put another way the right to control theory makes it wholly unnecessary for prosecutors to show that even the completed scheme produced tangible economic harm petitioners briefs are reinforced by an amicus brief submitted by the new york council of defense lawyers nycdl that argues that particularly in the second circuit prosecutors increasingly have relied upon the right to control theory when they can prove deceit but not contemplated economic harm with the effect of criminalizing non disclosure of information that before was addressed at most through state civil remedies and because of the absence of harm uncomplained of the nycdl lists examples of wire and mail fraud charges based in whole or in part on a right to control theory brought against at least 112 different defendants in the second circuit within the last decade in widely disparate factual circumstances nycdl identifies cases where prosecutors have used the theory to vastly expand the reach of mail and wire fraud to criminalize acts congress has chosen not to regulate or violations of rules of private organizations like the ncaa as well as breaches of unenforceable oral promises in the financial markets and even misrepresentations by job candidates rendering the fraud statutes property requirement essentially meaningless nycdl also points to the unintelligibility of the relevant jury instructions arguing that they invite jurors to convict without finding the necessary contemplation of economic harm bribery petitioners arguments petitioners in the bribery case focus on the conflict between the holding in united states v margiotta 688 f 2d 108 2d cir 1982 and the supreme court s subsequent decisions in skilling and united states v mcdonnell 136 s ct 2355 2371 72 2016 the latter of which held that an official act for the federal bribery statutes must involve a formal exercise of governmental power arguing that close ties to people in public office cannot suffice as percoco s petition memorably begins when a public official accepts money to convince the government to do something we call him a crook but when a private citizen accepts money to convince the government to do something we call him a lobbyist percoco asserts that margiotta was abrogated by mcnally and despite s congress s subsequent passage of 18 u s c 1346 margiotta s expansive reach and reasoning appropriately have been condemned as no longer good law by courts both within and without the second circuit see e g united states v adler 274 f supp 2d 583 587 s d n y 2003 margiotta was wrongly decided and is no longer good law in this circuit or anyplace nycdl s amicus brief emphasizes mcnally s official act requirement and mcdonnell s requirement of a formal exercise of governmental power nycdl argues that an interpretation of the honest services fraud statute that extends beyond formal acts by government officials becomes impermissibly arbitrary and expansive sweeping in even ordinary lobbying practices government arguments the government s arguments which of course were limited to opposing the petitions for review do not address petitioners right to control arguments at length but do point to the court s previous recognition of intangible property rights similar to those embodied in the right to control theory of fraud such as the general economic interest noted in pasquantino v united states 544 u s 349 357 2005 or one s use of valuable property as expressed in dickman v commissioner 465 u s 330 336 1984 as for the circuit split the government attempts to distinguish the decisions of the sixth and ninth circuits as limited to the facts of those cases to deny that the courts rejected the right to control theory of fraud generally as for the honest services fraud convictions the government contends that the facts of this case fall far short of the extent or breadth of the rule in margiotta the government also argues that the second circuit s holding below is not in conflict with skilling because its language allows for someone to qualify as a public official without formal employment so long as they occupy a position of public trust it is likewise not in conflict with mcdonnell because that decision explicitly allows for the notion that exerting pressure on another official can constitute an official act without foreclosing the possibility that such pressure can come from someone who lacks a formal employment relationship conclusion in ciminelli and percoco the supreme court will have the opportunity to further limit prosecutors use of unduly broad interpretations of the federal fraud laws to impose their own notions of an integrity code onto state government and many other arenas beyond their proper reach of the two petitions a conclusive holding in ciminelli rejecting the rightto control theory promises to have a broader impact given its frequent and creative application particularly by prosecutors in the second circuit to a wide range of disparate conduct entailing alleged deceit without economic harm although many may see the court s grant of review as a signal it is of course too

in a recent opinion arising from the chapter 11 proceedings of arcapita bank judge alvin hellerstein of the us district court for the southern district of new york affirmed a bankruptcy court decision denying safe harbor protection to shari a compliant murabaha investment agreements 1 specifically the district court held that the murabaha agreements at issue did not qualify as securities contracts forward contracts or swap agreements under the safe harbor provisions of the us bankruptcy code the district court s decision in arcapita is among the few decisions specifically addressing treatment of islamic finance transactions in a us bankruptcy proceeding the arcapita decision also is among the first times that any court in the us or england has addressed in depth the treatment of a shari a compliant product and how it should be classified according to relevant laws background murabaha transactions generally murabaha agreements comply with shari a law s restriction against traditional lending for interest as explained by judge hellerstein in a murabaha transaction placing party transfers funds to a receiving party a party in need of funds and he receiving party acting as an agent for the placing party purchases specified commodities on the placing party s behalf 2 the receiving party immediately agrees to repurchase those commodities from the placing party on a cost plus basis to be paid on an agreed future date and thus creates an obligation to repurchase by the receiving party and the placing party expects to receive the agreed upon repurchase price 3 murabaha agreements form the basis of a substantial majority of shari a compliant transactions in the market so the examination of their nature and how that dovetails with us bankruptcy laws is a welcome development in the small but growing body of case law that deals with islamic finance instruments arcapita bank s murabaha transactions in 2012 arcapita bank b s c c arcapita bank an investment bank and global manager of shari a compliant alternative investments headquartered in bahrain entered into two commodity investment agreements with bahrain islamic bank bisb a commercial bank also headquartered in bahrain 4 in accordance with shari a law and customary islamic banking and finance practice the transactions were structured as murabaha investments rather than traditional lending transactions so as not to run afoul of the prohibition against interest under shari a law 5 under those two murabaha investments bisb invested 9 8 million with arcapita bank separately arcapita bank made 30 million of its own murabaha investments with bisb 6 arcapita bank s chapter 11 cases and subsequent litigation arcapita bank filed for chapter 11 protection in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york on march 19 2012 7 approximately one week later bisb repaid 20 million of arcapita bank s matured murabahainvestments but withheld 10 million in additional matured murabaha investment proceeds 8 arcapita bank demanded that bisb turn over the remaining 10 million in proceeds but bisb refused 9 instead bisb communicated with arcapita bank that it had exercised a right of setoff under bahraini law of the debts owing between itself and arcapita bank 10 on august 26 2013 arcapita bank s official committee of unsecured creditors the committee commenced adversary proceedings against bisb in the bankruptcy court asserting claims for among other things violation of the automatic stay under section 362 a of the us bankruptcy code and seeking turnover of the 10 million in proceeds under section 542 b of the us bankruptcy code 11 bisb argued in a cross motion for summary judgment that among other things the murabaha transactions were protected under the safe harbor provisions of the us bankruptcy code either as securities contracts forward contracts or swap agreements 12the safe harbor provisions of the us bankruptcy code provide among other things that specified non debtor counterparties to a securities contract forward contract or swap agreement may exercise a contractual right to liquidate terminate or accelerate the contract by virtue of the bankruptcy or insolvency or similar status of the debtor 13 the non debtor counterparty s exercise of such contractual rights are not stayed by the automatic stay 14 as explained below the bankruptcy court denied bisb s cross motion and granted the committee s cross motion for summary judgment as to its claims for turnover under section 542 b of the us bankruptcy code and violation of the automatic stay under section 362 a of the us bankruptcy code but denied damages as to the stay violation 15 in particular the bankruptcy court held that the murabaha agreements did not qualify as securities contracts forward contracts or swap agreements and thus were not covered by the us bankruptcy code s safe harbor provisions applicable to these agreements 16 sdny affirms bankruptcy court ruling on appeal the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court s findings and judgment that the murabaha agreements were not protected by the safe harbor provisions 17 securities contracts the district court held that the murabaha agreements were not securities contracts 18 in doing so the court noted that bisb itself characterized the murabahas as liquidity management tools designed to allow the equivalent of interest to be paid on loans rather than investments 19 the district court also concluded that the bankruptcy court correctly interpreted the murabaha agreements as loan like rather than as securities contracts 20 in addition the district court held that the murabaha agreements on their face did not qualify as securities because the definition of securities contract in section 101 49 b vii of the us bankruptcy code specifically excludes a debt or evidence of indebtedness for goods sold and delivered or services rendered 21 the murabaha transactions fell within this exclusion because among other things the transactions provided for the purchase and repurchase of the same commodities plus an increase 22 forward contracts the district court also held that the murabaha agreements did not qualify as forward contracts23 for two primary reasons 24 first the contracts did not have a relationship to the financial markets as their primary purpose was not risk shifting in nature because they provided for immediate delivery of the underlying commodity and did not expose either party to the risk of price fluctuations 25 the district court further explained that othing in the record indicates that the urabahas involved speculation on the price of the underlying commodities which might have brought the transactions within the safe harbor provisions 26 indeed from an islamic finance practitioner s perspective it is a central pillar of islamic finance that speculation is specifically prohibited and it would be at odds with prevailing scholarly interpretation to suggest that a murabaha agreement was being used to speculate on commodity price movements second the contracts did not have a required maturity date of more than two days after the agreement was entered 27 rather the agreements provided for immediate delivery of commodities in exchange for deferred payments and because courts have regarded the delivery date as the maturity date for safe harbor purposes the murabaha agreements were not forward contracts under the us bankruptcy code 28 swap agreements finally the district found that the murabaha agreements were not swap agreements 29 which under the us bankruptcy code are defined to include commodity forward agreements 30 the court s reasoning on this issue paralleled its reasoning for holding that the murabaha agreements were not forward contracts 31 not consistent with safe harbor statutory purpose as an additional matter the court found that even assuming the murabaha agreements were swap agreements bisb could not claim protection under the swap agreement safe harbor provision in section 560 of the us bankruptcy code because bisb was not claiming or seeking to exercise a right to liquidate terminate or accelerate the agreement 32 similarly the court held that bisb was not entitled to forward contract safe harbor protection under section 556 of the us bankruptcy code because bisb was not seeking to liquidate terminate or accelerate any contract rather the district court held that bisb merely sought to enforce pre petition transactions and retain the proceeds 33 potential implications this case represents one of the first times that a us or english court has conducted a comprehensive legal analysis of the nature of a murabaha agreement to date case law on islamic finance transactions has been limited and mostly comes from english courts these cases have tended to involve an ultra vires claim by one of the parties that i it is a shari a compliant institution that is only permitted to enter into shari a compliant contracts ii the contract at issue was not in fact shari a compliant and therefore iii the party is not required to perform as the performance would be ultra vires i e beyond its corporate powers the ultra vires arguments in such cases have generally failed with courts generally declining to apply shari a principles but instead interpreting matters using english contractual principles as the governing law of the contract the matters at issue in this case were more complex and nuanced however practitioners should take comfort that the market accepted interpretation of a murabaha agreement has been supported by a us bankruptcy court and on appeal to a us district court in particular it is typically understood that the trading of commodities in murabaha transactions is not intended to provide any form of speculation or market related risk as it relates to such commodities rather the commodities are assets that can be sold by one party to the other for spot delivery and deferred payment terms it is those deferred payment terms that allow a profit to be charged on the cost price of the commodities thus mimicking the returns that would be paid on a conventional finance agreement the judgment handed down in arcapita supports this interpretation which provides comfort to market participants it remains to be seen however whether the market will respond to the decision in arcapita by requiring the parties to murabaha agreements to specifically acknowledge that the murabaha agreement is not a securities contract forward contract or swap agreement whether for purposes of the us bankruptcy laws or other applicable law another point of note is that murabaha agreements generally contain a waiver of the right to receive interest including interest awarded by a competent court however in arcapita there was no contractual interest waiver clause at issue as a result the bankruptcy court awarded prejudgment interest at 9 percent the new york statutory rate finding that doing so was consistent with bahraini civil code provisions regarding remedies for breach of contract 34 the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court s judgment on this issue in future cases where a contractual waiver of interest is at issue a court s decision may turn on the specific wording of any interest waiver clauses included in the relevant murabaha agreements the decision in arcapita is noteworthy for practitioners in islamic banking and finance and illustrates that courts will closely scrutinize whether a party is entitled to the protections of the us bankruptcy code s safe harbor provisions applicable to securities contracts forward contracts and swap agreements the case bears continued watching as bisb has appealed the district court s decision to the us court of appeals for

india s struggle for independence began more than a century and a half ago with the great rebellion of 1857 1858 the series of uprisings also known as the first war of independence was drowned in blood by the british with as many as 150 000 indians two thirds of them civilians as well as 2 400 british troops civil servants and members of their families killed in the violence that raged across the colony london responded to the rebellion with a series of reforms with the east india company a joint stock enterprise through which the state and private interests effectively ran and exploited india as a corporation from the early 17th century onward replaced with direct rule this period starting in 1858 and continuing all the way to indian independence in 1947 was known as the british raj raj being the hindi word for kingdom realm or empire the colonialists sought to parry rising pro autonomy sentiments and a growing sense of national identity among india s upper classes through a shrewd divide and rule strategy including economic and administrative concessions to dozens of vassal princely states and by successfully playing religious and caste differences off against one another this allowed the metropole to retain control over more than two thirds of india s vast riches of tea jute rubber textiles and food and to stifle the populous nation s economic development economist utsa patnaik estimates that the last two centuries of british rule cost india the equivalent of 44 6 trillion in wealth by the late 19th century two dominant trends emerged among the budding indian national movement moderates and radicals the former sought reforms and minor concessions from the british but did not speak of independence the latter consisting of more radically oriented forces demanded an end to the colonial and feudal yoke full stop as well as the boycott of all things british 1885 saw the formation of the indian national congress inc a radically oriented national liberation movement which would guide india to independence through a decades long struggle resistance organizer mahatma gandhi joined the inc in 1915 after his return from south africa and became its unofficial spiritual leader from the 1920s on revolutionary inspirationthe failed russian revolution of 1905 1907 served as a major inspiration for gandhi and the inc other pro independence publications and figures similarly praised the revolutionary upheaval to the north and called on indians to study and emulate the methods of the revolutionaries to take up arms against the british meanwhile back in russia vladimir lenin praised the indian independence movement and penned a scathing attack against the british over the brutality of their rule the russian revolutionary predicted that the rising consciousness for political mass struggle among indian workers would doom the british regime in india to destruction cooperation between the indian revolutionaries and their russian cousins expanded dramatically after the october revolution of 1917 and the creation of the soviet union in late 1922 in 1927 future prime minister jawaharlal nehru and other indian national movement leaders traveled to the ussr for the 10th anniversary of the october revolution evading british prohibitions to do so there nehru studied the works of marx and lenin on imperialism and marked support for soviet russia s anti imperialist rhetoric but not its atheistic materialist bent soviet and british media covered the visit extensively with the british press seeing it as evidence of a bolshevik conspiracy to undermine order in the colonies while soviet newspapers gave readers a primer on india s independence struggle and the roles played by nehru gandhi and of course india s socialist and communist parties nehru was received by soviet head of state mikhail kalinin in the kremlin and spent four days touring the country to get a sense for how the new government was getting on while in moscow he also met with other major national liberation movement and communist figures from around the world including german revolutionary clara zetkin soong chingling widow of chinese statesman sun yat sen and diego rivera the prominent mexican painter and leftist activist upon his return to india nehru published a short book entitled soviet russia some random sketches and impressions in which he would touch upon the ussr s educational healthcare and legal systems as well as the status of minorities and women in the new revolutionary state observers would later conclude that nehru s 1927 trip to the ussr would shape his inclinations toward socialism albeit of the non marxist variety which the inc adopted as its official ideology in 1936 throughout the 1920s and much of the 1930s london would see soviet red agents behind every palm tree in india blaming moscow for unrest in its colony and accusing it of seeking to spark a communist revolution in the asian nation in his famed 1946 book the discovery of india nehru wrote about the ussr its ideology place in the postwar world order and impact on the future india at length nehru had no issues accepting marx s dialectical materialism but criticized it for its lack of a moral approach to politics and a lack of idealism found in the vedanta school of hindu philosophy i did not like the frequent divorce in communist as in other practice between action and these basic urges or principles so there was an odd mixture in my mind which i could not rationally explain or resolve he wrote nehru praised the ussr s construction of a multinational state its advances in education culture medicine and its economic and industrial growth as well as the courage tenacity and whole heartedness that the soviet people displayed in the war against nazi germany the indian independence leader also effectively predicted moscow s future policy in relation to india by asking a series of questions the answers to which he said would determine whom the people of india and other colonial territories would side with in the cold war struggle self determination means economic independencenehru would receive answers to these questions after india won its independence the ussr became one of the first nations to recognize india with the nations actually establishing diplomatic ties several months before india achieved formal self rule in 1947 and in the early 1950s moscow agreed to assist new delhi with its goals of economic self sufficiency industrialization and diversification away from its status as a raw materials appendage of britain and other western powers the western countries at the time were not prepared to encourage india s industrialization program rather they desired india s continued existence as a rich potential for the supply of raw materials and a profitable market for their finished goods thus despite the political changes they had not given up their imperial psychosis indian economist r k sharma wrote in his 1980 book indo soviet relations economic analysis in this situation sharma noted the first trade agreement inked between new delhi and moscow in 1953 provided india with an alternative channel which had the effect of breaking the western monopoly on the supply of capital goods and also an outlet for traditional products on fair terms of trade indo soviet trade directed towards providing economic and technical means for building industries that produce industries a process that eliminates dependence on foreign countries in the years and decades that followed the ussr would provide tens of billions of rubles in direct assistance to india to help develop basic industries including iron and steel oil and electricity all key ingredients of a national industrial base in their 1987 book the soviet union and the third world the last three decades andrzej korbonski and francis fukuyama calculated that by the end of the 1970s the ussr had helped to create 30 percent of india s steel capacity 70 percent of its oil extraction facilities 30 percent of its oil refining capacity 20 percent of its power generating capacity and 80 percent of its metallurgical equipment production moreover they wrote moscow demonstrated its economic support for india by offering to finance public sector projects which the west was reluctant to do and by providing more favorable terms than the west lower interest rates longer repayment periods and repayment in indian currency or goods rather than in convertible or hard currency major industrial projects built with soviet help included the bhilai bokaro and visakhapatnam steel plants the large antibiotics and pharmaceutical factories at rishikesh and hyderabad which gave a kick start to india s now flourishing pharmaceutical industry a thermal power station at neyveli a mining equipment plant in durgapur an electromechanical enterprise at korba a surgical instruments plant oil refineries construction assistance for a network of canals and dams tractors fertilizers etc moscow also provided new delhi with engineering and technical know how with thousands of technicians engineers and scientists traveling to india to help set up industries and train their workers and tens of thousands of indians coming to the ussr to study at universities and technical colleges sharma contrasted soviet development aid to india with assistance provided by the united states noting that the latter was subject to conditions such as concessions to american private investors limited support for industrialization loan settlements only in dollars or gold and often political pressure the economist recalled for example how india s support for egypt during the suez crisis of 1956 prompted washington to threaten to cut off food aid sharma also compared moscow s favorable loan agreements of 2 2 5 percent interest over 12 20 years to the 4 5 8 5 percent interest rates offered by washington and the world bank along with industrialization assistance moscow also provided new delhi with other forms of economic technical and medical support delivering over a billion doses of smallpox vaccine to the country beginning in 1960 as part of the global campaign to eradicate the virus and sending the first indian satellite into space in 1975 rakesh sharma the first and so far only indian cosmonaut traveled on board a soyuz rocket to the salyut 7 orbital space station in 1984 under the interkosmos program in a live tele link from orbit when asked by indian president indira gandhi how india looked from space sharma replied saare jahan se achaa urdu for the best in the world a reference to the title of a patriotic 1904 poem by muhammad iqbal that became the anthem for indian opposition to colonial rule no revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itselfsoviet support for india during the cold war also included vast quantities of military equipment and production licenses which enabled new delhi to manufacture weapons themselves and create a national military industrial complex mic this assistance ranged from mig 21 fighters which the indian air force continues to operate to this day and plans to retire by the year 2025 to large warships tanks and man portable anti tank and anti aircraft weaponry indian russian defense cooperation continues to this day with moscow accounting for more than half of india s imported military hardware and licenses for russian weapons continuing to be sold to the indian mic along with armaments moscow provided other forms of security assistance to the south asian nation during the cold war including on the diplomatic front during the 13 day indo pakistani war in december 1971 in response to the assembly of a large us naval task force in the bay of bengal the deployment of the uss enterprise carrier group in the indian ocean and the dispatch of a british naval group led by the hms eagle aircraft carrier toward the arabian sea moscow deployed 16 battlecruisers destroyers attack submarines and at least one nuclear armed boomer sub to the region and warned washington that prompt countermeasures would be taken in the event of a us intervention in the crisis the deployment was undertaken in accordance with the indo soviet treaty of friendship and cooperation signed just months earlier in august of 1971 and which would become the bedrock foundation of the strategic partnership between moscow and new delhi that continues to this day according to indian accounts of what happened next the us fleet admiral told the 7th fleet commander william p mack sir we are too late the russians are here ultimately washington and london backed down islamabad surrendered and the new nation of bangladesh was born out of the former east pakistan the 1971 crisis wasn t the first time that india received direct soviet diplomatic and military support in a pinch a decade earlier in december 1961 when indian forces moved to take back the portuguese controlled india territories in goa daman and diu moscow blocked a us and portuguese ceasefire resolution at the united nations meanwhile the ussr s egyptian allies blocked a portuguese naval task force sailing east to try to stop new delhi from passing through the suez canal ultimately allowing india to present lisbon with a fait accompli and to liberate its lost territories in just 48 hours into the 21st centurythe foundations for relations between moscow and new delhi that were laid down in 1947 and strengthened during the cold war continue to inform the basis of modern day cooperation in a 2017 article in the times of india commemorating the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations russian president vladimir putin wrote that the 1971 treaty set forth the fundamental principles of bilateral relations such as respect for the sovereignty of each other s interests good neighborliness and peaceful coexistence which would be built upon in subsequent agreements putin emphasized the significance of cooperation in the nuclear and traditional energy sectors ongoing large scale projects in mechanical engineering chemicals and mining aircraft construction pharmaceuticals and medicine and cooperation in a host of other areas putin also pointed to the countries close cooperation at various international and regional groupings including the brics group of nations and the shanghai cooperation organization a century on from the first inklings of cooperation between moscow and the independence movement in new delhi the bedrock of ties which was established during and after india s independence struggle and the cold war and strengthened over the three decades since the collapse of the ussr continues to provide both countries with a solid and dependable economic diplomatic and defense partner the strength of this partnership has been demonstrated in the wake of the ongoing ukraine crisis with india not only refusing to go along with western sanctions against russia but ramping up trade with moscow and expressing interest in new cooperation tools including a free trade agreement and new ruble

by davide barbuscia new york reuters several major wall street banks have begun offering to facilitate trades in russian debt in recent days according to bank documents seen by reuters giving investors another chance to dispose of assets widely seen in the west as toxic most u s and european banks had pulled back from the market in june after the treasury department banned u s investors from purchasing any russian security as part of economic sanctions to punish moscow for invading ukraine according to an investor who holds russian securities and two banking sources following subsequent guidelines from the treasury in july that allowed u s holders to wind down their positions the largest wall street firms have cautiously returned to the market for russian government and corporate bonds according to emails client notes and other communications from six banks as well as interviews with the sources the banks that are in the market now include jpmorgan chase co bank of america corp citigroup inc deutsche bank ag barclays plc and jefferies financial group inc the documents show the return of the largest wall street firms the details of the trades they are offering to facilitate and the precautions they are taking to avoid breaching sanctions are reported here for the first time bank of america barclays citi and jpmorgan declined to comment a jefferies spokesperson said it was working within global sanctions guidelines to facilitate our clients needs to navigate this complicated situation a source close to deutsche bank said the bank trades bonds for clients on a request only and case by case basis to further manage down its russia risk exposure or that of its non u s clients but won t do any new business outside of these two categories stranded assets some 40 billion of russian sovereign bonds were outstanding before russia began what it calls a special military operation in ukraine in february roughly half was held by foreign funds many investors got stranded with russian assets as their value plummeted buyers disappeared and sanctions made trading hard in may two u s lawmakers asked jpmorgan and goldman sachs group inc for information about trades in russian debt saying they may undermine sanctions the following month the treasury s office of foreign assets control banned u s money managers from buying any russian debt or stocks in secondary markets prompting banks to pull back regulators have since taken steps to help ease the pain for investors the treasury provided further guidance on july 22 to help settle default insurance payments on russian bonds it also clarified that banks could facilitate clear and settle transactions of russian securities if this helped u s holders wind down their positions separately european regulators have also eased rules to allow investors to deal with russian assets by allowing them to put them into so called side pockets on a case by case basis the price of some russian bonds has jumped alongside the renewed trading activity since late july that could make the trades more attractive to investors and also help companies that sold protection against russian default for example u s bond manager pimco which was on the hook for a payout of around 1 billion after russia defaulted on its dollar debt in june could now save around 300 million one investor estimated pimco declined to comment there s some bid emerging for both local and external bonds for the first time in a while said gabriele foa portfolio manager of the global credit opportunities fund at algebris who follows the market for russian securities some banks and brokers are using this bid to facilitate divestment of russian positions for investors that want to get out reuters could not establish who was buying the bonds graphic russian bonds involved in cds auction lots of rules some banks are offering to trade russian sovereign and corporate bonds and some are offering to facilitate trades in bonds denominated in both roubles and u s dollars according to the documents and the investor who holds russian securities but they are also demanding additional paperwork from clients and remain averse to taking on risk in a research update to clients on wednesday for example bank of america declared in capital letters in red bank of america is now facilitating divestment of russian sovereign and select corporate bonds but it added that it would be acting as riskless principal on client facilitation trades meaning a situation where a dealer buys a bond and immediately resells it it also warned there were a lot of rules around the process which remained subject to protocol and attestation the approaches also differ among banks in some cases for example banks are offering clients to help divest their holdings as well as other types of trades that would reduce exposure to russian assets while others are limiting trades to asset disposals only at times they are asking investors to sign documents prior to trade execution that would allow the banks to cancel trades if settlement does not go through and risks leaving the banks with russian paper on their books according to one of the documents and the investor one bank warned clients that settlements would take longer than usual reporting by davide barbuscia in new york additional reporting by rodrigo campos editing by megan

the bitcoin boom produced new billionaires and videos of beach parties and lamborghinis the crypto crash brought devastation for retail investors and bankruptcy for many companies blockchain technology underpins crypto and has been hailed as a world changing innovation but does it have utility beyond creating speculative financial instruments afp asked crypto critic stephen diehl author of the recently published popping the crypto bubble to rule out some of the most popular claims about blockchain technology vote safer as tension and confusion gripped the united states after the 2020 election changpeng zhao billionaire founder of crypto firm binance had a proposal a blockchain based mobile voting app he tweeted would mean we don t have to wait for results or have questions about their validity his fellow crypto billionaire vitalik buterin responded that there are significant challenges but he thinks it s 100 percent correct so far the experiments have been very small for diehl the blockchain was more of a problem than a solution from an american perspective each individual district runs its own electoral program he said this is seen as a feature because to corrupt an election you would have to corrupt many many officials centralizing the voting system in a digital place would be quite risky then you just corrupt the blockchain and you could corrupt democracy automated house purchase at its core blockchain is a ledger a way of storing transactions that according to fans is secure transparent and durable these qualities have led countless enthusiasts to suggest the technology could replace paper contracts for things like buying a home diehl said it was absurd that the blockchain would revert to things that were solved a millennium ago to justify its own existence this is the system we ve had since the middle ages you have a state land registry title and deed that are transferred when ownership changes he said the blockchain solves nothing here payments without banks the blockchain emerged from a 2008 white paper on bitcoin which was designed as an alternative to fiat currency the opening line reads a pure peer to peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency there are now more than 10 000 others sitting on many different blockchains big companies have been desperate for ways to accept payments in crypto diehl pointed out that cryptoassets are speculative instruments not suitable for payments when was the last time you paid for your coffee with apple stock he asked it just doesn t happen you want something that s stable so the price of your coffee is the price of your coffee next week supply chain tracking do you want to know where your mango comes from some supermarkets believe the best way to find out is by accessing a blockchain based system that tracks fruit from the tropics of central america to your corner store walmart and carrefour are among the companies touting blockchain systems carrefour told afp earlier this year that shoppers could scan a qr code and discover the provenance of a range of products businesses hope for security certainty and transparency from the blockchain diehl pointed out that digital supply chain management has existed for years and is completely sufficient without blockchain blockchain doesn t add incorruptibility to the system he said noting that people in the supply chain could lie as easily on blockchain as on any other platform

we also continue to advance discussions with potential partners across our portfolio and evaluate the future development path for dipraglurant our mglu5 nam clinical program about gabab activation with pam activation of gamma aminobutyric acid subtype b gabab receptor a family c class of gpcr is clinically and commercially validated the generic gabab receptor agonist baclofen marketed for spasticity and some spinal cord injuries has been shown to be efficacious in several other disease areas including alcohol use disorder cmt1a chronic cough and pain however its wider use is limited due to a variety of side effects rapid clearance and the development of tolerance novel potent selective and orally available positive allosteric modulators pams that potentiate gaba responses rather than acting as orthosteric agonists at the gabab receptor like baclofen are expected to deliver efficacy and have less adverse effects furthermore pams only act when the natural ligand gaba activates the receptor hence respecting the physiological cycle of activation which is believed to explain why pams lead to less tolerance than direct agonists story continues about addex therapeutics addex

in the one health concept the use of beneficial bacteria to form positive biofilms that prevent the settlement of undesirable bacteria is a promising solution to limit the use of antimicrobials on farms however there is a lack of field studies reporting the onset of these beneficial bacteria after application and the effects on autochthonous surface microbiota in the study reported here the inner surfaces of commercial broiler chicken houses were treated or not with a bacterial consortium composed of bacillus spp and pediococcus spp strains able to form covering biofilms in different laboratory models preinstalled coupons were sampled over time to capture microbial biofilm dynamics on farm surfaces the results showed that the bacterial consortium can establish on the farm surfaces modulate microbial communities and limit the implantation of enterobacteriaceae and enterococcaceae two families containing potential pathogens introduction in standard intensive broiler farms chickens live all their life on the same floor mainly covered by straw litter wood shavings or sawdust animal density is high up to 21 birds m2 and physicochemical conditions illumination temperature and humidity are optimized to favor animal growth these conditions obviously trigger the development of microorganisms on the farm surfaces among which potential undesirable microorganisms guéneau et al 2022b cleaning and disinfection c d procedures are applied between each production batch in order to eliminate potential pathogens and avoid cross contamination through a reduction of the microbial load of livestock building surfaces these procedures are typically composed of wet cleaning with detergent disinfection rinsing and vacancy period steps before new animals enter luyckx et al 2015a the disinfectants typically used are quaternary ammonium compounds aldehydes and alcohols applied on surfaces by spraying or fogging luyckx et al 2015b it has been shown that these procedures are not totally effective in eradicating surface associated communities luyckx et al 2015a the presence of microbial communities spatially organized on surfaces has been invoked to explain the incomplete action of c d procedures flemming and wuertz 2019 those surface associated communities often named biofilms are three dimensional microbial structures adhering to the surface and enclosed in self produced extracellular polymeric substances epss flemming 2011 the eps composition can vary between biofilms but is typically composed of a complex mixture of water and biopolymers including polysaccharides edna proteins and amyloid fibers thanks to their spatial structure the protective effect of the eps matrix and cellular phenotypic heterogeneity biofilms can adapt exceptionally to environmental fluctuation and are often strongly tolerant to the action of antimicrobials bridier et al 2011 flemming et al 2016 in their biofilm form pathogens such as campylobacter jejuni enterococcus spp escherichia coli or salmonella spp have been shown to survive c d procedure leading to cross contaminations between batches of animals peyrat et al 2008 marin et al 2009 2011 as an example the contamination of chickens with the main zoonotic bacterial pathogen campylobacter spp in europe can be explained by its ability to form biofilms on surfaces trachoo et al 2002 newell and fearnley 2003 efsa and ecdc 2021 similarly the major pathogens responsible for zoonosis in europe have been described as biofilm formers in livestock building guéneau et al 2022b these observations support the need to study deeper biofilms in animal production systems for their control the poultry sector is one of the fastest growing and most flexible livestock sectors representing half of the additional meat expected to be produced within the next 10 years oecde and fao 2021 the current societal context leads producers to increase the sustainability and the biosecurity of their farms while reducing the use of antimicrobials such as antibiotics and surface disinfectants in addition to polluting the environment nonspecific and abusive use of these antimicrobials triggers the emergence of resistance that can be carried by pathogenic agents mcewen and collignon 2018 thereby the world health organization defines antimicrobial resistance as a world public health threat that has to be managed urgently in order to prevent zoonoses and increase food safety innovative biosecurity tools are implemented biosecurity procedures are a set of measures designed to protect against the entry and spread of pathogens the use of bacteria able to form positive biofilms and guide the microbial ecology of surfaces after c d procedures is a new and promising biosafety tool the concept is based on the rapid onset of beneficial bacteria that will occupy ecological niches on surfaces these beneficial bacteria are being selected for their biofilm forming abilities and other features linked to spatial and nutritional competition alvarez ordóñez et al 2019 guéneau et al 2022b surface bioprotection is already used by breeders and some products composed of cocktails of beneficial bacteria are already on the market however to our knowledge no scientific study reports their stepwise implantation on livestock surfaces and their effects on the autochthonous microbiota in this study the modulation of surface associated microbial communities by the addition of a product composed of a consortium of selected bacteria was studied first biofilm phenotypes of the strains that composed the product were studied in different laboratory models then using a field methodology previously described based on preinstalled coupons surface microbiota was captured over time in treated and untreated buildings guéneau et al 2022c an integrated global analysis was used to analyze i the in situ spatial organization of the surface attached communities by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm ii bacteria counting in specific agar media and iii the microbial diversity by high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene the exclusion effect of the product on enterobacteriaceae and enterococcaceae was studied using relative abundance ratio morton et al 2019 indeed these two families contain chicken pathogens of interest such as salmonella spp escherichia coli enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus cecorum foley et al 2013 manges 2016 souillard et al 2022 methods macro colonies pellicles and swarming phenotypes all axenic experiments began with 5 ml of trypticase soy

field experiments in livestock buildings two independent experiments were conducted in france batch 1 and batch 2 each with a building treated with a positive biofilm and an untreated control building

their log ratio asterisks represent significant differences between conditions p 0 05 discussion the objective of this work was to analyze the modulating effect of a mixture of bacillus spp and pediococcus spp strains on the natural surface attached microbial communities associated with poultry houses before testing in field conditions several biofilm models were used in the laboratory to characterize the traits of the bacteria that have been applied on the farm all the strains were able to form biofilms and the combination of all of them constitutes the lalfilm pro product which can form covering and structured biofilm in vitro the set of complementary techniques used to analyze livestock building surfaces demonstrated that the mixture of beneficial bacteria can also be established on farm surfaces it also revealed contrasted situations and heterogeneities between farm buildings batches indeed even if the observed environmental biofilms of the farm were sparse quantification of the syto 61 biovolume allowed to show that more biomass was detected in the treated condition in both batches specific counts showed more pediococcus spp in the treated conditions especially the first few days of sampling before the animals entered with no pediococcus spp detected in the controls relative abundances of pediococcus spp were significantly higher in the treated condition for both batches the large amount of bacillus spp detected in batch 1 control makes it difficult to differentiate the beneficial bacilli from the mixture that was applied in the treated building in batch 2 significantly more total aerobic bacteria were counted in the treated condition and bacillus spp relative abundance correlated with the spore counts on tsa 80 c for all time points except for day 18 in addition to being implanted on surfaces the product can modulate the alpha diversity of the surface communities in batch 1 a decrease of the shannon index is observed for the treated group on days 4 5 and 10 before returning to the same value as the control since the shannon index is calculated based on species richness and evenness adding a large number of bacteria of identical species lowers the value these values are in line with the establishment of the products on the surfaces at least for the 1st days the same observations were made for batch 2 on days 3 and 18 but a lower shannon index value is calculated in the control on day 6 which could be explained by a higher relative proportion of enterobacteriaceae 43 and enterococcaceae families 43 e g e casseliflavus and e cecorum due to animal entrance as revealed by the weighted unifrac distances of beta diversity the distribution or composition of species was also modulated by the treatment in both batches and at all sampling points except the next days of animal entry days 5 6 where a similar composition was found between coupon treatments the increase of bacillus spp and pediococcus spp abundance was correlated with a decrease in the shannon diversity the treatment increases bacillus spp and pediococcus spp quantities i e abundance and counts and the relevant ratios probing a concomitant decrease of enterobacteriaceae and enterococcaceae families despite these promising results further analysis would be required for a better resolution other techniques such as qpcr will be used in the future to track targeted pathogenic strains postollec et al 2011 the different approaches showed colonization of the applied consortium but it is unclear whether the product is able to grow and be metabolically active on the surfaces and not just persistent without growth acting hence more like a physical barrier as the main mode of action no significant differences were observed with the quantification of cam biovolume for both conditions and in both batches more pediococcus spp were enumerated during the earlier days in the batches in the treated condition but the increase in values that follow may be due to the detection of environmental pediococcus spp detected also in the controls moreover the values of spores count were very stable during the experiment even in the control which makes it impossible to conclude whether the bacillus spp of the product initially used in the form of spores were able to grow the relative abundance of the bacillus spp that decreases and the stable value of spores over time are consistent with the idea that the quantity of bacillus spp is stable during the time on the farm after the c d protocols the litter used in batch 1 was left outside for a longer period which may have resulted in bacillus spp colonization this could explain the higher number of spores detected in the batch 1 control compared to batch 2 another hypothesis is that the c d process before batch 1 was less efficient because the counts on tsa were also higher in the control building of batch 1 compared to batch 2 our results indicate that the initial situation between the two batches was different in terms of community profiles microbial density and spatial organization of the communities initial counts before animal entry were not identical across batches for control the bacterial count and biovolume of the batch 1 control were higher than those of the batch 2 control the clsm images showed that at the beginning of the rearing cycle biofilms were poorly developed and did not completely cover the surfaces of the coupons especially for batch 2 ten times less biovolume on batch 2 was quantified compared to batch 1 more total bacteria and spores were counted in batch 1 for all the experiments with a very stable value of spores during the time for the two batches the number of spores in the control of batch 1 was correlated with the relative abundance of bacillus spp these results show the importance of biological replicates for this type of field study the biofilms of the product did not cover the entire surface of the coupons in this farm setting although it was the case in vitro in the laboratory it can be interesting to develop a field model in the lab to study biofilm formation in conditions closer to those encountered on farms temperature humidity poor nutritive medium and materials modeling the interactions and testing the ecological theories within these positive bacterial consortia in simplified communities appear to be a promising step to improve the product composition de roy et al 2014 in addition the study of bacteria naturally present in farms would allow new selection criteria of strains phenotypes and genomes already identified as capable of living in these environments guéneau et al 2022a a previous study compared the use of beneficial bacteria guiding surface microbial ecology with conventional c d protocols in livestock buildings luyckx et al 2016 in our study the application of positive biofilm is a complement to the c d protocol and not a simple substitution indeed a surface with a reduced load of microorganisms obtained by c d will be more favorable to the settlement of a positive biofilm the observation of a decrease in the abundance of bacillus spp and pediococcus spp over time suggests that the product will be particularly effective at the beginning of the breeding process when the microbial load is low thus limiting the implantation and early development of harmful microorganisms other studies showed that natural positive resident microbiota of smear cheese wooden shelves had an effect on the exclusion of pathogens on surfaces by nutritional competition when the natural microbiota is already established or develops faster than the pathogen guillier et al 2008 in addition studies on agaricus bisporus biocontrol have shown that the addition of positive biofilm forming bacteria in compost with a low initial microorganism load was able to limit the early establishment of the main green mold mushroom pathogens pandin et al 2019 conclusion this field study demonstrated that the positive biofilm forming bacteria used can establish on livestock building surfaces and to modulate the biofilm community structure and diversity with special reference to the reduction of the ratio involving enterobacteriaceae and enterococcaceae families large scale field experiments will be required to get significant statistics on the effect of positive biofilm on the prevalence of specific targeted pathogens this study also highlights microbial variability between production batches of the same farm within the same building these promising

several major wall street banks have begun offering to facilitate trades in russian debt in recent days according to bank documents seen by reuters giving investors another chance to dispose of assets widely seen in the west as toxic most u s and european banks had pulled back from the market in june after the treasury department banned u s investors from purchasing any russian security as part of economic sanctions to punish moscow for invading ukraine according to an investor who holds russian securities and two banking sources following subsequent guidelines from the treasury in july that allowed u s holders to wind down their positions the largest wall street firms have cautiously returned to the market for russian government and corporate bonds according to emails client notes and other communications from six banks as well as interviews with the sources the banks that are in the market now include jpmorgan chase co jpm n bank of america corp bac n citigroup inc c n deutsche bank ag dbkgn de barclays plc barc l and jefferies financial group inc jef n the documents show the return of the largest wall street firms the details of the trades they are offering to facilitate and the precautions they are taking to avoid breaching sanctions are reported here for the first time bank of america barclays citi and jpmorgan declined to comment a jefferies spokesperson said it was working within global sanctions guidelines to facilitate our clients needs to navigate this complicated situation a source close to deutsche bank said the bank trades bonds for clients on a request only and case by case basis to further manage down its russia risk exposure or that of its non u s clients but won t do any new business outside of these two categories stranded assets some 40 billion of russian sovereign bonds were outstanding before russia began what it calls a special military operation in ukraine in february roughly half was held by foreign funds many investors got stranded with russian assets as their value plummeted buyers disappeared and sanctions made trading hard in may two u s lawmakers asked jpmorgan and goldman sachs group inc gs n for information about trades in russian debt saying they may undermine sanctions the following month the treasury s office of foreign assets control banned u s money managers from buying any russian debt or stocks in secondary markets prompting banks to pull back regulators have since taken steps to help ease the pain for investors the treasury provided further guidance on july 22 to help settle default insurance payments on russian bonds it also clarified that banks could facilitate clear and settle transactions of russian securities if this helped u s holders wind down their positions separately european regulators have also eased rules to allow investors to deal with russian assets by allowing them to put them into so called side pockets on a case by case basis the price of some russian bonds has jumped alongside the renewed trading activity since late july that could make the trades more attractive to investors and also help companies that sold protection against russian default for example u s bond manager pimco which was on the hook for a payout of around 1 billion after russia defaulted on its dollar debt in june could now save around 300 million one investor estimated pimco declined to comment there s some bid emerging for both local and external bonds for the first time in a while said gabriele foa portfolio manager of the global credit opportunities fund at algebris who follows

paris the bitcoin boom spawned new billionaires and videos of beach parties and lamborghinis the crypto crash brought devastation for small investors and bankruptcy for many companies blockchain technology underpins crypto and has been hailed as a world changing innovation but does it have any use beyond creating speculative financial instruments afp asked crypto critic stephen diehl author of recently published popping the crypto bubble to run the rule over some of the most popular claims made for blockchain technology more secure voting as tension and confusion engulfed the united states after the 2020 election changpeng zhao billionaire founder of crypto firm binance had a suggestion a blockchain based mobile voting app he tweeted would mean we won t have to wait for results or have any questions on its validity fellow crypto billionaire vitalik buterin replied that there were significant challenges but he thought it was directionally 100 correct so far experiments have been very small scale for diehl blockchain was more likely to introduce problems than solve them from the american perspective every single district runs its own voting programme said this is seen as a feature because to corrupt any one election you would have to corrupt many many civil servants centralising the voting system in one digital place would be pretty risky then all you have to do is corrupt the blockchain and you could corrupt democracy automated house buying blockchain at heart is a ledger a way of storing transactions that is according to fans secure transparent and permanent those qualities have led countless enthusiasts to propose that the technology could in effect replace paper contracts for things like house buying diehl said it was absurd that the blockchain was going back to things that were solved a millennium ago to justify its own existence this is the system we ve had since the middle ages you have a government registry of land a title and deed that get transferred when the ownership changes he said the blockchain isn t solving anything here payments without banks the blockchain emerged from a 2008 white paper on bitcoin which was conceived as an alternative to fiat currency the opening line reads a purely peer to peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency there are now more than 10 000 others sitting on many different blockchains big firms have been desperate to find ways to accept payments in crypto diehl pointed out that cryptoassets are speculative instruments not suitable for payments when was the last time you paid for your coffee with apple stocks he asked it just doesn t happen you want something that s going to be stable so the price of your coffee is the price of your coffee next week supply chain tracking want to know where your mango came from some supermarkets believe the best way for you to find out is to access a blockchain based system capable of tracking the fruit from the tropics of central america to your cornerstore walmart and carrefour are among the firms trumpeting blockchain systems carrefour told afp earlier this year that shoppers would be able to scan a qr code and discover the provenance of an array of products the shops hope the blockchain will provide security certainty and transparency diehl pointed out that digital supply chain management has been around for years and is perfectly adequate without blockchain blockchain is not adding any incorruptability to the system he said pointing out that people in the supply chain could tell lies on the blockchain as easily as on any other platform if i have a carton of apples and report that i put 100 of them on the truck but then i skim off 50 for myself the blockchain is not going to prevent that afp
