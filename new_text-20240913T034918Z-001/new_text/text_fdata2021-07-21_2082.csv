air canada tsx ac stock was up 5 12 in early afternoon trading on july 20 this came after a rough day for the broader stock market to open the week today i want to discuss three reasons investors should consider scooping up the stock for canada s top airliner let s jump in air canada stock is still undervalued right now shares of air canada are still trading under the 25 mark at the time of this writing however the stock is trading on the higher end of its 52 week range it is still well removed from the all time high it reached in january 2020 when it was priced above 50 last week i d discussed why air canada had the potential to double over the next year its shares are still trading in favourable territory compared to its industry peers the stock slipped into technically oversold territory in yesterday s trading session it is not too late to snatch up canada s top airline stock at a discounted price canada and the united states are finally easing border restrictions the closed border between the canada and the united states at least for regular travellers has stirred frustrations for over a year fortunately there now appears to be a light at the end of the tunnel on august 9 fully vaccinated u s citizens and permanent residents will be able to enter canada with relaxed testing measures and without mandatory hotel quarantines better yet air canada announced that it will add dozens of routes to the u s as part of its summer schedule this came after the announcement that border restrictions would be loosened the airline said that 55 routes to 34 destinations will add roughly 220 daily air canada flights between canada and the united states this is great news for the struggling industry this is a great step for air canada and its peers as we move into the middle of the summer with luck more routes will open especially as a greater proportion of canada s population is fully vaccinated travel demand is heating up as vaccinations rise back in june i d discussed the climbing demand for travel in the second half of 2021 travel agencies like the mmgy travel agency in the united states have noted the spike in demand this has the potential to fuel a huge rebound for air canada and its peers in the months ahead europe has also experienced rising demand increased travel to the continent across the atlantic will be the next big step in the reopening for the airline industry in july air canada reopened trips to greece united arab emirates italy spain the united kingdom and morocco the frequency of flights to these locations are set to increase by the time august rolls around these conditions make air canada s stock ripe for a big run in the months ahead investors should consider scooping up the stock as it is still worth half of what it was at its all time high in early 2020
have investors missed the boat on lucrative growth opportunities in 2020 growth stocks like well health technologies tsx well delivered extraordinary returns this year the stock market is much more muted growth stocks have struggled and even the reopening play seems to have tapped out it s a different economic environment but that doesn t mean well health stock and other long term growth plays can t deliver multi bagger returns here are the top three reasons why i believe the well health growth story is far from over telehealth is here to stay some pandemic trends are here to stay telehealth in my opinion is one of them why would you give up the convenience of speaking with a medical professional remotely some medical conditions and emergencies certainly need physical attention but for general advice and prescriptions a quick text or video call should be enough telehealth has vastly improved access to healthcare for millions over the past year well health s virtualclinic saw tremendous growth over 2020 this pace of adoption should continue as more people recognize the value of telehealth in the years ahead the u s healthcare market is worth trillions the acquisition of silicon valley based circle medical technologies gave well health access to the american healthcare market healthcare services are expected to generate us 4 3 trillion ca 5 5 trillion by 2023 much of that sector is still based on legacy systems and outdated infrastructure in other words well health has a trillion dollar opportunity to expand its network of private clinics medical data software and telehealth services across the continent this vast opportunity isn t fully reflected in the company s market value well health stock is undervalued well health stock currently trades at 7 5 15 below its all time high it s still up 6 700 over the past five years making it one of the best performing tech stocks in canada with recent acquisitions the well health team believes they can push annual revenue run rate beyond 400 million meanwhile the company is worth just 1 47 billion in other words the price to sales ratio is roughly 3 67 that s far lower than most tech or software stocks on the market right now well health could certainly be a multi bagger if the valuation is readjusted the company s american peers trade at price to sales ratios of 15 to 17 the team could also unlock substantial gains through mega mergers well health has 83 25 million in cash and cash equivalents on its books debt is relatively low which means there s room to add cheap borrowed capital meanwhile major investors such as sir li ka shing could certainly support future acquisitions and med deals this growth story is simply too compelling to ignore bottom line growth stocks have had a rough ride this year most are trading below all time highs well health stock is roughly 15 cheaper than it was just a few months ago however the growth story is as strong as ever and the stock could be a multi bagger if it simply receives a justified valuation keep an eye on this opportunity
with the pandemic affecting every aspect of life and industry it s no surprise that digitization is coming to construction fast construction suppliers are increasingly under the same pressure as other sectors to perform at a higher level we ve seen the rise of companies like dozer reno run and toolbox try to address this but often the model is closer to a vertical integration rather than something more open even with that it s still the case that to order concrete or bricks construction companies have to negotiate each time with simultaneous record keeping this is the argument of brokrete which bills itself as the shopify of construction the startup has now raised a 3 million seed financing round led by xploration capital which was joined by unnamed new strategic investors and existing investors the startup graduated from y combinator s winter cohort last year other strategic investors include ronald richardson avlok kohli ceo of angellist ventures and the mars investment accelerator fund iaf the funding will be used to expand in north american and european markets brokrete also launched storefront an e commerce platform for suppliers in the construction industry jordan latourelle the company s founder and ceo said construction today is a largely offline 1 2 trillion market where legacy commerce is the norm brokrete s storefront product equips suppliers with the tools required to enhance their operations by orders of magnitude i founded brokrete after seeing an industry left behind by e commerce giants now we are becoming the operating system for e commerce in the construction industry while staying easy and affordable at the same time brokrete says its platform is code free white labeled multi channel and industry specific to sell and manage orders online suppliers get an ios and android app for e commerce to receive offline orders from more traditional customers it then provides order management payouts dispatching logistics and real time delivery there are also financial and operational erp integrations brokrete claims to work with 1 000 contractors and to have a 250 supplier network story continues latourelle told me we re giving the construction industry an opportunity to use it on a shopify way and create their own store it s like a branded storefront for suppliers eugene timko managing partner at xploration capital said construction is one of the few remaining large industries with mostly undigitized supply chains historically the key problem was the lack of real time access to actual stocks which prevented producers and distributors from going online now with brokrete s end to end solution these businesses can not only sell through brokrete s marketplace but can also enable their own direct online channels similar to shopify this has allowed many thousands of previously offline businesses to start accepting orders online
debenhams pension scandal mps demand answers from private equity asset strippers as retirees face 10 cuts the chairmen of two parliamentary committees say private equity firms accused of asset stripping debenhams should be quizzed about the fate of the department store s pensioners who face a 10 per cent cut to their retirement payments darren jones who chairs the business energy and industrial strategy committee and stephen timms chairman of the work and pensions committee spoke out in the wake of the business s collapse the final stores closed their doors in may bringing an end to 243 years trading although the website was bought by online fashion retailer boohoo closure of the chain cost 18 500 people their jobs over the last 12 months the debenhams pension fund is currently under assessment by the pension protection fund ppf which rescues retirement schemes when firms go under if it takes the scheme over payouts will be reduced by 10 per cent for members who have not yet reached retirement age timms a labour mp said ppf assessment is a lengthy process and members of the debenhams pension schemes still face a lengthy wait to find out how their pensions will be affected if the schemes do enter the ppf there will be serious questions to ask about the role of the private equity consortium and whether more could and should have been done to protect pension scheme members fellow labour mp jones said too often in the past private equity owners have bought up household british businesses loaded them with debt resulting in the core business being undermined and workers customers and pensioners worse off if the debenhams pension schemes do end up in the ppf then their previous private equity owners should be accountable for their decisions on how far they protected pension scheme members the pension fund is believed to be around 32million in deficit less than annual bonuses once paid to individuals associated with the private equity consortium of cvc merrill lynch and texas pacific group which owned the firm for three years between 2003 and 2006 one private equity executive who helped orchestrate the debenhams takeover in 2003 reportedly made more money in one year than the entire shortfall in the failed department store chain s pension fund according to newspaper reports jonathan feuer was believed to be one of five partners at cvc who shared 250million in 2007 an average of 50million each the year after the department store returned to the stock market darren jones left who chairs the business energy and industrial strategy committee stephen timms right chairman of the work and pensions committee the 59 year old retired from cvc in 2018 and has since co founded an artificial intelligence firm for the finance industry former debenhams chief executive rob templeman who owns a central london home thought to be worth 4million was paid 7 9million in salary and benefits by his employer between 2003 and 2011 but in 2007 the financial times estimated he and two other directors made personal profits of 103million from when the company was refloated in 2006 with templeman netting 41million meanwhile tpg capital s one time european boss philippe costeletos 56 said to have been the mastermind of the debenhams takeover is also thought to have enjoyed multi million pound bonuses during that period the firm was loaded with more than 1billion debt 1 2billion was extracted in dividends almost double the profits made over the period while store freeholds were sold and leased back on expensive upwards only rental contracts to raise 495million dozens more branches were opened adding dramatically to the company s rent bills which rose 55 per cent in the next ten years debenhams struggled to meet its requirements to fund the pension in recent years as it buckled under demands to pay off the debt plus rents and business rates shoppers remained loyal with the 2billion annual turnover holding steady but much of the revenue went into lopping 900million off its debts the store chain was in the black up to 2017 but went into administration in 2019 partly because of the cost of store leases debts had risen to 622million a buyer could not be found for the stores once a fixture of the high street speaking earlier this year margaret hodge ex chairman of the commons public accounts committee accused the private equity barons of asset stripping adding the companies involved in the consortium have made profits in an immoral way cvc merrill lynch and tpg have declined to comment about decisions taken when they ran debenhams and the collapse of the business
wealthy philanthropists have long enjoyed an advantageous way to give to charity using something called a donor advised fund they ve been able to enjoy tax deductions and investment gains on their donations long before they give the money away these so called dafs set no deadlines for when the donations must reach charities the donors themselves decide when and where the money goes critics complain that because dafs provide no financial incentive to quickly donate the money much of it ends up sitting indefinitely in the accounts rather than being distributed to needy charities that criticism has helped drive a senate bill that would tighten the rules for dafs and aim to speed donations to charities the bill introduced by sens angus king a maine independent and chuck grassley an iowa republican appears to be gaining bipartisan support in congress the bill would make numerous reforms to dafs by among other things creating new categories of accounts one type of account would give donors an immediate income tax deduction for money they agree to give to a charity within 15 years the second type would let them delay the distribution of their money for 50 years these donors would get no income tax deduction until then but they would still get to enjoy capital gains and estate tax savings for donating stocks or gifts into a daf community foundation sponsored dafs with less than 1 million would be exempt from the requirement but donors with more than 1 million in such accounts would qualify for upfront tax benefits only if they distributed at least 5 of their assets annually or gave their money to a charity within 15 years under current law assets can remain in a daf indefinitely tax free this is about as common sense a bill as i ve ever seen said king who caucuses with democrats the idea of getting a tax deduction today for money that may not be paid out for 50 years makes no sense the senator added i understand you might want to put it into a fund and have someone else manage it but it s got to go out within a reasonable period of time otherwise it s an abuse of the tax code the proposed reforms have opened a rift in philanthropy circles among billionaire donors community foundations and trade associations and have sparked intense lobbying efforts both for and against the legislation the debate was ignited when john arnold a texas based billionaire who made his fortune in hedge funds and now co chairs arnold ventures joined with a group of scholars and philanthropies to propose a set of reforms under a coalition they called the initiative to accelerate charitable giving members of the group met with lawmakers to advocate for the reforms which have largely been incorporated into the senate bill what sparked arnold s interest he said was seeing rich people with philanthropic intent funneling money into dafs yet distributing very little of it to charities the money was just sitting there growing arnold said there wasn t any intent of abuse of the system but the money was just building up because there was no forcing mechanism opponents of the bill counter that tighter restrictions on dafs are unnecessary because the average annual payout rates for dafs hover around 20 much higher than the 5 minimum required of private foundations richard graber who leads the conservative bradley foundation calls the legislation a solution in search of a problem the foundation is affiliated with bradley impact fund a daf sponsor yet without payout requirements supporters of the legislation say dafs which hold an estimated 142 billion in the united states have essentially become warehouses for charitable donations the accounts let donors set up endowed accounts that exist in perpetuity and can pass on to their heirs a june report by the council of michigan foundations showed that 35 of dafs sponsored by michigan community foundations distributed no money in 2020 a year marked by enormous need because of the viral pandemic today roughly 1 in 8 charitable dollars are estimated to go into dafs the new york community trust a community foundation established the first daf in 1931 their use accelerated in the 1990s when fidelity charitable launched a national donor advised fund program charitable arms of many financial firms including vanguard charitable and schwab charitable now run robust daf programs community foundations along with universities hospitals faith based groups and large charities like united way also sponsor dafs collectively they account for a 300 growth in daf accounts over the past 10 years according to the national philanthropic trust eileen heisman who leads the philanthropic trust notes the ease of opening a daf account online the emergence of workplace charitable giving accounts and low initial minimum contributions indeed fidelity and schwab require no initial contributions at all for opening a daf account heisman noted thereby transforming it into a financial vehicle anyone can use still the average value of a daf account estimated at about 162 000 shows that dafs remain a vehicle mainly for the affluent the senate bill was crafted with guidance from ray madoff a boston college law professor who alongside arnold has called for stricter daf rules madoff and a colleague published a study in may that showed that working charities had lost 300 billion in contributions over a five year period as more people channeled donations through dafs and private foundations rather than directly to charities the philanthropy roundtable a conservative leaning group that opposes payout requirements for dafs disputes those findings its president elise westhoff argues that more mandates and regulations on giving will just make it harder for all americans to support the causes they care about supporters of the bill including william schambra a philanthropy expert at the conservative hudson institute say much of the pushback reflects a financial incentive that daf sponsors want to preserve the fees they charge to manage the accounts some community foundation leaders agree community foundations business models are based on asset management said paul major the ceo of the colorado based telluride foundation they charge fees and that s how they fund their operations if they have less money to manage they bring in less fees but the objective of charitable giving is not to manage more money major said the objective is to put the money to work other experts agree on the need to rein in dafs but favor a different approach edward a zelinsky a professor at yeshiva university s benjamin n cardozo school of law argues that creating a minimum annual contribution requirement for all dafs would more effectively accelerate donations to charities the senate bill has been referred to the finance committee though a vote hasn t been scheduled a spokesman for king s office said the senator expects a bipartisan house version of the bill to be introduced in the coming weeks
no oil discovery narrative appears to have captured investor attention this year as much as reconnaissance africa s tsxv reco otc recaf acquisition of the rights to namibia s giant 6 3 million acre kavango basin which was followed in short order by two confirmations of an active petroleum system it s captured our attention for several reasons not the least of which is that onshore discoveries are pretty much a thing of the past except in the final frontier of africa where namibia which has never produced a barrel in its history is anxiously awaiting the possibility of its day in the energy spotlight it s also captured our attention because this is a junior explorer who is sitting on what we think is a supermajor size basin and it s fully funded for its current 3 test well drill campaign but in recent weeks our attention has been drawn by reports of surprise early results twice and now there is a lot to potentially look forward to in the coming days and weeks on monday last week reconafrica announced that it had completed its second drill at its 6 1 stratigraphic test well in a matter of days we are expecting the results from that drill expectations are high because not only did reco show indications of an active petroleum system in its first test well drill 6 2 but it also showed over 200 meters over 660 feet of oil and natural gas indicators over three discrete intervals in a stacked sequence of reservoir and source rock expectations are also high because only part way into the second drill 6 1 in the shallow section reco again provided clear evidence of an active petroleum system with 134 meters 440 feet of light oil and gas shows now reco is launching 2d seismic and soon to release full drill results from 6 2 the well that s already delivered positive results in the shallow sections everything lines up in reco s favor everything appears to be lining up in reco s favor from day one when they took the giant leap of faith to acquire the rights to this huge basin in namibia and then to add another huge section of the same basin in botswana that gave them a total of 8 5 million acres a huge boost of confidence came first from bill cathey an industry recognized geologist for the biggest oil companies in the world who performed the magnetic survey interpretation for reco cathey came out saying that nowhere in the world is there a sedimentary basin this deep that does not produce hydrocarbons then came daniel jarvie a leading geochemist and source rock expert who is now all in on reco tsxv reco otc recaf jarvie estimated conservatively that the basin has generated billions of barrels of oil and gas he liked what he saw a lot so joined the reco team the company reports it has full government support local and national and has been helping namibia from the start from drilling water wells for kavango residents who have limited access to potable water to helping to fund the country s covid 19 vaccine rollout short selling desperation may have hit fever pitch so now with two confirmations of an active petroleum system under its belt new results expected just days away 2d seismic having launched we think those who have taken on enormous short positions against reco are thoroughly desperate that desperation may have led to organized media campaigns against the company in what we think is an attempt to bring the stock down enough to give them time to cover their shorts before there is no longer any way to stop the march forward in namibia you can read more about short and distort campaigns and the lengths short sellers will go to here on seeking alpha no one can know what will happen next but in our view there are enough breadcrumbs to follow in the latest press releases one of the most important breadcrumbs comes in the latest press release from monday which tells us that both test wells 6 2 and 6 1 will have a vsp vertical seismic profile tool run through them connecting them along the same seismic line and later this month the company says casing will be run and cemented to isolate the prospective hydrocarbon bearing zones investors who have no background in geology might now be able to interpret this clearly but for us the most important breadcrumb is this reconafrica would never fund the complex operation of running a vsp to tie these two wells together along the same seismic line if there wasn t a potential for something big there in both wells there are many catalysts here that stand to make the coming days very interesting for investors now that the second drill has been completed reco tsxv reco otc recaf reports it is making multiple logging runs and that up to 50 sidewall cores will be taken to maximize potential hydrocarbon recovery once that is complete the vsp is run as part of the 2d seismic program reco with its partner namcor the state oil company received approval from the namibian government on july 7th for seismic and will begin acquisition of the initial 450 km 2d seismic program across the kavango basin any day that will last for approx 6 8 weeks there are so many things we expect news releases on in the coming days and weeks results from the second test well results from the 450km 2d seismic the launch of the third test well drill most likely after the seismic acquisition and hopefully some potential jv farmout deals with the majors who will no doubt be watching like hawks for the next lab and 2d results and that could be one of the most exciting things for investors furthermore we think there is reason to be excited about 2d seismic results so does polaris canada s oldest seismic company contracted to do it polaris coo joe little stated the acquisition plan is progressing very well for a successful recording launch in mid july given our past success with the environmentally friendly explorer 860 source units on past projects in africa and given the very high resolution parameters designed by reconafrica s seismic team we anticipate getting excellent data results on the project what has made an organized misinformation campaign so hard to manage on the part of short sellers is the fact that reco isn t a fly by night junior explorer and a lot of reco s online followers appear to be very well informed and are keeping fellow investors up to date which for a short and distort campaign is a problem as they need uninformed investors for their strategies to work it s difficult for us to second guess results and operations when some of the biggest names in the industry are involved including the likes of giant schlumberger and polaris none of the companies involved in this operation would be willing to associate themselves with a fraudulent oil exploration play and we think short sellers are having a hard time covering because reco tsxv reco otc recaf has done everything by the book with some of the best in the industry there may be no other way to approach a basin of this size this is not another canadian micro cap plopping itself down on a random piece of alberta and pretending to drill while taking investor money this is the big time and it could end up being our last big onshore oil discovery ever the next time you read a story like this it will probably be in the deep waters where no junior company can travel alone oil narratives like this are potentially once in a lifetime and that s precisely what may have short sellers so worried they may have ended up on the wrong side of exploration history other oil companies worth keeping an eye on schlumberger nyse slb is the world s largest oilfield services company the schlumberger family of companies operates between 120 countries and employs more than 100 000 people they provide a wide range of exploration production drilling and processing services to their customers to help them find and produce hydrocarbons more efficiently from underground reservoirs schlumberger has been around for almost 90 years now with its first customer being shell in 1928 schlumberger is transforming itself to survive and thrive in an oilfield a fraction of the size it was only a few years ago the emphasis is shifting from throwing big chunks of iron and a schoolyard full people at a project to minimizing capital intensity of operations through the digital pso transformation we have discussed here the digitalization of the global oilfield will prove to be very sticky and begin to deliver subscription type returns to both companies slb is ahead of the rest of the oilfield pack with their new energy genvia venture which aims to produce carbon free blue

it built its first hydrogen compressor in 1962 and hasn t stopped since because it s still primarily an oil field service company however baker hughes has had its share of ups and downs over the past year but the 27 billion industry giant still remains a smart buy for long term investors not only has it shown that it can adapt to the times but it also pays dividends conocophillips nyse cop a

interest income primarily related to the yield enhancements realized on ppp loans that were repaid during the period these increases in net income were partially offset by a 0 7 million decrease in

for the second quarter of 2021 a decrease of 1 2 million compared to 0 3 million for the second quarter of 2020 the provision for loan losses decreased between the periods primarily because of the increase in the recoveries received in the current period when compared to the same period of 2020 and also because of improvements in the economic environment because of the lessened impact of the covid 19 pandemic during the current period during 2020 the company increased its allowance for loan losses due to the changes in the economic environment related to the disruption in business activity as a result of the covid 19 pandemic the amount of the increase in the allowance for loan losses related to the economic environment was based in part on the amount of loans to borrowers in the hospitality restaurant and entertainment industries that were negatively impacted by the covid 19 pandemic at june 30 2021 the bank had 33 5 million of loans that had been granted loan accommodations in accordance with section 4013 of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act the accommodations granted included 29 2 million of loans that are required to make interest only payments for periods up to december 31 2021 and 4 3 million of loans that had their loan amortization period increased of these loans 5 7 million were classified but still accruing at june 30 2021 and all of these loans were current with their agreed upon payments the commercial credit area continues to communicate regularly with the borrowers that have been granted loan accommodations and monitors their activity closely this information is used to analyze the performance of these loans and to anticipate any potential issues that these loans may develop so that risk ratings may be appropriately adjusted in a timely manner it is anticipated that most of the remaining borrowers that have been granted accommodations will be in a position to resume making their regular loan payments at the end of the initial accommodation period other borrowers particularly in the hospitality and restaurant industries may need additional accommodations when their initial accommodation period ends as their operations may need more time to recover from the impact of the pandemic the allowance for loan losses is made up of general reserves on the entire loan portfolio and specific reserves on impaired loans the general reserve amount includes quantitative reserves based on our past loan loss history and qualitative reserves for other items determined to have a potential impact on future loan losses the general reserves decreased during the quarter as a result of a decrease in the required qualitative reserves due to an improvement in business activity because of the lessened impact of covid 19 pandemic resulting from increased vaccination rates and the removal of pandemic focused restrictions during the period despite the progress made in the vaccination of the general public during the period it was determined that economic risks related to the pandemic continued to exist and more time was needed to prudently evaluate the impact that these risks would have on our loan portfolio before more qualitative reserves would be released from the allowance for loan losses total non performing assets were 1 8 million at june 30 2021 a decrease of 1 4 million or 45 1 from 3 2 million at march 31 2021 non performing loans decreased 0 7 million and foreclosed and repossessed assets decreased 0 7 million during the second quarter of

average interest earning assets between the periods these increases in interest income were partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned on interest earning assets which was 3 50 for the first six months of 2021 a decrease of 59 basis points from 4 09 for the first six months of 2020 the decrease in the average yield is primarily related to the decrease in the prime rate that occurred in the first quarter of 2020 which lowered the rate on adjustable rate loans in the portfolio as well as any new or renewing fixed rate loans that have been originated since that time interest expense was 0 9 million for the first six months of 2021 a decrease of 0 7 million or 47 3 compared to 1 6 million for the same period of 2020 interest expense decreased despite the 137 4 million increase in the average interest bearing liabilities and non interest bearing deposits between the periods primarily because of the decrease in the average interest rate paid on deposits the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and non interest bearing deposits was 0 21 for the first six months of 2021 a decrease of 26 basis points from 0 47 for the first six months of 2020 the decrease in the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities was primarily because of the decrease in deposit rates as a result of the decrease in the average federal funds rate between the periods net interest margin net interest income divided by average interest earning assets for the first six months of 2021 was 3 31 a decrease of 35 basis points compared to 3 66 for the first six months of 2020 the decrease in the net interest margin is primarily related to the decrease in the average yield earned on interest earning assets as a result of the decrease in the average prime rate between the periods provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was 1 5 million for the first six months of 2021 a decrease of 2 3 million compared to 0 8 million for the first six months of 2020 the provision for loan losses decreased primarily because of the reduction of qualitative reserves due to improvements in the economic environment because of the lessened impact of the covid 19 pandemic and also because of an increase in the recoveries received on previously charged off loans between the periods during 2020 the company increased its allowance for loan losses due to the changes in the economic environment related to the disruption in business activity as a result of the covid 19 pandemic the amount of the increase in the allowance for loan losses related to the economic environment was based in part on the amount of loans to borrowers in the hospitality restaurant and entertainment industries that were negatively impacted by the covid 19 pandemic at june 30 2021 the bank had 33 5 million of loans that had been granted loan accommodations in accordance with section 4013 of the cares act the accommodations granted included 29 2 million of loans that are required to make interest only payments for periods up to december 31 2021 and 4 3 million of loans that had their loan amortization period increased of these loans 5 7 million were classified but still accruing at june 30 2021 and all of these loans were current with their agreed upon payments the commercial credit area continues to communicate regularly with the borrowers that have been granted loan accommodations and monitors their activity closely this information is used to analyze the performance of these loans and to anticipate any potential issues that these loans may develop so that risk ratings may be appropriately adjusted in a timely manner it is anticipated that most of the remaining borrowers that have been granted accommodations will be in a position to resume making their regular loan payments at the end of the initial accommodation period other borrowers particularly in the hospitality and restaurant industries may need additional accommodations when their initial accommodation period ends as their operations may need more time to recover from the impact of the pandemic the allowance for loan losses is made up of general reserves on the entire loan portfolio and specific reserves on impaired loans the general reserve amount includes quantitative reserves based on our past loan loss history and qualitative reserves for other items determined to have a potential impact on future loan losses the general reserves decreased during the period as a result of a decrease in the required qualitative reserves due to an improvement in the business activity because of the lessened impact of the covid 19 pandemic resulting from increased vaccination rates and the removal of pandemic focused restrictions during the period despite the progress made in the vaccination of the general public during the period it was determined that economic risks related to the pandemic continued to exist and more time was needed to prudently evaluate the impact that these risks would have on our loan portfolio before more qualitative reserves would be released from the allowance for loan losses total non performing assets were 1 8 million at june 30 2021 a decrease of 1 5 million or 47 2 from 3 3 million at december 31 2020 non performing loans decreased 0 9 million and foreclosed and repossessed assets decreased 0 6 million during the first six months of 2021 a reconciliation of the company s allowance for loan losses for the six month periods ended june 30 2021 and 2020 is summarized as follows dollars in thousands 2021 2020 balance at january 1 10 699 8 564 provision 1 467 778 charge offs consumer 42 45 commercial real estate 0 730 recoveries 725 82 balance at june 30 9 915 8 649 the 0 7 million of recoveries relates primarily to a commercial loan in the transportation industry non interest income and expense non interest income was 8 0 million for the first six months of 2021 an increase of 1 9 million or 31 9 from 6 1 million for the first six months of 2020 other non interest income increased 1 7 million due primarily to a 1 5 million gain that was realized on the sale of commercial real estate owned loan servicing fees increased 0 2 million between the periods due to an increase in the aggregate balances of single family mortgage loans that were being serviced for others fees and service charges increased 0 1 million between the periods due primarily to an increase in debit card income these increases in non interest income were partially offset by a slight decrease in the gain on sales of loans primarily because of a decrease in single family loan originations and sales between the periods non interest expense was 13 5 million for the first six months of 2021 a decrease of 0 2 million or 1 4 from 13 7 million for the first six months of 2020 professional services expense decreased 0 4 million between the periods primarily because of a decrease in legal expenses relating to an ongoing bankruptcy litigation claim occupancy and equipment costs decreased slightly between the periods due to a decrease in depreciation and non capitalized software costs these decreases were partially offset by a 0 1 million increase in other non interest expenses due primarily to an increase in fdic insurance premiums between the periods a 0 1 million increase in data processing expense between the periods due to an increase in debit card processing costs because of increased activity and a 0 1 million increase in compensation and benefits expense due to a decrease in the direct loan origination compensation costs that were deferred as a result of the decreased mortgage loan production between the periods income tax expense was 3 2 million for the first six months of 2021 an increase of 1 6 million from 1 6 million for the first six months of 2020 the increase in income tax expense between the periods is primarily the result of an increase in pre tax income return on assets and equity return on average assets annualized for the six month period ended june 30 2021 was 1 68 compared to 1 01 for the same six month period in 2020 return on average equity annualized was 15 31 for the

as canada s beef farmers and ranchers face drought industry leaders are trying to find ways to secure feed and help those forced to sell rebuild their herds b c ranchers are dealing with high temperatures that have parched the grass that was there kevin boone general manager of b c cattlemen s association said during a canadian cattlemen s association cca online town hall on monday on top of the drought slashing hay supplies wildfires are burning prime grasslands leaving ranchers with little summer or winter feed b c s southern interior has been hit the hardest with no significant moisture in the region since late march or early april advertisement read also u s grains soy drops corn ticks up ahead of brazil and us crop reports chicago board of trade soy fell on wednesday after hitting a one month low as traders awaited a u s department of agriculture supply and demand report and brazil s conab crop forecast drought has a hard grip on the prairie provinces too arnold balicki saskatchewan cattlemen s association chair and long time rancher says it s the worst drought he s seen in saskatchewan you can go down five inches and there s not a drop of moisture manitoba also has a widespread moisture deficit says tyler fulton manitoba beef producers president but conditions around the interlake and southwest are dire those areas haven t had pasture for weeks and rain now wouldn t move the needle he said advertisement in ontario the farther north one travels the drier it gets with the rainy river district holding the unfortunate distinction as most scorched that district was the first to declare a state of emergency with other districts soon following suit kim jo bliss a farmer and crop researcher in the rainy river district said they ve only received four millimetres so far this month typically the area can count on about 12 inches of rain for the growing season but some places have only had about two inches i m very concerned about this industry and in particular the rainy river district she said in alberta the heatwave wind and ongoing lack of moisture have sped crop deterioration said dr melanie wowk alberta beef producers chair beef producer and veterinarian we re a very resilient industry but we need to ask for some help she said requests are urgent advertisement industry leaders are worried that producers will be forced to sell mother cows due to the feed shortage in manitoba producers are already selling cattle fulton said the cow losses will vary significantly between regions but estimated that some regions could see 50 per cent of the herd lost that s the reality right now and you just can t solve the problem everywhere with a feed assistance type of program i don t think one request is to not only enact the livestock tax deferral program but to expand eligibility to include other classes of cattle such as replacement heifers cca policy and program manager brady stadnicki said the cca and its provincial counterparts are also asking to extend the program beyond one year giving producers more time to restock after the drought advertisement stadnicki said that it s critical that crop insurance staff and adjusters help producers with questions and requests in a timely manner the cca is also asking crop insurance agencies to create incentives to encourage farmers to salvage crops as livestock feed without penalty one option is to raise the yield threshold at which crops can be salvaged for grazing or livestock feed without negatively affecting a farmer s coverage as saskatchewan did in mid july we d like to see this widely implemented across the drought stricken provinces immediately another incentive he said could be premium rebates on next year s coverage if farmers designate crops as livestock feed advertisement this request is very urgent given the closing window available to salvage feed the canadian canola growers association and grain growers of canada have joined the cca in asking for crop insurance changes to enable crops to be diverted to feed bob lowe cca president noted other requests include implementing programs to help producers get water to livestock on pasture as water quantity and quality are increasingly becoming animal health and welfare concerns and implementing agrirecovery a federal provincial disaster relief program marie claude bibeau the federal ag minister has indicated the federal government was ready to receive submissions from provinces on agrirecovery a formal step needed to trigger the program advertisement asked about rumours that u s producers were purchasing feed in alberta buoyed by transportation subsidies from the u s government stadnicki noted the u s has a national program to support its producers through forage shortages we have shared this information with the federal government as a bottom line when looking at agrirecovery support it needs to be at the very least on par with the program in the united states to prevent incentives to move feed south he said u s subsidies for buying feed mean they re getting quite aggressive at buying hay stocks said wowk and they are coming as far as northern alberta for that wowk also noted that farmers production contracts and high grain values are another stumbling block as contract buyers aren t allowing farmers to defer delivery to next year wowk said it s an area that needs to get opened up so livestock producers can access those crops time is ticking and we need answers like yesterday and i m just hoping people will realize the importance of this lisa guenther is

there are two schools of thought for this on one hand are those who believe that the federal reserve will be proved correct and that inflation temporary on the other are those who believe that the fed will commit a policy mistake and trigger a recession resulting in the japanification of the us economy the performance of risk assets such as equities and credit spreads in the second quarter would support the former thesis rather than the later we beg to differ in fact neither of these reasons explain the behaviour of us long term rates and the derived behaviour of risk assets during the second quarter in our view treasury deposits held by the fed is money that remains outside of the monetary supply up until the minute the treasury spends it when that happens this operates exactly in the same way quantitative easing operates injecting pure liquidity in the financial system during the normal operation of the government inflows and outflows to from this account balance themselves and do not have a significant impact in financial conditions in comparison when the treasury collects taxes and deposits the proceeds at the fed that operates as a factor tightening financial conditions there were no large changes in the cash balances between early 2018 and march 2020 it s worth noting here that back in 2020 when the trump administration toyed with the idea of passing a large rescue package the treasury undertook a massive increase in bond issuance largely via t bills to accumulate the resources required to fund such a fiscal package at the time the fed bought the vast majority of the issuance in the secondary market and as such the increase in the cash balance kept by the treasury at the fed did not produce a tightening effect for the economy then in february 2021 when the biden administration passed the american rescue plan act cash deposits fell the decline of us 876 billion in little less than four months from mid february to mid june equates to an average monthly liquidity injection of us 220 billion per month or 1 8x the fed purchases of treasuries and mortgage backed securities mbs under its qe program in addition the us treasury substantially decreased its net issuance of debt and seems to have opted to withdraw the cash that it had deposited at the fed with respect to us treasury s monthly issuance net of the fed qe purchases from an average monthly net issuance after fed purchases of us 290 billion per month the net issuance fell to us 163 billion in april and may in the four month period between late february and late june there was a massive injection of liquidity coupled with a massive decrease in the issuance of ust hitting the market no wonder then that us treasury yields fell from late march to june the problem is that the treasury has indicated that it wants to run the cash level at around us 700 billion going forward thus it is unlikely that the supportive conditions experienced in the second quarter will continue we might have one final injection of liquidity if the treasury is forced to run down its cash deposits due to a failure to roll over the debt ceiling quickly however at the current rate of cash burn even after accounting for delayed tax payments we estimate that the treasury should run out of money over the next one or two months once that happens net ust issuance will go back to us 220 billion per month assuming that the fed does not taper otherwise the net issuance hitting the market would be larger at that point supportive liquidity conditions will go away and fundamentals will begin to matter once more if the debt ceiling is not rolled over soon the us treasury will have to issue even more than us 220 billion per month to rebuild its cash cushion history shows us that when a debt ceiling rollover has been required market sell offs have occurred if we are right then we should expect a significant market shock within the next few months be warned guillermo osses head of emerging market debt strategies man glg

next refill since all pharmacies in his area were looted or closed when phillip dix from durban returned from the drakensberg during the unrest last week he had similar challenges to find a pharmacy to refill a script for his girlfriend s anxiety medicine i went to about six places but couldn t find meds because stocks were depleted or there just wasn t any because pharmacies were cleaned out just to try and find something like a loaf of bread and milk something you just take for granted you couldn t get now just think how scary it is with medicine especially if you really need it he tells spotlight like sikhakane dix eventually sourced the medicine in yellow wood park where residents barricaded the streets to keep looters from reaching the area just trying to get in and out of places and try to get through barricades was quite a nightmare but you know you have to i was with my dad and we left the women at home and as chivalrous as we tried to be it still was quite daunting to try and get around and there were a lot of people in the same boat thankfully it has sort of subsided now nosipho buthelezi who lives in yellow wood park said that last week she received frantic calls from family in umlazi struggling to get blood pressure medicine for her aunt and a refill for her sister s baby who developed a rash on his body fortunately they reached the doctor for a new script which was sent through whatsapp and buthelezi could get the medicine from a pharmacy in yellow wood park maybe if we can get other ways to get medication quicker and faster during this time it would really help she says we would appreciate that because timing is everything when one is sick what is the plan shafrudeen amod a pharmacist in durban says with big retail pharmacies closed many independent community pharmacists are now left to deal with patients running out of medication for both communicable and non communicable diseases with crucial support and communication lacking from the government and the pharmacy council it s all good and well to make statements about stolen medicine rightfully so but now what what are the plans instead we now sit with a legal and moral abandonment of patients and pharmacists amod says we understand that medicine was stolen but that is not the biggest priority it is those people who are alive now and to keep them alive by providing them with their prescription medicine we are all waiting for guidance what do we do to facilitate access to prescriptions he warns we may end up in a situation where people want to bulk buy and then what steps are there with rationing amod says at the moment the big retail pharmacies tell their patients to go to their nearest pharmacy and get community pharmacists to call them regarding prescriptions we don t have time to do that how legal is that will it be acceptable for the pharmacy council and medical aids to do that when there are no physical prescriptions he asks a chain reaction is now in place where patients are being deprived of access to proper pharmaceutical care innovative mechanisms should be put into place until services normalise one such temporary measure he says is to issue the pharmacies with temporary section 22 a permits section 22 a of the medicines and related substances control act provides for a concession granted to an organisation or person rendering a health service the right as authorised by the director general of health to acquire possess use or supply any schedule 1 4 substance it will provide us with a temporary solution if certain pharmacists were issued with these permits particularly in the hard hit areas it means that they can continue with diabetes hypertension and arvs without patients having to consult a doctor first and especially since most of the prescriptions records were destroyed says amod most chronic medicines are schedule 3 to schedule 4 medicines we need to implement mechanisms to ensure continuity of supply of medicines he says the pharmaceutical supply chain has been interrupted to the point where pharmacists have to collect their own supplies major medicine wholesalers he says are not delivering medicines due to security concerns one supplier city medical wholesalers in durban which supplies many community pharmacies and gps with medicine resumed operations this week when spotlight enquired about this city medical stressed that they are working through backlogs but deliveries have resumed amod says there is a backlog of about 48 hours at present since he is still waiting on his dispensary stock 55 000 patients redirected in gauteng right epharmacy in a statement on monday announced that it will permanently close all atm pharmacies in the province three of their four sites were destroyed in last week s unrest the atm pharmacies as they were known are pharmacy dispensing units which served almost 55 000 patients and dispensed more than 710 000 chronic medicine prescriptions this pilot project which allowed patients to collect two months supply of their medication in under three minutes offering an audio visual tele pharmacy consultation with each visit was set to run until september this year now these patients will have to be redirected elsewhere for their chronic medicine the right epharmacy team in collaboration with the gauteng department of health is assisting affected patients to transition to other facilities so that they may continue receiving their chronic medication uninterrupted the statement reads still calculating the registrar of the south african pharmacy council vincent tlala told spotlight looters last week left 131 pharmacies vandalised and without medicine stock eighty percent of the 131 pharmacies in the two provinces were also vaccination sites tlala says the amount of vaccine stock and medicines stolen across the two provinces can still not be calculated as pharmacies still have to reconcile their books with what was supplied he says the council is still assessing the impact on pharmacies and their ability to fund the rebuilding of their pharmacies through insurance pay outs or other finance vehicles and once this has been established an appropriate programme of action will be implemented wherever necessary we are currently encouraging relocation applications within affected communities by pharmacy owners with the ability to do this and we are processing these applications free of charge to the owners affected tlala says medicine access will be a challenge in next few months as some independent pharmacists express frustration about feeling abandoned and burdened without the necessary support tlala tells spotlight the council is confident that its efforts in the past week to ensure that wholesale pharmacies commit to consistent medicine supply to the operational pharmacies in affected and nearby communities will prevent medicine shortages however accessibility will continue to be a challenge for the next few months large pharmacy groups and a few independent pharmacies have indicated that they are already putting plans in place to rebuild their looted pharmacies as such this will further improve accessibility in these areas tlala says the council is working on relocating interns and learners who are based at affected pharmacies at no cost to both the pharmacy and the learner intern to ensure the continuation of training of much needed healthcare human resources meanwhile the treatment action campaign tac and other csos are scrambling to ensure treatment of people living with hiv is not interrupted tac chairperson sibongile tshabalala tells spotlight most of the centralised chronic medicines dispensing and distribution ccmdd sites in shopping malls were vandalised or closed and many people living with hiv could not collect medicine due to the unrest she says their numbers show that by the end of last week between 12 000 and 15 000 people in gauteng on the ccmdd programme may have been affected the intent is not to lose people tshabalala says many people had to resort to sharing medicine until the situation stabilises in some areas such as umlazi civil society organisations with the ward councillor took up loudhailers to tell people to get to their nearest clinic should they need arvs as part of our treatment literacy programmes we always encourage people to not interrupt treatment because you can develop treatment resistance so we cannot afford people not being able to get arvs she says tshabalala says there are other challenges too where those who were part of the ccmdd programme report to clinics they do not always know which medicine they are on staff shortages at the clinics and staff attitudes also make people not want to go to clinics so with all of this we fear that we will lose people because they would not want to go to clinics she says another issue is that facilities often order according to their catchment area and so clinics will only order for their patient numbers and maybe a few hundred extra meaning there is not a lot left to help additional people all of us were shocked by this we were not prepared and we with government have to go back to the drawing board and get a plan together right now we are just trying to get people to facilities and to make sure no one leaves without medicine the intent is not to lose people she says one community health worker doing house visits in and around phoenix tells spotlight she only returned to work on tuesday having stayed away since the unrest started she wanted to remain anonymous she said more than 100 patients couldn t access their tb treatment last week but fortunately some had three to four days extra supply she had to get her own tb medicine refill with the help of her brother who drove from richards bay to durban when starting treatment they say you must take your medicine every day you can t just stop or skip this thing is pulling us backwards she told spotlight on friday on tuesday she tells spotlight the community health workers are back on their rounds and clinics are now fast tracking chronic medicines like arvs and tb medicines i m just happy that people are getting their medicine we are back to house visits and back to normal even as there are still cars with guys with guns driving around but because they know us in the community we are fine the unthinkable when spotlight asked acting minister in the presidency khumbudzo ntshavheni about the contingency plans to restore medicine security especially for arvs and tb medicine she acknowledged medicine security in kwazulu natal is a challenge ntshavheni says work is underway to replenish stock and they are considering various options because we know those who are hiv positive and tb cases can t afford to miss their doses otherwise we will be dealing with something that is unthinkable for our country and more so in kzn where the prevalence of hiv is at its highest so we are moving quickly to deal with that to make sure arvs and tb meds are available attempts to get more detail on the recovery plans from the kwazulu natal department of health and the national department of health were unsuccessful ntshavheni says stolen goods that the government has confiscated or that were returned so far include medicine medicine was stolen and we don t know if it is safe for further use or must be discarded so the normal route is to just discard first use as evidence in court and then discard because if tampered with you cannot really vouch for its safety about 300 000 vaccination opportunities lost the situation may still appear uncertain for medicine security but at least south africa s vaccination efforts have not been floored by the riots the deputy director general in the health department dr nicholas crisp during an interview on enca on monday said the country had its best performance yet with more than 223 000 vaccine doses administered in 24 hours things have been picking up nicely and once kwazulu natal is completely in the swing of things and gauteng i m sure the figures will pick up even more he said tlala said that the covid 19 vaccine follows a supply line moving from a storage facility to the vaccination site in short intervals and as such the impact on the roll out will not necessarily be the lack of vaccines but fewer vaccination sites crisp says most of the losses were in the private sector in kwazulu natal we did lose some of these allocated to the distribution network of the private sector fortunately there wasn t that much in the portions of the supply chain that were damaged so it has not been too great a loss and the public sector vaccines are spread over a large number of facilities and we are protected so fortunately we have not lost a lot by way of vaccines but we have lost a lot of opportunities to vaccinate people crisp quantifies it as between 40 000 and 50 000 vaccine opportunities lost per day in the two provinces last week which amounts to about 300 000 vaccine opportunities during the unrest dm mc a representative of the treatment action campaign tac is quoted in this article spotlight is

should consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of a fund before investing prospectuses for the funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll free at 1 800 621 1675 or visiting a prospectus should be read carefully before investing past performance is no assurance of future results investment return and market value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost principal risk factors a fund s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a fund s investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings securities held by a fund as well as shares of a fund itself are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions political events regulatory or market developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations in addition local regional or global events such as war acts of terrorism spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues recessions or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments such events may affect certain geographic regions countries sectors and industries more significantly than others the outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as covid 19 in december 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets which have caused losses for investors while the development of vaccines has slowed the spread of the virus and allowed for the resumption of reasonably normal business activity in the united states many countries continue to impose lockdown measures in an attempt to slow the spread additionally there is no guarantee that vaccines will be effective against emerging variants of the disease an index etf seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index you should anticipate that the value of an index fund s shares will decline more or less in correlation with any decline in the value of the index an index fund s return may not match the return of the index unlike a fund the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a fund investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants in very large creation redemption units if the fund s authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to the fund s net asset value and possibly face delisting one of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value an actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a fund s investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or sub advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result a fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in a fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically certain funds may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies an investment in a fund containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries a fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative and there is a heightened risk of investing in emerging markets securities financial and other reporting by companies and government entities also may be less reliable in emerging market countries shareholder claims that are available in the u s as well as regulatory oversight and authority that is common in the u s including for claims based on fraud may be difficult or impossible for shareholders of securities in emerging market countries or for u s authorities to pursue investments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and or interest when due in times of economic uncertainty the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations preferred securities high yield securities corporate bonds government bonds municipal bonds and senior loans are subject to credit risk call risk income risk interest rate risk inflation risk and prepayment risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floating rate loans and high yield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher yielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a fund s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a fund s income senior floating rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations and or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities the senior loan market has seen an increase in loans with weaker lender protections which may impact recovery values and or trading levels in the future the absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates this may hinder the fund s ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce the fund s ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss as a result the fund s exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions to the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the london interbank offered rate libor as a reference interest rate it is subject to libor risk the united kingdom s financial conduct authority which regulates libor will cease making libor available as a reference rate over a phase out period that will begin immediately after december 31 2021 the unavailability or replacement of libor may affect the value liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades any potential effects of the transition away from libor on the fund or on certain instruments in which the fund invests can be difficult to ascertain and they may vary depending on a variety of factors and they could result in losses to the fund in the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or principal payments on a senior loan held by the fund the fund will experience a reduction in its income and a decline in the value of the senior loan which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value of the fund s common shares if the fund acquires a senior loan from another lender for example by acquiring a participation the fund may also be subject to credit risks with respect to that lender although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral the value of the collateral may not equal the fund s investment when the senior loan is acquired or may decline below the principal amount of the senior loan subsequent to the fund s investment also to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates the fund bears the risk that the stock may decline in value be relatively illiquid and or may lose all or substantially all of its value causing the senior loan to be under collateralized therefore the liquidation of the collateral underlying a senior loan may not satisfy the issuer s obligation to the fund in the event of non payment of scheduled interest or principal and the collateral may not be readily liquidated income from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer convertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and as a result are exposed to certain additional risks the values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments each with its own market value a fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives exchange traded notes etns are senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees the value of an etn may be influenced by various factors real estate investment trusts reits and real estate operating companies reocs are subject to certain risks including changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recession master limited partnerships mlps are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments in addition there is the risk that a mlp could be taxed as a corporation resulting in decreased returns from such mlp the use of futures options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when a fund s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a fund s return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by a fund a fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than in kind securities as a result an investment in a fund may be less tax efficient than an investment in an exchange traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in kind securities a fund s investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements alternative investments may employ complex strategies have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be appropriate for all investors certain funds may invest in other investment companies including closed end funds cefs etfs and affiliated etfs which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds in addition a fund s investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds a fund may invest in u s government obligations u s treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and u s government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government income from the first trust managed municipal etf fmb the first trust california municipal high income etf fcal the first

issuers located in california such concentration exposes the fund to political fiscal and economic conditions affecting california municipal issuers and may affect the value of the fund s investments short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns in times of unusual or adverse market economic regulatory or political conditions a fund may not be able fully or partially to implement its short selling strategy certain funds may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the fund or at prices approximately the value at which the fund is carrying the securities on its books certain funds are classified as non diversified and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers as a result the fund may

june 7 2021 nancy stuebe director investor relations good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call once again thomas is on the call but asked me to present his comments on the business he will handle the q a as a reminder today s call may include forward looking statements which represent the company s belief regarding future events which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the company s control our actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward looking statements we ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release you should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the sec q2 was a fantastic quarter with the exception of the first quarter this year it was the best one in interactive brokers history total accounts grew 61 versus a year ago a record say for the first quarter client equity grew 79 growth also outpaced only by q1 total client darts of 2 3 million were also except for q1 a record the same is true of our stock share and options contract volumes our business strength can also be seen in our overall metrics while our client equity or the cash and securities in client accounts grew 79 client margin loans rose even faster to a record high of 49 billion up 96 in contrast client credit balances or the cash and client accounts grew 16 why strong markets and an active client base let our customers utilize the interactive brokers platform to put proportionately more of their money to work in the market as percent of our client equity margin loans have risen from a pandemic outset low of 11 5 up to 13 4 as investors have grown more confident and want to participate in the market this increase is even more impressive when you consider that while for margin loans the numerator is based solely on client activity the denominator client equity is based on customer activity plus overall market performance even if there was no change in total margin loans rising markets mean that this ratio will naturally decline instead we see that this ratio increased nearly 200 basis points within a backdrop of rising global markets showing investor confidence and willingness to participate and the more our clients participate the stronger we become our reported pre tax margin was 72 and adjusted for non core items was 67 we know of no other broker who can claim margins close to this we see this investor confidence and strong activity across the globe in all geographies as we observed earlier this year this activity appears to be led more by individual investors than by institutions these customers tend to be sticky as they become familiar with our platform and especially internationally we offer the broadest geographic product offering and lowest costs to those investors and there are many who wish to invest internationally it is expensive to provide global market access with compliance legal currency and tax and reporting requirements different in each market and the cost to comply with all these requirements is high as three quarters of our accounts are international this competitive advantage continues to serve us well over time even as this period of covid winds down we see global interest in the markets and the rise of the electronic connectedness of individuals to financial markets institutions and each other driving more people to participate generating further interest in the financial markets among investors old and new we continue to see year over year growth in total accounts in the high 20 s to low 30 this is well above the high teens level year over year growth we experienced before the pandemic we continue to get better at giving our customers the power to navigate through our numerous high quality features more efficiently we continue to improve on giving them a customized work environment we continue to listen to them to learn what products and tools they want added and now to go over our record for the first quarter numbers we ended the quarter with a record 1 414 000 accounts a net increase of 61 once again we saw account growth in all client segments and all geographic regions with all areas showing over 50 growth with modestly more rapid growth in asia we saw growth in all five of the client types that we service i will now go over our five client segments individual customers who made up 63 of our accounts 37 of our client equity and 54 of our commissions continued their growth this quarter with 12 month account growth of 88 and client equity growth of 85 while commissions grew 48 in addition to the aforementioned factors continued active interest in markets by our investors worldwide increases in market indices and investor desire to improve on zero interest rate environment alternatives are some of the reasons behind the segment s strength all geographic areas we serve saw triple digit individual account growth with close to uniform growth rates across the americas europe and asia this proves the importance of providing a reliable platform to a global audience offering wide product choices and worldwide access and shows the clients want the maximum opportunities to invest in the variety of ways they prefer we continue to see growth in the hedge fund customer segment for the 12 months ended june 30 we saw 2 hedge fund account growth 54 customer equity growth and 5 commission growth we continue to benefit from a reputation for best price execution low and transparent margin and securities financing rates the quality of our platform and the strength of our balance sheet hedge funds represent 1 of our accounts 7 of our client equity and 6 of our commission proprietary trading firms are 2 of our accounts 9 of our client equity and 12 of commission for the quarter this group grew by 34 in accounts for the 12 month period 48 in client equity and 21 in commission prop trading firms are sensitive to the direction of volatility and trade more as volatility increases while not as high as the spike in the first quarter continuing strong volatility led to more active trading strategies while accounts and client equity grew due to more traders wanting to be on our platform to capitalize on its reputation for seamlessness and efficient trade executions financial advisors are 10 of our account 16 of our customer equity and 10 of our commissions this group grew accounts by 20 for the 12 month period customer equity by 52 and commissions by 6 percent account and client equity growth show are increasing penetration of the segment commissions were up by less than the account and equity growth as advisors typically tend to trade more conservatively while independent advisor business is small relative to fidelity or schwab those firms serve the advisor and individual segments only interactive brokers also caters to hedge funds and prop traders more demanding groups as far as certain functionality is concerned we add tools and build out our infrastructure based on input from each client segment and then make these improvements available to all of them as a result our platform has the richest set of tools and capabilities and with the strategy we get better and grow faster in each of our customer segments than our peers our final segment is introducing brokers these represent 26 of our accounts 32 of our client equity and 17 of our commissions ibroker segment account growth was 39 for the latest 12 months while client equity more than doubled growing 115 and commissions by 131 interactive brokers platform provides the global trading and seamless back office functionality critical for brokers who want to provide a global offering in order to capture clients worldwide who seek to invest and want to be able to access many markets in order to do so we continue to be excited about 2021 and beyond i know you were all going to ask me about a bitcoin introduction and we expected by the end of next month in other areas we ve provided content to coursera creating a certificate program for them called a practical guide to trading which covers equities forex us bond and derivatives trading you should also take a look at ibkr campus which offers over 50 courses on investment products trading tools and portfolio and risk analysis we want informed clients who will have the knowledge and tools to be with us for the long run and finally we look forward to the robinhood ipo so that our various metrics can be compared to another firm besides charles schwab with that i will turn the call over to our cfo paul brody who will go through the numbers for the quarter paul paul j brody chief financial officer treasurer secretary and director thank you nancy thanks everyone for joining the call as usual we ll review the quarterly operating results the non core items factors that drove those numbers and then we will open it up for questions starting with the operating data progressively stronger trading levels and record margin borrowing throughout the quarter drove robust operating metrics albeit below the unusual spike in the first quarter with the tailwind of rising world markets on positive vaccination and economic news and low interest rate continued global interest in financial markets amid the search for higher yield led to industry trading volumes that are still above the activity levels in 2020 in most products mean stock trading volume came down from the extreme highs of the first quarter which impacted industry volume mainly in stock so over the course of the second quarter trading by our active trader customer base rose from april lows volatility as measured by the average vix fell from the unusually high levels that reached early last year at the beginning of the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic a time of great uncertainty amid rising case numbers worldwide the average vix fell from 35 in the second quarter last year to 18 this quarter and while it has come down recently the vix is still stronger than pre pandemic levels reflecting perhaps the unevenness of the reopening of economies worldwide merit to the second quarter of 2020 our quarterly total darts rose 32 to 2 3 million second only to the unusually active first quarter our customer trade volumes rose year on year in several product classes led by increases of 34 and 160 in options and stock volumes respectively stock volume was inflated by trading in low priced stocks though even after removing those from our calculation our share volume still rose 36 again these volumes are second only to those of the first quarter futures volume declined 19 year on year but remained modestly higher than the pre pandemic level fx dollar volumes this quarter were lower a trend we have seen since the explosion of volume in early 2020 and now are about even with pre pandemic levels total accounts reached a record 1 414 000 up 61 over the prior year contributing to customer equity growing 79 from the second quarter of 2020 to 363 5 billion our overall average commission per cleared commissionable order declined 15 versus last year to 2 38 so it rose 3 versus first quarter factors impacting this decline include a product mix that featured smaller average trade size as an options forex and our continued success in capturing liquidity rebate some or all of which are passed through to our clients capturing these rebates reduces the overall commission our clients pay decreasing the average commission per dart but also reduces the exchange fees we pay on the expense side making their net impact neutral to our bottom line moving to our net interest margin table our net interest margin rose from 0 99 to 1 15 year over year driven by margin lending and securities lending quarter over quarter our nim declined from 1 26 to 1 15 partially impacted by a decrease in the average effective us benchmark fed funds rate from 8 to 7 basis points with a further impact from most other rates worldwide remaining at or below zero securities lending and margin loans were the largest contributors to our net interest income securities lending was particularly strong this quarter down from a spike in the first quarter when several stocks presented us opportunities to lend at higher rate utilizing our in house developed system our team executed on opportunities to lend hard to borrow names that investors were looking to short net interest income from securities lending reached 136 million this quarter up 70 year over year average margin loan balances rose 94 versus last year as investors continue to grow more comfortable of taking on risk and leverage higher year over year balances led to a 97 increase in margin loan interest income to 128 million in light of the flat yield curve we kept the duration of our portfolio relatively short and recorded an immaterial mark to market loss on our holdings of us treasuries outside the us notably in europe where we have grown accounts at 55 and client equity by 70 negative benchmark interest rates in some currencies have affected our ability to achieve acceptable yields on our segregated cash in this region this has led to a couple of unusual factors over the past few quarters we have earned interest on our customer credit balances as we pass through negative rate costs on large balances in these currencies our aggregate yield on segregated cash in this quarter was immaterial but slightly negative so it was driven by increased customer cash balances and negative rate currencies although offset by the pass through of costs i just mentioned aggregate segregated cash balances fell 13 as clients use more cash to invest in the financial markets and more cash was used to fund margin lending in the us this overall decline along with inflows in negative rate currencies led to a drop in our segregated cash net interest to minus 2 million including the pass through of 8 million of the negative rate interest to customers the net interest earned on segregated cash balances was 6 million for the quarter note that for accounting purposes our fdic sweep program which was 2 7 billion in the second quarter removes funds that would otherwise be included in segregated cash balances on our balance sheet now for our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in rates calculating the impact of rate changes we understand that as the possibility of a future rate increase becomes more certain this expectation is typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest therefore we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected rise or fall in rate separate from the impact of rate hikes or cuts that have already been baked into the prices of these instruments with that assumption we would expect the next 25 basis point unanticipated rise in rates to produce an additional 99 million in net interest income over the next four quarters and 102 million as the yearly run rate based on our current balance sheet our net interest income is highly sensitive to small rate increases due to the impact of low benchmark rates on the spread between what we earn on our segregated cash and what we pay to our customers as us rates fell below 50 basis points our spread compressed as we earn less on our segregated cash however the converse is also true that as rates move back up toward 50 basis points the spread rises the 102 million run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new assumed rate but does not take into account any change in how we may manage our segregated cash a 25 basis point unanticipated fall in rates would produce a decline in net interest income of 32 million over the next four quarters and 32 million as well for the yearly run rate as a reminder about a quarter of our customer credit balances are not in us dollars and so changes in rates that occur in the us do not apply to all of our balance turning to the income statement we define it non core items as those are not part of our fundamental operating results non core adjusting items versus the year ago quarter are as follows our currency diversification strategy swung from a gain of 16 million a year ago to a loss of 9 million this quarter for a comparative decrease in income of 25 million investment gains and losses rose from a gain of 13 million to a gain of 113 million this quarter for a comparative increase of 100 million and mark to market on us government securities went from a 13 million loss to about zero this quarter a comparative increase of 13 million the net effect of these items increased pre tax income by 104 million this quarter a positive shift of 88 million over last year s quarter net revenues were a reported 754 million for the quarter up 40 versus last year s second quarter excluding non core items net revenues were up 24 to 650 million commission revenue rose 11 on higher volumes year on year particularly in stocks and options net interest income rose 40 to 274 million despite continued low benchmark interest rates thanks to growth in our balance sheet higher margin loan balances and our successful securities lending efforts our growth in net interest was robust other fees and services revenues which include market data exposure account activity fdic bank sweep program and ipo facilitation fees as well as order flow income from options exchange mandated programs rose 38 to 55 million top three contributors were at risk exposure fees which were up 6 million market data fees which were up 5 million and liquidity payments from options exchanges which rose 2 million other income which includes gains and losses on our investments and currency diversification strategy as well as principle transaction showed a gain of 118 million up from a gain of 27 million in last year s quarter ex non core items other income increased 27 to 14 million non interest expenses were 213 million for the quarter down 33 from last year s quarter larger exchange liquidity rebate lower futures volume and a 6 million clearing fee rebate drove a 29 reduction in execution clearing and distribution fees to 54 million despite the higher stock and options volume as mentioned a portion of exchange liquidity rebates are passed through to our clients and are reflected in reduced commission fixed expenses were 158 million down 34 driven by a 73 decrease in g a expense last year s g a included a 103 million in costs associated with the wti oil futures event at quarter end our total head count stood at 2 429 a 34 increase over last year we continue to hire aggressively in client services to support the influx of new accounts as well as in software development note too that brexit requires that we open offices in europe which are now fully operational in hungary as well as in ireland customer bad debt expense was 1 million well contained for a highly active trading period reported pre tax income more than doubled from last year s quarter to 541 million for a 72 pre tax margin and excluding non core items pre tax income rose 41 to 437 million 67 pre tax margin diluted earnings per share were 1 for the quarter versus 0 40 for the same period in 2020 and ex non core items diluted earnings per share were 0 82 versus 0 57 as adjusted last year now to help investors better understand our earnings taxes and the split between public shareholders and the non controlling interests the second quarter numbers are as follows starting with our pre tax income of 541 million we removed 1 million income at the holding company then we deduct 12 million for income taxes paid by our operating companies which are mostly foreign tax this leaves 528 million of which 78 1 or that 414 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non controlling interests the remaining 21 9 or 114 million is available for the public company shareholders as this is a non gaap gap measure it is not reported on our income statement after we expensed remaining taxes owed by the public company 23 million on that 114 million the net income available for common stockholders is the 92 million you see reported on our income statement note that public companies tax is proportionately higher than last year primarily because ibg inc s ownership rose from 18 6 to 21 9 our total income tax expense of 35 million consists of this 23 million plus the 12 million of tax paid by the operating company turning to the balance sheet with 9 9 billion in consolidated equity at june 30 2021 we re well capitalized from a regulatory standpoint we deploy our strong capital base toward opportunities to grow our business and investment opportunities worldwide as well as to emphasize the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners our capital is deployed across 14 registered broker dealer type entities around the world supporting regulatory capital requirements liquidity needs margin lending and other financing opportunities in our growing brokerage business and we continue to carry no long term debt now i ll turn the call back over to the moderator and we will take questions questions and answers operator and thank you and our first question comes from rich repetto from piper sandler your line is now open rich repetto piper sandler analyst good evening thomas good evening paul i guess my first question is on interest and interest sensitivity and i know paul you gave us the sensitivity to the 25 basis points move but i was just trying to see if when and if the fed get to 50 basis points or above i know you share that completely with customers but you don t share it if they have less than 100 000 or pro rata and they need 10 000 cash is there any way we can get a i think you d give it in the past about how much cash is we call rate insensitive that would fall that wouldn t be get share that interest above the fed rate of 50 basis points and then the other part would be just what could you do on treasuries in your reinvestments sort of policy how could the nim expand if potentially treasuries were to widen out paul j brody chief financial officer treasurer secretary and director i can take the first one certainly yeah our fully interest rate sensitive credit amount to about 14 of the total credit about 11 2 billion at the end of the quarter so that can give you an idea of the portion on which we can fully capture any other rate increases and to the second i would turn that went over to thomas with regard to investment policy on depending on the yield curve i guess is really your question yeah thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors so we re going to remain invested for the short term because i wouldn t dare to go out very far on the yield curve especially with the rising inflation prospects but as to your first question the first 0 5 is just completely ours right you understand it so then fed rates going to 0 5 that is completely ours from there on we share but our clients with less than 100 000 they have only about sum total of 10 billion rich repetto piper sandler analyst understood yes and the if we got i m just trying to understand if we looked at last rate cycle your net interest your nim expanded dramatically and if i m not saying today but if the yield curve changed dramatically in a rising rate scenario wouldn t we expect some nim expansion because you would go farther out the curve on treasuries rather than staying short on the short end right now paul j brody chief financial officer treasurer secretary and director it s not because we were not further out i mean we went out maybe a year but it s mostly because the first half percent is a huge amount of money on 85 billion of free cash we re seeking in them customer cash rich repetto piper sandler analyst got it okay my last question would be thomas you ve talked about regulatory issues any have your views on payment for order flow of what any changes to market structure that you could that you re at least bracing for or think could possibly change over the next 12 to 18 months thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors so i cannot foresee any change because basically this has been the business of wall street for 200 years now namely customer order comes in and the firm trades against it right now all that is happening with schwab on the wrong side on the other is that they are two different companies but so if that prohibited order flow what would happened is and the same thing will just continue right so i don t think that this that any of i don t think that any of the payment for orders can be prohibited it just unbundles the traditional the traditional wall street model rich repetto piper sandler analyst got it super helpful thomas thank you operator and thank you and our next question comes from dan fannon from jefferies your line is now open dan fannon jefferies analyst thanks so just a follow up on some of the account metrics and the growth numbers that you guys cited in regions continues to be very strong i believe last quarter you talked about china and hong kong being slightly weaker but so just curious if there s anything underneath at a country level or other areas where things are potentially not as strong as otherwise would be expected thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors china continues to be weaker even weaker than in the previous quarter and i mean to practically nothing and hong kong is just itself may not be as strong as it was a year ago but would sort of continues otherwise the europe especially eastern europe the middle east and south america these are especially strong dan fannon jefferies analyst in the profile of the customer being added today any kind of material difference or change than what you ve seen historically thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors well in the mix maybe there are some smaller customers but we also got larger customers in there due to our institution networks such as the prop trading firms and the investment advisors so overall there isn t a substantial difference in the mix of and the size of customers dan fannon jefferies analyst thank you operator and thank you and our next question comes from kyle voigt from kbw your line is now open kyle voigt kbw analyst hi good evening so thomas if you look at may and june metrics specifically i think you re running around 23 or 24 annualized account growth rate in the past you had said you thought the account growth would kind of normalize toward kind of maybe high 20 or around 30 range but it seems like the trajectory of the growth over the past couple months is trending below that so i guess any updated thoughts on where you think that account growth will stabilize as this kind of work from home environment ends and the operating environment normalizes thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors my best guess is 30 i m aware that may was lower june was also lower and although not 23 like 27 but my best guess going forward is 30 kyle voigt kbw analyst okay and second question is on the elimination of the monthly inactivity fees i think we probably asked about this for a long time a lot of the analyst community so i m wondering can you help us understand why you thought now is the right time to eliminate these fees do you think that could impact to your account growth rate and does this move kind of suggests the shift in strategy in terms of wanting to target maybe smaller less active individual traders which is a little bit different than where you historically targeted thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors so it is not saying that traders new traders and existing folks that decide to hang up their hats for a while and not trade and so they have been doing this they closed their accounts and then in order to save the inactivity fee and so they come back a year or two later but they won t necessarily come back to us they go to some other broker so that s what we want to prevent so we want to we would like to hold on to the people who have had accounts with us to run them to continue to have accounts with us even if they become inactive for a while and so the account is open even if they just leave a few dollars and then when they are ready to invest again they will do it with us kyle voigt kbw analyst understood and then just maybe my final questions on securities lending just down from a record first quarter but still grew 70 year on year the revenues there i guess when we think about the current sec lending environment would you still think that this is an elevated revenue level or i guess i m asking if this should be a good run rate going forward because as i said 70 year on year growth in revenues but your average plan on equity was also up over 70 year over year and account growth was also up very strongly but just curious on your thoughts on the current kind of environment for sec lending thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors i didn t understand the first security funding you said kyle voigt kbw analyst securities lending thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors lending ok kyle voigt kbw analyst sorry thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors i can comment on it thomas sure i mean as we always say it s driven by both as the customer base grows and balances grow it is driven by higher short balances and greater inventory to lend but it is most particularly driven by stocks that get hot in the marketplace and for some period of time sometimes very short sometimes an extended period of time we can lend them out at very high rate and so we had some experience with that this past quarter we had more in the first quarter these stocks just come and go as you know you can read about them in the news we were just able to take advantage of them both because our customers our money against them but also because we have a fully paid lending program we call stock yield enhancement program and so we ve seen growth there and it provides us opportunities to increase revenues because we re now lending out more of our customers stock in that program paul j brody chief financial officer treasurer secretary and director i would add to that that our especially lower margin rates brings in a lot of clients who want to carry positions on margin and as you know those positions are available to us to lend so there is a benefit to charging the very low margin rate kyle voigt kbw analyst great thanks thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from chris allen from compass point your line is now open chris allen compass point analyst good evening everyone maybe just a follow up on kyle s question on the monthly activity fees any estimate in terms of how many accounts have been closed to save on the activity fees maybe over the last year or two paul j brody chief financial officer treasurer secretary and director i would guess about 25 000 accounts a year but that s a guess chris allen compass point analyst got it and then i think it was yesterday you announced new pricing over in europe the standard pricing i guess started in western europe maybe just some color just in terms of what was the catalyst to introduce new pricing scheme any estimate in terms of financial impact paul j brody chief financial officer treasurer secretary and director so there is no financial impact to speak of but competitors were advertising these simple rates our issue was that our rates were not so simple and so we re not going to say that it s eur3 or gbp3 or 3 whatever your currency is and so it competes well with other folks in the marketplace chris allen compass point analyst understood thanks that s it from me operator and thank you and ladies and gentlemen i would now like to turn the call back to nancy stuebe director of investor relations for closing remarks i apologize we have a follow up question from rich repetto from piper sandler rich repetto piper sandler analyst want to get one more in thomas a quick one i think paul could you define fully paid securities lending versus just i guess margin loan lending and then also do you think that just because we re trading in the us markets almost 50 higher levels at 10 billion shares a day versus 7 billion in 2019 does that make it more likely that stocks are that you have these scare stocks just because there s more trading overall like in other words more evidence that the elevated securities lending could be could stay elevated going forward paul j brody chief financial officer treasurer secretary and director well certainly the greater inventory we have the more likely it is that we have more shares in the high rate stocks to lend and this feeds on itself as thomas said as our low rates attract more margin lending that frees up those that body of stocks for us to lend on that we earn 100 of the revenue because they are margin stocks and on the fully paid stocks we share that revenue generally 50 50 with our customer a fully paid means it s either complete fully paid even in a cash account or margin account where there maybe margin borrowing by the customer that s not a full amount of margin borrowing that the customer can put on which leaves some of the stocks to be not collateralized in margin loans and therefore they are fully paid we can still lend them out and in fact the customer will earn something on those shares rich repetto piper sandler analyst got it thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors so we have an outright agreement with some of our customers in which we agree they agree that we can lend out the shares that are fully paid for and we agree to all of them as far as the credit risk so we guarantee them against credit risk and we give them the proceeds rich repetto piper sandler analyst understood thank you very helpful that s all i have operator thank you and i m showing no further questions i would now like to turn the call back to nancy stuebe director of investor relations for closing remarks nancy stuebe director investor relations thank you everyone for participating today as a reminder this call will be available for replay on our website and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow thank you again

executive officer good morning everybody and welcome to our second quarter earnings call as mentioned with me are dave dykstra our chief operating officer dave stoehr our cfo kate boege our general counsel tim crane president and rich murphy vice chairman of credit we re going to stick with the format we started in first quarter you don t have to listen to me as much you can listen to dave is going to talk more well i m going to give some general comments about our results dave is going to dave dykstra will give us a detailed analysis of the income statement tim crane will talk about the balance sheet rich murphy will provide an overview of credit and back to me for some summary comments and thoughts about the future of course time for questions last april at the start of the pandemic and the government massive response to it dakota in a long zero interest rate environment i indicated wintrust supports would be to try to grow through it today we have accomplish this goal so so far so good second quarter shows the strategy is working the growth today has been all our growth to date has been organic since that period of time third quarter was all round 1 billion quarter i d like to say assets deposits and core loans out of ppp loans grew by approximately 1 billion plus or minus our growth prospects remain very good and income for the quarter totaled 105 million or 1 70 per common share year to date income was 258 3 million or 4 24 per common share our reported net interest margin grew nine basis points to 2 63 while net interest income was up 17 7 million in q1 but to back out the ppp loan income the nim grew three basis points 2 49 core loan growth and investment activity was at the end of the quarter so this bodes well for quarter three period end loans exceeded average loans in the quarter by over 800 million so we start q3 with a nice with that in our back pocket i d say loan growth was excellent our pipeline and the pipelines in all our businesses remain very good it s important to note line usage it s out to an all time low about 39 normal average is closer to 50 so we re going to go back there we have 1 billion of growth built in there credit quality got even better with net charge offs totaling two basis points npls and npas reached down npls were fell 11 3 million to 87 7 million or 27 basis points our npas fell 1 6 million to stand at 22 basis points total assets this resulted in a reserve release of about 53 3 million keep saying credit can t get better it keeps getting better it s hard to believe the mortgage experienced inevitable decline in the quarter dave will discuss this in detail it should be noted wealth management has been that had been immune to this growth story assets under administration grew to 2 billion or 5 3 or 25 annualized in the quarter will see overall market and new business our wealth management assets now total 34 2 billion to 32 2 billion in the quarter 1 30 billion at the end of the prior year i will turn to dave who would review the income statement tim crane president this is tim i ll do the balance sheet maybe just for a second and then turn it over to dave as ed mentioned in the quarter assets grew a 1 1 billion to 46 7 billion a couple of items worth highlighting here first we experienced very strong core loan growth loans excluding ppp were up 1 2 billion in the quarter growth was spread nicely across loan categories commercial real estate and our niche businesses rich will share a little more detail in a few minutes on a percentage basis this 1 2 billion equates to 15 annualized growth and on a year to date basis our loan growth excluding ppp is just over 11 annualized as ed mentioned we believe these growth numbers are solid and as during the quarter we continued to see a decline in utilization the trend in the coming quarters we hope will reverse and will help rather than hurt our loan growth activity in addition the pipelines remain strong as we see evidence of accelerating economic activity in our markets with respect to ppp loans we saw a reduction of 1 4 billion as the forgiveness activity accelerated materially during the quarter total ppp loans at the end of the quarter were 1 9 billion down from a peak of 3 3 billion at the end of the first quarter for the remainder of the year we remain comfortable with our loan growth target of mid to high single digits on a percentage basis but could see upside with either improved line of credit utilization or continued strong market conditions deposit growth for the quarter was 932 million the majority of the growth in non interest bearing dda this represents annualized growth of nearly 10 deposit costs continue to fall as we primarily reprice term deposits for the quarter the cost of interest bearing deposits fell an additional 7 basis points to 38 basis points a trend we expect to continue in the coming quarters notably the non interest bearing dda deposits now comprise a third of our total deposits as we ve noted in prior quarters we re monitoring the significant deposit growth carefully however we view stable low cost deposits as a strength of our company and we ll continue to grow those deposits related to client relationships obviously like many institutions we also remain very liquid with rates falling and at low levels for most of the quarter we held our securities position essentially stable during the quarter we remain cautious in our deployment of the excess liquidity wary of locking in low long term yields we continue to evaluate our options in view of the appropriate deployment of this liquidity as an opportunity in future periods given where we think volumes will land going forward we expect generally steady to improving net interest income in the coming quarters despite lower levels of ppp accretion and excluding ppp expect a generally steady net interest margin capital levels essentially held steady during the quarter with strong growth and remain appropriate given the conservative risk profile of the bank overall we remain well positioned to benefit from either stronger economic activity or higher rates or both as we enter the second half of the year dave david dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer all right thanks tim as ed indicated i ll cover the noteworthy income statement categories starting first with the net interest income for the second quarter of 2021 net interest income totaled 279 6 million that was an increase of 17 7 million as compared to the first quarter of 2021 and an increase of 16 5 million as compared to the second quarter of last year the 17 7 million increase in net interest income compared to the first quarter was primarily due to the earning asset growth which was up 9 over the prior quarter net interest margin expansion and one additional day in the second quarter and for your reference one additional day approximates 3 million of net interest income for wintrust the net interest margin improved 9 basis points from the prior quarter to 2 63 as the rate on interest bearing liabilities declined 7 basis points in the second quarter as compared to the prior quarter and a 4 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets was partially offset by a 2 basis point decline in our net free funds contribution the 4 basis point improvement in the yield on earning assets was comprised of a 3 basis point increase in the yield on loans and a 13 basis point increase in the yield on liquidity management assets due to the appointment of a portion of our liquidity into investment securities late in the first quarter the decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to a 7 basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing deposits primarily due to the lower repricing of time deposits ppp fee accretion as we noted in the press release was 25 2 million of recognition in the second quarter compared to 19 2 million in the first quarter of 2021 as forgiveness activity accelerated during the quarter and additionally as tim noted the margin was again affected by excess liquidity on the balance sheet and we believe the that the deployment of such liquidity when market conditions improve will be tailwind to our net interest margin turning to the provision for credit losses similar to many other banks that have reported this quarter one press recorded a negative provision for credit losses of 15 3 million compared to a directionally similar negative provision of 45 3 million in the prior quarter and 135 1 million provision expense recorded in the year ago quarter the negative provision was driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses primarily due to improvements in macroeconomic forecast including improvements in the commercial real estate price index and the baa corporate credit spreads additionally company saw improvement in loan portfolio characteristics during the quarter including decreases in covid 19 related loan modifications and improving loan risk rating migrations slide 13 through 20 of the presentation deck that we provided on our website we ll give you additional details about the improvement in the non performing loan the covid 19 modified loans and the macroeconomic factors impacting the allowance for credit losses and rich will cover credit quality in a lot more detail in just a few minutes turning to non interest income the non interest expense and the income tax sections in the non interest income portion of the income statement our wealth management revenue increased 1 4 million to another record level of 30 7 million in the second quarter compared to 29 3 million in the first quarter and that revenue sources up 36 from the 22 6 million recorded in the year ago quarter this revenue source has been positively impacted by higher equity valuations which impact the pricing on our managed asset accounts turning to mortgage banking revenue we saw reasonably strong loan origination volumes during the second quarter but that origination volume was off the record high level seen in the past few quarters to lower refinance activity in the marketplace to that end the company originated approximately 1 7 billion of mortgage loans for sale in the second quarter of 2021 down 22 from the approximately 2 2 billion in each of the prior quarter and the second quarter of last year mortgage banking revenue decreased to 50 6 million for the second quarter as compared to 113 5 million in the first quarter of 2021 contributing to the 62 9 million reduction in revenue were the following items a 29 million decline in revenue related to the impact of the msr valuation and the msr capitalization net of pay offs and pay downs the 29 million negative impact of the value of the mortgage servicing rights primarily related to a positive fair value adjustment of 18 million in the first quarter of the year as compared to a decrease of 5 5 million in the current quarter as well as the decrease in the value of capitalization of retained mortgage servicing rights due to a decline in loans sold with servicing retained another 21 million reduction was due to reduced gain on sale primarily associated with the aforementioned lower production volume and a 13 million decline due to secondary marketing gains and mark to market impact of declining interest rate lock commitment pipeline so our pipeline was smaller at the end of the second quarter than the first quarter first quarter of 2021 also benefited from atypical elevated levels of secondary marketing gains related to the market environment in the first quarter where we had strong investor demand general margin enhancement due to historically strong consumer demand and the timing associated with recognized gains on hedging trades in the prior quarter the normalization of that market drove a quarterly swing to a more typical range of secondary gains in the second quarter looking forward based on the current pipeline activity we expect mortgage originations we saw in the third quarter to be very similar to slightly less than the origination volumes we experienced in the second quarter and the mortgage revenue excluding any msr valuation adjustments to be roughly in line with the second quarter or in the mid 50 million range however i should note that although the aforementioned revenue estimate for the third quarter is expected to be in line with the second quarter the operating expenses should trend lower in the third quarter as many of you know we essentially record the net mortgage revenue when we lock the interest rate commitment on the majority of loans that we expect to originate and sell accordingly expense reductions lagged the revenue recognition as we still need to underwrite process and close those loans that are in the pipeline as well as pay commissions once the loans close since the mortgage loans in the pipeline were substantially higher at the end of the first quarter the expenses associated with processing and closing that pipeline naturally lagged end of the second quarter and lagged the drop off in revenue as the pipeline of loans has decreased during the second quarter we would expect to see a corresponding decrease in mortgage related expenses in the third quarter so currently assuming the mid 50 million range of revenue excluding any msr valuation we anticipate mortgage related non interest expenses to decline further in the third quarter in the 8 million range i should note that when you evaluate the mortgage expenses relative to market revenue decline you should consider the 29 million of the msr valuation decline of 13 million related to the secondary marketing gains in decline in the pipeline or 42 million in aggregate of revenue decline would not have any associated expense reduction so those amounts are simply valuation measurements so the expense reductions really follow through with the production decline of 21 million so our mortgage expense reductions in the first quarter were generally 7 million to 8 million of commission reductions a couple of million dollars of other expense reductions and then we expected an additional 8 million of expense reductions in the third quarter with that being said i have to caveat that in the last few days the interest rates have dropped considerably and the pipeline of new applications have increased if that continues we would expect the mortgage revenue to be higher than what i just guided and expenses associated with that revenue would also guide a little higher than what i just said but we should be able to lock in that net 8 million of additional profitability on that production decline in revenue that we saw also i should note that valuation adjustment and the state interest rates and we re not going to speculate on where rates will be at the end of the third quarter and so those amounts that i just talked about would be exclusive of the msrs other non interest income totaled 20 4 million in the second quarter was up 4 7 million from the 15 7 million recorded in the prior quarter the primary reason for that increase was a 4 million gain on the sale of few branch locations in south western wisconsin that previously disclosed transaction closed during the second quarter in the non interest expense categories non interest expenses totaled 280 1 million down approximately 6 8 million or 2 from the 286 9 million recorded in the prior quarter there are a handful of categories that account for the majority of the change from the prior quarter that i ll focus on first salaries and employee benefits expense decreased by 8 million in the second quarter compared to the first quarter the 8 million decline is primarily related to 7 6 million of lower commissions and incentive comp primarily related to the decline in commissions related to the lower mortgage originations that i just talked about occupancy expense totaled 17 7 million in the first quarter decreasing 2 3 million from the 20 million recorded in the prior quarter that decrease was primarily the result of the first quarter of the year including a 1 4 million impairment charge associated with the plant closure of a branch location and the current quarter having a lower level of maintenance and repairs expense similar to recent years other than 2020 which was impacted by the pandemic marketing expenses increased by approximately 2 8 million from the first quarter to 11 3 million as we ve discussed on previous calls this category of expenses increased as our corporate sponsorships tend to be higher in the second and third quarter of the year due primarily to our marketing efforts related to various major and minor league baseball sponsorships as well as sponsorship of summer time events held in the communities that we serve so other than those expense categories that i discussed all other expense categories in the aggregate were up by less than 1 million compared to the first quarter and nothing noteworthy to discuss moving on the income tax expense the effective tax rate in the first quarter was approximately 27 which is in the 26 to 27 range that we would normally expect so nothing significant there to talk about so in summary other than the nuance associated with the normalizing mortgage market and the undesirable swing in the msr valuation the core fundamentals were strong with robust loan and deposit growth increased net interest margin improved credit quality record wealth management revenue and lower expenses so with that i will conclude my comments and turn it over to rich murphy rich murphy vice chairman chief lending officer thanks dave as noted earlier credit performance for the quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives loan growth net of ppp was 1 2 billion and this growth was across the portfolio but a couple of areas really stood out first insurance funding where we financed commercial insurance premiums grew by 563 million an outstanding quarter which was the result of a number of new larger relationships a hardening market which took our average premium up to 39 000 from 34 000 in the first quarter and the continued popularity of financing insurance premiums due to lower interest rates and wintrust life finance grew by 248 million or 16 annualized as we have seen this product grow by over 1 billion over the past year as more people are looking at life insurance as a key part of their state plan and the market allows them to finance the product at historically low rates from a core loan perspective commercial loans excluding ppp grew by 148 million or 6 3 annualized most of which closed at the very end of the quarter and commercial real estate loans grew by 134 million or 6 3 annualized as well a couple of additional notes on loan growth pipeline levels continue to look very strong the total core pipeline is approximately 1 3 billion and consistent with what we saw in q1 and as ed and tim pointed out while we are pleased with the overall level of core loan growth we think that this number is muted by the line of the level of line utilization which fell to 38 in q2 compared to pre pandemic levels in the upper 40 range this lower utilization resulted in funded balances being reduced by approximately 1 billion and i d also like to point out the granularity within the portfolio as we have talked about in prior quarters one of the keys to our credit portfolio has been diversification across a number of product lines this quarter was a great example of that strategy while we continue to have good consistent growth from our core portfolio our niche products have allowed us to grow the overall portfolio well ahead of projections in addition slide 12 details the geographic diversification in our portfolio as we have stated before wintrust will always have a chicago milwaukee nexus however as this slide illustrates our various product lines provide us with a meaningful amount of credit opportunities outside of our primary markets from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide 13 we continue to see meaningful improvement in credit performance across the portfolio as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic this can be seen in a number of metrics nonperforming loans to reduce from 99 million at the end of q1 to 88 million at the end of the second quarter this is roughly half the level of npls we saw at the end of the third quarter of 2020 we recorded 2 million of net charge offs during the quarter which was down from 13 million in the previous quarter this is a very good quarter from a charge off perspective and helped by a number of recoveries primarily out of the first insurance funding portfolio we also saw a reduction of over 40 in covid 19 modified loans from 254 million to 146 million during the quarter as outlined on slide 19 the majority of these remaining modified loans are primarily in our select high risk impact industries and credit ratings continue to show meaningful positive migrations as our customers continue to recover finally on ppp as outlined on slide 14 we funded 4 9 million to more than 4 9 billion to more than 15 000 different businesses through the ppp program we cannot be happier with the results from this program and the positive effects on our customers and community it was an enormous team effort and we are so proud of the employees of wintrust who made it possible we are now focused on working with our customers to process their applications for forgiveness this is proceeding very well as we have now processed forgiveness applications and over 90 of our 2020 ppp loans and over 80 of those loans have received their final forgiveness decision that concludes my comments and i ll turn it back to ed to wrap up edward wehmer founder chief executive officer thanks rich as i mentioned at the beginning of the call our strategy throughout this has been to grow the balance sheet during this period of low rates these are structural hedges like mortgages to buffer the loss of net interest income till such time as a balance sheet growth can offset the income loss due to lower rates ppp loans were an expected benefit add on to this strategy all the above was we accomplished while enhancing our asset sensitivity position anticipation eventual higher rates balance sheet growth for the year asset growth of 1 7 billion the core loan was 1 7 billion excluding loans held for sale on ppp we ve experienced all this as tim laid out has been done on a totally organic basis the acquisition market which has been sleeping today today appears to be picking up based upon the amount of inbound calls we ve received lately sellers still have rather high expectations so we re going to see where all this ends up as rich said loan pipelines remain extremely strong in all our major categories our asset sensitivity position is where we want it we continue to leg into our investment our excess liquidity take advantage of market blips we totally invested locking in allows you long term rates does make a lot of sense to us credit is remarkably good thanks to our consistently conservative credit standards our loan portfolio both about our lending line and credit talks npas npls are lower than they were before the start of the pandemic our major areas delivering strong results and assets under administration continue to grow so that the plan is working we need to continue in order to bring this plan to total fulfillment organic growth should remain strong we will take advantage of the opening of the acquisition market if it actually makes some sense and want to be as core growth that would offset any reduction in ppp loans and we seem to be doing that i think that the end of the day if we get another 1 billion loan growth quarter and by the end of the year we should have made up for the ppp loans which should actually help our margin to some extent and the net interest income so basically we feel very good about where we are right now the plan is achieving what we set out to achieve and we will continue to take what the market gives us and with that i turn over to some questions thank you questions and answers operator your first question coming from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst thanks good morning edward wehmer founder chief executive officer hi john jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst thanks for the help on some of the expectations here and i think on mortgage and nii and expenses and i did want to ask on the loan growth tim you talked about accelerating economic activity and then rich you talked about a little bit higher commercial at the end of the quarter curious what you guys are seeing outside of the premium finance businesses in terms of some of the growth potential there is it spreading to broaden out and then just a sustainability of the premium finance growth as well rich murphy vice chairman chief lending officer yeah i ll take the course question first so i think that we are seeing our customers feeling much better about the prospects going into the back half of the year i think confidence has really improved dramatically i think there are obviously some headwinds that are making people nervous i think labor availability is an issue and obviously the uptick in covid cases test people a little bit anxious but overall i think we re feeling pretty good about where our existing customers are and i think you will see line utilization increase as we go into the back half of the year and as we ve talked about in the past jon the concept of becoming chicago s bank has really started to happen i mean we really feel like at this point in time we are a go to bank in terms of new opportunities the pipelines are very good and i think we ll continue to bring more customers on as a result of the disruption that s been in the market the most recent announcement as it relates to first midwest helps us as well so we re pretty confident about where core loan growth might be going into the back half of the year as it relates to first insurance i think the hard market is not going away anytime soon i think that as you see the team and the p c side has done a very good job bringing in new relationships you got the hard market you really have a lot of good strong momentum there and the life side similarly we had anticipated that things were going to begin slowing down in the back half of the year but in talking with that team as recent as recently as yesterday they are also feeling very good about where the back half of the year could go so again we re not changing our guidance but we re feeling pretty comfortable right now that momentum will continue at least through year end jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay edward wehmer founder chief executive officer we have to thank mr biden president biden for talking about the state planning and the state taxes in that regard so at leas he s doing something right for us jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst that s good that s good question for you dave this is a more difficult question but when you think about the mortgage line and i know there s a lot that goes into it but the business really took off when the pandemic hit and when you look at some of the numbers prior to the pandemic it was in the 50 million a quarter range and i m just wondering if there s anything materially different about your business today than where it was pre pandemic other than rates and just obviously what i m trying to get at is just longer term expectations for the business so anything you can do to help us out on that i d appreciate david dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer yeah well i think the mix between veterans first and the retail has been fairly stable the refi volume has obviously dropped off a little bit although with this recent drop i think that it looks like that may be picking up a little bit where people are bouncing back in but longer term i think we have better technology and we have better tools to reach people than just guys sitting in the street physically and those tools help those guys the street physically to serve their customers better and do more deals so i think our technology is better but at the end of the day it s still good old fashioned service with improved technology i just i don t see anything substantially different between that mix of business or our ability to serve the customers obviously we continue to expand our footprint a little bit into some different areas of the of our market we hopefully can pick up some additional customers but i wouldn t say it s dramatically different just on improved product improved service model jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst all right thanks for the help rich murphy vice chairman chief lending officer thank you operator and our next question coming from the line of david long with raymond james your line is open david long raymond james analyst hi david good morning everyone just as it relates to deposits you ve had some very good deposit growth a lot of liquidity created is your sense that these deposits are sticky are these new relationships they re going to remain on your balance sheet for quite some time or as things improve and customers start to spend again do you see a drop off in those deposits edward wehmer founder chief executive officer well judging by the activity in our treasury area these are all the relationships for the most part a lot of it is the leftover from the ppp loans we picked up close to 500 new customers as we bring them in it those are pretty sticky those are all full relationship so tim your thoughts tim crane president yeah i mean david we re watching it carefully but we feel pretty good i mean we continue to add households we don t disclose numbers here but we get the digital lift that everybody else is reporting on their calls and folks have good tool so we ve added a couple of branches which will continue to bring a few more online between now and end of the year so i guess we ll watch it carefully but so far it s pretty sticky david long raymond james analyst got it and then on the lending side the commercial side with your core c i stuff as far as the competitive backdrop we talked a little bit about that but internally are you guys doing anything differently are you able to loosen anything in your i don t know if it s standards is the right word but how have you changed internally your willingness to lend on the commercial side over the last few quarters edward wehmer founder chief executive officer well david i said this often we do not change our loan policy or our pricing decisions right away those are sacrosanct so we re not seeing anymore we exceptions or deviations from our profitability models so to say are we doing anything differently i would say no we re not changing our credit stance at all we never do that murphy your thoughts rich murphy vice chairman chief lending officer yeah no i would agree with that i mean it s something we talk about on a regular basis in our credit meetings just where the market is at because the market is very competitive i m sure you hear that through as you talk to other banks that price competition is very hot structural competition is also pretty aggressive so we re very mindful of that topic and we just have to know where the lines are and i think we have really good communication between the lines and our credit people just to make sure that we re all on the same page and i think we ve done a pretty good job so far in that regard one maybe note to that is just as we continue to grow we look at different niches all the time and we want to be able to continue to broaden out our product suite so that would probably be the only sort of thing that we would maybe look to as we grow forward is just different areas we ve talked about leasing part of our leasing group to be in aviation finance and we ve talked about the money services group and those are the things that we want to continue to evolve as the opportunities start to present themselves david long raymond james analyst got it and then just a final follow up with the ppp and the additional relationships that you talked about maybe you re seeing on the deposit side are you seeing that in your low numbers today are your former ppp customers are the ppp borrowing yet are you seeing any loan growth attributed to these new relationships yet tim crane president david it s tim we are i mean there s sort of two sides to that it s obviously been a little bit of a substitution and part of the reason you re seeing the utilization down but we ve also added new relationships and we track the larger ones and it was over 0 5 billion in commitments that are already on the books with more to come and the utilization there is better than our utilization overall so we still feel good about that we ve got more activity but we re probably half the three quarters away through the ppp prospect pipeline rich murphy vice chairman chief lending officer unfortunately it just takes longer to bring the lending side of the relationship over there s just a lot of work that needs to get done in terms of getting that loan structure getting it approved and getting it documented working through the pay off so but it s definitely common we see it on a weekly basis we see new opportunities that are coming as a result of our work with ppp tim crane president the market disruptions were very helpful still with mb there is still some hangover from that of this benefit to us with private same thing now we re starting to see more of that now as canada gets more involved down there and they re changing some of the things that they do we re seeing opportunities we never saw there and obviously first midwest move is you have to see what happens well sort of market disruption is good for us and it comes to a decision point we want to be there we want to have a seat at the table if we were going to change and we ve been very successful at that david long raymond james analyst got it thanks for the color guys appreciate it operator our next question coming from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open terry mcevoy stephens analyst hi good morning everyone tim crane president good morning terry mcevoy stephens analyst maybe david a question for you on your mortgage outlook what type of production margins are you thinking about over the near term that top left graph on page 10 shows a pretty steep decline down to 2 2 last quarter david dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer yeah it s impacted a little bit the way we presented by the decline in pipe inventory in the pipeline and we also had a little bit of there is some volatility in the secondary market in last quarter we had gains in this quarter we had some small losses but i think we re thinking about it more in the sort of 3 plus or minus range excluding any changes in the pipeline terry mcevoy stephens analyst thanks and then as a follow up question i m not sure ed maybe you re just not as creative as you typically are each quarter or maybe you re trying to tell us something but the last two press releases your final quote has been the exact same something along the lines of evaluate expenses on an ongoing basis to enhance profitability so or should we read into that same statement two quarters in a row and is there some sort of expense plan coming or is it more of a kind of a big picture view that you re consciously are always aware of expenses edward wehmer founder chief executive officer well latter we re always looking at expenses and working them through at the same time we still are a growth company and we re going to invest in the company we have a number of branches opening up in markets we haven t been in yet both parc being one that s coming on board we should that s a great market for us we ve never been there and do very well but it costs money to get them up and running we contrary to maybe what so many believe we watch our expenses very closely with the net overhead ratio in the mid 130s this quarter that s about where we think will normalize but i think it could be up or down depending on some of the other things that we do but i think that mortgages just kind of skews everything up for you guys and we wish we could find a better way to show you how it all works dave explained there are so many moving parts in the time we so screwed up we record the income in one quarter our expenses in the next quarter so those will look great but all in all with the 135 their overhead ratio and our goal is to be in the mid 130s right now in a normalized basis we re comfortable but doesn t mean we don t always look at expenses and try to run down so terry mcevoy stephens analyst great edward wehmer founder chief executive officer i ll change it next time for you appreciate that thanks thank you guys operator our next question coming from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs your line is open brock vandervliet ubs analyst thanks david just i wanted to follow up on your mortgage commentary was there anything to call out regarding a veteran s first that volume dropped by a third or so it seemed to drop harder than the rest of the business david dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer yeah i think their business is more heavily generally weighted toward refinance activity and that part of the market got hit harder in our footprint where we ve got customers just walking into the bank and have a relationship with the bank the purchase activity tends to be a heavier piece of it so i think it s just more the mix of purchase and refinance and the given marketplace brock vandervliet ubs analyst okay and just combining securities growth and what you may retain on from the mortgage bank yeah i think you ve given guidance around 10 of production you re going to shunt on balance sheet how should we look at that versus how you may grow the investment securities book in this environment or it sounds like you re pretty cautious in growing that securities book given the rate environment if you could just kind of unpack that a little bit david dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer yeah we ve been keeping the thought was to keep about 100 million of the first jumbo mortgage production on our books but then we also generally have maybe 100 or so of other products that we originate in the bank some non standard or variable rate products that we typically keep on the books out of the bank so probably which is normal but keep 100 million of the production that we would normally sell so a couple of hundred million in total that we would add to the balance sheet per quarter i would say it would be a good rough number and on the liquidity side you re right as we noted earlier we were essentially flat quarter end to quarter end because we just the more mortgage backed rate sort of backed off a little bit and we re just being cautious on investing that liquidity as ed and tim noted taking 175 or 180 sort of rates for a long term instrument just doesn t seem that appealing right now and so we re going to be patient with that hope to grow the loan portfolio deal up some of that liquidity and we look at that as an opportunity it may suppress our earnings in the quarter a little bit by not investing but the long term we look at that as an opportunity to grow the nii grow the margin but we re just trying to be patient and not invest at really low rates right now brock vandervliet ubs analyst got it ok thank you operator our next question coming from the line of nathan race with piper sandler your line is open nathan race piper sandler analyst hi guys good morning edward wehmer founder chief executive officer good morning nathan race piper sandler analyst couple of questions on capital the stocks come in a little bit along with the rest of the group turnaround 1q book these days just curious to get some updated thoughts on the upside around returning to buyback edward wehmer founder chief executive officer we ve got money left under our previous authorization so if the time is right we will utilize that and go from there so yeah we looked at it all the time vis a vis where do just where that return out capital where do we we want to invest some money and at certain levels it makes sense to buy the stock back like yesterday would have been a good day but we were in a blackout period we ll see but david dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer and then we also compared to acquisition opportunities out there too so just where you re going to invest your capita so we look at it constantly but i think we have about 33 million plus or minus availability under the prior authorization and market conditions are there we can look at what we do going forward but as i said we evaluate it all the time nathan race piper sandler analyst and along those lines in terms of acquisitions other dave just curious i think in the past that you ve spoken to an appetite to do a larger acquisition i m not sure in terms of the esi range that you guys would be willing to go up to but just curious kind of how that appetite stands today with the currency where it s at obviously your capital levels are stable sequentially in a comfortable level i would imagine so along those lines just curious can i get your updated thoughts on what you re seeing from a acquisition standpoint how large a deal potentially you d want to do historically you guys have been strong stewards of defending and growing tangible book value and i imagine that will continue to be the case going forward as you guys entertain potential acquisition opportunities so just curious to get some updated thoughts on all those dynamics edward wehmer founder chief executive officer yeah said with the market gives us for years that gave us was under 1 billion of reasonable prices you know how much i don t like dilution so we still have anywhere from under 1 billion to 2 billion or 3 billion are out there but well i could do anything stupid we don t like giving up two years worth of earnings to grow where we can grow organically market silvio good organic growth we ll stick with that i know it s a deal comes along to make strategic sense and what have you but i think that as to size the market is kind of limited now when you think of that as the geography so as i said earlier i did a couple of earnings calls ago threw out the concept that we would be willing to look out of our traditional market area i was chumming the water to see if i get everybody out it was a bad fishing day i guess but having but we will look at anything basically that enhances shareholder value franchise value earnings and and it doesn t do we don t give away the house to get it but we ll always be very disciplined in that regard and we ll see where it goes but right now they re across the board between 3 billion 4 billion down to 300 million the inbound calls have been very have picked up a lot however price expectations for the first one is we ve kind of reviewed our don t fit that criteria i talked about earlier so they if the local guys sell to somebody else that s good for us the disruption is good so they sell somebody out of state or so i think it s harder and harder for banks now 2 billion 3 billion to stay competitive just the amount you have to spend technology with the additional regulatory things that are coming down the pipe from loan administration people and loans is all getting good loans we all dig deeper all in there trying to get those deals which is harder for those guys to compete i think it s going to take some time for them to understand the magnitude of that where it s going to be their margins their costs and when it does open up their price expectations back in line nathan race piper sandler analyst got it and i suppose along those lines just given the organic growth trajectory in front of you guys that s likely going to accelerate with some of the recent disruption that was announced in chicago from an m a perspective i imagine acquisitions of net asset range that you described are probably less of a focus these days just given that organic growth runway that s in front of you guys today that s only gotten stronger within last couple of months here edward wehmer founder chief executive officer yeah but that doesn t mean that if we have a good deal came along we won t do it rich murphy vice chairman chief lending officer i mean we can do we can obviously do both but organic growth is really good as you said but it does close out doing the acquisition market prices and strategically work edward wehmer founder chief executive officer yeah i mean we can i m to say it will be 30 years old in december we have a good chance hitting 50 billion just through organic growth it s not bad from a card table to 50 in 30 years so people always ask how big do you want to be and i say well we i don t care where you d be 5 years from now i have no idea we ll take what the market gives us and what makes sense it makes sense we ll continue to grow and grow profitably and and keep our shareholder returns up and we operate asset growth profitability and growth in our tangible book value so if anything fits those lines and advances those or reaching those goals is earnings available nathan race piper sandler analyst got it not bad to say the least i appreciate the color thanks guys edward wehmer founder chief executive officer you re welcome thank you operator our next question coming from the line of julien brush with securities your line is open michael young truist securities analyst hey this is michael young i m on for true securities thanks just wanted to ask as the loan growth kind of broadens out maybe out of some of the premium finance categories would you expect those loan yields to be accretive to the overall loan yield with that mix shift or kind of what are you seeing in the pricing environment that would cause that to happen or not rich murphy vice chairman chief lending officer yeah i mean again as ed pointed out before and we have a very strict pricing model that we re just not going to go it s something not really accretive to where we want to be we re just not going to do it i mean so i think overall yes we monitor that very closely and confident that we can do that michael young truist securities analyst okay and maybe just a follow up on the expense commentary related to mortgage obviously you guys are seeing quite strong loan production so i would assume there is some natural inflation to the expense run rate but with the offset of that 8 million potential reduction depending on production levels is that kind of the right way to think about it those 2 pieces david dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer i m not sure if i follow you re just saying that in the past we think that expenses are inflated a little bit because of the extraordinarily high volume is that what you re trying to get to michael young truist securities analyst i guess is it more of a net 8 million reduction that you kind of expect in expenses quarter over quarter assuming the production levels you discussed or are there some core expense inflation factors from in a strong loan production that would offset that david dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer no what i was trying to get at is i think net net 8 million savings assuming that the level is in line revenue level is in line with the prior quarter now let s say production revenues go up to 5 million let s say 6 million and they go up 5 million i would expect the expenses to go up a little bit too so but you should be able to maintain that delta of roughly 8 million profit improvement on the business michael young truist securities analyst okay perfect thanks operator your next question coming from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open chris mcgratty kbw analyst asset quality you guys have historically been kind of quick to move any problems and it served you well over cycles given the amount of i guess there s for assets across the industry are there any portfolios that you guys are effectively looking to reduce exposure to given the bid for assets is high today thanks rich murphy vice chairman chief lending officer chris we ve done asset sales in the past and we re always calling through the portfolio and to try to find where weak spots exist and just to go to see the market out there so i would say we re open to that concept we ve done pretty well getting sort of a maximum value on the asset that we do work through so when you in the past when we ve looked at some of those prices we just weren t willing to accept a discount but if that gap starts to narrow even more going forward we might take a look at some of the portfolios where maybe we see some distress but generally speaking i mean we just kind of take a deal at a time and work it through so no plans as of this point chris mcgratty kbw analyst great thanks rich operator i m showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference call back over to mr edward wehmer for closing remarks edward wehmer founder chief executive officer thanks everybody for listening in our goal is to continue to increase all important things in the right way and not have a decreases so with that thanks very much and we ll see you we ll talk to you again in a month or three months and any further questions follow up questions please feel free to call anybody who s on the call thank

thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call our team delivered another solid quarter with growth in revenue and earning assets while maintaining an expense discipline that resulted in year over year quarterly expenses declining 5 additionally we continue to see an improving credit outlook that produced a release in allowance finally we continue to successfully deliver on our synovus forward initiatives and investments with the 75 million in pre tax run rate benefit achieved through the second quarter and an additional 100 million in pre tax run rate benefits to come by year end 2022 before i proceed let me take a second to remind you of our performance to date as it compared to our expectations at the beginning of the year we shared with you that we would deliver loan growth excluding ppp and ramp it up in the second half of the year we also said we would improve the deposit mix and lower our cost of funds to stabilize the margin also we would drive efficiency initiatives that will assist in returning to positive operating leverage while continuing to manage effectively through the uncertain credit environment and produce the planned benefits from synovus forward i m pleased to share with you today that we are delivering on those objectives and we concluded the first half of 2021 with considerable momentum and are optimistic about the prospects for growth and expansion moving forward our commercial loan pipelines are back to pre pandemic levels with continued growth in c i outstandings and commitments and line utilization actually increased slightly during the quarter client liquidity remains strong which has allowed us to further optimize our deposit mix and reduce our cost of funds again this quarter we expect this trend to continue in this low rate environment our wealth and treasury and payment solutions businesses are performing at a high level continued growth and operating margin expansion in these fee income generating business units will help to offset the industrywide reduction in mortgage activity criticized and classified loans declined for the quarter another proof point that the elevated credit concerns raised by the pandemic continue to abate and signal the opportunity to continue to move the allowance over time back down toward day one cecl levels and during the first half of the year we continued to invest in the future of synovus key priorities to enhance the customer experience and deliver new sources of growth a couple of examples of this include our treasury and payment solutions business launched a new suite of integrated receivable solutions called synovus accelerate ar this solution has been well received and the sales pipeline has already begun to fill which will create a new source of revenue while significantly benefiting our customers by saving them time and money we also have migrated approximately 25 000 business clients to synovus gateway our new digital platform for business and commercial banking with expanded functionality and capabilities we are making it easier for our customers to do business and promoting higher levels of business retention lastly our smart analytics tool which we ve shared previously has been further rolled out across our bankers and our markets and is beginning to have an impact on increasing pipelines and opportunities to expand the share of wallet from our customers we are also reminded during the second quarter that our focus on delivering a personalized and value added customer experience matters and will continue to provide a foundation for future growth industrywide consumer satisfaction surveys again show that our clients are more satisfied and loyal than those of our competitors and we also received two awards of excellence for our family office during the quarter these scores and accolades are not success in and of themselves but rather affirmation that our efforts and our approaches are having meaningful impacts for our customers for all of these reasons as well as the vibrant economic expansion that we expect to continue in the southeast we remain confident in our path forward moving to slide 3 which includes our financial highlights for the quarter total adjusted revenue of 489 million adjusted expenses of 268 million and a 25 million reversal of provision for credit losses resulted in adjusted net income of 179 million or 1 20 diluted earnings per share without adjustments net income was 178 million or 1 19 diluted earnings per share pretax run rate benefits from synovus forward of 75 million have increased by 25 million from the first quarter results our work on completed and future initiatives continues to give us confidence in our ability to achieve an aggregate pre tax run rate benefit of 100 million by year end 2021 and 175 million by the end of 22 total loans excluding p3 loans were up 194 million in the second quarter growth in the quarter was delivered in our core c i portfolio as well as third party consumer lending given the continued high liquidity environment despite solid production levels elevated prepayment activity remains a headwind in our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios core transaction deposits increased 702 million or 2 led by core noninterest bearing deposits growth of 601 million or 4 with the current loan to deposit ratio we continue to remix the deposit base strategically reducing higher cost categories including cds and broker deposits key credit metrics were stable with the npa ratio declining by 4 basis points to 46 basis points and the acl coverage remains strong a more favorable economic outlook and a 14 reduction in criticized and classified loans supported further allowance releases the acl ratio excluding p3 loans declined 15 basis points to 1 54 we remain well capitalized with the cet1 ratio increasing to 9 8 while completing nearly half of our 200 million share authorization in the quarter we also executed on additional earning asset growth activities to monetize excess liquidity while keeping capital above our operating target with that serving as an overview for the quarter i will now turn it over to jamie for a more detailed financial update and i ll rejoin you later for an update on synovus forward and our guidance jamie jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president thank you kevin as shown on slide 4 we ended the quarter with earning assets of 51 billion total loans declined 569 million led by p3 balance declines of 763 million while gross production levels continue to improve the liquidity environment continues to result in downward pressure on loan demand while our customers are utilizing less of their line commitments we are continuing to grow overall commitments to new client relationships and deeper existing relationships the annualized growth rate and total commitments over the past two years is more than 3 compared to an annualized increase in funded loan balances of approximately 1 a material portion of that growth will translate into funded balances once c i line utilization begins to normalize closer to the long term average of 46 to 47 based on market intelligence and conversations with our clients we believe increases in line utilization will occur later in the cycle as client liquidity subsides our base assumption included in our loan growth guidance is that line utilization will remain near current levels through year end while commitment growth will support longer term loan growth our confidence in the forecast for the near term is based on continued strong production growth in the commercial loan pipeline and our expectation that the elevated level of payoffs and paydowns will abate another factor that gives us confidence in loan growth is more recent monthly data in june total loans excluding changes in p3 balances grew by approximately 200 million in the second quarter further declines in consumer mortgage and heloc portfolios of 98 million and 74 million respectively continued to be impacted by accelerated prepayment activity and excess liquidity cre loan declines of 173 million this quarter largely resulted from accelerated payoffs as many owners are selling with the expectation that capital gains taxes will increase in 2022 c i balances excluding changes in p3 increased 220 million with 469 million in commitment growth while c i line utilization remained near historic lows as a reminder a normalization in c i line utilization would result in more than 700 million in funded balances we had approximately 150 million in fundings of round two p3 loans net of unearned fees which partially offset forgiveness of 927 million total p3 balances ended the quarter at 1 6 billion there s more detail related to p3 loan activity in the appendix lastly as a function of this liquidity environment we increased the securities portfolio about 616 million and third party consumer portfolio about 273 million the risk profile of asset acquisitions was largely consistent with those completed in the first quarter with emphasis in mortgage backed securities and secured third party consumer loans investment securities accounted for 17 of total assets at the end of the quarter and could increase further as we look for opportunistic deployments of liquidity in the second half of 2021 as shown on slide 5 we continue to grow core transaction deposits which increased 702 million or 2 from the prior quarter this was led by core noninterest bearing deposit growth of 601 million or 4 which offset strategic declines in higher cost deposits we continue to have success reducing our total deposit costs in the second quarter with a reduction of 6 basis points from 22 basis points to 16 basis points this was driven by a combination of deposit mix optimization with a continued focus on strategic reductions in high cost time deposits as well as a reduction in the expense associated with interest bearing deposits while the pace of cd maturities will slow significantly there are opportunities to further improve the deposit mix and reduce rates paid on other interest bearing deposits as we progress through the second half of 2021 for the month of june total deposit costs were 15 basis points and we expect further reductions in total deposit costs this year slide 6 shows net interest income of 382 million an increase of 8 million from the prior quarter nii increased as benefits from asset growth reduced deposit costs and day count more than offset the reduction in p3 fee income the net interest margin of 3 02 a decline of 2 basis points was primarily impacted by p3 forgiveness as p3 fee accretion decreased 5 million from the prior quarter other dynamics are similar to recent quarters as the headwind from asset repricing is being offset by further reductions in liability costs as expected slower prepayment activity in the latter part of the quarter helped to improve the yield on the securities portfolio supporting both margin and nii based on current mortgage trends we d expect modest further improvement in that yield in the third quarter as the impact of a full quarter of more normalized prepay activity is realized deceleration of prepayment activity resulted in a 3 million reduction of premium amortization in the second quarter down from 20 million in the first quarter in terms of asset sensitivity we remain positively exposed to potential increases in interest rates that dynamic continues to be supported by the aforementioned shifts in our balance sheet including funding mix with the estimated exposure being split between both short term and long term rates as of june 30th our loan portfolio is 54 variable and approximately 30 of those variable rate loans have floors at or above short term index rates of 25 basis points based on current market conditions and our expectations for loan growth we reiterate our expectation that quarterly net interest income excluding p3 fee accretion should increase in the second half of the year driven by loan growth deployment of liquidity a deceleration of prepayments and further deposit cost reductions using the quarter end forward curve and absent rate hikes we expect a nim of approximately 3 excluding the impact of p3 with headwinds from the lapse of p3 fee accretion being offset by the continued deployment of excess liquidity and with notable upside coming from increases in either short term or long term interest rates as we ve shared previously we estimate nim dilution of approximately 6 basis points per 1 billion of excess cash on deposit at the federal reserve slide 7 shows a total adjusted noninterest revenue of 106 million down 6 million from the previous quarter embedded in the continued strength in fee revenue is diversified growth across our fee revenue sources partially offsetting the continued normalization of the mortgage business from all time high levels of production core banking fees were 41 million up 3 million increases were broad based led by 1 million increases in account analysis fees that benefit from our treasury and payment solutions team and our recently in sourced merchant business nsf or overdraft fees which have received a lot of attention throughout the industry were flat at 6 million accounting for less than 6 of noninterest revenue and 1 3 of total revenues net mortgage revenue declined 8 million in the second quarter to 14 million due to reductions in secondary production and gain on sale this remains above pre pandemic levels and we expect continued normalization in the second half of 2021 increases in fiduciary revenues of 3 million helped offset decreases in other areas including capital markets income assets under management grew 3 in the quarter and 28 from the previous year the build out of wealth management and other fiduciary services particularly in south florida will continue to provide meaningful growth opportunities total noninterest expense of 271 million is highlighted on slide 8 adjusted noninterest expense was 268 million up 2 million from the prior quarter and down 6 million from the prior year adjusted items include the impact of an earn out liability nonqualified deferred compensation and restructuring fees primarily related to branch closures employment expense of 159 million was down 1 million from the prior quarter as seasonal decreases in payroll taxes was partially offset by an increase in pay days as well as commissions and other variable compensation expenses of 42 million associated with occupancy equipment and software increased 1 million from the previous quarter largely due to an increase in the repairs and maintenance as kevin will touch on later we continue to evaluate and optimize our branch and non branch real estate for additional efficiency opportunities other expenses of 67 million were up 3 million primarily due to the 4 million increase in third party processing fees associated with the expenses from additional p3 forgiveness and third party consumer loans our commitment to prudent expense management and profitable growth allows us to continue to invest in strategically compelling high return growth vectors we have reduced our head count 6 year over year approximately 85 of which was on the support side this reduction in headcount is a key priority in our expense management efforts however there are some offsetting costs as we promote team members who are taking on more responsibility and continue to hire customer facing team members our expectations for expenses and benefits from synovus forward remain unchanged slide 9 highlights stable credit metrics which remain near historical lows we continue to see improvement in the overall economic outlook which is reflected in the reversal of provision for credit losses of 25 million and a 14 reduction in criticized and classified loans support for the ratings improvements comes from client conversations and cash inflows as shown in the appendix cash inflows from march to may are each up more than 10 compared to the same period from 2019 which we use as a pre pandemic baseline the annualized net charge off ratio for the quarter was 0 28 we expect net charge offs to remain relatively stable in the second half of the 2021 assuming no material change in the economic outlook during the second quarter the npa ratio declined 4 basis points to 46 basis points criticized and classified loans fell 14 and we expect further reductions as we progress through the rest of the year the acl ratio of 1 54 excluding p3 loans was down 15 basis points from the prior quarter and 27 basis points from the end of the year we continue to use a multi scenario framework in our cecl modeling and a sign of 40 weighting to adverse scenarios 55 weighting to the base scenario and 5 weighting to an upside scenario as noted on slide 10 the cet1 ratio increased 1 basis point to 9 75 as a result of strong performance the building capital was deployed via risk weighted asset growth share repurchases and our common equity dividend in the second quarter we repurchased 92 million of the 200 million share repurchase authorization in place for 2021 which resulted in a 1 3 reduction of average diluted outstanding shares we have completed approximately 15 million of additional repurchase activity in july based on current conditions and economic outlook we expect to complete the full authorization in the second half of the year we will continue to opportunistically deploy capital on our balance sheet and to our shareholders as we remain above our 9 5 operating target for cet1 we remain well positioned to complete our key strategic objectives including profitable growth with the highest priority being multi solution relationships with that i ll turn it back to kevin kevin blair president and chief operating officer thanks jamie at the beginning of 2020 we laid out our synovus forward plan to deliver significant upside in earnings power through a set of strategic actions to enhance our efficiency and accelerate top line growth the synovus forward initiatives are aligned with our strategy of building a high growth low risk nimble bank that can continue to take market share in our attractive southeastern markets as i highlighted earlier throughout the second quarter we have continued to add to our synovus forward pre tax run rate benefits now totaling approximately 75 million as you can see on slide 11 we have delivered these results through a combination of expense and revenue initiatives based upon our progress to date as well as the ongoing plan and execution we remain confident in achieving the 2021 and 2022 milestones of 100 million and 175 million respectively success to date on the expense front has largely come from three primary areas a reduction in third party spend a decrease in head count as well as branch and corporate real estate consolidation approximately 50 million of the 75 million pre tax run rate benefit we have achieved by the end of the quarter relates to these specific efficiency initiatives we have plans to increase the savings in each of these categories but also are adding new initiatives and areas of focus to achieve an incremental 30 to 40 million in pre tax benefits by the end of 2022 additional third party savings workforce optimization a reduction in branch and non branch square footage process automation and additional tax strategies will all contribute to drive future efficiencies we have also had success to date on the revenue side of synovus forward with 25 million in pre tax run rate benefits the treasury and payment solutions pricing for value initiative has resulted in annualized pre tax run rate benefits of approximately 12 million in the second quarter the realization of a broad based increase in pricing has been supported by the competitive landscape enhancements to our products and services and a commitment to providing proactive needs based advice in addition with the deployment of a new pricing tool and the continued low rate environment we have also been able to reduce our cost of funds to levels lower than was originally expected and we now have a more robust capability and tool to better manage customer rate elasticity as we move into a higher rate environment in the future additional areas where we have seen incremental revenue include the in sourcing of our merchant business and expansion of our merchant sponsorship business and expanded solutions such as trade finance and international payment and currency capabilities as we turn to future plans and initiatives the 60 to 70 million in expected pre tax revenue benefits will largely be accomplished through analytics new products and solutions balance sheet management strategies as well as ongoing talent and specialty team expansion as it relates to analytics we continue to make progress on our aforementioned commercial analytics pilot which we refer to as the smart tool the feedback and utilization thus far are encouraging as our bankers are working to actionable leads and insights that are now translating into new sales and overall expansion of the share of wallet of our existing clients we will continue to pilot in the third quarter with a companywide rollout in the fourth in addition we have begun to develop our retail analytics program which will also have a meaningful impact in our ability to deepen the share of wallet of our consumer and wealth customers while reducing the overall levels of attrition we are expanding our premium finance and specialty lending businesses adding strong new teams and highly attractive specialized verticals as well as launching targeted innovative products and capabilities to serve as new sources of revenue growth as i have noted in the past synovus forward is a constant improvement mindset not just a collection of initiatives i am pleased with our team members focused on the art of possible as we continue to innovate and find new ways to become more efficient and drive new sources of revenue and i would be remiss if i didn t end this slide with an update on technology in general we clearly feel that our competitive advantage will come from our high touch approach complementing our high tech investments and partnerships we continue to make progress in enhancing both the consumer and the commercial client digital experience we are partnering with the right fintechs to build and deliver new products and solutions and we have a road map to move to a modern core over time in a segmented and controlled fashion we will continue to focus on ways to increase online origination capabilities and evaluate new technological opportunities especially in the payment and banking as a service areas moving to slide 12 this includes our 2021 outlook which have a few key changes with the first half of the year behind us and greater certainty in the economic outlook we d like to provide some updates and additional clarity i ll begin with loan growth we still expect to be within our 2 to 4 loan growth guidance excluding p3 loans and third party consumer loans however we think it s likely that we re at the low end of this range due primarily to the elevated prepayment activity that we have seen to date that was not anticipated at the beginning of the year this assumes line utilization remains at current low levels and prepayment activity returns to a more normalized level as a reminder we do not include third party consumer loans in this guidance this asset class represents 1 5 billion in period end balances up 776 million in 2021 pre pandemic this portfolio was approximately 2 billion in held for investment outstandings over the past five plus years we have had a successful track record with originating and managing these credits providing incremental revenue and solid returns we will continue to employ this strategy as long as the excess liquidity environment persists as well as the relative returns of future purchases are constructive we re raising our expectation for total adjusted revenue and total adjusted expense as a reminder it s appropriate to consider these together because areas that are providing additional revenue including mortgage production and higher third party consumer balances have associated expenses related to them and these examples commission and servicing expense and while we remain committed to taking advantage of growth opportunities in the southeast we also remain committed to achieving positive operating leverage and that is one of our top priorities for 2021 we are not incorporating any significant change in interest rates as part of the updated guidance although it s important to note the increased asset sensitivity jamie referenced earlier as any increase in rate will provide a meaningful tailwind to nii our capital management target now includes a cet1 ratio greater or equal to 9 5 target a continuation of strong operating performance and a stable economic outlook is likely to result in a cet1 ratio above 9 5 even after completing the entire 200 million share repurchase authorization for the current year additional focus and execution related to various tax strategies are expected to result in an effective tax rate of 22 to 24 year to date the etr is 22 or 23 before discrete items the actions we ve mentioned throughout today s call further position us for success in the second half of the year but also long term success it s important to note that the efforts and continued investment in synovus strengthens our currency and provides opportunities for strategic growth both organic and inorganic we re looking forward to the second half of 2021 and i feel an increased level of excitement from our entire team as we roll out our future of work operating environment this quarter our balance sheet is well positioned for growth with strong capital and liquidity our team members are delivering and they re very passionate about winning and our pipeline show that clients are poised to grow their business with synovus as their partner with that i ll turn the call over to our operator for the q a portion of today s call questions answers operator the first question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond please go ahead michael rose raymond james analyst hey good morning everyone how are you good just wanted to start on the loan growth outlook it looks like if i exclude ppp and then the third party loans which were up this quarter you guys were down a little bit in both the first and the second quarter and if i m doing the math right it looks like on a core basis ex those two lines that the guidance would imply some positive growth in the back half of the year so can you just kind of reconcile the comments around line utilization remaining low paydowns still remaining high and what would appear to be a positive inflection point in those kind of core loan balances kevin blair president and chief operating officer yes michael it s a great question i think before i talk about the rest of the year i think it s important to make sure that we re all clear on what happened this past quarter when you exclude ppp as you mentioned we actually grew 195 million for the quarter a large piece of that was on the c i side we grew 220 million this quarter and that was on the backs of very strong production we were actually up 10 versus the first quarter and 19 versus the second quarter of last year we also grew the third party portfolio roughly 273 million and as we ve shared in the past that s really a surrogate to the securities book and we felt with the excess liquidity and capital we had we would continue to make those purchases as long as the returns made sense i think on the cre side one thing that s lost in this quarter is that we also saw good increases in funded production there up 35 versus the first quarter but unfortunately we saw unprecedented levels of payoffs as we saw borrowers start to take some chips off the table leading up to what they perceive to be an increase in the capital gains tax so we saw a runoff there of about 173 million so inside of the quarterly growth there are some underlying stories we ve seen our pipelines return to pre pandemic levels up 22 versus the previous quarter and in line as i said with previous year pipelines as i mentioned production is increasing across our franchise primarily on the commercial side but production in total was up 12 from the first quarter when you look at our commercial lines of business we actually had in our sublines business we have 12 11 of the 12 actually grew during the quarter only our cre business declined because of those payoffs and paydowns we also saw tremendous momentum going into june where c i loan growth in june was 160 million and cre actually grew in june 10 million and to your point on line utilization it s not a herculean task but it s up 1 from 39 1 to 40 1 so we re starting to see a little bit of activity there and we saw broad based industry growth whether it was in the finance insurance area transportation warehousing healthcare across several of our industries so in general what gets us excited about the second half of the year is that we re starting to see some momentum build both through pipelines and production we re starting to hear from our customers that demand is picking up and we think there s been kind of a secular move across the industry to hold more liquidity on their balance sheet which means that they ll start to borrow again before the balances completely run off from having the excess cash so we re optimistic and we re planning for the second half of the year to deliver that growth to be able to achieve that 2 to 4 but as we said we think it will be toward the low half of that range michael rose raymond james analyst that s great color kevin i really appreciate it and maybe just as my follow up if we can hit on expenses you gave a lot of color on the synovus forward and the progress that is continuing there but i assume like everybody else you re continuing to invest in the franchise it looks like if i take kind of the midpoint of the guidance it would imply that expenses on an adjusted basis would remain relatively flat at these levels in the next couple of quarters is that the way we should think about it and then maybe if you could just kind of outline some of the reinvestment initiatives and what the priorities are jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president yes michael this is jamie you re right on the second half of the year and expenses are expected to be flat due to increases in a few different things we have third party servicing expense our portfolio there is larger than we had originally guided toward the beginning of this year we also have increased third party processing expense associated with p3 forgiveness and lastly we have variable compensation expectations we do continue to invest in the franchise specifically you see it in multiple areas first i would point to technology advancements to help us deliver our businesses better a good example of that as we recently launched the accelerate ar program which is an accounts receivable solution for our treasury customers that s only six weeks old and we re now on track to receive about 2 5 million in annualized revenue from that just six weeks in we re also looking at our verticals we re looking at our customer facing team members and growing frontline associates where appropriate and all of that spend is embedded in our full year guidance for 2021 michael rose raymond james analyst very helpful thanks for taking my questions jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president thank you michael operator the next question comes from jennifer demba of truist securities please go ahead jennifer demba truist securities analyst thank you can you hear me ok jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president yes good morning jennifer kevin blair president and chief operating officer yes jennifer demba truist securities analyst good morning kevin you mentioned you anticipate synovus will migrate to a modern core over time can you give us some details on that comment kevin blair president and chief operating officer yes jennifer it s a part of our infrastructure investments that we believe we have to make over time now what you won t see is that synovus will do a rip and replace and move off of our mainframe core today over into a cloud based core tomorrow what we ll do is we ll start by in a segmented fashion start to move over certain products and certain capabilities potentially create new capabilities that we could add on to the modern core of our digital platform and then over time as it makes sense we would then move the core businesses over there we think that s the prudent approach versus doing it all in a kind of that rip and replace methodology and it allows us to expand our capabilities and new functionality in that agile platform with that api connection where we really need it and that s the real value of moving to the modern core as we ve shared is it allows you to be much more agile in adding new solutions adding new applications and new services for our customers so that s how we would view the ability to move things over and we ll do that over several years where we have the opportunity to do that jennifer demba truist securities analyst you think the industry will follow that kind of pattern as well kevin kevin blair president and chief operating officer yes i think so jennifer just because no one wants to hear that there s a massive increase in expense in order to do that so the way that you do it in a more efficient fashion is to be able to go out and do it over time in components where you move parts of your business and ultimately allows you to have a pathway to get all of your business over to the modern platform jennifer demba truist securities analyst ok also you mentioned you re rolling out the future of work operating environment third quarter can you just give us a little more detail there kevin blair president and chief operating officer yes so it s for us we call it our here together program jennifer but i think it s important to note for synovus we ve already brought back roughly 60 of our team members in the office so we have about 40 of our team members that continue to work remotely today and so we ve really spent the summer evaluating job family by job family to determine which one of those positions we felt like needed to be in the office 100 of the time and which team members needed to have more of a flex work schedule and then that left a third set of team members that would be 100 remote and so as we re rolling this out our next level of return to work will be in the middle of august where we ll have those team members that now will come back to work full time that represents about 400 additional team members and then at the end of august we ll roll out our flexible work schedule which is about another 500 team members that will begin to come in the office three days a week and then two days off site and that leaves us with around 1 200 team members that will continue to work remotely 100 of the time we feel that it s important in today s environment for talent to assess which positions needed to work remote number one we want to make sure we re testing and monitoring the productivity which we can for those positions number two i think for the competition of team members it was important for the 1 200 that we identified we felt like this was a work environment perk that was necessary to be able to retain and attract the right level of talent but with all of that we look at this as the next normal it s not permanent we ll continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our workforce and make any adjustments that we need to make going forward jennifer demba truist securities analyst if i could just ask one more thing how much wage pressure are you seeing right now kevin blair president and chief operating officer jennifer we re starting to see some increases in attrition in some of our entry level positions and we ve seen some positions where individuals can work remotely for their job and that job could be in texas or california or new york and so we re starting to see a little bit of that so you ll see and we ve addressed that with our internal teams we made an adjustment a salary adjustment for all of our team members below kind of our median salary level and we also provide our leaders with additional pools of funds to make sure that we re continuing to match or combat what s becoming a fairly competitive landscape as it relates to salary and compensation but it s really started to hit us in the last couple of months and especially as it relates to those entry level positions jennifer demba truist securities analyst thank you operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america securities please go ahead ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning i guess just wanted to follow up on jennifer s question around the modern core conversion kevin talk to us i mean i understand you re doing it in a fragmented way one what s the time line of that is it 23 is it beyond that and in the meantime does it not allow you to do certain things that a full conversion would just give us a sense of how important that conversion will be both one in terms of the timing and the additional capability that synovus could have in order to compete with banks or nonbanks kevin blair president and chief operating officer so ebrahim it s a great question we haven t set a time frame and i think that s important as part of the story because to me what will determine the ultimate conversion will be the success of some of these fragmented pilots that will run so if we set up a digital bank or move some of our products over on to the new core we may test one vendor two vendors it really is a pilot for us to figure out what s the most scalable way to do that but we ll learn from those pilots and ultimately that will determine what the ultimate time frame is now to your question as to limitations by doing this in a fragmented approach we don t believe so i think today we feel like we can continue to add new products and solutions that are necessary it just takes a little more time we can work with our core provider and make sure that we schedule out the time frame that s required a great example of that is an example that jamie mentioned earlier on the accelerate ar we were able to from contract to open it up for folks to apply was 171 days and we did that with a mainframe core platform that needed to connect to that system so it doesn t prohibit us from doing things we re just excited about the speed that what a modern core would bring to the table where you can do things even more efficiently and more less costly in the future but it s not something that will inhibit our abilities in the short term ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst and just tied to that would m a make it easier to accelerate that in terms of undertaking that investment or is it easier for you to do that and then think about m a of any large scale kevin blair president and chief operating officer i think you can look at that either way ebrahim obviously m a if you can cut costs someplace else it allows you to reinvest that we ve seen that with the messaging coming out of a lot of the recent mergers but we believe that we can do it within our existing budget today i mean when i look at our technology spend this year as we shared on the call we re down in expenses on a year to date basis 3 yet we ve increased our technology spend by 8 and the large majority of that increase comes in our special projects where we re able to add additional spend to drive revenue growth and new client acquisitions so i don t think that not having a merger take place is a limiting factor either quite frankly we ll continue to utilize synovus forward to find efficiencies in other areas so that we can redeploy that into the areas that we want to invest like talent and technology ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you operator the next question comes from brady gailey with kbw please go ahead brady gailey kbw analyst yeah thanks good morning guys i wanted to start with the buyback it s great to see you all reengage there if you include what you ve repurchased in july i think you re about halfway there to your 200 million mark but the stock is cheaper now i think you all repurchased around 165 of tangible last quarter it s now at 140 of tangible and to me it seems like you could go a little beyond the 200 million so maybe just talk about the pullback in the stock here and if it s possible that we could see buybacks actually exceed that 200 million kind of threshold that you all talked about jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president yes thanks brady as we progress through 2021 we ve been proactive in managing our balance sheet you ve seen that both in growth in our lending partnership portfolio as well as through share repurchases as you mentioned in the second quarter as we look forward into the second half of the year i expect those same themes will apply along with our expectation for the gradual pickup in core loan growth our core customer loan growth and that s where our priority is ensuring that our balance sheet is position so that we can serve our customers best and we expect that to materialize in the second half of the year 9 5 for us is not a point in time objective that we manage to it s really just a target that we use for medium term objectives and we re comfortable operating above or below the target in the short run as you ve seen in the second quarter we were actively purchasing shares we ve been actively purchasing shares quarter to date we believe they are attractively valued and we will continue that plan as long as it s prudent but as we look forward we do believe that core earnings will provide enough capital to cover our core customer loan growth and we should remain above target assuming no material changes in the operating outlook to facilitate the full 200 million in share repurchase as you mentioned brady gailey kbw analyst ok and then my second question so jamie i mean you talked about getting the bond book up to 16 to 17 of average earning assets you re there now you re talking about maybe going a little higher what s the max that you think we could see as far as how much of the bond book could continue to grow here jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president yes it s a great question and typically when we think about the securities portfolio you re thinking about as traditional balance sheet management and this is a unique environment right now we re managing at a time where our customer liquidity is at levels unforeseen and unexpected and we re managing in that dynamic we do believe that this liquidity environment will remain for the foreseeable future and we re managing our balance sheet accordingly where we are growing the securities portfolio in a prudent manner at 17 of assets we re growing our third party lending but it s hard for me to give you an absolute level because it really depends on what the opportunities are we re being very specific in what we re targeting and if you look at the third party loan purchases in the first half of the year they re great examples they are strong credit assets in asset classes that we are very familiar with with shorter durations and that aligns with our liquidity view and as we look forward into the second half of the year if we see opportunities that fit that profile then we will continue to pursue them but it s hard for me to give you targets brady gailey kbw analyst yes and jamie what was the yield on the third party consumer purchases this quarter jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president the third party purchases this quarter the largest portfolio purchase there were multiple purchases in the second quarter but the largest purchase was a little more than 300 million in auto loans with a gross yield a little more than 5 brady gailey kbw analyst all right thanks guys jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president thank you brady operator the next question comes from steven alexopoulos with j p morgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst hey good morning everybody kevin for you i know there are quite a few initiatives already underway but with this being our first call with you as the ceo could you give us a bit of a deeper look into what you see as your long term vision for the company kevin blair president and chief operating officer yes it s a great question steven and look i ll start by saying my goal for our company is to win and i know our team members feel the same way and similar to my comments earlier in the call i feel like it s our job to build significant upside in our earnings power through a set of strategic actions that will allow us to improve efficiency and accelerate our top line growth and i know with you we ve had discussions in the past of what that growth looks like i think that s directly aligned with what our opportunity is and that we feel like we can build a high growth low risk bank that can continue to take market share and in a very attractive southeastern market and so we re building the and so i used the word transformation because our bank is extremely well positioned i feel like we sit in a great footprint we have a 133 year history of performing but as i look into the future i think there are four areas we have to focus on to be able to be a bank that truly stands out number one is an ease of doing business it s not rocket science what we do every day it s important for us to recognize that our customers want a bank that is easy to do business with our team members want to come here every day and have a work a place that it s easy for them to get their job done and so we re investing time and energy and improving how we do business with our customers through process automation through our client journeys where we re going to shorten cycle times and improve the overall customer experience that s important because it leads to great referrals to our prospects which generate growth the second area of focus is around being able to seamlessly deliver all of our products and solutions across all of our segments as a relationship bank we believe that we ve earned the right to have a deeper share of wallet with our customers and that means that we can t deliver in silos we have to deliver as a team and we feel that we do that today but we can do a better job of delivering across our products and solutions and ultimately increase the type of solutions that we bring to our customers that will also serve as a source of revenue the third area as we talked about in the past is we ll take our high touch approach i think which shows loud and clear with some of our loyalty scores and will apply a high tech approach to match that and complement it so we ll bring new technology and new solutions to the table along with analytics that will allow us to deepen the share of wallet again and expand our customer base and then lastly we ll focus on our team members this is a great place to work and we know that but there s opportunities to continue to improve that through professional development and compensation and other perks for our team members but also continuing to attract the top talent in the industry so we believe that ultimately when you bring on those four areas of transformation along with the strong foundation we have we think it puts us in a position to stand out in the industry and deliver growth that exceeds that of our peers and that of our marketplace steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst i appreciate that color kevin that s terrific can you realize that vision based on the current technology offering or do you need that modern core to get you where you ultimately want to be kevin blair president and chief operating officer yes steven i think over time i think to be able to compete in the very competitive landscape we need to make sure that our technology is at par with our competitors and so do i think a modern core is important yes we ve done two proof of concepts since 2019 so i think we re well on the way of testing that out the goal with the modern core as i said earlier is just to make us more agile and bring more services to our customers i think the great equalizer in our industry today is fintechs we believe that partnering with fintechs allows us through the software as a service model to bring new solutions to our customers and we can do that without having to have an r d shop inside of our bank and we can do it in a way that s extremely scalable and customizable so for us it s about things like the modern core but then it s also about having partners that can continue to add new services and better solutions for our customers like our synovus gateway product or the accelerate ar solution that jamie mentioned earlier so i think it s modern core but it s also about having the right fintech partners to complement that steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst ok thanks for all that color kevin blair president and chief operating officer yeah thanks steve operator the next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning everybody right now the third party consumer loans are around 5 of the total i guess looking at that dynamic of deploying the cash and with the 10 year down further could we expect to see that as a percentage of the loan book maybe accelerate over the next few quarters versus putting incremental dollars into the security book down here and if so how big would you be comfortable with that portfolio getting jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president yes jared as we think about that portfolio i bifurcate it into hfi and hff what you re referring to is the total combined portfolio but the risk profile of the held for sale portfolio is very different than the held for investment portfolio so i want to focus in on the hfi portfolio as we sit here today we believe that we have the ability as far as our knowledge our experience to grow this portfolio further and get back to that 2 billion pre pandemic level on held for investment loans on balance sheet what you should expect to see from us first is discipline we re not going to go out there and chase these assets just to grow the portfolio but we have found strong risk adjusted returns in these portfolio purchases and we believe that we re taking the appropriate amount of risk which is actually fairly low on this portfolio and delivering incremental spread vis a vis the securities portfolio where you get that spread in duration and so we would much rather take it in prime credits like the prime auto securities i mean prime auto loans with a two year duration versus extending out on the duration curve in the securities book and so we feel comfortable with 2 billion we re not there today we re not going to chase that number but that is something we have our eye to and in this liquidity environment there s plenty of liquidity to support that jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst ok and then circling back on to the capital management side here and it sounds like maybe a little bit of a reluctance to extend that buyback what s the thoughts on m a and what are you seeing i guess sort of out there in the market are there opportunities to potentially reengage or engage in an acquisition strategy to help accelerate some of those growth goals kevin blair president and chief operating officer jared this is kevin i ll take that so as we ve said on previous calls we remain focused on investing in synovus and i think the next 100 million in synovus forward will be our top of mind activity at this point and we need to be able to deliver those incremental benefits as i ve shared in the past i think bank m a often looks great on paper when you look at the pro forma financial metrics but i think there are challenges that are present with system and cultural integration as well as just creating growth off the acquired company s base and i think all of those challenges are underestimated so we believe that we can focus on improvements here at synovus and with those improvements our currency will improve and then that will allow us over time to consider alternatives and options in that bank m a space but for now i think the only m a that we ve evaluated or would evaluate would be smaller companies that provide solutions or capabilities that would be additive to our existing customer base and those sort of businesses would have to provide elevated returns and a growth profile that align with our overarching strategies as it relates to what we re seeing as you know there s still a very active m a environment i know with the executive order that came out recently i think there s been some questions as to how that will impact that activity i believe that it s not intended to truly impact the mid cap space in terms of mergers and acquisitions if anything i think it will just hinder bank s ability to close branches and may increase the amount of investment that s required for community development but i don t think it s going to slow it down obviously in this low rate environment where many banks are challenged and they look at their two and three year forecast it s resulting in them reaching out to a partner and that s why transactions are happening we are very confident in our forward strategy in our ability to grow the bank and therefore we don t feel like we have to go in that route go that route today jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst great thank you operator the next question comes from brad milsaps with piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps piper sandler analyst hey good morning jamie i m just curious anything more to do on the right side of the balance sheet in terms of i know you mentioned continuing to optimize the deposit base but just curious if there s anything on the horizon that might accelerate there on the brokerage side of things with those time deposits maturing or any of the other brokered accounts that you might be able to change on the right side of the balance sheet jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president yes first off we re very pleased with the progress we ve made to date in closing the gap versus peer median 6 basis points a quarter for each of the last two quarters it is strong on total deposit cost improvement we do expect to be able to continue to reduce total deposit costs albeit not quite at the pace you ve seen in the last couple of quarters obviously as you get closer to zero it gets more difficult but we do think there are opportunities and to your point there are opportunities in broker deposits we do have some of those maturing in the second half of this year even though a larger wave is in 2022 early 2022 we have about 1 billion 1 1 billion of cds maturing this quarter the third quarter at an average rate of around 70 basis points and so that s an opportunity for us to reduce deposit costs as we mentioned in the prepared remarks total deposit costs were at 15 basis points for the month of june relative to the 16 basis points for the quarter so we think that we can continue to reduce them we have opportunities on money market and non maturity deposits and so we do see opportunities to continue our work in closing the gap to peer median and that s just one of our key strategic priorities as we head into the second half of this year brad milsaps piper sandler analyst great that s helpful and then as my follow up just i was going to see if you could just add a little more color to some of the fee income line this quarter obviously the mortgage is pretty self explanatory but maybe down a little bit more than i thought and then i know capital markets is an area that you guys have invested a lot in and been bullish on that business maybe a little weaker than i thought but there may be some seasonality some other things that you could add some color there as well jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president yes what i would say is if you look at fee revenue it s a great success story of broad based growth which is offset by secular trends in mortgage as well as nsf and so when we look at the growth in wealth which is it s not just due to equity market increases this is due to customer growth deepening relationships we re seeing growth in account analysis and we ve spoken in the past about the work being done in treasury on pricing for value this is extremely valuable to our company both as far as just the pure revenue but as far as also acknowledging the value add of our expertise in that area we re seeing growth in card and other core banking fees so what we are pleased with is we can t pipe the longer term industry trends in mortgage or in nsf to liquidity out there but we are delivering in all of our businesses beyond those with those more secular headwinds so we re pleased with the growth we re expecting that to continue in those areas we do expect continued normalization in mortgage and so we would expect mortgage revenue to decline in the second half of the year versus the first but we are pleased in the broad based growth kevin blair president and chief operating officer and brad the only thing i d add on the mortgage front i think when you look at the quarter over quarter results there s although production was down slightly there was a fairly sizable shift in the mix over to the portfolio side so in first quarter about 70 of our production was in secondary this past quarter it was only about 53 so as you see our production moving to more purchase money which it will over time i think you ll see more move over into the portfolio which as just to provide a background is our private wealth and our physician mortgage product and less we ll go into secondary the other thing this quarter that impacted mortgage revenue is the cash gain on sale in the secondary market was down in total from around 3 down to 2 40 which is where we had guided but it s a very competitive marketplace obviously with the pricing of mortgages and that s an area that we expect to continue to see some pressure on that cash gain on sale brad milsaps piper sandler analyst great thank you guys operator the next question comes from brody preston with stephens inc please go ahead brody preston stephens inc analyst good morning everyone jamie i just wanted to circle back on the third party loan purchases so i think the guidance that you all provided around the noninterest expense indicated that it doesn t include any significant changes from noncore balance sheet activity and so i m assuming that those third party loan purchases kind of fit into that bucket and so i guess just help me understand these loans are yielding about 5 and the step up that you ve seen in the third party expense the run rate on that kind of indicates that you re bringing these loans on at about a 50 efficiency ratio or so and so just given how yields have trended over the last two months i m assuming that it s going to get more competitive for these type of loans which might actually push the incremental efficiency ratio back to neutral as to where you guys are running right now so i guess help me understand your thought process around the trade offs between deploying liquidity into these loans but also potentially kind of modeling the expense run rate from here relative to the guidance jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president yes brody let me just add a few points on that our expense guidance for 2021 the down 1 to down 2 includes the associated expenses with the portfolio as it is today and so our point there is increases from here because we have not forecasted those increases that would that s what we re referring to when you look at the second quarter growth in third party processing expenses it s actually a combination of two things we did have an increase in the paycheck protection program forgiveness fees as well as the process or servicing expense associated with third party loans and so when you look at these portfolios the servicing expense varies but generally it s less than 1 on these loan portfolios you are exactly right that it s a very competitive market and i very much agree with you that it will only get more competitive as more people look to deploy liquidity and so we re very mindful of spread compression we expect to see spread compression and we ll just remain diligent to make sure that these purchases actually add shareholder value obviously with this liquidity environment we re leveraging the benefits of it on the right side of the balance sheet just in line with the prior conversation to reduce deposit costs to optimize the mix there and so we re not compelled to grow assets but we do believe that if we can continue to find assets like we found in the past that we will pursue that because we believe it s the right thing for the shareholder we believe that s a prudent way to deploy the liquidity brody preston stephens inc analyst got it so perhaps once ppp is out of the equation that 1 kind of servicing of that third party portfolio become a little bit clearer i guess that s how i should think about it jamie gregory chief financial officer executive vice president yes that s right exactly brody preston stephens inc analyst ok and then i guess my follow up would just be on the core banking fees so this is i guess is a little bit of a loaded question because there s questions within the question but i just wanted to ask if you could talk just a little bit more about it what goes into the account analysis the nice step up you saw there and what are the specific use cases that s driving that growth maybe from the new products that you ve rolled out and then on nsf you mentioned that it s become a little bit of a focal point for the industry other banks are getting rid of it the cfpb seems to be willing to take a harder look here just given how low it is as a percent of your revenues have you given any thought to maybe just getting rid of it especially given the nice traction you ve seen in other areas kevin blair president and chief operating officer yes so brody this is kevin i ll take the on the core banking fees when you look at it on quarter over quarter basis were up 9 up 41 year over year and you noted one of the categories the account analysis is largely a function of those treasury services that we re offering our customers some of that a large percentage of the increase comes from the repricing that jamie mentioned that was pricing for value and the good news there is that it was well received by our customers any time you increase fees you have to question whether it s going to lead to increase turnover or call as a problem we saw a fairly favorable response in that we had very few customers try to negotiate that increase in fee and that tells us that what we re doing from a value added advice perspective is meaningful and so they re willing to pay for those services the other part of that is just the increase in the amount of activity in the number of new solutions and the whether it s a new solution or existing product that we re providing to our customers that s also the sales are up 40 year over year so our customers are continuing to request and we re offering additional solutions to be able to deepen that relationship and so that is a success story and outside of the pricing increase we expect that line to continue to grow just based on our smart analytics tool which about 80 of those insights or leads are treasury opportunities and so our bankers are starting to work those the other area in core banking fees that was up this quarter was card fees and that s just an increased spend we were up about 11 versus first quarter and 45 versus last year but inside of that as we ve also made some investments in our commercial card and purchasing card and that s starting to show up in that we re able to get more cards in our commercial customers hands and so that s a success story as it relates to overdraft you mentioned it we re only about 6 of our fee income that is derived from nsf od and that s down about 36 from where we were in 2019 and so we ve embarked on our own overdraft assistance optimization strategy where we re evaluating the solutions we provide our customers today we feel that we provide a variety of banking options and for example we today offer a free checking account and a prepaid card that allows our customers to access their funds without allowing any overdrafts but we are considering some options that will add some new functionality and more specifically as it relates to the bank on standard that i think many of our competitors are talking about and that will involve some product changes and some new digital tools and most importantly some education but we ll do that and we feel like there s an opportunity to do that in the fourth quarter of this year or early first quarter of next year but to your point the fact that it represents about 24 to 25 million of income where we re looking to offset any losses that we have there it s in some of the businesses that jamie mentioned earlier where you see our fiduciary business which is growing our brokerage and our securities area as well as our treasury and payment solutions so over time we think the growth in those other larger categories will be able to offset any reductions we have from a new product suite brody preston stephens inc analyst got it thank you very much for taking my questions i appreciate it kevin blair president and chief operating officer thank you operator and the last question will come from steven duong with rbc capital please go ahead steven duong rbc capital markets analyst hi good morning everyone just a question on the c i growth in the quarter can you give us some color on what industries or areas where you re seeing that growth and do you expect the acceleration to continue for the end of the year kevin blair president and chief operating officer so steven as i mentioned earlier the areas that we ve seen some growth from an industry standpoint is the financial services and insurance area we ve seen growth in healthcare transportation and logistics retail trade and some construction growth we do expect that to continue for the rest of the year based on our pipeline and based on the discussions we re having with our customers ultimately most of the growth that we re getting is coming out of our metro markets and i think that s where you re seeing the lion s share of activity but we re well positioned i looked at this last quarter if you look at just our tier 1 markets our largest markets it represented about 50 of our production our tier 2 markets which are still large msas were about 40 and we only had about 10 of our production from our rural smaller market so from those industries i ve mentioned as well as our markets like south florida and atlanta and some medium tier markets like charleston and columbia south carolina greenville we think there s a tremendous opportunity and we think we ll grow c i strongly in the second half of the year steven duong rbc capital markets analyst great i appreciate the color on that kevin and then just a follow up just the commercial loan yields they came in at 3 86 i guess if you were to strip out the impact of ppp where would that be and if you were to look out one year and the rate environment remains where it is do you expect that to trickle a little lower kevin blair president and chief operating officer so yes look the way i look at that steven as i look at our loans on the books excluding all fees the coupon rate in our portfolio today is about 3 63 and if you look at our production that we brought on in the second quarter it came on around 3 30 to 3 50 so you re putting it on let s say midpoint of that 3 40 so there will be continued pressure based on repricing on the new loan origination side as well as renewals that will continue to put pressure on the overall portfolio now the good news is in second quarter those coupons were flat with first quarter so we feel like the price competition that we ve been seeing from both large and small banks is starting to normalize and we actually are widening our spread when you look at the credit spread and our cost of funds when we look at that new coupon so it is going to provide pressure and that s where as jamie mentioned earlier we ll continue to leverage the liability side to continue to cut our costs there to help to mitigate any impact and keep our margins stabilize steven duong rbc capital markets analyst great appreciate the color on that guys operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr kevin blair for any closing remarks thank you kevin blair president and chief operating officer thank you operator and i want to thank everybody for your participation today

stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 john m holmes president and chief executive officer great thank you and good afternoon everyone i appreciate you joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2021 results before i comment on the results i would like to take a moment to reflect on the last fiscal year the reduction of commercial passenger air travel to nearly zero shortly before our fiscal year began and the persistently depressed levels of commercial traffic throughout the year tested our industry and our company to agree that was previously hard to imagine at aar we have a strong set of values one of them is to every day find a way that has never been more important than it has been over the last 16 months and i m proud of the results we have delivered i want to thank our employees for their commitment and endurance and our customers who they re continuing to support and i m pleased to be able to say that we are now emerging from this crisis an even stronger more focused company turning to our results sales for the year decreased 20 from 2 07 billion to 1 65 billion and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 39 from 2 15 per share to 1 31 per share these results reflect the impact of covid 19 on the demand for commercial air travel but also our team s ability to reduce costs and increase efficiency to mitigate that impact as you may recall our q4 of last year was only partially impacted by covid as our hangars completed work on aircraft that were already in the hangar when the pandemic began as such i m particularly pleased to report that sales for the fourth quarter were up 5 from 417 million to 438 million and i m even more pleased to report that adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 81 from 0 26 per share to 0 47 per share our sales to commercial customers increased 3 and our sales to government and defense customers increased 7 sequentially our total sales growth was 7 and our adjusted diluted eps growth was 27 the eps growth was driven by our operating margin which was 5 2 for the quarter on an adjusted basis up from 3 2 last year and 5 in the third quarter we saw strong performance in our mro operations as airlines performed maintenance in advance of the anticipated return to summer leisure travel as well as the strong performance in our government programs contracts notably we have not seen much of a recovery in our commercial parts supply businesses as operators continue to consume their existing inventory parts supply is one of our higher margin activities and the performance in the quarter did not yet reflect the recovery of that business turning to cash it was another strong quarter as we generated 23 5 million from operating activities from continuing operations we also continue to reduce the usage of our accounts receivable financing program excluding the impact of that ar program our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was 33 3 million the results for the year reflect our accomplishments in three key areas first we moved quickly at the outset of the pandemic to reduce costs and optimize our portfolio for efficiency we did this by consolidating multiple facilities making permanent reductions to our fixed and variable costs exiting or restructuring several underperforming commercial programs contracts and completing the divestiture of our composites business which had been unprofitable in recent quarters second we continued to win important new business in particular we created a partnership with fortress to supply used serviceable material on the cfm56 5b and 7b engine types we were awarded a follow on contract from the navy that extended and expanded our support of its c 40 fleet we expanded our distribution relationship with ge subsidiary unison we entered into a 10 year agreement with honeywell to be an exclusive repair provider for certain 737 max components and most recently we signed a multi year agreement with united to provide 737 heavy maintenance in our rockford facility finally we focused on our balance sheet and working capital management which allowed us to generate over 100 million of cash from operating activities from continuing operations notwithstanding the investments that we made to support new business growth we demonstrated that we can generate cash even in a downmarket and as a result we are now well under one times levered and exceptionally well positioned to fund our growth going forward there are very few companies in commercial aviation that are emerging from the pandemic with a debt level that is actually lower than when they entered with that i ll turn it over to our cfo sean gillen to discuss the results in more detail sean gillen vice president and chief financial officer thanks john our sales in the quarter of 437 6 million were up 5 or 21 1 million year over year sales in our aviation services segment were up 6 5 driven by continued strong performance in government as well as the recovery in commercial sales in our expeditionary services segment were down slightly reflecting the divestiture of our composites business gross profit margin in the quarter was 16 4 versus 8 7 in the prior year quarter and adjusted gross profit margin was 16 5 versus 13 6 in the prior year quarter aviation services gross profit increased 32 9 million and expeditionary services gross profit increased 2 5 million gross profit margin in our commercial activities was 13 4 this reflects the relative strength in mro where we ve been able to drive margin improvement through the efficiency actions we have taken as the commercial market continues to recover we would expect higher overall commercial gross margins gross profit margin in our government activities was 19 7 which was driven by continued strong performance as well as certain events that occurred during the quarter the adjustments in the quarter include 2 1 million related to the closure of our goldsboro facility which had supported our mobility business within expeditionary services we have completed our consolidation of those operations into mobility s cadillac michigan facility and the adjustment reflects our current estimate of sale proceeds from the building looking forward subsequent to the end of q4 one of our commercial programs contracts was terminated as a result we expect to recognize impairment charge of between 5 million and 10 million in the first quarter of fiscal 22 this contract had been underperforming for us in recent quarters and with this termination our restructuring actions in commercial programs are largely complete as john described we have taken steps over the last year to rationalize certain underperforming operations including the divestiture of our composites business the closure of our duluth heavy maintenance facility and the exit or restructuring of certain contracts these activities along with the terminated contracts i just described collectively contributed approximately 140 million of annualized pre covid sales which will not return as commercial markets recover however the absence of these operations is now part of what s driving our increasing profitability sg a expenses in the quarter were 48 8 million on an adjusted basis sg a was 46 7 million up only 0 2 million from the prior year quarter despite the increase in sales as a reminder sg a in the prior year quarter already reflected our cost reduction actions for fiscal year 22 we would expect a modest increase in sg a compared to fy 21 as we invest in certain initiatives such as digital that will drive improved performance in future years we continue to focus on driving sg a as a percent of sales to 10 or lower as our top line recovers as john indicated we generated cash flow from our operating activities from continuing operations of 23 5 million as we continued to reduce our inventory balance in addition we reduced our accounts receivable financing program by 9 8 million in the quarter from 48 4 million to 38 6 million as a result our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with net debt of 83 4 million versus 197 3 million at the end of last year and our net leverage as of year end was only 0 7 times thank you for your attention and i will now turn the call back over to john john m holmes president and chief executive officer great thank you sean looking forward we are optimistic that the significant recent increase in us domestic leisure flying is both enduring and a leading indicator of return to business in international travel we ve seen a nice recovery in heavy maintenance and expect that performance to continue on that note while we are aware of the tight labor market we believe that the labor related programs that we have established to recruit train and retain skilled technicians will continue to serve us well particularly when those programs are coupled with our ongoing investment in innovation to drive efficiency and differentiation inside of our hangars also although the commercial parts supply business has lagged behind the recovery we have recently seen some early and modest signs of a rebound in that market as well both in our usm and new parts activities on the government side which has been very strong for us we do expect a moderation in the pace of growth as buying under previous administration normalizes and some of our programs come to a natural completion such as the c 40 aircraft procurement program for the marine corps but the valuable past performance that we have continued to build and the cost reduction actions that we ve taken put us in a strong position to continue to take market share and our government pipeline remains strong the path and pace of the commercial air travel recovery continue to remain uncertain which is underscored by the emergence of the delta variants as such we are not issuing full year guidance however in the immediate term we expect to see performance in q1 that is similar to or modestly better than q4 as you know q1 is typically our slowest quarter whereas q4 is typically our strongest quarter so normally you would see a decline from q4 to q1 however this year s expectation of similar performance reflects our belief that our commercial markets will continue their recovery over the medium and longer term we are exceptionally well positioned we are stronger today than where we were when we entered the pandemic and we are excited to leverage our efficiency gains optimize portfolio and strong balance sheet to continue to drive growth and margin expansion going forward with that i ll turn it over to the operator for questions questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of robert spingarn your line is open robert spingarn credit suisse analyst hi good afternoon john and sean john m holmes president and chief executive officer hey rob robert spingarn credit suisse analyst hey there i wanted to see if we could expand a little on a couple of things you just talked about first just looking back at q4 and perhaps talking separately about mro and parts how that trended throughout the quarter and then into the first quarter john m holmes president and chief executive officer sure mro was relatively stable throughout the quarter and that continues to be the case as we go into the first quarter which and i think we commented on this in the last earnings call that s a bit unusual i usually see a decline of activity in mro as aircraft return to the sky for summer flying in this case we are seeing a more steady performance there the parts businesses did continue to improve slightly throughout q4 and we have seen a bit of improvement most notably on the parts trading side just at the beginning of the current quarter robert spingarn credit suisse analyst and john is there anything obscure in the numbers where we re maybe seeing strength from cargo maybe obscuring some deeper weakness in passenger john m holmes president and chief executive officer no the cargo business has been again relatively stable throughout the entire pandemic i mean we saw a bit of growth early on as we turned our attention to that market but i d say for the last several quarters now it s been relatively stable i think what you re seeing is obviously air travel is pacing ahead here in the us and so you re seeing some of our larger customers burn through inventory that they had on the shelf as opposed to buying from suppliers we expect that to come to an end and expect to see more activity in the used parts and new parts business in the coming quarters as they burn through that inventory but in the rest of the world and our parts business is our most international activity you ve got markets with one exception china i ll come back to that in a second you ve got markets that are just behind in terms of overall flying activity and that s certainly impacting the pace of the recovery in the parts business as well but china on the other hand as you know their domestic flying has been has recovered largely and has been that way for several months and we actually had a record year in the china market robert spingarn credit suisse analyst you sort of segued pretty well into what i wanted to ask you next which is to look beyond the near term and think about the recovery with regard to the different pieces of aviation services so largely overhaul and then parts when you think about the recovery to pre covid levels what are the how do you frame it when you look at mro and then separately at parts what needs to happen for you to get to an aviation services number in the mid 500s 500 million you know what i m saying john m holmes president and chief executive officer yeah sure exactly so in the mro business we re being much more disciplined about the work that we take on post pandemic than what we had before we re really matching the volume of work that we choose to accept if you will with the availability of skilled labor and pre pandemic we had a very heavy reliance on contract labor to produce more labor hours but that was in a much less profitable level than what we re able to achieve today so you based on the current footprint and labor capacity it s possible that we ll be a bit smaller in the heavy maintenance business but a much more profitable business than we were pre pandemic having said that we continue to look at our footprint in north america and look at ways to potentially better align that footprint with labor availability than based on where we see the most supply of labor than what we have today so that s something we re continuing to monitor on the parts side of the business in the usm market we see the potential for that to actually even exceed pre covid levels based on early indications that we ve talked about this in prior quarters based on indications from the customer base that there would likely be an increased acceptance of used material in the aftermarket obviously we need to make sure we have material to supply but we see the potential for even greater growth out of that business over the next couple of years and then on the new parts business we remain very very bullish on that business we ve announced a number of new distribution agreements over the last couple of years there are more in the pipeline that we plan to announce and that business as we add more parts both on the government side as well as the commercial side we definitely see that business growing beyond pandemic levels and finally on commercial programs that s a business that we ve done a lot of work to restructure it s in a much better place than it was pre pandemic it is smaller than it was pre pandemic but we still intend to be a participant at that market but just more disciplined about the contract that we go after robert spingarn credit suisse analyst okay and then just to finish this up is there a way to gauge your utilization in mro in terms of your hangar capacity where are you relative to the capacity that you have that s part one of the question part two of the question is we ve heard anecdotally that some capacity globally has gone away during covid and there could be a shortage of heavy maintenance capacity so those are the two questions your current utilization and whether there is a shortage and does that help you from a market share perspective at some point john m holmes president and chief executive officer sure in terms of capacity measured as looking at our footprint we still have a lot of capacity left but again we re really measuring capacity on our ability to attract full time skilled labor we are using contract labor a bit but we don t want to rely on that is heavily as we did pre covid so based on the labor capacity where we re pretty close to full at this point and having said that as i mentioned we re looking at potential opportunities to realign our footprint but we re with where we see available labor which would expand our capacity down the road and then in terms of a shortage overall there is definitely an elevated amount of maintenance activity out there right now there s a lot of deferred maintenance that has not been done there is and i think that s globally and you re certainly seeing that here in north america and i think you ll see that elsewhere as if aircraft come back to the skies so i agree with the comment that there is a shortage i think a lot of that s driven by return to service work which obviously is a moment in time but we our goal is just to remain very disciplined as i mentioned in the beginning about the work that we take on because we want to hold on to these production efficiency gains that we ve achieved in the last couple of quarters robert spingarn credit suisse analyst okay thanks for the help john john m holmes president and chief executive officer thanks rob operator your next question comes from the line of michael ciarmoli your line is open please go ahead pete osterland truist securities analyst hey good afternoon this is pete osterland down for mike first just wanted to get a little more color on your near term margin outlook are there any incremental operational efficiencies that you re still planning to implement that could help give you even more margin leverage and on the other hand are there any specific pressure points you re experiencing in terms of cost inflation as you start fiscal 22 john m holmes president and chief executive officer so we we ve done a lot as we ve mentioned in terms of structural changes to improve the margin those are largely done and sean mentioned this most recent contract that was terminated that will contribute to that so a lot of that has been done the majority of the margin improvement that we expect to see in the medium term will come as the revenue recovers in our more profitable parts activities so i would say the lion s share will come from that over the longer term i should say medium to longer term we would expect to see additional margin improvement coming from certain of our digital initiatives we are making investments in that area that will start to come through in the coming quarters in terms of you ll see investments that we made but long term that should add efficiency particularly inside our hangar operations pete osterland truist securities analyst okay thanks and then just wanted to ask on your expeditionary business just given the relatively small size of the business and the lower margins versus the company average would you be open to considering strategic alternatives for that business john m holmes president and chief executive officer it s not something we typically discuss publicly but we articulated several years ago our strategy is to be an aviation services company and as we look at the portfolio anything that doesn t necessarily align with that strategy long term certainly we continue to evaluate pete osterland truist securities analyst okay thank you very much john m holmes president and chief executive officer great thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of joseph denardi your line is open please go ahead joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst thanks good afternoon john or sean can you give us what commercial margins i guess adjusted commercial margins were in the quarter sean gillen vice president and chief financial officer yes we don t break out the margins on an adjusted basis but you can kind of take a look at the adjustments and kind of allocate some of that but it s relatively close to the margin that i gave in terms of gaap joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst okay okay and then john just on the parts side of the business can you talk about whether you re seeing any difference there kind of geographically are us airlines kind of behaving differently from an inventory management standpoint and how much longer do you foresee kind of inventories being able to be burned down before they have to come back to the market john m holmes president and chief executive officer yeah definitely the us airlines outside of china the us airlines are certainly well ahead in terms of that inventory burn down and as i mentioned just in recent weeks we started to see some noticeable pickup in activity on the parts businesses both new and usm and that s largely being driven by us carriers we expect that you d see the same kind of curve occur around the world as aircraft get back into service i mentioned a couple of calls ago that we do a lot of business up in canada we ve got two great facilities up there and canada has been largely shut down through this time and we were very encouraged yesterday to see the announcement come out that they ve got a timeline to open the borders and air canada for example subsequently followed with an announcement that they re going to be putting more flights in the network as a result so you will see that kind of thing we expect as the vaccines are deployed around the world and those airlines will go through the same i m assuming the same type of curve where they will burn through what they have on the shelf and they will return to purchasing from us joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst okay okay that s great and then on fortress john you mentioned i think that that is starting to contribute could you characterize whether the contribution is at full run rate yet or how much that has left to go until it s fully up and running john m holmes president and chief executive officer yeah that s actually going the program is going really well fortress is a great partner so far they are right on the money with the number of engines that are coming through to us the so i would say the induction of engines is right on pace the bookings that we are starting to see now that the engines are being processed and parts are being repaired and they are being marketed to customers so the bookings are right on pace with our expectations but you did not see very significant shipments yet in this quarter or in q4 you will see a bit more in q1 and we d expect later this fiscal year in terms of actual shipments in the quarter we would be at full run rate joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst okay that s great and then just lastly sean the 140 million that you referenced does that capture the c 40 and the commercial programs headwind is what that was sean gillen vice president and chief financial officer no so that s just taken a look at the call it activities will be exited like closing duluth or selling the composites business and then contracts that we ve restructured or exited the revenue that those contributed pre covid was 140 million so it s not kind of a forward looking for c 40 or anything like that just quantifying the sales of activities that we have exited over the last several quarters joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst got it okay could you characterize what you expect from the defense business for the year if the commercial side is little bit too hard to call do you have more visibility on the defense side sean gillen vice president and chief financial officer yeah we re not obviously defense got a little bit better the line of sight but in terms of not giving guidance don t want to kind of go into specifics as john mentioned some of these contracts may be recompete and ultimately stay or add so there s some uncertainty there and going to quantify kind of the forward look for sales on that joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst okay thank you john m holmes president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken herbert your line is open please go ahead kenneth herbert canaccord genuity analyst yeah hey john and sean good afternoon john m holmes president and chief executive officer hi ken kenneth herbert canaccord genuity analyst hey john as you look then into fiscal 22 when you think about your parts business is there any reason you would see demand lower than aircraft utilization and i m guessing as utilization continues to increase perhaps usm represents scenario where you could see faster growth but just to finer point just to put a finer point on it how are you viewing the pull on the parts side relative to utilization on the aircraft side as we head into fiscal 22 john m holmes president and chief executive officer i mean we i think you re you have pent up demand there is no question out there and so we would expect to see once that inventory is burned down thanks to elevated utilization that our recovery would i would say kind of outpace utilization in the early part as you catch up if you will but then track with increased utilization once we hit steady state in terms of parts supply and consumption kenneth herbert canaccord genuity analyst and do you think that catch up is a quarter or two or could it be even longer john m holmes president and chief executive officer we i think what i would say is that the us is definitely going to be sooner than international because of the increase in utilization that you re seeing in the us it s difficult to predict right now i ll go back to what i said earlier and as much as just in the last few weeks we ve seen some higher highs if you will in the that parts activity so we re encouraged but at this point i wouldn t want to attempt to predict precisely when we would see that elevation kenneth herbert canaccord genuity analyst yeah okay and as we look at the mro business have you started to see yet the industry pull any widebody heavy work back to united states that previously or currently is done in asia and china in particular and if we do start to see that trend is that an interesting market to you or you would maybe look to capture some of that and add capacity to capture some of that or how do you think about that john m holmes president and chief executive officer so at the top of my head i can t take the specific examples yet but anecdotally absolutely there is a lot of discussion about that we have had conversations with a couple of our customers and as much as to the extent that that occurs would we be able to service it and it kind of all depends in terms of how we balance that versus other demand and historically i think that we ve been largely a narrow body operation in north america both in canada and the us and so that s been our primary focus but to the extent that an existing customer wants to repatriate work and we can make room for it and find the technical labor to support it would certainly be open kenneth herbert canaccord genuity analyst okay and pre covid you had talked about perhaps pursuing pma on the parts side as a growth opportunity is that still something you re looking at or how do you view that that opportunity now john m holmes president and chief executive officer yeah we continue to believe that should be a part of our portfolio and we continue to look at internal initiatives as well as partnership opportunities with other pma houses out there kenneth herbert canaccord genuity analyst okay great and just finally on the government side we re hearing about some pressure from the dla i know you ve got a number of contracts on the distribution side for military or government parts are you seeing any of that pressure yet on the dla or how does that look from fiscal 21 to 22 in terms of their purchasing john m holmes president and chief executive officer yeah good question and we are we ve definitely seen a moderation in the weekly order volume out of the dla and we attribute that to the new administration is going to focus on spending money on the next generation platforms as opposed to the prior administration s focus on sustainment and readiness so we do expect moderated growth in that regard having said that even though same store sales on military product lines may actually come at or a little bit of pressure we ve got a number of new distribution agreements that we ve signed or have in the queue that ultimately we believe would still provide growth over time in that market as we sign up new distributorships kenneth herbert canaccord genuity analyst okay great thanks a lot and really nice job managing the business through the downturn john m holmes president and chief executive officer thank you ken really appreciate that operator your next question comes from the line of josh sullivan your line is open please go ahead josh sullivan the benchmark company analyst hey good afternoon john m holmes president and chief executive officer hey josh how are you josh sullivan the benchmark company analyst i m doing well can you just kind of outline some of your afghanistan exposure is it an opportunity as they pull out on some of your support services or is it more of a headwind at this point john m holmes president and chief executive officer it s a great question there is one program we have a couple different operations that are involved in afghanistan one program is actually being restructured the operation will change but the kind of financial impact to aar will be neutral to positive based on that restructuring the other significant operation we have over there is to support the wass contract and at this point it s unclear what if any impact the withdrawal will have to that operation we do but your point on the opportunity is exactly correct i mean there will be a number of ways that that country will be supported differently going forward and we are focused on participating in that to the extent that we can josh sullivan the benchmark company analyst and then just on the wass contract i mean globally outside of afghanistan are there growing opportunities or is it really in afghanistan kind of opportunity for you john m holmes president and chief executive officer so wass i would say philosophically a democratic administration tend to rely more on diplomacy than a republican administration so wass has had its best years under obama for example prior to trump and so we believe that to the extent that the current administration look to increase the level of diplomatic activity around the world that wass could be a beneficiary of that none of that has occurred yet but certainly it s something it s on our mind josh sullivan the benchmark company analyst got it and then just following up on the pma question do you see yourselves more as a distributor of the pma or do you think you will be investing in engineering resources and pursuing pma of your own your making john m holmes president and chief executive officer both josh sullivan the benchmark company analyst got it both right thank you for the time john m holmes president and chief executive officer great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of robert spingarn your line is open please go ahead robert spingarn credit suisse analyst hi i m back just with a couple more questions john m holmes president and chief executive officer hey great robert spingarn credit suisse analyst in mro what does smaller but more profitable look like in the future maybe one way to think about this is pre covid we thought of it is about a third of aviation services john m holmes president and chief executive officer yeah i wouldn t want to quantify that at this point we that s not something that we historically broken out but we tend to think of it in terms of labor our production and for competitive reasons wouldn t necessarily want to get into that but we would expect fewer hours but a higher yield on those hours this fiscal year and then i would also point to that s where we are today but to the extent that we can stay true to the model of servicing the demand with full time employees as opposed to relying on contractors and adjust our footprint so that we can continue to attract more full time employees and go where the skilled labor is that would allow us to expand our capacity and potentially get back to the hour production that we saw pre covid but again on a with much better yield so that s how we re thinking about it robert spingarn credit suisse analyst okay and then these all these questions are in a similar way in looking to the future you ve announced a lot of different deals joint ventures and relationships with customers during covid when we think about all of that business how do we size that relative to i guess aviation services before in other words how do we think about the new business in terms of how additive it is sean gillen vice president and chief financial officer i think a lot of those and that goes back to my earlier comments around the parts businesses in particular we believe that usm thanks to likely increased user adoption of aftermarket material as well as programs like fortress and then on the new parts distribution business our the lines that we ve announced over the last year and a half as those grow back to pre covid levels we see both of those businesses have the opportunity and the foundation to ultimately exceed the volume that we saw pre covid just on deals that we ve already done that s not counting on new business that we have in the pipeline at this point again i would say it s just difficult to sketch out the pace and size of that but we have a broader foundation to build from than we did pre covid for those businesses in particular robert spingarn credit suisse analyst and is there anything we should take from the fortress or other deals about your activity on the engine side as in contrast to the airframes we think about mro we think about airframe but clearly you re doing engine work what s the trend there engine versus airframe in terms of parts john m holmes president and chief executive officer yeah so the airframe has always been the focus of the primary focus of the mro businesses and don t forget you ve got landing gear components in there as well but airframe maintenance business is the primary focus of the mro business the parts business the primary focus in the aftermarket has historically been the engines and we expect that to continue and we see the most opportunity for us there supplying engine parts not overhauling engines but supplying engine parts in most cases to shops that performed the overhauls and again as fortress is detailed there is a tremendous amount of cost savings opportunity for customers as they want to overhaul engines by using aftermarket engine part materials as opposed to buying new from the oems robert spingarn credit suisse analyst okay and then just on distribution these distribution deals that we ve seen some investment in in the past what are you expecting going forward there does any structural change to the desire to do that more opportunity post covid to put your balance sheet to work john m holmes president and chief executive officer absolutely we see a lot of opportunity for organic investment in that market you recall a year ago we announced the unison deal that was a meaningful investment that s tracking right where we expected there are other programs that we ve announced since then and other things that are in the pipeline some of them require capital some of them do not but we are very excited about the position we occupy in the distribution space because unlike a couple of our larger competitors at this point we ve got a balance sheet that we can put to work and it s our core focus robert spingarn credit suisse analyst right and my last one also on investment and maybe sean you have this is what do you expect or how much do you expect to invest in digitization in fiscal 22 sean gillen vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think there will be some modest investment some of that will be in sg a as i mentioned to see a bit of an increase there and then in terms of the capital capex obviously last year was a lean year for capex so you will see some of that digital investment come through capex which will be higher than this past year a little bit more in line with historical years before that in terms of total capex robert spingarn credit suisse analyst okay thank you both john m holmes president and chief executive officer thanks rob operator your next question comes from the line of ken herbert your line is open please go ahead kenneth herbert canaccord genuity analyst yeah hi thanks sean i just wanted to follow up on that you generated really strong cash in fiscal 21 it sounds like capex heads up in 22 can you walk through a couple of sort of the key moving pieces as we think about free cash flow in 22 and maybe if you re comfortable how we should start to think about sort of a framework around cash conversion or where you think the business should be on more normal basis sean gillen vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we ve made a lot of improvements in terms of the cost of the company which shows up in our cash flow efficiency and working capital management as you think about what occurred in fy 21 and try to and compare it to fy 22 obviously inventory was a significant provider of cash in the fiscal year as we focused on that and managed our position there i don t think you will see the same performance in fy 21 because as john mentioned there will be opportunities both on new material as well as used material which will show up in inventory largely to put capital to work but we re going to have and sketched out a specific conversion target we will continue to focus on managing working capital and driving free cash flow but with a little bit more of an eye toward putting money to work on new investments kenneth herbert canaccord genuity analyst okay that s helpful thank you john m holmes president and chief executive officer thanks ken operator there are no further questions presenters please go ahead john m holmes president and chief executive officer great well thank you very much we really appreciate the time and the interest and we look forward to being back here to talk about our first quarter results thank you operator duration 41 minutes call participants john m holmes president and chief executive

tammy patrick a former federal compliance officer for the maricopa county elections department for 11 years told us logan is looking at early voter lists provided to political parties in the weeks before the election to assist their get out the vote efforts they are not meant to be and are not a full accounting of early voters at the hearing logan called for a door to door canvassing of some voters because it s the one way to know for sure whether some of the data we re seeing if it s real problems or whether it s clerical errors of some sort we have 74 243 mail in ballots where there is no clear record of them being sent logan said and just to be clear here in the state of arizona there s ev32s and ev33s ev32 is supposed to give a record of when a mail in ballot is sent and an ev33 is supposed to give a record of when the mail in ballot is received and so there should be more ev32s more sent out than there are that are received according to logan we have 74 000 where we have them came back from individuals where we don t have a clear indication that they were ever sent out to them that could be something where documentation wasn t done right there was a clerical issue there s not proper things there but i think when we ve got 74 000 it merits knocking on a door and validating some of this information patrick who is now a senior adviser to the elections program at democracy fund said this is no clerical error or fraud but rather a mistake made by someone who simply doesn t understand what they re looking at because of their predisposition anything they don t see or understand they use to further this narrative that there was something wrong with this election patrick said the first thing to understand is that arizona calls all voting before election day early voting no matter if the ballot is mailed out to a voter or voted in person at an early voting location patrick told us as the county explained via twitter the people who vote in person use ballots provided at a vote center this is not a new practice so it s not unusual that we would have more early votes than mail in ballots sent the county said the files logan referred to ev32s and ev33s are not the proper files to refer to for a complete accumulating of all early ballots sent and received as patrick explained to us for decades arizona statute has required that county recorders provide the political parties request and return files to aid them in their get out the vote gotv efforts the ev32 request file includes ballot requests through the final day of requesting a ballot be mailed to the voter e 11 and the ev33 return file includes all returns through the monday before election day e 1 which is the last list anyone needs for the final gotv effort on election day she said the lists allows local political parties prior to the election to reach out to voters from their party who have received a mail in ballot to remind them to stick their ballot in the mail or if it s too close to the election to drop it in a drop box or at a polling place on election day individuals who don t understand how elections work in az don t seem to understand that the ev33 return file contains voters who simultaneously requested and voted in person during the final week of in person early voting patrick said additionally they don t seem to understand that it does not include any ballots returned after monday and we know that tens of thousands of ballots are dropped off on election day itself to use these files as an attempt to understand the number of voters who were mailed a ballot or who returned a ballot is not only misguided but dishonest patrick said that information is obtained from the voted file not a gotv tool for the political parties and candidates according to the maricopa county twitter feed there were actually a total of 2 364 426 mail in ballots requested and 1 918 024 of them were returned in an email to us rod thomson a public relations consultant working for cyber ninjas defended logan s comments and blamed any confusion about the early vote tallies on maricopa county officials refusal to communicate with the company as mr logan stated there is no clear record of them being sent thomson said but he said there could be numerous legitimate possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy if maricopa county officials had not refused to communicate with the audit team these sorts of questions would be answered in the normal course of auditor and auditee thomson said questions always arise in audits and the industry standard is that communications go back and forth with the audited entity providing answers maricopa county has refused to do so requiring that these be brought out in a public setting maricopa county responded via twitter realauditorsdont need their auditees to handhold them through every process because they lack the knowledge to do their job correctly no evidence arizona voting system was hacked in his july 16 statement trump claimed the arizona senate hearing showed that all the access logs to the machines were wiped and the election server was hacked during the election a day earlier trump claimed the hearing revealed that the voting system was breached or hacked by who at the july 15 hearing senate president karen fann said maricopa county sent letters out to the voters and saying please be aware our system s been hacked or breached and we believe none of your personal information has been disclosed but the county said there was no hack and it isn t possible for hackers to change votes because the ballot tabulation equipment is a closed air gapped system meaning it isn t connected to the internet this is false the county said in a july 16 tweet the event in question involved an individual inappropriately accessing and downloading publicly available info the website is in no way connected to the election management system in fact the county in february released the results of the independent forensic audit of its ballot tabulation equipment that found no issues with how the votes were counted that audit was conducted by two federally certified voting system testing laboratories pro v v and sli compliance these tests looked for evidence of the tabulations system ability to connect to the internet and if the tabulators and or system was transmitting information outside the closed air gapped system within the county tabulation center or while being delivered returned or used at a vote center the county reported pro v v and sli compliance found no evidence of internet connectivity voter rolls confusion trump claimed that 11 000 voters were added to the voter rolls after the election and still voted suggesting that is evidence of fraud it s not maricopa county officials said that the figure referenced could include individuals who voted using provisional ballots and whose registration information wasn t added to the voter rolls until after the necessary steps were taken to verify their eligibility to vote in the general election these go through a rigorous verification process to make sure that the provisional ballots cast are only counted if the voter is eligible to vote in the election county officials wrote in a twitter thread this happens after election day only eligible voters are added to the voter rolls the officials also said that even some people whose provisional ballots were not counted may have been later added to the voter rolls it is possible for a voter to not be on the voter rolls vote a provisional ballot receive credit for voting that ballot not actually be counted because they voted provisionally and then later show up on the voter rolls the officials explained on twitter in maricopa county for example thousands of provisional ballots were not counted because the person had not registered to vote or had not registered before the deadline but even if their ballots were not counted those who registered late may be later added to the voter rolls because you can register to vote at anytime megan gilbertson communications director for the maricopa county elections department told us in a phone interview logan and maricopa county disagreements there are at least two issues on which logan and maricopa county disagree duplicated ballots and signature verification standards but in neither case does logan cite instances of fraud both logan and maricopa county say that if a ballot can t be run through a tabulator because it s damaged a braille ballot or a military or overseas ballot elections officials duplicate the ballot so it can be tallied the county tweeted on july 16 the elections department assigns a matching serial number to both the original and duplicated ballot this number can be used to compare the ballots logan said in the senate hearing that he was having difficulty matching up original and duplicated ballots he cited a handful of examples where we have two original ballots that have the same exact serial number and we have only one that was duplicated from it and he said there were a whole bunch of ballots that also don t have any serial number on them so it s quite possible that for the second one with the same serial number there s another one that matches up with it that literally doesn t have a serial number on it but it creates a lot of time and difficulty in resolving these issues maricopa county said the accuracy of its duplication process was confirmed in a court case in which 1 626 duplicated ballots were randomly sampled that court case ward v jackson found that among the random sample of 1 626 duplicated ballots there were nine errors that would have given trump seven votes and president joe biden two votes the arizona supreme court which rejected the plaintiff s lawsuit said that such an error rate extrapolated to all 27 869 duplicate ballots in maricopa county is not sufficient to come close to warranting a recount under state law and would amount to only a net increase of 103 to 153 votes neither of which is sufficient to call the election results into question chief justice robert brutinel wrote in the decision that the plaintiff state gop chairwoman kelli ward fails to present any evidence of misconduct illegal votes or that the biden electors did not in fact receive the highest number of votes for office let alone establish any degree of fraud or a sufficient error rate that would undermine the certainty of the election results logan also claimed he had an affidavit from an unnamed person alleging maricopa county relaxed and then eliminated signature verification requirements the county said that s false yeah we ve had an affidavit this specifically stated that when mail in ballots were received that so many of them were received that the standards reduced every time they originally talked about there was initially 20 points of comparison on the signature and then after some time they re told to go to 10 points of signature 10 points of comparison then five and then eventually they were just told to let every single mail in ballot through logan said maricopa county responded on twitter this is simply not true maricopa county follows rigorous state signature verification guidelines staff receives training prior to elections to ensure compliance it continued in june 2020 prior to the primary election all full time staff members that perform signature verification in maricopa county completed a statewide signature verification certification course offered by the associated forensic laboratory llc the maricopa county recorder s office headed by republican stephen richer who has shot down election fraud claims before also disputed logan s claim at no point during the 2020 election cycle did maricopa county modify the rigorous signature verification requirements any suggestion to the contrary is categorically false the office said on twitter editor s

senate bill 8 went into effect on sept 1 the supreme court voted 5 4 to deny an emergency appeal from abortion providers to block the bill update the supreme court voted 5 4 to deny an emergency appeal from abortion providers and reproductive rights groups to block the texas heartbeat act or senate bill 8 sb 8 the bill which went into effect on sept 1 bars abortions in the state as early as six weeks or after a fetal heartbeat has been detected chief justice john roberts dissented along with the high court s three liberal justices justice sonia sotomayor justice elena kagan and justice stephen g breyer each of the four dissenting justices wrote separate statements expressing their disagreement with the majority previous update on sept 1 the texas heartbeat act also known as senate bill 8 sb 8 went into effect the bill bars abortions in the state as early as six weeks or after a fetal heartbeat has been detected sb 8 differs from previous abortion bills passed in texas because the state s top attorney won t enforce it the public will the bill states this law will be exclusively enforced through private civil action several reproductive rights groups including the aclu and planned parenthood filed an emergency request with the u s supreme court asking it to block sb 8 on aug 30 kvue reports the filing comes after the fifth circuit court of appeals denied the plaintiffs request on aug 29 to block the law the supreme court has yet to act on an emergency appeal to put the law on hold previous report bills limiting abortions have been passed in state legislatures across the united states this year the guttmacher institute a research and policy group focused on reproductive health rights says more abortion restrictions have been enacted in 2021 than any other year since the 1973 roe v wade supreme court decision which gave women the constitutional right to an abortion one of those bills is senate bill 8 in texas colloquially known as the state s heartbeat bill gov greg abbott signed the bill in may and the law is set to go into effect on sept 1 2021 under the law abortions are banned after a fetal heartbeat is detected which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy on social media tweets shared thousands of times said people who report abortion violations under the new law could get 10 000 some called the potential 10 000 awards abortion bounties the question can people who report violations of the new texas abortion law get 10 000 the sources jessie hill professor of law at case western reserve university school of law in ohio caroline mala corbin professor of law at the university of miami school of law texas senate bill 8 the answer yes private citizens who successfully sue over violations under the new texas abortion law will be awarded at least 10 000 what we found texas is not the first state to pass a heartbeat bill other states including georgia and ohio have passed similar abortion laws but jessie hill a professor of law at case western reserve university school of law in ohio said those bans have all been struck down in court for being in violation of roe v wade which says states can t prohibit abortions until the fetus reaches a point of viability according to the american pregnancy association most women discover they are pregnant between weeks four and seven of pregnancy that means under the heartbeat bill some women may not know they re pregnant until after the abortion ban goes into effect when gov abbott signed the bill on may 19 he said the law ensures the life of every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion what makes the texas abortion law unique is how it is set to be enforced the wording of the law says any person other an officer or employee of a state or local government entity in this state may bring civil action against anyone who performs an abortion or aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion essentially that means private citizens not the state government are in charge of enforcing the law according to caroline mala corbin a professor of law at the university of miami school of law this is so unusual i would even say bizarre corbin said what texas has done here is forbidden state actors from enforcing the law and instead is saying only private citizens can enforce the law and not only private people but any private person the language actually says any person can bring a suit under this that means it doesn t have to be someone connected to the clinic or the woman seeking to end her pregnancy doesn t have to be someone in texas it can literally be any person a person who brings forward civil action against someone over the abortion law and wins in court will be awarded at least 10 000 according to the law it is this kind of bounty for suing abortion providers it creates a huge incentive and a huge invitation to sue hill said so who can be sued under the law the woman who had the abortion can t be sued hill said but pretty much everyone else involved could face litigation the person who provided the abortion can be sued for the damages award but also anyone who aided or abetted that person hill said so anyone who helped pay for it even mentions providing insurance coverage for the abortion anyone who just assisted along the way which suggests that employees someone who gave a patient a ride to the abortion clinic for example anyone who participates in the entire process can be sued prior to the law being passed nearly 400 texas attorneys and more than 200 texas physicians voiced concerns about how it would be enforced hill said the enforcement aspect makes the law more difficult to challenge because normally when abortion providers want to challenge a law like this one banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy they go into court before the law takes effect and they sue the public officials who would be charged with enforcing the law and get an order a court order preventing them from enforcing it hill said but that s not possible here on july 13 a challenge to the law was filed in federal court by a wide range of plaintiffs including abortion providers they sued state judges and county clerks of course if you re going to bring a lawsuit you need state court judges to hear the lawsuits and clerks to process the lawsuits and so on hill said so those clinics have sued the judges and are trying to get a court order that will prevent the judges from hearing these cases hill said an obstacle facing the plaintiffs in the case is that judges have protections from being sued one of the non judge defendants in the case is mark lee dickson the director of right to life east texas he referred to the lawsuit as ridiculous texas right to life said the lawsuit is an embarrassing farce and that it was confident the suit would be dismissed corbin and hill are unsure of how the lawsuit will play out
shifts in how rents are rising in local apartments have continued more than a year after the covid 19 pandemic changed housing considerations for many according to commercial real estate data company yardi matrix rents on lifestyle apartments which are typically newer and more upscale rose by more than 15 from june 2020 to last month in the sacramento region doug ressler yardi matrix s manager of business intelligence said that s largely a function of bay area workers now working remotely more often coming east for more living space but people who rent by necessity are seeing higher rents too for those apartments rents rose by about 10 5 from june 2020 to june 2021 overall sacramento region multifamily rents rose by 12 6 according to the report a shortage of housing overall is a key factor in rents rising across the board putting landlords in a position of strength no one is offering concessions ressler said they re gone there is a possible sign however of some flattening in the second quarter of this year april through june absorption of newer apartment units in the region plateaued ressler said that could be the result of people becoming more thoughtful about signing leases with the economy reopening and some businesses making plans to call workers back to the office at least part time he said beyond an external factor the only other possible factor that would make rents level out would be increased supply following normal economic theories ressler said but while yardi matrix projects more than 3 200 new apartment units to open in the region in both 2022 and 2023 that number is projected to fall off after that just over 1 500 are expected to open in the sacramento region in 2024 and no more than about 2 300 in either of the two following years the number of new units completed locally in the last year equals about 1 1 of the total apartment stock still among the lowest new numbers of any market in the u s in rent growth phoenix led the june 2020 21 period with 17 followed by tampa florida california s inland empire las vegas atlanta and then sacramento
when the covid 19 pandemic shuttered major economies in march 2020 it also wreaked havoc on financial markets in the first few weeks of march investment grade corporate bonds lost roughly a fifth of their value on par with the declines in equity and high yield debt haddad et al 2020 falato et al forthcoming contrary to the usual flight to quality in mid march treasury yields began rising and only stabilised after the federal reserve initiated a massive purchase program vissing jorgensen 2020 the distress in the treasury market accentuated distress in other markets and liquidity challenges for firms nonbanks that service a huge swathe of home loans looked as though they may face their own collective liquidity crisis causing ripple effects in mortgage origination and elsewhere crisis was averted only because of the quick and aggressive interventions by the federal reserve congress and others that a shock the size of the pandemic would trigger distress in financial markets is far from surprising what is surprising is how much of the distress arose in domains that could have been identified posing a potential threat to stability well before the pandemic hit and yet each remained largely unaddressed for example the volume of investment grade bonds outstanding more than doubled since the 2008 financial crisis contributing to and enabled by a rapid growth in bond mutual funds studies had already shown that such funds exhibit a first mover advantage rendering them inherently fragile similarly despite regulations that presumed treasuries could always and easily be converted into cash the treasury market had already exhibited meaningful dysfunction in response to stressors far smaller than the pandemic that the volume of treasuries outstanding had more than doubled since 2008 while the capacity of banks to provide liquidity for treasuries had stagnated was also readily apparent duffie 2018 the mortgage market too has evolved dramatically since 2008 with banks originating and servicing fewer loans particularly to higher risk borrowers that nonbanks were critical to mortgage origination and servicing and that they nonetheless remained thinly capitalised heavily dependent on wholesale funding and outside the domain of prudential regulators was known that these vulnerabilities and others had not been addressed suggests structural shortcomings in the us financial regulatory regime bolton et al 2019 as these examples show a core challenge is that finance is dynamic rules introduced to address known threats to stability cause activity to migrate elsewhere improvements in information technology and other innovations give rise to new actors and new modes of financial intermediation carletti et al 2020 petralia et al 2019 yet the regulation of these evolving actors and activities often fails to adjust to new realities the net result is de facto deregulation and these same problems and patterns are present in europe hudula 2020 in a new report co authored with colleagues on the task force on financial stability co sponsored by the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy at brookings and the chicago booth initiative on global markets we explore how the us financial regulatory regime is falling short hubbard et al 2021 we also propose reforms to increase the likelihood that policymakers will identify and address threats to stability before they harm the real economy the us regulatory structure is famously fragmented with three bank regulators two market regulators and host of other financial regulators the dodd frank act sought to mitigate this challenge by creating a new financial stability oversight council fsoc under the leadership of the secretary of the treasury the other federal financial regulators and a few others fifteen in total are members of this fsoc rather than propose an overhaul to the system we sought to improve it we focused on ensuring regulators have the information and other competencies they need to tackle systemic threats and that they are incentivised to do so first we recommend that congress clarify that every fsoc member has an obligation to promote stability and resilience to make sure that they have the personnel and resources they need to fulfil this mission we propose that each fsoc member also have a new office of financial stability and resilience to encourage regulators to consider the collateral consequences of their interventions we would require that they undertake an impact analysis when adopting new rules and that they also undertake a lookback five years later to see how well their predictions fared each fsoc member would also be required to prepare an addendum to the fsoc s annual financial stability report identifying what they see as potential threats to stability and explaining how they intend to respond to threats that they and others have identified within their domain it may well take time and some trial and error to realise the benefits of these layered and complementary reforms nonetheless given the authority that fsoc members already possess we see the process of ensuring fsoc members acquire the information skills and incentives to tackle threats to stability as key to building a more resilient system a second area of reform is fsoc leadership the treasury secretary consistently takes the lead when crisis hits but often has a plate full of other pressing matters during periods of stability for this and other reasons efforts to promote stability can languish when all seems well to facilitate ongoing diligence and the horizon scanning needed to identify common vulnerabilities and interconnections we propose a new undersecretary for financial stability within the treasury department in addition to being authorised to testify before congress on behalf of the fsoc and facilitating coordination among fsoc members the new undersecretary and an expanded staff would have full control over the fsoc annual report with other fsoc members now providing their own addenda and not having veto power over the text of the main report fsoc leadership should have greater freedom to use the report to identify weaknesses explain how the financial system is changing and propose plans for addressing deficiencies these two sets of reforms are designed to be mutually supportive and to normalise an understanding that regulation and regulators to evolve alongside changes in the financial system the reforms should lay the groundwork for more meaningful macroprudential activities based regulation by harnessing that authority where it lies with fsoc member agencies and creating built in mechanisms for holding regulators to account when they drag their feet and for seeking new authority from congress when current tools prove insufficient the enhanced transparency should also enable those outside of government to sound the alarm bells more readily when needed the third major area of reform addresses information and data gaps these gaps continue to undermine the capacity of regulators to identify emerging threats and interconnections and that can accentuate the tendency for market actors to run in the face of a shock the office of financial research the other major regulatory innovation in the dodd frank act was designed to identify such gaps promote data standardisation and sharing and to gather and analyse the data needed to recognise potential fragilities for an array of reasons it has thus far fallen short of these important aims we propose strengthening the organisation by having it morph from the ofr into the comptroller for data and resilience and making it a full member of the fsoc we suggest that other fsoc members should be required to consult with the cdr when undertaking any new data collection and we propose other reforms that should enhance the cdr s capacity to further the important aims laid out for it the full report provides a more complete account of the deficiencies of the current system and how these three changes and other more modest reforms could lay the groundwork for a more effective and accountable system for addressing threats to

july 21 i thought things were bad enough when malaysia chinese were spurning other vaccines for sinovac believing it was their only guarantee they could gain hassle free entry into china now i hear some malaysian indians refusing sinovac in fear that they would not be able to travel to india as they had heard the country did not recognise the china made vaccine add to that some of those who had signed up for astrazeneca jabs decided to cancel in the hopes of getting other vaccines now new stocks have arrived i am sorry malaysians but we are not in the us where we can get vaccines at target departmental stores without needing to download terrible apps or indulge in online warfare to fight for a jab advertisement lack of information as i d said before it is ridiculous that the chinese communist party ccp is better at vaccine outreach than our own government i wonder if any government officials have quietly asked the country to perhaps stop sabotaging our vaccine programme with its anti mrna vaccine propaganda advertisement if the government was smart it would let people know that china is now procuring mrna vaccines as booster shots to its existing vaccines this after the relentless spreading of misinformation that mrna jabs were less safe and inferior to china s vaccines might perhaps get the more stubborn malaysians to accept whatever they re offered unfortunately malaysians are getting their information about vaccines not from outreach but via whatsapp groups full of conspiracy theories and unverified news i realise that the pandemic makes in person vaccine campaigning difficult but this is a matter of life and death so why isn t there more funding or some attempt at creativity too much of the information is online and not as accessible to those without decent internet connections people wait to receive their covid 19 vaccine jab at the mega vaccination centre located at uitm in puncak alam june 7 2021 picture by yusof mat isa have our tv and radio stations died i saw a tweet from an american saying that it was a shame that the us could promote cars better than it could vaccines you could say the same thing about malaysia we can make fancy commercials and relentless promotions for local car launches yet we couldn t put that effort into vaccine campaigns where are our vaccine commercials our ridiculous probably but catchy jingles where are the posters radio spots and ambassadors instead it seems the government is too busy sending enforcers after people questioning the transparency of our vaccine procurement and distribution there are also plenty of paid cybertroopers trying to counter popular hashtags such as kerajaangagal with their own rakyatgagal malaysians can spot cybertroopers from just one tweet now so hiring them is just a waste of money be your own vaccine hero i joked that i have now become the asian auntie vaccine edition my friends have had to put up with my overbearing questions asking after their appointments how they feel after jabs reminding them to check their mysejahtera apps daily it s gotten to the point where i nag people every day on social media and whatsapp or message friends constantly with vaccine news directives and other information what s tragic is that i have to do this am very blessed my parents are believers in vaccines and had registered for the vaccines without needing any prompting sure my mother sends me the odd folk cure or viral video on whatsapp but she still didn t think twice about getting the jab and my father checked his app daily until he finally got his appointment my friends aren t that lucky i keep hearing stories about parents stubbornly refusing to take vaccines or even insisting they will take only vaccine a or b we do not have the luxury of choice in this pandemic malaysians have to be convinced that any vaccine is better than getting covid 19 again it s kitajagakita all over again it s up to us to talk to our families friends neighbours and be as relentless in trying to save them as the government is reticent about combating misinformation we have to be our own vaccine superheroes because right now there is no way out of this pandemic except through vaccination to those still waiting for a vaccination i hope you get your appointment soon to those reluctant to register or get jabbed please reconsider to the government perhaps allocate funds to causes other than policing social media because this is 2021 and malaysians are too angry to be afraid anymore this is the personal opinion of the columnist
pilgrim s pride corporation filed three motions to dismiss for the corporation and cfo fabio sandri former ceo william lovette and current ceo jayson penn in the district of colorado on monday after shareholders alleged violations of the exchange act the class action lawsuit claimed that a price fixing conspiracy led to a sharp downturn in pilgrim s pride s stock prices the defendants first took aim at the plaintiffs claim that statements concerning its performance were false and misleading by noting that anticompetitive conduct in the plea agreement involved three contracts with a single customer that impacted 361 million of sales and that less than 1 of its sales does not support plaintiffs unspecified broad brush assertion that an antitrust conspiracy constituted the true driver of all of the company s financial performance during the class period furthermore the defendants claimed that the plaintiffs failed to allege that pilgrim s executives engaged in any anticompetitive conduct or were even aware of any continuing wrongdoing finally the defendants proffered that the plaintiffs did not establish loss causation since pilgrim s fully disclosed that there was ongoing litigation alleging that pilgrim s had been involved in antitrust violations and that the market was aware well before the stock price significantly decreased jayson penn noted that the class period was from 2012 2017 and that the complaint alleged no underlying wrongdoing by penn when he served as ceo from 2019 2020 he also claimed the plaintiffs attempted to plead penn s scienter based on statements he made several years after the underlying misconduct which supposedly does not meet the burden to plead scienter under the private securities litigation reform act pslra william lovette claimed that the complaint is virtually devoid of allegations involving mr lovette rendering the claims against him insufficient to sustain a private cause of action under the exchange act the defendant countered his charge by saying that the complaint trie to tie generic public statements made by mr lovette to two pre 2017 conversations involving mr lovette which plaintiff speculates related to alleged anticompetitive behavior occurring before the class period pilgrim s pride and fabio sandri are represented by weil gotshal manges llp and lewis roca rothgerber christie llp william lovette is represented by moore van allen pllc and jayson penn is represented by o melveny myers llp and davis graham stubbs llp

new york new york the covid 19 surge particularly the delta variant was blamed for monday s plunge in global stocks the biggest one day dive in 9 months so analysts were finding it difficult to explain why stocks roared ahead on tuesday the narrative from yesterday that bled through the weekend was a little bit of a risk off scenario around the increasing covid cases charlie ripley senior investment strategist for allianz investment management told reuters thomson monday i don t think it s so much that investors are worried about the cases themselves it s government officials and their reaction where we could get into a situation where restrictive measures get put in place again that dampens growth over the long run the contrast could be seen with the uk celebrating freedom day and the dispensing of all restrictions while recording more than 50 000 cases a day while in australia where the country is now registering around 100 cases a day two states and the most populated parts of a third are now in lockdown nonetheless investors were back feverishly buying stocks on tuesday the dow jones industrials accelerated 549 95 points or 1 62 percent to 34 511 99 the standard and poor s 500 added 64 57 points or 1 52 percent to 4 323 06 the nasdaq composite advanced 223 89 points or 1 57 percent to 14 498 88 the u s dollar retained its strength on tuesday but with the resurgence of stocks it made little headway the euro last changed hands approaching the new york close at 1 1780 this after hitting a low of 1 1755 earlier in the day the british pound slipped further to 1 3626 the japanese yen eased to 109 87 the swiss franc softened to 0 9213 the canadian dollar edged higher to 1 2682 the australian dollar inched up to 0 7331 from levels of 0 7315 reached in asia the new zealand dollar was slightly firmer at 0 6919 overseas in germany the dax index rose 0 55 percent the paris france based cac 40 climbed 0 81 percent in london the ftse 100 advanced 0 54 percent on asian markets the nikkei 225 in tokyo was off 264 58 points or 0 96 percent at 27 388 16 the australian all ordinaries shed 33 90 points or 0 45 percent to 7 525 80 china s shanghai composite fared best losing just 2 33 points or 0 07 percent to 3 536 79 in hong kong the hang seng dispensed with 264 58 points or 0 96 percent to 27 388 16
in january 2021 president biden signed an executive order protecting public health and the environment and restoring science to tackle the climate crisis this order provided a clear signal that the biden administration was recommitting the united states to climate initiatives guided by the best science with a renewed federal focus on addressing the climate crisis federal agencies have been tasked with captur the full cost of greenhouse gas emissions as accurately as possible in order to engage in informed decision and policy making consequently agencies have been examining both old and new methods of measuring greenhouse gas emissions one such measure that government agencies have readopted is the social cost of carbon in light of this reinstatement the environmental law institute eli hosted a webinar at which environmental experts discussed the social cost of carbon and its use as an analytical tool in measuring climate change carol jones ph d a visiting scholar at the eli moderated the webinar and hosted four distinguished panelists working in various areas of the environmental sphere the panelists in order of presentation were ann wolverton ph d senior research economist at the u s epa richard newell ph d president and ceo of resources for the future rachel cleetus ph d policy director and lead economist of the climate and energy program at the union of concerned scientists and steven rose ph d senior research economist at electric power research institute what is the social cost of carbon there was consensus amongst the panelists that the social cost of carbon can be defined as a measure used to estimate in dollars all economic damage that would result from emitting one ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere the measure indicates how much it is worth in today s dollars to avoid the damage that is projected for the future ann wolverton framed the social cost of carbon as a way for policy makers to monetize the benefits of reducing carbon emissions allowing for environmental impact to be incorporated into cost benefit analyses dr wolverton also noted that the calculation will always be an estimation of cost but is intended to be a comprehensive measure of climate change damages including but not limited to human health net energy demand changes in agricultural productivity property damages from increased flood risk and value of ecosystem services approaches to calculating the social cost of carbon dr wolverton outlined a four step process for estimating the social cost of carbon first agencies create projections of future population levels and gross domestic product in order to generate a carbon emissions path next the carbon emissions path informs predictions of how much the average global temperature will change using the mean temperature change agencies aggregate and monetize the expected amount of damages finally since damages have decades long affects agencies use a discount rate to apply a present value in today s dollars this process when used to estimate as far into the future as 2050 reveals that future emissions expected to produce larger incremental damages as economy grows and physical and economic systems become more stressed from greater climactic change richard newell followed dr wolverton s presentation by explaining resources for the future s rff similar but slightly different approach to estimation born out of a 2015 2017 study by the national academy of sciences according to dr newell the impetus for rff s social cost of carbon initiative came from the trump administration s low prioritization of improving estimation processes based on their study the national academy of sciences recommended building an integrated framework to unbundle the process of social cost of carbon estimation into four modules a socioeconomic module a climate module a damages module and a discounting module rff has been working on ways to implement each module by drawing on recent research to keep estimation processes updated applying the social cost of carbon to the electric power sector steven rose applauded the strides made towards improving the social cost of carbon estimation process but stressed the importance of continuous imparovement in order to truly reap the benefits of estimation in the electric power sector most notably he discussed how the current processes for estimation are not scientifically reliable and substantive overarching methodological issues need to be addressed for example there are methodological inconsistencies related to whether net global greenhouse gas changes are factored into calculations and estimates however if these technical issues can be solved dr rose stated that the practical impact on the power sector could be significant two notable impacts that he highlighted are the ability to set energy demand standards such as vehicle lighting and appliance efficiency and the ability to set a primary energy supply an electricity generating commercially traded fuel stock which at some point may be derived from renewable energy instead of oil recommendations for tackling the costs of climate change armed with an understanding of the mechanics for how the social cost of carbon is estimated and the technical problems therein rachel cleetus pivoted the discussion to emphasize that the latest science demonstrates the impacts of climate change has already cost the u s a billion dollars dr cleetus urgently called for the u s to make policy choices now in order to determine how the consequences of climate change will unfold in her call for action dr cleetus highlighted both the beneficial uses and drawbacks of relying on the social cost of carbon as a metric for policy making while she acknowledged that the social cost of carbon is a valuable metric to help determine stringency of federal regulations dr cleetus also said the metric fails to account for the cumulative legacy of pollution on communities of color and low income communities dr cleetus outlined nine recommendations based on the idea that the social cost of carbon should be but one tool amongst many in a robust toolbox three of those recommendations stood out as follows first the recommendations outlined in the national academy of sciences study should be continuously updated in order to maintain accurate estimates of the social cost of carbon second dr cleetus advocated more research be performed on the impacts of climate change felt by low income communities communities of color and developing countries the environmental impact of federal agency decisions on low income communities and communities of color is a major focus of the new administration s environmental justice agenda finally she highlighted the need for interdisciplinary research between scientists economists and policy makers to gather a more complete picture of the state of our climate conclusion the panelists shared their opinions on various considerations in using the social cost of carbon as a measure of the benefits in reducing carbon emissions care must be taken in the use of such an analytical tool for policy making purposes in the prior administration the social cost of carbon was set between 1 to 7 per ton of carbon released thus effectively communicating a negligible benefit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions this cost range imputed for the social cost of carbon was in contrast to the obama administration s estimate of 51 per ton released as noted by the webinar participants the social cost of carbon can be a useful policy tool if used properly which includes establishing accurate metrics for measuring benefits and adjusting as appropriate thus the biden administration s january 2021 executive order immediately reinstated the interagency working group on the social cost of carbon tasking the group to immediately establish a realistic interim scc in february 2021 the interim cost of carbon was set to match the obama administration s determination at 51 per ton released experts expect that once additional data are collected and analyzed the scc will further increase with a cost of carbon in the 50 plus range per ton released the biden administration is expected to more readily be able to pursue the ambitious carbon reduction goals to which it has committed the united states id id wolverton ann

the chinese communist party has been conducting an ongoing regulatory campaign that has seemed to particularly focus on domestic companies conducting foreign ipos the picture becomes even more clear with a proposed new set of rules that would force chinese tech companies that hold data on over one million users to apply for special cybersecurity approval before listing citing the national security risks associated with that data falling into the hands of foreign governments the new rules may be calculated to push chinese tech companies to list their ipos in hong kong instead of the west as they would not be subject to the same requirements there in a country of about 1 4 billion nearly every platform that handles user data is very likely to have at least one million records and therefore be subject to the new rules chinese tech companies steered away from foreign fundraising a statement released by the cyberspace administration of china last week expressed concern that the personal data of citizens could be affected controlled and maliciously exploited by foreign governments and create national security risks the move comes in response to a trend of chinese tech companies listing in foreign countries that originates with alibaba s first public listing in 2014 the online retail giant used a structure called a variable interest entity vie that allowed it to get around existing chinese government restrictions on foreign investment rather than being a traditional share of ownership as expressed by a stock a vie is a contract that grants the holder the rights to a certain percentage of the company s profits the profits are routed through a foreign shell company in alibaba s case a holding company registered in the cayman islands this entirely circumvents government restrictions on foreign entities investing in the physical assets of chinese tech companies there has been something of a rush of foreign listings making use of vies in the past year dating back to the planned listing of alibaba owned ant group in october after making a speech challenging chinese financial regulations owner jack ma famously disappeared from the public eye for about three months and the ipo was blocked by the government but other chinese tech companies 37 in 2021 alone including baidu and rideshare app didi have found success in listing on foreign exchanges by making use of the vie structure and have raised a collective 12 9 billion the latest controversy in this world of overseas listings is didi s ipo which recently went ahead even though the chinese government reportedly asked the company to delay it for several months due to concerns about national security risks this caused anger at both ends as the government s intervention caused a large drop in value and foreign investors believed that they should have been notified didi is currently blocked from chinese app stores while it makes necessary security adjustments national security requirements spook some tech companies the new national security requirements do not forbid vie structures such as these but would make these companies entirely responsible for their data security and accountable for any lapses chinese tech companies would have to apply to the government for permission to list in this way subject to a presumably stringent cybersecurity review beforehand that focuses on potential national security risks this includes a review of supply chains conducted by the china cybersecurity review technology and certification center a division of the newly formed cybersecurity review office this has already caused several planned ipos to be suddenly shelved regardless of whether or not any national security risks were involved linkdoc fitness app keep and restaurant supplier meicai all backed out of plans to list in the united states after the announcement was made tiktok owner bytedance has also reportedly been considering one of these foreign ipos it remains to be seen if the new requirements will dissuade it hong kong remains a viable though less lucrative option for chinese tech companies looking to do an ipo while this would allow them to avoid all the regulatory complications that come with the specter of national security risks the vie model may not be possible there for long china s securities regulators are reportedly preparing revisions to rules that would not only take vies off the table but would force companies that have already listed in this way like alibaba and baidu to seek government approval to issue any new shares the process of reviewing potential national security risks seems designed to dissuade chinese tech companies given that the government expects it to take at minimum 45 days to complete but could potentially stretch out for months in complex cases and generate substantial added compliance costs the measures are also reportedly not particularly specific about what standards these companies need to meet beyond calling for ipo materials and procurement documents as well as a report on the potential impact of the company s plans on national security
air travel in the united states hit another pandemic era record over the weekend as vacationers jammed airports but shares of airlines cruise lines hotels and almost anything else related to travel tumbled monday on growing concerns about highly contagious coronavirus variants the transportation security administration said it screened more than 2 2 million people at airport checkpoints on sunday the highest number since early march 2020 when the pandemic was beginning to crush travel in the u s that topped a record set just two days earlier and was the fourth peak recorded in july however sunday s mark was still 18 lower than on the comparable sunday in 2019 according to the tsa but investors weren t celebrating the latest evidence of a recovery in travel since vaccines against covid 19 became widely available in the u s stocks fell broadly the dow jones industrial average lost 2 1 on concern about rising infections in many countries and airline and cruise line stocks were hit especially hard united airlines shares tumbled 5 5 american airlines and delta air lines each fell about 4 and southwest dipped nearly 3 cruise line stocks fell to levels last seen before vaccines were widely available to americans carnival royal caribbean and norwegian cruise line holdings each lost between 4 and 6 hotels and airbnb also slipped shares of boeing which is just starting to see a recovery in aircraft orders fell 5 tensions rose monday between the u s and china a huge market for planes and one that has not lifted its grounding of boeing 737 max jets when the u s and allies formally blamed china for a major hacking attack airlines say domestic leisure travel is back to pre pandemic levels but international travel and business trips both remain sharply lower than in 2019 that is especially bad for american united and delta which get a sizeable chunk of revenue from international and business travel airlines are frustrated that restrictions on international travel haven t been relaxed more quickly the rise in coronavirus infections the u s daily rate of new reported cases has more than doubled over the past two weeks and the world health organization says the delta variant is causing cases and deaths from covid 19 to rise worldwide after a period of decline could delay moves to make travel easier after massive losses last year airlines are doing better with more americans booking flights delta reported a second quarter profit last week thanks to federal pandemic relief united american and southwest report results this week copyright 2021 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed photo ap
with demand especially among leisure travelers rebounding strongly since spring united airlines leaders tuesday reported a much smaller loss for the second quarter and forecast pre tax profits for the third and fourth quaters ahead elijah nouvelage bloomberg 2021 bloomberg finance lp united airlines may have lost 434 million or 1 34 per share in the second quarter but its strong belief that it will be profitable albeit only on a pre tax basis in both the third and fourth quarters ahead boosted investors confidence not only in the chicago based carrier but in all u s airlines airline shares in general rose sharply in wednesday morning trading buoyed by united s second quarter results and it s top executives positive outlook for the balance of the year by 12 30 pm et united shares were up 4 at 48 16 each still united s second quarter loss was the sixth straight quarterly loss for the chicago based carrier with all of those resulting from the unprecedented impact on travel demand and revenue of the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 s second quarter the airline lost 1 63 billion in the first quarter of this year it posted a 1 4 billion loss yet the dramatic improvement in united s financial results from the first to the second quarter this year is almost entirely because of the sharp jump in travel demand in the second quarter and especially over the last 45 days of the second quarter pent up demand among leisure travelers seemingly exploded in the last half of the second quarter s the number of new covid 19 cases and deaths declined significantly this spring and in a conference call wednesday morning with analysts and reporters united ceo scott kirby said he expects there to be little impact on the carrier s recovery trajectory from the recent moderate increases in newly reported cases of covid 19 that increase appears to be the result of the spread of the so called delta variant of the virus indeed kirby didn t wait for questions to come up about the impact of the delta variant he brought the matter up at the outset of the call we think the most likely outcome is that the recovery of demand will continue almost unabated he said he added that through data that united tracks from members of its mileage plus frequent flier programs and other research the company thinks bout 84 of its mileage plus members already are vaccinated and therefore unlikely to be made sick by the delta variant andrew nocella united s chief commercial officer added that in the last few weeks as news about the rise in newly reported covid 19 cases driven by the delta variant spread the rate at which passengers cancelled their travel plans or simply didn t show up to take their flights did not change typically he added throughout the pandemic period cancellation and no show rates would rise based on negative headlines about the higher infection rates the bigger issue kirby added is when will international borders be re opened to arriving foreigners already much of europe is open to arriving u s travelers but the united states borders remain mostly closed to arriving europeans for now but when the biden administration decides to re open up the u s to europeans and eventually others to travel here kirby said he expects to see the same hockey stick jump in demand the hockey stick metaphor suggests a straight almost flat line demand curve on a chart suddenly leaping almost straight up making the graph look like a hockey stick laying on its back edge with the blade pointed up indeed united s management expectation of pre tax profitability over the last half of this year would seem to indicate that it is expecting a significant increase in demand this fall among business travelers who typically buy much higher priced fares thus far the demand recovery has been driven almost entirely by leisure travel demand because leisure travelers typically buy much lower priced fares united s revenue in the second quarter was down a whopping 52 from the same period in 2019 before the pandemic while its capacity was down a little more modest 46 from the second quarter of 2019 second quarter revenue this year totaled only 5 5 billion vs 11 4 billion in 2019 s second quarter during that worst stretch of time for airlines early in the pandemic united took in a relatively paltry 1 5 billion in revenue nocella said that united s current advance bookings for the kind of higher priced fares typically bought by business travel for trips in september after the peak summer leisure travel season ends are down only about 50 from what the were in the same period in 2019 before the pandemic while still weak from an historical perspective that s a huge improvement over what demand for business travel was at the pandemic s peak and up from about 35 of normal only three months ago he added that by the end of third quarter he expects business travel bookings to be down from historic norms by only 40 to 45 showing the continued recovery of demand among business travelers nocella also said that another step increase in business travel demand is likely early next year when corporations switch to their new annual budgets which are expected to include lots more money for travel kirby said that while he expects demand to continue its steady pace recovery over the last half of this year and throughout 2022 full demand recovery is not likely until 2023 in the third quarter united said it expects its domestic capacity to be down about 26 from where it was in the third quarter of 2019 but up about 39 from the second quarter just completed investors had sold off big chunks of airline and cruise line stocks over the last five trading days ended monday in apparent response to the spread of the delta variant investors appear to be assuming that it will drive a reduction in travel demand and a slowing of the travel industry s recovery in fact airline stocks overall have been trending down since at least early april even as travel demand began rising significantly in late march and continued still united like other carriers face continuing challenges one obvious one is the rising price of oil and jet fuel united paid an average price of 1 97 a gallon for yet fuel up a painful 67 from the second quarter of 2020 when it didn t actually fly very much because of the drop in demand caused it to dramatically reduce it flying schedule the company also forecast that it s third quarter average price of fuel will be 2 17 a gallon that would represent a 10 2 further rise in the average price per gallon over what it paid in the second

after two years of what appears to be poor judgment regarding balance sheets executive appointments and questionable accuracy of disclosure we see the judgment shown by the osh board as seriously compromised in the market s eyes mr kavonic told clients ambiguity in the messages put out by oil search over strategy and plans particularly as regards the pikka oil project in alaska have sapped trust in the board said allan gray portfolio manager simon mawhinney every single fork that has come in the road we have travelled down that fork that is not the one the company has convinced investors to expect or flagged mr mawhinney said still adding that santos initial offer looks very cheap he pointed to oil search s original commitment that it would not exercise an option to increase its stake in the alaskan oil project without a simultaneous agreement to sell part of the interest to a third party and an ongoing lack of clarity around the conditions to go forward with a final investment decision on the 4 billion project the abrupt departure of dr wulff as ceo triggered by a board investigation into a whistleblower complaint about his abrasive management style is also weighing on the minds of investors as is the apparent contradiction between mr lee s denial on monday that oil search had received an approach and oil search s belated revelation early tuesday that it had received a merger proposal advertisement there have been a lot of events in the last few months which have rattled confidence a little bit said matt haupt at wilson asset management which owns 65 70 million of oil search shares it s really been an underperformer for a long period of time now given the choice to go down the alaska path and the potential capital needed to progress there and relying on sell downs mr haupt said while oil search clearly wants a revised improved offer from santos to share more of the merger synergies with oil search shareholders it just makes so much sense for these guys to get together blake henricks at firetrail investments which like wilson owns stakes in both companies also called on oil search to have discussions with santos the oil search board should engage and see what can be done to understand the benefits of the offer to oil search shareholders and get the best value mr henricks said that developments this week at oil search had not affected his view of what was an acceptable price but they had reinforced the logic of examining a potential deal advertisement clearly the events in the last couple of days have brought it to a head and now we absolutely have to explore what value is on offer from combining the two entities he said oil search however is sticking firmly to its position that while it sees strategic logic in combining with santos the terms of any merger need to be fair to warrant engagement santos proposed an offer of 0 589 of its shares for each oil search share after santos shares rose 1 2 per cent to 6 57 on wednesday it values oil search shares at about 3 87 each down from 4 25 when the proposal was put by santos chairman keith spence on june 25 oil search shares rose another 3 6 per cent on wednesday to 4 04 signalling some investors are betting on a higher offer the stock is still about half its pre covid 19 levels while santos has recovered much more ground jpmorgan analyst mark busuttil said a fair price for oil search would be up to 0 69 santos shares for each oil search share he put an overweight rating on oil search stock with a price target of 5 60 ubs said santos could increase the offer to 0 6 of its shares for every oil search share before the merger would dilute value for santos shareholders santos existing proposal appears to place close to zero value on oil search s alaskan oil venture said morgan stanley analyst adam martin who calculated oil search s share of the combined company should be closer to 41 per cent than the 37 per cent proposed by santos implying a valuation for oil search of about 4 50 per share multinationals exxonmobil and total the operators of oil search s lng projects in png have long also been seen as potential suitors for oil search while woodside petroleum may revive its takeover interest from 2015 analysts say japanese lng buyers could also be keen to have a look at oil search but the fact that mubadala s recent sale of shares did not go to a strategic buyer suggests limited appetite on this front mr kavonic said

the two american staffordshire terriers penetrated three rings of sturdy 1 2 metre high wire fencing around his alpaca farm in a town in new south wales but he will never forget what the pair of dogs

guy little prince they ran little prince into the dam simon said and started basically tearing him apart the police and a vet were called but there was no saving little prince who had no chance against two powerful dogs that rank the number one breed for dog attacks in nsw little prince s face was mangled beyond recognition unfortunately we had to just euthanise him because there s no way of repairing that simon said as the vet put little prince to sleep the police turned up at the farm and managed to catch one of the dogs which were both owned by one of simon s neighbours neither dog had been registered with the council simon said and only one had been microchipped both failures contravene government laws and responsible dog ownership guidelines meanwhile the other dog fled the scene leaving police in its dust and began making its way towards another paddock of prized alpaca police eventually chased the dog down and caught it before more bloody damage could be inflicted but in the aftermath as simon and his wife began to count heads of alpaca they realised something was wrong we went nope someone is missing simon said triple c the farm s best up and coming stud male was nowhere to be found simon s wife jumped on a four wheeler to scout the property read more pets vulnerable to poisoning as baits laid to control mouse plague then i got a phone call from her saying in tears

of the large 70 kilogram adult male the vet couldn t get a vein on him to be able to euthanase him so i asked the police officer with me to shoot him which he did police then took the dogs to the pound and simon quickly demanded they be put down but they were staggered to learn the council legally couldn t and wouldn t because it was both dogs first reported attack therefore with its hands effectively bound the council would not put the dogs to sleep without the owner s permission the owners were adamant they did not want the dogs destroyed simon said instead with a dangerous order declared on each dog both were released back to the owner i ve never got an apology from anyone in their family they haven t offered to pay their bills or anything simon believed the dogs have since been moved from a rural setting into the suburbs he called the american staffordshire breed ticking time bombs simon blasted nsw laws on dog attacks which he claims are useless to protect victims they want the nsw companion act changed to state that any dog that kills a human or animal should be seized and euthanised without questions for the safety of the community if you think about the power a

phoenix has generally been considered one of the most affordable large metropolitan areas to live in the u s but the landscape is shifting significantly record demand fueled by the large millennial cohort entering prime home buying age in migration patterns from more expensive cities and historically low interest rates are having a serious effect on housing costs in phoenix insatiable home demand that has resulted in falling supply and rising material and labor costs have pushed home prices in the metro phoenix area to new heights home prices in the metro phoenix area have increased dramatically over the past 12 months both new and resale median home prices are approaching 100 000 plus increases during this period of time july new home prices are 25 higher than they were in july of last year while resale home prices are 27 higher over the same period home buyers are still purchasing new and resale homes at record numbers even with the rising costs even as home prices are appreciating at a rapid rate there appears to be ample demand in the marketplace today there has been a slight pullback in demand for new homes over the past 30 days new home sales in the metro phoenix area fell 16 from the previous month though when compared with historical numbers demand is still high while there is demand today every day of rising prices is another day a buyer is priced out of the market which creates cause for concern in the latter half of this year home price appreciation is pushing entry level buyers out of the market a market that is fueled by entry level buyers this is just a yellow flag at this time but there is a high likelihood that demand will soften later this year conversely significant in migration and an expanding local economy suggest there should be optimism moving forward phoenix has ranked in the top 10 for in migration for the past several years and that is unlikely to change in the near term with a limited level of supply new metro phoenix area residents need a place to call home which is favorable for home builders and developers according to june employment data the metro phoenix area unemployment rate sat at 6 and 77 of the jobs lost in the covid 19 recession have been recovered on a national level unemployment in june sat at 5 9 while 66 of jobs have been recovered suggesting phoenix is recovering better than the nation as a whole
briefs mark the latest milestone toward building lake erie s first offshore energy a resource that might someday supply up to a fifth of ohio s electricity lake erie seen from cleveland ohio credit tim evanson creative commons briefs mark the latest milestone toward building lake erie s first offshore energy a resource that might someday supply up to a fifth of ohio s electricity a legal challenge by two lakeview condo dwellers seeking to block lake erie s first offshore wind farm faces a high legal bar before the ohio supreme court with equally high stakes for clean energy in the region the icebreaker windpower project s six turbines would sit roughly 8 to 10 miles northwest of cleveland and produce roughly 20 7 megawatts of electricity per year the lake erie energy development corporation or leedco has worked on the project for more than a decade the ohio power siting board approved the project in october putting it on track to become not just the first offshore wind project in ohio but also the first freshwater offshore wind project in north america the developer has achieved several regulatory wins including the removal of a poison pill from an earlier version of the siting board s approval which would have mandated nightly shutdowns of the turbines for eight months of the year there was no evidence that the shutdowns would have been necessary to protect wildlife leedco and others asked the board to reconsider that proviso a bipartisan group of 32 lawmakers also wrote to then board chair sam randazzo detailing why the nightly shutdown condition was unlawful the board issued its revised order on oct 8 2020 randazzo a longtime foe of renewable energy had initially favored the shutdown requirement he resigned the next month in the wake of the house bill 6 conspiracy scandal in the end the ohio power siting board thoroughly considered the abundant evidence in the record including testimony from eight days of evidentiary hearings as well as findings in a revised stipulation lawyers for the board wrote in their brief that stipulation represents a fully negotiated agreement containing numerous protective conditions benefits the public interest and comports with all applicable regulatory principles and practices they added high bar the project s primary resistance now comes from two intervenors in bratenahl ohio a suburb east of cleveland with median annual earnings above 80 000 according to u s census data w susan dempsey watches birds and sunsets from her balcony and robert maloney enjoys birding and regularly takes his boat out to fish on lake erie their lawyers wrote in 2018 their case challenging the siting board s decision now before the state s top court faces a much narrower path than it had before the board the ohio supreme court won t overturn the ohio power siting board s ruling unless it was unlawful or unreasonable generally speaking the court is supposed to affirm the ohio power siting board as long as it correctly applied the law to the facts before it and the board s factual findings depend in large part on its technical expertise so the court won t disturb those findings unless they are manifestly against the weight of the evidence or so clearly unsupported as to show misapprehension mistake or a willful disregard of duty the state s brief noted the court gives deference to the technical opinions of the agencies said dave karpinski who heads up leedco in his view there are really no new arguments in their appeal which haven t already been considered and rejected by the board because icebreaker wind is the first ever offshore wind project proposed in ohio it is one of the most thoroughly reviewed projects ever to be approved in the state having been comprehensively studied and analyzed at length said miranda leppla vice president of energy policy for the ohio environmental council attorneys john stock and mark tucker represent dempsey and maloney neither stock nor tucker responded to a request for comment for this article the lawyers 2017 engagement letter with maloney indicates that the legal fees were being paid by murray energy corporation the company began bankruptcy proceedings in late 2019 but nonetheless made payments to the lawyers firm that year and while the bankruptcy was pending dave anderson at the energy and policy institute has reported murray energy has not paid the bratenahl residents fees for quite some time and yet the bratenahl residents continue their vehement opposition to this misguided project said a footnote in stock and tucker s june 17 reply brief left unsaid was whether dempsey and maloney have since paid any legal fees out of pocket or whether fees have been paid by american consolidated natural resources inc that company is murray energy s successor after its emergence from bankruptcy in september 2020 media personnel for american consolidated natural resources inc likewise have not responded to questions about legal fees in the case high stakes the stakes go far beyond the icebreaker windpower project because the work could help prove the viability of offshore wind in the great lakes the fact that it s been done off the east coast is good but it doesn t really pave the way for the great lakes because there are so many differences karpinski said among other things fresh water freezes before ocean water does because of that the turbines will need to deal with surface ice the maximum winter ice cover forecast for lake erie is 67 the highest for the great lakes according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration so turbines ability to deal with ice there should bode well for other great lakes projects the great lakes wind energy potential could be huge according to a march 2021 report from environment america and frontier group calculations show that the lakes could supply up to roughly one fifth of combined electricity needs projected by 2050 for ohio michigan wisconsin minnesota illinois indiana and pennsylvania among those states michigan wisconsin and ohio have the greatest potential up to 72 27 and 19 of their projected 2050 needs a demonstration project in the great lakes would be an important step toward reaching our offshore wind potential said bronte payne go solar campaign director for environment america for too long offshore wind has been an untapped tool poised to deliver large amounts of renewable electricity she said right now the great lakes region is experiencing the effects of climate change with both warmer weather and increased flooding bronte continued this makes it even more important that we are using all of the tools in our toolbox to repower our communities with 100 renewable energy offshore wind is a part of that leppla said the project has taken on additional significance as the state legislature has made it more difficult to site renewable projects ohio should be leaning into the clean energy future and all of the benefits that come with it from environmental benefits to economic development and job creation next steps briefing in the ohio supreme court case wrapped up last month oral argument will likely take place within the next two to four months a decision in the case will probably follow by sometime in 2022 however there s no statutory timeline for the court to act that s really just put things in a holding pattern karpinski said if the court upholds the power siting board leedco will still need time to mobilize and line up contractors karpinski said we ve got to restart it you re not just picking up where you left off as and when that does happen leedco also will need to comply with various permit conditions incorporated into the ohio power siting board s october 2020 order including pre construction testing to show that any avian collisions will be reliably detected pre construction requirements are not unusual all permits have conditions karpinski said there s so much compliance not only during construction but for the life of the project that we have to satisfy for the time being leedco will wait for the ohio supreme court s ruling right now we want to make sure we have permanent certainty before we do anything karpinski said
