hannibal barca was a carthaginian general who lived between the 3rd and 2nd centuries bc he is perhaps best remembered for his military campaign against the romans in the second punic war thanks to hannibal s capable leadership the carthaginians won several significant victories against the romans and succeeded in seizing parts of southern italy the carthaginians however were unable to score a decisive victory against the romans moreover the romans changed their strategy in dealing with hannibal and eventually launched a counter attack against carthage which led to their victory after the war hannibal remained an important leader in carthage but was later forced into exile by his enemies he found refuge amongst rome s enemies in the east though the romans ultimately caught up with him instead of allowing himself to be taken to rome as a prisoner hannibal committed suicide before he could be captured hannibal and hamilcar hannibal was born in 247 bc in north africa his name which is hanba al in his native punic means mercy of ba al ba al being a major punic deity hannibal was the eldest son of hamilcar barca a carthaginian general carthaginian coin likely depicting hamilcar on its reverse is a war elephant unknown author public domain at the time of hannibal s birth carthage was at war with the roman republic this war the first punic war ended with the defeat of carthage in 241 bc hamilcar however never stopped seeing the romans as his enemies and launched a campaign to conquer the iberian peninsula according to the greek historian polybius whose histories is a main source of information on hannibal s life although not a direct attack on rome this campaign was aimed at obtaining the resources needed to wage another war against the roman republic the roman historian livy s history of rome another important work containing material on hannibal s life relates a story about the carthaginian general as a young boy according to this story whilst hamilcar was offering sacrifices at the altar before embarking on his campaign hannibal who was nine years old at the time pestered his father to take him along to iberia therefore hamilcar took his son to the altar placed the boy s hand on the sacrificial victim and told him to swear that as soon as he possibly could he would show himself the enemy of rome hannibal did so and left with his father for iberia in the nine years that followed hamilcar conducted a successful campaign in iberia which allowed carthage to rebuild itself into a formidable power in the western mediterranean once again hamilcar was unable to fulfil his goal of waging a new war against rome as he died in 229 bc whilst he was still on campaign in iberia hamilcar s death however did not mean that the carthaginian threat to rome had disappeared as the war that he so desired would be eventually be waged by his son nevertheless with the benefit of hindsight livy could point out that hamilcar s untimely death in addition to the fact that hannibal was still young at the time caused the war to be delayed following hamilcar s death the supreme command of the army and carthage s campaign passed into the hands of his son in law and hannibal s brother in law hasdrubal the fair hasdrubal the diplomat unlike hamilcar and hannibal hasdrubal conducted the campaign in iberia in quite a different manner instead of using military might to subdue the enemies of carthage hasdrubal opted for diplomacy according to livy trusting to policy rather than to arms he did more to extend the empire of carthage by forming connections with the petty chieftains and winning over new tribes by making friends of their leading men than by force of arms or by war hannibal barca youssefbensaad cc by sa 4 0 thanks to hasdrubal s diplomacy carthage was able to extend its control and influence into iberia peacefully in addition hasdrubal succeeded in negotiating a treaty with rome under which the river ebro was to form the boundary between carthage and rome in iberia additionally according to the treaty saguntum which lay in between the territory of the romans and carthaginians was to be a free city as livy notes however peace brought him no security and eventually hasdrubal was assassinated in 221 bc livy s account of hasdrubal s murder is as follows a barbarian whose master he had put to death murdered him in broad daylight and when seized by the bystanders he looked as happy as though he had escaped even when put to the torture his delight at the success of his attempt mastered his pain and his face wore a smiling expression incidentally polybius paints quite different portrait of hasdrubal based on the account of a roman storyteller by the name of fabius according to fabius hasdrubal was an ambitious man and had a lust for power having secured his position in iberia hasdrubal returned to carthage with the intention of abolishing its constitution and establishing a monarchy the nobles however learned of hasdrubal s plans and successfully opposed him therefore hasdrubal returned to iberia and continued to rule the conquered territories without bothering too much about the politics back in carthage hannibal 247 181 bc portrait on tunisia 5 dinars 2013 banknote source vkilikov adobe stock hannibal rising in either case it was during hasdrubal s governorship in iberia that hannibal was made an officer in the carthaginian army after hasdrubal s assassination hannibal who was 26 years old at the time was chosen by the carthaginian armies in iberia to be their supreme commander although hannibal was now in a position where he could fulfil his oath to wage war against rome he knew that he needed to first consolidate carthage s position in iberia which his predecessors had been doing like hasdrubal hannibal employed diplomacy and strengthened relations with the iberians by marrying imilce a native princess at the same time hannibal combined this diplomacy with the methods used by his father and used military force to subdue other iberian tribes in 219 bc two years after coming to power hannibal was ready to take on the roman republic hannibal s first attack however was not on the romans themselves but on the free city of saguntum the siege lasted eight months during which hannibal was wounded saguntum diego delso cc by sa 4 0 the romans who counted saguntum as an ally regarded the carthaginian attack on the independent city as an act of war they did not however provide military aid to the besieged city instead the romans send envoys to carthage to protest hannibal s action when the city fell after eight months the roman envoys demanded hannibal s surrender the second punic war when their demands were not met rome declared war on carthage thus the second punic war began in 218 bc since on the carthaginian side the war was conducted primarily by hannibal the second punic war is sometimes referred to as the hannibalic war hannibal s next move was to bring the war to the romans by directly invading italy having left his brother another hasdrubal in charge of the defence of north africa and iberia hannibal assembled an army for the invasion of italy according to polybius this army consisted of about 90 000 infantry 12 000 cavalry and 37 elephants since the romans held control of the sea hannibal opted for a land invasion of italy this meant that the carthaginian army had to cross overland about 1 600 km 1000 miles to get from iberia to italy in their way stood three formidable natural obstacles the pyrenees the rhone river and the alps the last of these was the greatest and hannibal s crossing of the alps is remembered as one of the most celebrated military feats of the ancient world conquering the alps first of all crossing the alps with an army was very difficult due to the harsh conditions on the mountains this however was not the only challenge faced by hannibal as they also had to deal with hostile enemies according to polybius whilst hannibal and his army were traversing across the plains between the rhone river and the alps a tribe known as the allobroges who inhabited that area initially left them alone when hannibal began to ascent the alps however they assembled an army and occupied strategic positions on the route that the carthaginians had to march through during their ascent crossing the alps massimo todaro adobe stock the allobroges intended to ambush hannibal and destroy his army in the alps fortunately for the carthaginians they were forewarned of the allobroges s plan consequently although the allobroges inflicted heavy damage on the carthaginians they received more casualties themselves polybius notes that the entire march took five months 15 days of which were spent crossing the alps the historian also reports that by the time hannibal had crossed the alps his army was reduced to about 20 000 infantry and less than 6 000 cavalry even though hannibal had lost many men he was still able to descend into northern italy and defeat the roman force waiting for him on the plain to the west of the river ticinus in december 218 bc about a month later the carthaginians again defeated the roman army which met him on the west bank of the trebia river the battle of the trebia is considered as the first major battle of the second punic war and was a grave defeat for the romans hannibal s victory at this battle convinced the local tribes of gauls to join the carthaginians in their war against rome hannibal s elephants erica guilane nachez adobe stock the march on rome hannibal continued his march southwards and scored another victory at the battle of lake trasimene in june 217 bc following this victory however hannibal did not immediately march on rome either because he felt that his troops were too exhausted or that rome s fortifications were too strong moreover hannibal was hoping that rome s italic allies would defect to his side therefore in the summer of 217 hannibal rested in picenum restricting his campaigns to local attacks against apulia and campania but the romans did not wait idly quintus fabius maximus verrucosus was elected dictator after their defeat at the battle of lake trasimene the dictator avoided pitched battles but harassed the carthaginians continuously with the aim of wearing them down this is now known as the fabian strategy and earned fabius the nickname initially as an insult cunctator which translates as delayer in the summer of 216 bc hannibal marched south again and dealt an extremely costly defeat to the romans at the battle of cannae as well as leaving the forces of rome shattered this allowed hannibal to gain a foothold in southern italy and caused many of rome s italian allies to go over to the carthaginians once again however rather than seizing the opportunity to march on rome hannibal spent the winter of 216 5 bc in capua one of rome s former allies that defected to the carthaginians the battle of cannae the romans are drawn into the center and destroyed united states military academy public domain this delay proved costly in the next few years the carthaginians suffered severe hardships amongst other things the carthaginians were unable to score a decisive victory as the romans avoided pitched battles at all cost hannibal s numerical inferiority also made it difficult to for him to spread his forces across the peninsula and to hold the territorial gains made by the carthaginians hannibal s army was also slowly eroding due to the death of his men as well as the desertion of his gallic allies and reinforcements from carthage did not materialize the roman counterattack whilst hannibal s army was being worn down in italy the romans launched an attack on iberia and succeeded in expelling the carthaginians from the peninsula the leader of this campaign publius cornelius scipio then invaded north africa which caused the carthaginians to recall hannibal from italy in 203 bc the following year in 202 bc hannibal faced scipio s army at the battle of zama in north africa and was defeated by the roman armies carthage sued for peace and the second punic war came to an end in the following year in honor of his victory at zama scipio was awarded the title africanus scipio africanus massimo finizio cc by sa 2 0 hannibal after the war in spite of the threat that hannibal had presented to rome he was not punished by the romans after his defeat and was allowed to continue serving as a leader in carthage moreover scipio africanus who had defeated hannibal at zama supported his leadership hannibal however is said to have offended certain parts of the nobility as he opposed their corrupt practices consequently he was accused of inciting antiochus iii the ruler of the seleucid empire in the eastern mediterranean to wage war on rome whilst some have questioned the soundness of this accusation others have argued that hannibal was hoping to start another war against rome in any case hannibal fled to the seleucid court following antiochus defeat by the romans however the victors demanded the surrender of hannibal therefore the former carthaginian general fled further and eventually ended up at the court of prusias the ruler of bithynia on the black sea eventually the romans whose influenced had increased greatly in the east demanded that prusias surrender his carthaginian guest hannibal realizing that the bithynians were about to betray him committed suicide by consuming poison hannibal probably died in 183 bc hannibal was the greatest obstacle to rome s domination of the mediterranean world following hannibal s death there was no serious challenge to roman supremacy for centuries hannibal s invasion of italy especially his crossing of the alps is a feat that is as incredible today as it was when it happened hannibal himself continued to strike fear into the hearts of the citizens of ancient rome long after his death the latter captured perfectly in the latin phrase used to describe a crisis hannibal ad portas or hannibal at the gates top image hannibal and his war elephants source lunstream adobe stock by wu mingren

for the first 12 weeks melbourne has recorded no new local covid cases overnight and just one new case in hotel quarantine acting premier james merlino said it is good news and news i know everyone in victoria wanted to hear but he warned that while it was a terrific outcome it was nowhere near over victorians have done an awesome effort in getting tested getting vaccinated following the rules we are not out of the woods yet today having zero cases is a great reflection of the work of all victorians there is a total of 75 active cases in the community and 17 604 tests were processed on thursday mr merlino urged those in craigieburn to get tested as he said testing numbers were lower than expected in some areas we would like to see an uplift because of community transmission it was lower than we would have liked in some parts of melbourne i am asking victorians that if you live in the craigieburn area and did not get tested yesterday please go out and get tested today he said acting premier james merlino says victorians are not out of the woods yet picture david crosling chief health officer brett sutton also urged victorians to keep testing efforts up the week ahead probably won t be all zero cases we have thousands of primary close contacts some of which will become positive it is not a concern as they all quarantined for the entire period it has only been 48 hours since we had cases of uncertain acquisition the genomic sequence from the four mystery cases in the same reservoir household has indicated they re carrying the kappa strain of virus prof sutton said that finding was consistent with the existing city of whittlesea outbreak the dhhs is still searching for the source of exposure for the two queensland cases in melbourne they have gone through a long interview process with us prof sutton said we thank them for that it is a tiring process lots of detail around where they have been we have been looking quite a bit earlier than june for that acquisition where they may have picked it up whether or not they were infectious through that he said mr merlino said a number of exposure sites would come up as a result of the couple who had

place prof sutton said the state would not ease restrictions sooner than planned given the kappa variant link with the reservoir household he said he wasn t suprised by friday s zero cases obviously primary close contacts isolating at home has helped to control this he said although tracing work has helped to control this and all the great testing that has been done has allowed us to find cases and then control them so we are going to get days of zero i expect they will be more and i also expect there will be days when we have new cases each day it isn t over yet we are on the right track as the city s restrictions eased on monday prof sutton said he had never backed lockdowns as the first measure to tackle an outbreak they will never be the first measure they will be a measure that we implement when we have to do and only when we have to do there are so many sad stories and struggles that people are reporting on my heart goes out to them i cannot fathom what it has meant across victoria throughout lockdown and through all of the circuit breakers and lockdowns across australia we are doing this with the minimum restrictions that keep us safe the alternative with this running away is too awful to imagine in some respects however he said mystery cases would trigger tighter restrictions but couldn t say whether the emergence of more mystery cases would lead to another lockdown of course mystery cases where there are concerns about high risk settings would be of concern there will be mystery cases where people have had very little interaction or there is a significant suggestion where they may have picked it up geographically or otherwise there is no one size fits all each on its own merits chief health officer brett sutton says mystery cases will

coronavirus had not been transmitted outside in any recent outbreak it comes as authorities scramble to work out how a family of four mysteriously caught the virus a woman in her 70s and three men in

cautious easing of melbourne s restrictions allowing schools to reopen restaurants to have 100 patrons only 50 indoors and travel up to 25km could go ahead we are moving ahead but we are on high alert acting premier james merlino said questions have been raised as to the effectiveness of wearing masks outdoors after both professor cheng and covid 19 commander jeroen weimar confirmed no cases in the current cluster or recent outbreaks had been acquired while outside we have no evidence that we ve seen yet in this particular outbreak or the most recent ones we ve dealt with of outdoor transmission mr weimar admitted on thursday professor cheng said there was pretty good evidence around masks reducing transmission and that cases where the virus was passed outdoors in the second wave might have gone unnoticed when asked about reports that transmission was 20 times less likely to happen outdoors prof cheng said that doesn t mean zero there is still a risk infectious diseases expert prof peter collignon said little to no transmission occurred outdoors unless in crowded situations where people gathered for prolonged periods unless you ve got uncontrollable spread like in the uk or europe i can t really see it ll provide much benefit to wear masks outdoors prof collignon said there can t be much community transmission in melbourne right now if any mr merlino said the continued wearing of

moving their for work the couple both in their 40s left melbourne on june 1 and travelled through nsw before arriving on the sunshine coast on june 5 they first became symptomatic on june 3 but victorian contact tracers have little information on the case given they are now in the hands of queensland authorities prof cheng flagged the new cases could stall the planned easing of restrictions in greater melbourne from thursday june 17 we may need to hold on the current settings for a little longer prof cheng said more exposure sites added a mcdonald s drive through multiple coles supermarkets and a woolworths are among the latest additions to victoria s long list of covid 19 exposure sites the state s health department made eight additions to the alerts list of venues visited by a confirmed case of covid 19 on thursday as melbourne s tough lockdown was lifted all of the new venues were listed as tier 2 exposure sites meaning people who visited during the times listed need

by frank shostak via mises the increase in the growth rate of the consumer price index cpi has fueled concerns that if the rising trend were to continue the fed is likely to tighten its interest rate stance observe that the yearly growth rate in the cpi climbed to 4 2 percent in april from 2 6 percent in march and 0 3 percent in april 2020 note that the yearly growth rate of money supply climbed to 79 percent in february from 6 5 percent in february 2020 various increases in the prices of goods are just the manifestation of increases in money supply once money enters a particular market this means that more money is paid for a product in that market alternatively we can say that the price of a good in this market has gone up note that a price is the number of dollars per unit of something hence an increase in money supply all other things being equal implies that a greater amount of money is going to enter into various markets this means that the prices of goods will follow suit also note that when money is injected it enters a particular market once the price of a good is rising to the level that is perceived as fully valued then the money leaves to another market which is considered as undervalued the shift from one market to another market gives rise to a time lag from increases in money and its effect on the average price increases because of the time lag the manifestation of the current strong increases in money supply in terms of the prices of goods is likely to become visible in the months ahead on account of the likely uptrend in the growth rate of the prices of goods in the months ahead we hold that the economic bust is going to emerge regardless of whether the fed is going to tighten its interest rate stance or not here is why money supply and liquidity in a market economy a major service that money provides is that of the medium of exchange producers exchange their goods for money and then exchange money for other goods as the production of goods increases this results in a greater demand for money conversely as economic activity slows down the demand for money follows suit the demand for money is also affected by changes in prices an increase in the prices of goods and assets leads to an increase in the demand for money people now demand more money to facilitate goods and assets that are more expensive a fall in the prices of goods and assets results in a decline in the demand for money according to mises the services money renders are conditioned by the height of its purchasing power nobody wants to have in his cash holding a definite number of pieces of money or a definite weight of money he wants to keep a cash holding of a definite amount of purchasing power 1 changes in the supply of money and liquidity consider an increase in the supply of money for a given state of economic activity since we did not have here a change in the demand for money this means that people now have a surplus of money no individual wants to hold more money than is required an individual can get rid of surplus money by exchanging the money for goods and assets individuals as a group however cannot dispose of the surplus of money just like that they can only shift money from one individual to another individual 2 the mechanism that generates the reduction of the surplus of money is the increase in the prices of goods and assets once individuals start to employ the surplus of money in acquiring goods and assets this pushes goods and asset prices higher as a result the demand for money increases all this in turn works towards the decline in the monetary surplus whilst increases in the money supply for a given level of economic activity results in a monetary surplus a fall in the money supply for a given level of economic activity leads to a monetary deficit individuals still demand the same amount of money to accommodate this they will start selling goods and assets for money thus pushing goods and asset prices lower at lower prices the demand for money declines and this in turn works towards the elimination of the monetary deficit when changes in liquidity occur due to factors other than changes in the money supply a monetary surplus or a deficit can also emerge in response to changes in economic activity and changes in prices we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us for instance an increase in liquidity can emerge for a decline in economic activity whilst the stock of money and the prices of goods and assets remain unchanged a decline in economic activity results in a fewer goods produced this means that less goods are going to be exchanged implying a decline in the demand for money conversely an increase in economic activity whilst the stock of money and the prices of goods and assets stay unchanged produces a monetary deficit if an increase in the prices of goods and assets all other things being equal takes place this triggers an increase in the demand for money this puts downward pressure on liquidity to restore the balance individuals are likely to start selling goods and assets in order to accommodate the increase in the demand for money conversely a decline in the prices of goods and assets triggers a decline in the demand for money and within all other things being equal to the increase in liquidity note that changes in real economic activity and changes in prices are factors that affecting the demand for money hence we can suggest that changes in liquidity are driven by changes in the supply of money minus changes in the demand for money consequently changes in liquidity are defined as change in liquidity change in money supply change in real economic activity percent change in prices we can thus establish that changes in monetary liquidity are the outcome of the interplay between the supply and the demand for money easy monetary policy sets the stage for an economic bust again the yearly growth rate of the us money supply as depicted by our ams austrian money supply metric stood at 79 percent in february this year against 6 5 percent in february 2020 this massive increase has likely severely undermined the pool of real savings and set the platform for large increases in the prices of goods and assets we suggest that within all other things being equal a rising momentum of prices is going to increase the demand for money thereby weakening the excess money growth i e the monetary liquidity this is likely to result in the selling of goods and assets and to the decline in the growth momentum of prices consequently within all other things being equal nominal economic activity in terms of gdp is likely to come under downward pressure we suggest that a weakening in the pool of real savings due to very loose monetary and fiscal policies is going to exert a further downward pressure on the growth rate of gdp note that the likely economic slump is because of the increase in the prices of goods and assets coupled with the weakening in the pool of real savings the increase in prices is expected to weaken the monetary liquidity thereby setting in motion the selling of goods and assets thus depressing the goods and asset prices momentum observe that the trigger to all this is past strong increases in money supply if the fed were to embark on aggressive monetary pumping to counter economic recession this is going to dilute further the pool of real savings and make things much worse note that the economic slump is likely to emerge regardless of whether the fed is going to tighten its interest rate stance or not the key cause for this is the increase in the growth momentum of goods and asset prices because of past strong monetary growth hence we could end up in an economic slump as a result of the past strong monetary growth the economic slump is likely to emerge regardless of whether the fed is going to tighten its monetary stance or not the severity of the

james emejo assesses the effectiveness of monetary policy measures in enhancing output growth and recovery of the nigerian economy amidst the adverse impact of the covid 19 pandemic as well as summarises the outcome of the recent mpc meeting the nigerian economy posted a positive gdp growth in the first quarter of the year further cementing its performance in the fourth quarter of the preceding year which had help to exit the second consecutive recession in recent times not many believed that the economy actually exited recession in q4 2020 due to some theoretical misunderstanding on what should constitute an exit from recession while some analysts believed that if it took two consecutive quarters of negative growth to fall into recession it also required two consecutive quarters of positive performance to exit the downturn however another school of thought had argued that it requires only a quarter of positive growth to exit a recession and this argument appeared to align with the books nevertheless the q1 2021 gdp performance of 0 51 per cent and 0 11 per cent in the preceding quarter had finally settled the dusts as everyone now agrees that the nigerian economy has effectively exited recession though still fragile nonetheless a post recession has considered the role of the monetary authority in stimulating growth as well as pulling the economy of the woods many believed the central bank of nigeria cbn played a dominant role and deserved credit for the resuscitation of the economy following the bank s historic and aggressive interventions in critical sectors of the economy particularly agriculture and health among others analysts also agreed that the apex bank had effectively deployed its monetary and developmental intervention tools to weather the storm the cbn s covid 19 targeted credit facility for households and small businesses for example through which about n300 billion had so far been disbursed had been a major relief for beneficiaries and had been able to provide some level of stability to nigerians apart from other regulatory forbearances in the financial sector which was initiated by the cbn with severe inflationary pressures amidst declining productivity and volatility in oil price the cbn has had to fall back on the use of development finance tools to stabilise price and achieve other macroeconomic objectives which had kept the country afloat also confronted with daunting macroeconomic challenges the mpc which appeared less swayed by the dangers of posed by inflation which is far above the monetary policy rate mpr rather than tighten policy instruments at its recent meeting decided to retain interest rate at 11 5 per cent providing insights on the committee s resolutions as well as appraisal of the apex bank s contribution to output growth cbn governor mr godwin emefiele said i think it s important to say that for us at the cbn we are not surprised we are not surprised because if you recall nigeria is just one country that is peculiar for what i call a situation that is out of the ordinary because you find nigeria among several countries being one country that is challenged by stagflation according to him stagflation is a situation where inflation is running high prices are being high and at the same time output growth in this case the gdp is contracting and if you understand how this works you will find that as monetary policy committee your core responsibility is to rein in inflation by ensuring that you keep supreme your price and monetary stability mandate and to do so means that you have to tighten to be able to rein in inflation on the other hand the economy is confronted by a contracting output where growth is negative and the normal way in economics you would want to really recover from a contracting economy is to stimulate the economy with a lot of easing and injecting liquidity into the system to stimulate consumption and investments increase government expenditure increase export earnings and possibly see what you can do to reduce your imports that is basically the definition of output growth he said but what did we do at the monetary policy particularly at the last meeting we said we would try as much as possible to be pro growth so as to continue to see what can be done to accelerate output but at the same time put an eye to whatever can be done to rein in inflation and in doing this what did they say at the last meeting mpc said we are going to adopt a series of systematic synchronisation of monetary policy variables that will help to rein in inflation and at the same time boost output mpc also encouraged the management to adopt some form of administrative measures to mop up liquidity or to control money supply in the system and in the process rein in inflation by reducing money supply that would help to control inflation while at the same time because what you would find when you rein in inflation by mopping liqudity is that it becomes constraining but at the same time on the output side and what should we be doing let us use our development finance tools to boost output by ensuring that liquidity and funding is made available at concessionary rates to employment generating and output stimulating sectors of the economy it is not surprising that we are seeing what we are seeing now what monetary policy decided we should be doing today is how do we proceed what are those indicators that led to us having these kinds of results and that was why mpc said let s hold look at those items for inflation continue your administrative measures on the output side continue to use your interventions at subsidised interest rates to agriculture manufacturing to targeted credit facilities make sure we are able to stimulate consumption and investment that will ultimately yield results and growth for the economy he said indeed out of the targeted credit facility we have almost the whole of n300 billion has now been disbursed and monetary policy committee has encouraged the management to increase it even to n400 billion so what does that also mean more money is going to be made available to households to small businesses for them to go back to business which will ultimately yield employment and also grow our economy so for us it is not science when people begin to say they doubt all the numbers the national bureau of statistics nbs is releasing i think they are speaking from a position of being uninformed about what is happening in the nigerian economy retains monetary parameters however the cbn had resolved to retain monetary policy rate mpr otherwise known as interest rate at 11 5 per cent the mpc also voted to maintain the asymmetric corridor of 100 700 basis points around the mpr and left the cash reserve ratio at 27 5 per cent and liquidity ratio at 30 per cent the mpr is the rate at which the cbn lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy in arriving at a decision to hold the rates the cbn governor said whereas the committee remained overwhelmingly committed to supporting the efforts of the federal government in ensuring full restoration of the productive capacity of the economy members remained much more focused towards achieving price stability in the short to medium term he pointed out that economic growth could be hampered in an environment of unstable prices adding therefore that the choice was between loosening the stance of policy to ease credit further or tighten to moderate price development or maintain a hold stance in order to allow previous policy measures continue to permeate the economy while observing global and domestic developments emefiele argued that an expansionary stance of policy could transmit to reduce pricing of the loan portfolios of deposit money banks and result therefore in cheaper credit to the real sector of the economy he added however that this expected transmission might be constrained by persisting security challenges and infrastructural deficits on the other hand while a contractionary stance will only address the monetary component of price development supply side constraints such as the security crisis and infrastructural deficits can only be addressed by policies outside the purview of the central bank a tight stance in the view of members will also hamper the bank s objectives of providing low cost credit to households micro small and medium enterprises msmes agriculture and other output growth and employment stimulating sectors of the economy he said recommendations to fiscal authority however the cbn while commending government s efforts in combating the headwinds imposed by the pandemic urged the latter to avoid an entire nationwide lockdown as was experienced in 2020 adding that this will reverse the wholesome gains jointly achieved between the government and the apex bank in response to the outbreak of covid 19 he said the mpc carefully assessed the options on direction of policy in the short to medium term and re appraised current measures by the government to purchase covid 19 vaccines and the general preparedness of relevant public health agencies to guard against the spread of the mutating strains of the virus to this end the cbn governor said the committee noted the appropriate steps taken by the government to ensure that up to 70 per cent of the populace get vaccinated to drastically drive down the infection rate in the country and hence sustain economic activities he said the committee noted the persisting security crisis especially in major food producing regions of the country and the severe toll on food supply and prices it noted that inflation had moderated marginally due to the unrelenting effort of the bank in supporting agriculture to boost food supply and prices the committee thus re iterated its call to the government to intensify effort towards addressing the security situation in the country to ease supply bottlenecks and bring down food prices the mpc further noted government s commitment towards investing in public infrastructure despite constrained fiscal position and urged a continued focus on this objective while exploring the option of effective partnership with the private sector as improved road networks telecommunications and power supply will greatly and proactively impact the supply chain and moderate price increments emefiele also stressed the need for collaboration with nigeria s huge diaspora through the issuance of diaspora bonds targeted at specific infrastructure projects this is even as the committee noted that the public debt stock was currently high it was of the view that project specific diaspora bond issues could conveniently pay itself back without imposing a burden on government finances the committee also noted the complementary role this would play in boosting foreign exchange supply accretion to reserves and easing of the current exchange rate pressure analysts appraise policy initiatives however analysts in separate interviews with thisday expressed their opinions on the cbn s execution of its primary mandate of price stability and fighting inflation particularly in the current situation where the bank had retained monetary policy tools an economist dr muhammad rislanuddeen said the position taken by the mpc was the best option in the circumstance given the fragility of the reported gdp growth maintaining status quo is the best option as reduction in mpr will be a disincentive to critical investment needed to consolidate on the gdp growth also increase in mpr perhaps to support more foreign direct investment will simply be inflationary and further worsen both the already high inflation and unemployment situation and also impact negatively on the sluggish gdp growth managing director chief executive dignity finance and investment limited dr chijioke ekechukwu also aligned with the policy direction of the apex bank he said cbn was right to retain mpr at 11 5 per cent though far lower than inflation rate the reason for retaining rates could not be far from maintaining stability already achieved in interest rates exchange rates and other monetary policy indicators increasing mpr would lead to increase in interest rates and increase in inflation rate reducing mpr would lead to increase in money in circulation and increased pressure on fx demand so retaining mpr was the proper thing to do on his part managing director chief executive credent investment managers limited mr ibrahim shelleng was of the view that the challenges faced by economy continue to be structural pointing out that the central bank had limited influence in intervening in that aspect he said insecurity lack of power and generally poor infrastructure were still the major issues affecting the economy stressing that these have to be tackled on the fiscal side shelleng said the apex bank has maintained its stance of not wanting to rock the boat amidst multiple fiscal challenges with the country seemingly out of recession according to recent gdp figures it has justified the central bank s hawkish stance whilst maintaining a double digit mpr amidst a low growth environment may be considered detrimental the peculiar nature of the inflationary drivers in the country may have justified the cbns decision to hold cost push factors have been mainly caused by structural fiscal challenges and as such have been out of the purview of monetary policy given the illiquidity of fx it has also been vital for the apex bank to maintain attractive rates to continue to lure portfolio investors in his contribution chairman chartered institute of bankers of nigeria cibn abuja branch prof uche uwaleke further backed the resolution of the cbn to leave policy rates unchanged he said i think a hold position was the most expedient decision to take given the prevailing economic condition of the country as long as stagflation continues to challenge the economy the cbn s monetary policy stance will be dictated by the need to strike a balance between tackling inflation and supporting economic growth against the backdrop of elevated inflation a reduction in mpr or other policy parameters though persuasive will only serve to worsen forex pressure despite recent attempt to unify exchange rates and exacerbate inflationary trend he said on the other hand given weak economic growth and the need to support an economy still reeling from the impact of covid 19 pandemic tightening monetary policy via increase in mpr is capable of rolling back the modest progress being made it s instructive to note that the non oil sector gdp actually tanked during the first quarter of 2021 so maintaining the status quo while strengthening the cbn s intervention initiatives in critical sectors of the economy is a wise decision however managing director chief executive sd d capital management limited mr idakolo gbolade said the cbn has taken the cautious stand again by retaining the mpr at 11 5 per cent he said these measures have increased inflation in the past and the various cbn interventions have still not yielded positive results to turn around the economy to increase productivity in the economy there should be the loosening of policy stance of mpr to allow more access to capital by key sectors of the economy if we want continuous improvement in the gdp and be on the road to substantial recovery of the economy the mpr policy stand has made the naira to witness continuous devaluation month on month the cbn has not been able to generate enough forex to service demands by forex users thereby hampering productivity olive branch for bandits yet another major highlights of the mpc engagement was emefiele s plea to bandits terrorising the country and others involved in unlawful activities to drop their arms and embrace the central bank s anchor borrowers programme abp according to emefiele his appeal to criminals to embrace family is because there is a linkage between security and economic growth responding to a question he said if you want an economy to grow the level of insecurity must be low because if there is a high level of insecurity like what we see today the economy will suffer he added that security agencies were doing their best to tackle insecurity efforts are now targeted at the south eastern and north eastern parts of the country about three years ago the federal government and the united states signed a pact that resulted in a government to government acquisition of military equipment out of which we are expecting 12 fighter planes that would help us solve our insecurity i am aware that six of them are coming to the country in the month of july and august i therefore would like to appeal to our brothers who decide that they want to live in bushes and forests that they should please begin to retreat drop their arms and come and embrace the anchor borrowers programme if they do so it will help them if they choose not to do so they will be confronted by the security as this battle continues i am optimistic before the end of the year that the security challenges confronting the country will substantially abate cryptocurrency crash victory for cbn on whether the cbn had been vindicated following the crash of cryptocurrency market after the apex bank had opposed its operations in the country emefiele said it was not about cbn being vindicated adding the cbn investigated and found out that a substantial percentage of nigerians are involved in cryptocurrency which is not the best he said don t get me wrong some may be legitimate but i dare say most are illegitimate and i will corroborate that under cryptocurrency and bitcoin nigeria comes second right but in the global size of the economy nigeria comes 27th so do you think that there is some correlation you think those countries whose economies are second and 26th will allow you to grow your cryptocurrency business to second position if what is inside is a big deal that is going to profit everybody emefiele added of course we saw it that the market collapsed elon musk twitted sometime about the time the cbn said our banking and payment infrastructure will no longer be available for cryptocurrency transactions he twitted that he was going to invest about 1 5 billion in crypto and the rates went to the highest roof and he then twitted again and raised a few concerns and the thing plunged elon musk had himself decided that he will no longer deal in cryptos and so if a man who felt it was good suddenly decides to say it s no longer good and then you don t forget those who invented crypto said it is encrypted when they say it s encrypted it means that whatever is happening between me and you is only known to the two of us and you know what in case i defraud you because it is encrypted you can t even disclose my name and you can t even get your money back digital currency for nigeria emefiele had also hinted that the idea of operating a digital currency will soon become a reality in the country adding that the central bank had already set up its committee which is working on the project according to him that is not what a responsible central bank would support i have heard about digital currency we are working on it we have set up our committee at the cbn and i can assure everybody that digital currency will come to life even in nigeria

noble counting our losses after months following the science why did minister zigzag this week has been awfully long how the worm has turned on thursday 3 june prime minister dr keith rowley announced that us vice president kamala harris had promised a substantial vaccine donation on saturday 5 june he informed that the country had secured 800 000 johnson johnson vaccines with an august delivery date in addition there was talk about border reopening in four to six weeks the country exhaled for the first time in months finally we were seeing the light at the end of the more than year long troubles then this week happened the nation s flickering hopes have been severely bruised after months of following the science including vaccinating the member companies in the food chain why did the minister zigzag why despite a published mfo poll and the ministry of heath s data and maps was minister terrence deyalsingh surprised by the turnout for vaccinations did the minister not believe the may vaccination achievement almost 49 000 first dose vaccinations compared to 57 744 before 6 may despite the rickety appointment system the ministry s graphs showed a steep projected climb of infections from 2 may the ministry s epidemiologist predicted a rise by a factor of five and showed all the national hotspots instead the minister in his vaccination roll out succumbed to the national preference for anecdotes over evidential data like many including the opposition did he believe that policy initiatives can be based on hearsay and social media soundbites facts are stubborn things and whatever may be our wishes our inclinations or other dictates of our passion they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence john adams 2nd us president in one fell swoop the minister and the cabinet damaged the reputations and hard work of the professionals will the hardworking team that has presented every week for more than a year unjustifiably carry the blame for this fiasco how will there be any attraction of bright young people to public service have we encouraged the overworked doctors and nurses having taken the unnecessary risk of accepting ceo davlin thomas outrageous act why provoke our best doctors who remain in the public health system we all lose should those doctors leave our public hospitals and poor people will pay that heavy price we have lit a fire that will consume us on saturday last we felt that we would be coming out of a nightmare finally our families would be safe we held on to the branch of hope offered we saw and knew persons who died from the lethal disease when the minister whom we had trusted for more than a year told us to come to the health centres what is the expected response we had eagerly anticipated our deliverance from the constant bickering and silly offerings by self centred politicians and others instead this hope was dashed for all to see there is no vaccine to wipe away that insult or the memories of our lost friends and family we saw our elders left in the elements being offered strong doses of disrespect how can we easily forget this when we have to decide whether to trust our political leaders in the future this loss is another milestone in the journey to the bottom of social trust it adds fuel to the fires of political polarisation how will we build community spirit an essential ingredient for resilience through tough times and a catalyst for success the callous disrespect of this week tops the uncertainty and trauma of the last 18 months why does the minister believe that the nation would accept that the rha ceos with their supposed target of 50 shots a day per health facility can dictate the conditions for the vaccination programme how many vaccines do we really have in stock a lack of transparency compromises faith in leaders in a time of uncertainty except for republic bank none of our large businesses stepped up to the plate as grace kennedy did in jamaica instead they were sluggish begging for help or criticising the bailout efforts shane mahabirsingh of bilda boyz construction became the unlikely exemplar as he thoughtfully distributed chairs to elderly persons waiting at the ste madeleine health centre elsewhere they acted like there would be no tomorrow they abdicated their role let us stop comparing with barbados until our business and labour sectors can work together with the government until then we will continue to be numbed by the lack of leadership capacity let us hope that the road ahead will be paved with wisdom from our past mistakes
in a highly contested presidential election in peru socialist political outsider pedro castillo seems to have beat keiko fujimori the daughter of former dictator alberto fujimori by a margin of less than 100 000 votes of the 18 million total votes cast this result represents a broad rejection of the country s political establishment and a watershed moment for peruvian politics it lays bare deep seated frustration after peru has been led by four presidents and eight finance ministers over the past five years seen massive political upheaval and protest and more recently suffered the world s highest per capita covid 19 death rate over 500 deaths per 100 000 people despite enduring long periods of lockdown and an economic crisis that saw its gdp plunge by 11 6 percent in 2020 the candidates in the first round voters were so unimpressed by the candidates that more than 3 million peruvians voted blank or null exceeding the number of votes of any other candidate for moderates in particular the runoff offered a choice between two unappealing options keiko fujimori who received 13 percent of the vote in a highly fragmented first round and who lost previous runoffs in 2011 and 2016 by small margins has faced numerous accusations of campaign finance violations and money laundering and graft furthermore she has been imprisoned three times and has proposed a demodura a so called hard democracy a vague idea combining democracy with the supposedly positive aspects of autocracy even though she promised to respect judicial independence she also has refused to explicitly distance herself from her father alberto who is serving a twenty five year jail sentence for corruption and committing death squad murders furthermore fujimori has said she would pardon him a move that would shut down trials for the forced sterilization of thousands of women mainly in the andes and amazon regions that occurred under her father s rule still in the end she received broad support from traditional political and economic elites in lima including longtime foes such as nobel peace prize winner mario vargas llosa oliver stuenkel oliver stuenkel is an associate professor at the school of international relations at fundação getulio vargas fgv in são paulo brazil he is also a nonresident scholar affiliated with the democracy conflict and governance program at the carnegie endowment for international peace more oliverstuenkel the victorious pedro castillo on the other hand is a former schoolteacher and union leader who ran with a marxist leninist party and chose the campaign slogan no more poor people in a rich country reflecting the promise of greater redistributive measures and a stronger role for the state in an economy that has traditionally been one of south america s most liberal ones socially conservative and strongly opposed to gay marriage and the right to abortion he obtained 19 percent of the vote in the first round castillo who began his speeches on the campaign trail by saying i come from deep peru sought political office for the first time and had been largely unknown to urban peruvians until the presidential elections a sign of the political and cultural disconnect between lima and the country s rural regions castillo who gave almost no interviews to mainstream media outlets during the campaign will be only the second president born outside of lima since 1956 castillo s first moves castillo has also promised to replace the constitution of 1993 which was written under alberto fujimori a year after the recently elected outsider successfully staged a coup and closed down the country s congress and supreme court this constitution limits the state s ability to engage in business activities as such markets showed concern about castillo s more radical ideas after it became clear that he would win peruvian stocks initially lost 8 percent of their value some of the ideas in his original campaign manifesto seem to contradict democratic principles including sentences like socialism does not advocate for freedom of the press but for the press committed to the education and cohesion of its people yet the leftist leader will face formidable impediments in peru s highly fractured congress where his peru libre party has only 28 percent of the seats and may not be able to implement many of his proposals indeed given peruvian lawmakers combative relationship with past presidents most notably their failed attempt to impeach pedro pablo kuczynski in 2017 and their successful ouster of martín vizcarra three years later it is far from assured that castillo will be able to serve his full term after all like most of his predecessors castillo who has no previous governing experience will be a minority president which requires constant negotiations to cajole congressmen to support the president s proposals like in brazil this setup creates incentives for corrupt practices just like keiko fujimori s fuerza popular party launched a campaign to oust kuczynski in 2017 it is likely that it will attempt to do the same with castillo fujimori s accusations of voter fraud without presenting any evidence do not suggest her party is willing to cooperate with the new president the fact that castillo won with the smallest of margins is likely to further limit his mandate for change and make it harder for him to convince congress to go along with his more controversial policies after his victory in the first round castillo moderated his rhetoric somewhat and advisers said he did not defend outright expropriations like former president ollanta humala who held office from 2011 to 2016 won as a leftist populist candidate but ended up governing as a moderate neoliberal and did not threaten democracy castillo may tack toward the center preemptively even though he continued to speak somewhat erratically during the campaign of nationalizing companies yet comparisons between humala and castillo overlook that public frustration with democracy today seems to be far more deep seated than it was ten years ago as last year s wave of civil unrest shows while the election of the fifty one year old castillo may seem somewhat coincidental at first his insurgent campaign grasped the population s rage better than most others consistently pointing to structural inequalities between urban and rural regions that elites in the capital had neglected and where state presence continues to be limited the vacuna gate scandal which involved many well connected policymakers secretly receiving covid 19 vaccines while the nationwide vaccination campaign remained painfully slow seemed to symbolize the establishment s moral bankruptcy which was already severely battered by never ending news about corruption scandals three ex presidents are under investigation and another alan garcía killed himself in 2019 as police were about to arrest him bridging political divides while it is entirely unclear whether castillo can address peru s multiple challenges his election represents a demand for change that is more fundamental than policy elites like to acknowledge these demands range from the need to make decisionmaking processes more inclusive and transparent to renegotiating peru s social contract along with chile peru boasted the region s most stable economy which grew at an annual average of 4 3 percent between 1990 and 2019 compared to the 2 6 average percent growth of the region yet particularly in the eyes of many rural voters peru s neoliberal economic model has left too many behind an opinion that surprised many outside observers who had often referred to the country as a model because it had reduced its poverty rate to 21 7 percent before it shot up to 27 5 percent during the pandemic aware of changing public opinion even keiko fujimori a defender of peru s liberal economic policies had proposed adjustments during the campaign such as raising the minimum wage and improving the country s social safety net promoting such a debate in a constructive manner has worked in neighboring chile where large scale discontent and protests in 2019 were channeled into an inclusive debate about the future of the country chile s institutional solution symbolized by the creation of a constituent assembly stands in contrast to brazil s wave of protests which produced a massive anti establishment sentiment that eventually led to the rise of president jair bolsonaro a populist outsider with authoritarian ambitions who often suggests that a greater concentration of power in the presidency could solve the country s ills given how unpopular peru s congress is castillo may feel tempted to embrace a similar route reminiscent of alberto fujimori who closed down congress in the name of national renewal in 1992 a move that preceded years of dictatorship and political persecution expecting peru to follow into chile s recent footsteps thus seems to be excessively optimistic peru s plight represents in many ways the deep malaise of democracy across latin america worsened by the pandemic which has led to economic collapse and brutally exposed the weaknesses of public services aggravated by extreme polarization a perception of impunity among political elites and little faith in democratic institutions as peru s democracy is set to face a serious challenge civil society will have to play a key role in seeking to prevent the erosion of the country s institutions more broadly speaking the fact that even peru and chile latin america s economic star performers are gripped by anti establishment sentiment shows that a fundamental rethink is necessary about what constitutes successful policy now political elites must focus not only on gdp figures but also on the quality of public services especially in poorer regions anti corruption legislation and indices of inequality and social mobility

by bola a akinterinwa three major events of concern in the past two weeks are the marking of june 12 as democracy day arise news channel s exclusive interview with president muhammadu buhari pmb on thursday 10 june 2021 and president muhammadu buhari pmb s tweetoplomacy the three events have the great potential to further attract special global attention in the foreseeable future because of their nature and strategic implications for nigeria s foreign policy they necessarily raise questions on the extent to which democracy can endure in nigeria the extent to which there can be fairness or justice driven governance in nigeria and particularly how foreign policy can be conducted and managed to protect domestic policy inconsistencies in fact they raise the extent to which nigeria can remain united as an indivisible sovereign nation state on june 12 a day set aside for remembering the people s political will was slaughtered on the altar of democracy in 1993 it was the day chief mko abiola was on record to have won the fairest the freest and the best ever organised presidential election in nigeria s political history the results of the elections for selfish militaro ethnic considerations were recklessly annulled by the then military president general ibrahim badamasi babangida as a result of the annulment every june 12 has been marked since 1993 to celebrate chief mko abiola the president we never had as a symbolic instrument of democracy the impact of the celebrations is such that pmb had to put a stop to the marking of may 29 as democracy day in favour of june 12 with effect from apparently to secure the political support of the yoruba south west the marking of june 12 this year 2021 is particularly noteworthy because of its environmental insecurity and particularly the agitations for self determination and sovereign autonomy the statement of mr sunday igboho an apostle of oduduwa republic is a pointer to this observation as credited to mr igboho under no circumstance should the peaceful public demonstrations scheduled for june 12 be tainted with any bloodshed in his words let us warn the federal government that if there is bloodshed this weekend the international community is watching if the military kills any nigerian this weekend it is going to be very hot the yoruba nation rally will go ahead in every part of yoruba land and the rest of the country where it will hold and perhaps more importantly sunday igboho said red alarm will begin on friday people should stock up food items from friday night we are not backing down this weekend we are ready to take back what belongs to us this statement is self explanatory it is against this background of environmental insecurity that the discussion of the arise television exclusive interview with pmb and pmb s tweetoplomacy becomes relevant arise interview and pmb s tweetoplomacy the exclusive interview granted by pmb to the arise news channel on the future of nigeria and particularly on what to expect from the pmb administration in the next two years enabled viewers to delineate pmb s apparent dual character in the governance of nigeria character of statesmanship when convenient and character of an unrepentant military dictator when helplessly pushed to a tight corner the questions asked during the arise news channel interview and the mania of pmb responses clearly show that he is not and cannot be a good president of a truly united nigeria simply because he consciously dodged critical questions bordering on patriotism and fairness and clearly showed partisanship when specific questions relating to his ethnic group are raised put differently a good leader a patriotic leader must have the discipline of always defending fairness equity justice and requirements of good governance rather than conveniently seeking to defend his people indirectly a good nigerian must also similarly defend objectivity and honesty of purpose they must seek to address issues rather than addressing people this is why pmb has not been able to superintend national questions well and why policy makers now find themselves in a junction of confusion and policy inconsistencies this is a major rationale for nigeria s current problems a review of the arise news channel interview is relevant and necessary at this juncture first pmb hardly responds to questions asked it is possible he does not hear the question well or does not understand the question or he understands the implications of providing the explanatory truth but does not want to respond to it whatever is the case the attitudinal disposition of pmb simply reminds of what chief obafemi awolowo said in 1985 our ship of state is heading towards the rock unless the chief helmsman rises courageously to steer the ship away from its present course the inescapable consequence will be an inexplicable disaster there is nothing to suggest that the inescapable consequence is not at hand with the responses of pmb the first question asked by dr reuben abati after prince nduka obaigbena s prolegomena was on the deepening situation of insecurity mr president the nation is witnessing a rising insecurity banditry arson kidnapping how do we get here what is the way out the essence of these questions is not far fetched that there is an intrinsic situation of insecurity in nigeria which is a truism that the insecurity is also deepening is another truism the point of interest is how did we move from the level of a crisis to that of a conflict in other words why the crises and the conflicts perhaps more interestingly before the insecurity began to deepen could it be that pmb was unaware if he was unaware why if he was aware what has he done to contain the worsening of the conflicts the bottom line of dr abati s question is how did we get to the level of a rising insecurity without doubt how is more about mania rationales factors and what is responsible for the rise in insecurity the responses given by pmb did not address the question of how as submitted by pmb when we came it is sic been a very difficult undertaking but we closed the borders with benin republic we closed the borders with niger republic we stopped smuggling we asked nigerians to grow what they will eat and eat what they grow the cost of importation of rice and other foodstuff we stopped it we made fertilisers available and we were very impressed and happy with the action of nigerians they went back to the farm and we made sure our neighbours especially niger are carried along because there are nigerians who order food in niger for nigerian market the nigerien government cooperated with us so really we depended on ourselves and nigerians do not regret it pmb spoke on corruption which he said is very difficult under this system and even under the military system luckily i have experienced both occasions he explained how he too was arrested and detained by the security agents how he had to put on his agbada and join politicians and how he may not be able to change the system etc from the foregoing transcribed quotation pmb has not in any way addressed the question of how we got to the current noisome situation in the country he also did not respond to the issue of quo vadis also raised by dr abati the second question was raised by prince nduka obaigbena who anchored the interview shekau was reported dead does that give us an opportunity for us to zero in and consolidate and secure the north east pmb responded that the problem of the northeast is difficult the governor this present governor is working very hard he is taking a lot of risk sic and i asked him this boko haram is it our people or is it nigerians or people coming out he said they are nigerians most of them they are nigerians as i said the only way to go round about it is that you cannot kill innocent people and say god is great that works very well but i think we have a problem of unemployment we have a lot of youths looking basically for what to eat not even to talk about accommodation the level of poverty is almost unimaginable so this is our problem but those who are really keeping in touch with what we are doing they know the difference between the time we came in and now and the people of north east and south south i think are the best judges for the performances of this administration because they knew what they were in and they know the condition now again the essence of the second question is to know the extent to which there can be a glimmer of hope now that the boko haram leader is purported to have been killed is security in the north east now feasible pmb cannot reply as to whether there is an opportunity or not to consolidate security in the north east by explaining that the situation in the north east is difficult does he imply that there is no opportunity of consolidating security in the region without doubt in virtually all the questions raised including those of mr olusegun adeniyi and ms tundun abiola pmb always found it convenient to justify what his administration has done rather than seeking appropriate explanations to questions asked for instance while mr adeniyi raised the question of the spread of insecurity from the north east to the south east and ms tundun abiola raised the issue of formalisation of state police pmb simply gave the usual defensive narratives in light of this evasive attitude we strongly believe that it cannot be possible even for a well intentioned leader to ensure national security in nigeria pmb s vision is quite questionable his intentions and words conflict with his actions as regards pmb s tweetoplomacy the twitter com a social network and podcasting private company removed mbuhari from its clientèle space for violating its operational regulations twitter com is not a government outfit but one that all governments relate with for various reasons of force majeure in the same vein buhari com is not governmental in character at best it is individual it is pmb s private twitter handle and therefore quite different from that of the nigerian presidency ngr presidency in reaction to the de registration of his private twitter handle pmb declared the twitter com non grata in nigeria did pmb act because of the dishonour done him as an individual or because of the national interest it is useful here to note that as a social network and a podcasting company twitter com was founded on 21 march 2006 in san francisco california united states by jack dorsey biz stone noah glass and evan williams it was launched in july 2006 to provide a social network service with an original code name twttr and an original name called status as wikipedia has it the original name was called status but after searching through the dictionary he dorsey found the word twitter the definition was a short burst of inconsequential information and chirps from birds more important when twitter was first launched in july 2006 no one used tweet as a noun or a verb instead the service referred to the tweeting process as twittering and those who used the service as twitter ers thus pmb is simply an ordinary twitterer like many others more significantly twitter is an online micro blogging service for the distribution of a short message service for groups in terms of policy stand twitter like other social media companies is constantly under pressure to prevent hate speech harassment and bullying in whatever is posted in twitter site it is against this background that the misunderstanding between pmb and the twitter com should be partly explained and understood beyond the braggadocio the federal government has really engaged in a battle that it cannot win the ban has seriously tainted nigeria s international image and also seriously undermined her national interests the business of tweeting is necessarily conducted vertically and horizontally in a manner of win win the twitter com as the business owners engages in tweeting not only to make money but also to control and possibly influence direction of global governance like in other social media tweeting cannot but be a good platform for intelligence gathering which is good for the twitter com and also for the government of nigeria it is a platform that all the security agencies should be interested in in nigeria suspending or banning the services of twitter in nigeria temporarily or permanently can only generate and deepen public animosity vis á vis the federal government secondly the mere fact that the art of communication can be vertical be it in the manner of ascending or descending or horizontal in the manner of parity and not authoritative like it is in the vertical sense government cannot but be the major looser when it is only able to suspend the twitter but unable to sanction the nigerian clients of the twitter who all have alternative platforms to take advantage of twitter s operations have a global character though the company is registered in the united states thirdly even though the government has been enabled with the suspension of twitter to consider regulating further the various social media platforms in the country the truth is that pmb is the first victim of his policy decision of suspending the twitter simply because he necessarily denies himself access to the same platform as an individual and as a government agent true it was the twitter that first launched the attack by deleting on 2 june 2021 mbuhari which is pmb s individual account twitter considered that pmb had violated its regulations by making pronouncements along threats of violence twitter has rules and policies on many issues hate speech dummies harassment suspension of accounts trending bullying etc whereas twitter s regulations under safety and violence include non threatening of violence against an individual or a group of people the regulations also protect privacy and authenticity unexpectedly pmb reciprocated not by acting as an individual but as the president with all powers by initially banning and later re explaining that it is suspension of the twitter in the eyes of the government of nigeria the twitter s micro blogging site was being used to undermine nigeria s corporate existence if pmb were not the president or in the position of power as at the time the decision to suspend twitter was taken he would not have been able to so react in this regard pmb has used his official position to promote selfish interest however if we do consider the fact that pmb has the onerous responsibility to also ensure national unity and territorial integrity of the country the extent to which pmb should be blamed cannot but be limited fourth and true enough again there is no disputing the fact that the twitter platform has been severally used in the past to promote anti government sentiments to which the federal government has not been favourably disposed and which has also been a major source of anger all along the endsars protests are a case in point the opportunity of twitter s deletion of mbuhari only served as the crescendo of already existing government s animosity vis à vis twitter in the continuum of intolerance the main problem here is that the ban has now generated a fresh multi dimensional problem international condemnation which the government is finding it increasingly very difficult to manage at the nigerian domestic level for instance there have been condemnations as well the ban is seen as an assault on democracy on freedom of expression as a further special attempt to gag the press and opponents of pmb and his government in fact some nigerians have instituted a legal action against the pmb government at the ecowas court of justice their prayer is an interim injunction restraining government from implementing its suspension policy the court s likely grant of the prayer cannot be taken for granted at the international level virtually all the major european powers have condemned pmb s ban and have asked him to rescind his decision although russia and donald trump appear to support the ban international condemnation of the ban is quite overwhelming the diplomatic missions of canada european union s delegation to nigeria republic of ireland norway the united kingdom and the united states noted in their joint statement their great disappointment about nigeria s ban in their words they strongly support the fundamental right of free expression and access to information as a pillar of democracy in nigeria and around the world and these rights apply online as well as offline banning systems of expression is not the answer these measures inhibit access to information and commerce at precisely the moment when nigeria needs to foster inclusive dialogue and expression of opinions as well as share vital information in this time of covid 19 pandemic more important the joint statement has it that the path to a more secure nigeria lies in more not less in communication to accompany the concerted efforts of nigeria s citizens in fulsome dialogue toward unity peace and prosperity with this position it should be expected that the ban has the potential to impact more on nigeria s foreign relations multi dimensionally in terms of political and economic sanctions europeans do see fundamental human rights of free expression not only as a pillar of democracy but also as a non negotiable one it is from this perspective that the issue of twitter ban cannot but also remain an irritant in nigeria s foreign relations fifthly and perhaps more importantly the ban on twitter necessarily raises the question of who really is in charge of nigeria s foreign policy the minister of information and culture or the minister of foreign affairs is it that the information minister is more actively engaged than the foreign minister these questions are prompted by the many problems of government s always reasoning after pronouncement of policies and not always thinking enough about their likely implications before their pronouncements government should make haste slowly in acting speedily after inadequate reflection on foreign policy implications pmb s mania of keeping silent on burning national questions or taking much delight in not wanting to speak on such questions forthrightly can only taint whatever legacy he is claiming to want to leave for posterity the truth as at today is that many observers believe that the rising insecurity in nigeria is a resultant from alleged pmb s fulanisation agenda islamic jihadism and his unrepentant nepotism besides it is most unfortunate that pmb can say that merit should apply in the appointment of military chiefs and all those who grew in the system and qualified for appointment are only his ethnic people consequently in reply to prince obaigbena s question of what security future with the alleged demise of the boko haram leader nigeria s security future cannot be bright for a simple reason fulanisation jihadism nepotism inequity unfairness injustice etc cannot be celebrated on a platter of gold and at the same time still expect goodness of purpose patriotism and national unity from the people

at 2am on the morning of may 11 thomas lauria poured himself a glass of jack daniel s even though he was still at work a partner in the miami office of law firm white case lauria had spent the previous 15 hours overseeing a tense auction between two rival private equity consortiums for hertz the bankrupt rental car group dozens of financiers lawyers and bankers had descended on the white case office overlooking biscayne bay for many it was their first in person business meeting in 14 months fortified by what he later described as the right mix of caffeine sugar carbs and whiskey lauria eventually asked each bidding group to submit their best and final offers so a winner could be crowned and everyone could finally get some sleep the bidding war that had built up over the previous two months pushed hertz s enterprise value to a figure approaching 7bn a figure that was unthinkable a year before the remarkable turnround in hertz s fortunes mimics the dramatic rebound that large parts of the global economy are experiencing when the rental car group filed for bankruptcy in may 2020 after business and leisure travel had ground to a halt the company was the most high profile victim of the economic carnage being inflicted by the pandemic and seemingly portended more corporate failures to come last june hertz somehow became the original meme stock stricken companies which found frenzied support on social media among groups of retail investors whose confidence in their short term futures was dismissed at the time as foolish by professional investors yet by the spring of 2021 those terrifying early days of the pandemic were just a faded memory massive intervention first by the federal reserve and then by the treasury stabilised the us economy and then america s furious pace of vaccinations buoyed hopes for the travel industry allowing cruise companies and airliners to raise billions of cheap capital from flush institutional investors thirty two hours after the bidding first started a group led by distressed debt fund knighthead capital prevailed in the auction knighthead s group agreed a deal that gave hertz an enterprise value of 6 9bn including 1 1bn to a group of shareholders which once dominated by day traders on the robinhood app now included a set of canny hedge funds bankruptcy typically involves vultures fighting for scraps instead the hertz brawl revolved around a once broken company that was getting more valuable by the minute the perfect metaphor for an upside down year on wall street thomas lauria a top corporate restructuring lawyer who specialised in representing long shot creditors who needed a bulldog to argue their case in court white case braking fast in late march 2020 as the full impact of the pandemic became apparent hertz faced dual existential problems first as travel halted the group s revenues had collapsed in april alone turnover was down by 73 per cent more critically the company s fleet of more than 500 000 cars was financed off balance sheet through special purpose vehicles since cars served as collateral it was a relatively cheap way to borrow these lenders however also had negotiated protections where if used cars declined in value hertz itself was obliged to inject equity into these spvs in april with used car prices plummeting bondholders told the company it owed them more than 100m rather than pay the company chose bankruptcy carl icahn the billionaire investor who had been hertz s de facto boss sold his 38 per cent stake on the eve of bankruptcy registering a near 2bn loss hertz s hope was that through a court supervised process there would be a way for the company to efficiently deal with all of its problems bondholders in its asset backed securities were understandably desperate to be repaid and with the travel shutdown expected to continue indefinitely there were even whispers that hertz would be forced to simply liquidate its entire fleet that bankruptcy process centred on lauria a top corporate restructuring lawyer who specialised in representing long shot creditors who needed a bulldog to argue their case in court his business card boasts the motto walk in fuck shit up walk out the owner of a mansion on exclusive fisher s island lauria had used his miami base to become friendly with various florida business luminaries most notably icahn white case had been working with hertz for years and was the easy selection for the florida based company as it entered bankruptcy this case however would require both more diplomacy and creativity than lauria s trademark bomb throwing a chance for an outside the box gambit came within days of hertz s may 24 bankruptcy petition the company bizarrely was becoming the hottest stock on robinhood lauria and hertz figured it was worth trying to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in cheap bankruptcy financing by selling stock the bankruptcy court agreed at a friday afternoon telephone hearing in june but just as the company started gradually selling new stock reaching 29m the us securities regulator raised doubt and the company backed off instead hertz was forced to take

abs holders to sell 200 000 vehicles the prospects for a covid 19 vaccine then were promising but a recovery in travel remained uncertain an empty hertz rent a car rental office at san francisco international airport in april 2020 justin sullivan getty images still knighthead and certares the latter a travel specialist with stakes in tripadvisor and the american express travel agency were leading a deal that would inject 5bn into hertz the company s junior bondholders would realise a recovery of either 70 cents on the dollar in cash or get the chance to buy into the equity of new hertz however hertz shareholders according to the terms were to get nothing this was the perfect scenario i just needed a couple of good bounces says eric parkinson a retail investor who likens himself to george soros and warren buffett parkinson based in los angeles started speculating in hertz shares around the time knighthead certares terms were announced i love the intersection of fear a lazy media narrative and where nothing makes sense he says referring to the mainstream view that anyone buying hertz stock was a sucker parkinson like the hedge funds that lawyer andrew glenn was pitching noticed that hertz bonds had jumped well over the 70 cent offer on the table the implication was that the company s equity would soon start to be worth considerably more parkinson would accumulate 67 000 shares at an average price of below 1 and another private equity group was about to jump into the fray let battle begin the near 5bn that knighthead had agreed to pay for hertz seemed cheap to many as such another set of heavy hitters was ready to put up a fight tom dundon knew a thing or two about automobiles dundon had become a texas billionaire making subprime auto loans to americans eventually selling his business to santander now he had teamed up with two elite private equity firms centerbridge and warburg pincus to put in their own bid for hertz predicated on a partnership with carvana an online used car marketplace whose public market capitalisation had surged to 47bn by mid april hertz had changed its mind and approved a 5 5bn bid from the centerbridge warburg dundon consortium through the course of april the knighthead and centerbridge groups fought to win control of hertz lauria at the same time wanted the company out of bankruptcy by july to avoid an endless tit for tat the court agreed to an auction for monday may 10 that lauria had proposed the result was a late spring pilgrimage of hertz bidders to florida why are we doing this in miami one lawyer emailed to the group incredulous that 95 per cent of the case participants lived in new york still less than an hour after gathering at the white case office virtually everyone had shed their masks betting that their colleagues had already received a vaccine the duelling private equity groups had by now gathered critical allies the centerbridge team had secured the support of virtually all hertz junior bondholders which included the likes of fidelity jpmorgan and de shaw these bondholders holding 3bn of paper were willing to take their recovery in new hertz shares and were also purchasing more equity to fund the restructuring these creditors had early in the process offered to buy hertz at a 3 5bn enterprise value but now were hoping to tag along with the centerbridge bid at a number near twice that figure joining the rival knighthead group was andrew glenn s committee of hedge funds which had bought up shares and were committing hundreds of millions in new capital the group had also secured the heavyweight apollo global management which was contributing 1 5bn of preferred stock in the days leading up to the miami showdown the knighthead team had seized the upper hand offering roughly 300m to existing shareholders or 2 a share when the group gathered mid morning on may 11 one banker described the vibe as exhilarating a bidding war occurring live after a year of zoom fatigue even if the scene mostly involved long periods of sitting around with occasional moments of frenzy each side s bids were complex involving packages of cash as well as ownership in the new hertz in the form of other complex instruments hertz s bankers at moelis co had to run the numbers through their spreadsheets before all sides would gather to hear the announcement that a bid had been deemed superior carl icahn the billionaire investor who had been hertz s de facto boss sold his 38 per cent stake on the eve of bankruptcy registering a near 2bn loss neilson barnard getty images by midnight only a couple of rounds of bidding had finished the knighthead group was able to quickly counterbid however the centerbridge group proved messier requiring the unwieldy bondholder group s consent before sending in a bid jim millstein the restructuring banker representing knighthead sent a flurry of heated text messages to william derrough of moelis about the perceived leniency extended to centerbridge at one point late at night lauria had an agitated argument with a certares executive lauria thrives in the chaos explains one bankruptcy adviser who was in the room adding as long as he is controlling the chaos still as lauria sipped his scotch in the small hours he knew that however erratic the process had been each bidding group was convinced that hertz had been prejudiced against them over the previous months he had essentially done the unthinkable in stoking up a hot auction by midday on tuesday as the white case office reeked of papa john s pizza and cuban sandwiches along with dozens of weary bidders who had not left the premises in 24 hours hertz told the two groups to submit their best and final offers each side was approaching their limit but no one wanted to lose by a penny either ultimately the margin was not close centerbridge offered a package worth 5 39 cents a share or 841m in the form of cash options and preferred equity knighthead submitted a final bid they said was worth 1 15bn or 7 36 a share while that included a cash payment of 239m more than 700m was in options derived from the black scholes equation the centerbridge group was furious believing knighthead had goosed that figure by using financial inputs in their bid that defied economic reality still members of the centerbridge group admitted that its marriage with the bondholders had limited their own agility overall hertz accepted a deal had raised 7bn in new capital its overall enterprise value had doubled to 6 9bn in three months and all its creditors would be paid 100 cents on the dollar and in cash eric parkinson the retail investor who had loaded up shares as the bidding war began was sitting on winnings of 400 000 rental cars are stored in a parking lot at dodger stadium in la california in may 2020 bing guan bloomberg late that tuesday some of the bidders headed back to new york having never checked into their hotel one banker described the ordeal as inhumane members of the knighthead group retreated to a celebratory dinner at a nearby italian restaurant il gabbiano on thursday the court approved the restructuring which is set to take effect in a few weeks hertz shares now trade at 7 implying a market capitalisation of more than 1bn these guys paid a pretty penny says one person involved in the centerbridge bid analysts at research firm creditsights argue that the winning bid requires everything to go right and lot of conviction on the forward variables citing not just the recovery in travel but both high rental car rates and used car prices jim millstein the banker for knighthead who remains irritated by the auction shenanigans still tipped his cap to the man who had orchestrated the process lauria as much as it pains me to say it was maybe both smart and lucky lauria for his part acknowledged both the challenge and the satisfaction of the hertz case i got to use every braincell i have and every skill i ve used over 35 years says the 60 year old hertz called it all into play
here s what you need to know nazi germany could not develop nukes as war winning weapons in the early years of world war ii it looked as if germany might have the luxury to spend its time developing a new generation of super weapons the nazis haphazardly pursued the idea of building an atomic bomb with an eye toward eventual conflict with the united states however the immediate demands of war combined with western allied sabotage undercut the program leaving it at the basic research stage by war s end but what if the germans had devoted more attention to the program or had lucked into more substantial breakthroughs what could the nazis have done with an atomic weapon context for construction the american atomic weapons program cost an enormous amount of money and took human capital away from other important projects but the united states unique among the great powers of world war ii believed that the war would last long enough to justify complex projects germany did not have this luxury especially after it became apparent that the soviet union would not collapse in 1941 for germany to seriously consider taking the atomic plunge it needed favorable war conditions that would allow the development of long term research projects in the event jets submarines and rockets took up a greater portion of the reich s scarce engineering resources the german program faced other obstacles western allied attacks on the german industrial economy took their toll even if they could not push germany out of the war sabotage like the attacks on heavy water processing plants in norway also curtailed german progress the nature of the nazi regime also made scientific progress difficult many of the best nuclear scientists disliked the nazis and took steps to escape europe the germans could not draw on europe s scientific expertise to the same extent as the americans nevertheless the nazi regime did make substantial progress on a number of engineering frontiers and could have developed a weapon in time solving the basic theoretical and engineering problems wouldn t have suddenly turned germany into a major nuclear power however the german program concentrated on enriched uranium a simpler project that eliminated some of the more tricky problems faced by the united states however the need for stocks of uranium some of which had been seized from belgium and the extensive industrial complex needed to enrich would have made it difficult for the germans to produce a large number of devices delivery even if the germans had managed to develop an atomic weapon delivery would have been a problem for tactical use against ground targets the wehrmacht could have engineered a way to deliver the devices but anything at longer range would have been a struggle the luftwaffe lacked an advanced heavy bomber capable of hitting targets in england or russia much less the united states designed to fight in support of the wehrmacht the german air force had toyed with the idea of heavy bombers in the 1930s but concentrated on lighter smaller planes as war approached surely the german could have developed a strategic bomber given enough time junkers heinkel and focke wulf all worked on large bomber projects during the war but such aircraft were enormously complex and expensive with long lead times the b 29 program reputedly cost more than the atomic bomb itself and even b 29s required modification in order to carry atomic weapons the best candidate available to the luftwaffe would have been the he 177 capable of carrying a device considerably smaller than the little boy bomb dropped on hiroshima could submarines have delivered the devices conceivably a nuclear torpedo was probably beyond the means of the kriegsmarine but a submarine sufficiently close to its target could probably deliver the warhead in a small boat but getting into position was no mean task by 1943 allied anti submarine warfare was devastating germany s submarine fleet only the type xxi submarines could have approached useful targets with any degree of certainty and these boats did not appear until late in the war the v 2 ballistic missiles represented the most obvious potential delivery vehicles they could deliver payloads at range with little chance of interception and with enough accuracy for an atomic warhead however v 2s had a startling launch failure rate making them a sketchy option for an atomic payload they also lacked the ability to carry heavy payloads reducing a warhead to sufficiently small size and reinforcing it such that it could handle the rigors of launch flight and separation were tasks likely beyond nazi germany in any useful timeframe use of the weapon how would the germans have used the atomic bomb if they had managed to construct it it depends naturally on germany s tactical situation when it developed the weapon and on the delivery systems it had available obvious strategic targets include london and moscow and the luftwaffe could probably have delivered them successfully with a fair degree of confidence an attack on either would have proved devastating in the case of moscow a surprise strike that decapitated the soviet leadership might have caused very serious problems although the red army would undoubtedly have continued to fight in the west the v 2 campaign had a serious impact on british morale and an atomic device would have had an even more devastating impact it s worth keeping in mind however that the combined bomber offensive was delivering atomic levels of destruction to the reich from 1943 on and that this effort failed to force a german surrender in any case the center of gravity of the western allied war effort had passed to the other side of the atlantic and the united states was likely out of reach if hard pressed by the red army germany could have used its weapons for tactical effect an atomic weapon could have had a devastating impact on armored columns staging areas or command centers although with a small number of warheads the germans would have had to take great care in target selection the red army moved on such a massive scale that even an atomic attack might not have upset its grandest offensives on the naval side the bikini atom bomb tests demonstrated that modern naval units could survive atomic attacks if imperfectly as with the war in the east atomic bombs could have dented the western allied naval advantage but likely not to the extent of severing the trans atlantic lifeline major amphibious operations such as the normandy invasion would have proven far juicier targets although they would have required very judicious decisions on the part of the germans the final salvo nazi germany could have developed nuclear weapons if it had won the war it could not develop them as war winning weapons both because of the demands of the project and the limitations of early atomic devices only the united states could combine the economic resources and the long time horizon necessary to develop the bomb while at the same time developing a fleet of bombers capable of delivering it robert farley a frequent contributor to tni is author of the battleship

cancel culture has become one of the most shopworn epithets in the gop vocabulary and also one of the most hypocritical the only cancellation of free expression to which most republican politicians object are republican talking points particularly trumpy ones as for progressive talking points or even conservative critiques of donald trump they would just as soon shout them down or shut them off rearview mirror take for example a recent move by stanford university law school to delay the graduation of senior law student nicholas wallace for publishing a parody wallace had sent an email to a campus discussion site mocking the federalist society a conservative legal lobby group that exercised outsized influence with the trump administration in vetting strict constructionist often known as originalist jurists for nomination to the federal bench wallace s email invited students to an imaginary federalist society campus event on jan 6 the date of the u s capitol riot which had occurred 19 days earlier he dubbed the event the originalist case for inciting insurrection and touted as featured speakers sen josh hawley r mo a stanford graduate and texas attorney general ken paxton both outspoken deniers of the legitimacy of president joe biden s election win violent insurrection also known as doing a coup is a classical system of installing a government the email stated and it promised that riot information will be mailed the day of the event anyone with the sense god gave little green apples let alone a society of learned lawyers would have seen this post for what it was a lampoon of the outlandish claims of election fraud promoted by self styled originalist constitutionalists like hawley and paxton and parody no matter how biting is protected by the first amendment free speech clause nonetheless the stanford chapter of the federalist society filed a complaint with the school on march 27 alleging that wallace had violated the school s code of conduct by falsely accusing hawley and paxton of having promoted the capitol riot advertisement two months later on may 27 his last day of classes and just weeks before he was due to graduate wallace was informed his graduation was being placed on hold while the school investigated the federalist society complaint after the investigation was closed on june 2 by which time this distinguished law school had become a national laughing stock it decided surprise surprise that wallace s email was protected speech and that he should be allowed to graduate consider too brian kemp georgia s conservative republican governor who had the temerity to accept the validity of his state s 2020 election result favoring biden over trump a large contingent of trump supporters at the state s june 5 gop convention tried to silence kemp with boos and jeers as he was delivering a speech kemp barely escaped censure by the same convention goers though his secretary of state brad raffensperger was not so lucky raffensperger was censured for refusing to overturn the election result i could cite many more examples but these will suffice to illustrate that cancel culture isn t limited to the unfortunate practice of many colleges and universities often under pressure from their students of denying a forum for speakers whose views have failed to pass a liberal litmus test when i was a senior at georgetown university in june 1969 before the term cancel culture was even invented i witnessed an example of this phenomenon which left a sour taste in my mouth and persuaded me that speech however unpopular should nearly always be permitted about a half dozen students from the radical left students for a democratic society stormed the podium in a university lecture hall where joseph alioto san francisco s mayor was starting to deliver a speech the commotion forced security personnel to hustle alioto off stage and the scheduled event for which there was a packed house was canceled advertisement alioto a successful antitrust lawyer turned politician had taken a hard stand on student campus protests then roiling the country as a result of the vietnam war black power and other anti establishment movements these were not the relatively restrained protests of the civil rights movement typified by peaceful marches and speeches students were literally paralyzing their campuses taking over administrative buildings and preventing teachers from holding classes until their demands had been met though a democrat with a fairly progressive political agenda alioto had no patience for such disruptive behavior and sent in police to quell a student strike at san francisco state university which threatened to shut down the campus i was personally struggling to understand the societal upheaval that was tearing the country apart in the late 1960s and i really wanted to hear alioto s speech appropriately titled freedom of speech on the campus but it was not to be i recognized one of the disruptors as an underclassman with whom i had worked on the college radio station on my way out of the hall i pulled him aside and angrily asked why did you do this he shrugged and replied it had to be done as if his own ideas about truth and social justice were so obviously correct that no further explanation was required the events of the past four years in which massive disinformation campaigns qanon conspiracy theories and donald trump s big lie seemed to turn many otherwise rational respectable americans including those storming the capitol on jan 6 into drooling menacing zombies have caused me to question my own views as to the inviolability of free speech perhaps the government does need to give a more expansive definition to incitement to violence and insurrection speech which is not protected by the first amendment short of that however i still believe that giving full rein to free speech is healthier for a democratic society than cancellation elliott epstein is a

a few words about the makers and the takers that as you may recall was the formulation once favored by fox news and other organs of the political right to describe the dynamic between those at the top of the economic pyramid and those at the bottom the poor characterized as scavenging animals by more than one conservative were said to contribute nothing to our society while mooching off their financial betters but it is worth re examining the whole makers and takers paradigm in light of last week s jarring report from propublica the nonprofit online newsroom it was based on a trove of irs information provided by an anonymous source and it laid out in granular detail the strategies used by the wealthiest people in america to get away with paying little or nothing in taxes take for instance jeff bezos amazon founder and world s richest man with a net worth estimated by forbes at 192 billion we are told that he paid nothing in taxes in 2007 and 2011 and a relative pittance in other years not to pick on bezos elon musk michael bloomberg warren buffett and other ginormously rich people all reportedly employ the same strategy to avoid taxes which is to say they pay themselves minimal salaries as little as a dollar a year in some cases and keep their wealth in the form of stocks bonds and other financial instruments which the irs does not consider income and taxes at a much lower rate for comparison propublica says the median american tax rate in recent years is 14 but it calculates bezos true tax rate between 2014 and 2018 i e factoring the growth of his assets in with his reported income at under 1 it says that when people like him need actual cash they simply borrow against their massive assets interest on such loans runs in the single digits and the proceeds are not considered income and therefore are not taxable advertisement all of this is perfectly legal by the way also perfectly infuriating and here let me just say i believe in capitalism i believe that when you incentivize earning you incentivize risk taking innovation and hard work but i also believe something is wrong when ceo pay rose by about 1 000 between 1978 and 2018 while worker pay edged up just 12 something is wrong when working full time doesn t put a roof over your head or food on your table something is wrong when an amazon driver complains of 14 hour shifts and peeing in bottles to make his delivery quotas something is wrong when employees at tyson and other meat packers report wearing diapers to work because conveyor belts are relentless and bathroom breaks denied advertisement i also believe that paying taxes is a patriotic duty onerous you bet but patriotic just the same it s how we fund our governments local and national and the services they provide everything from road maintenance fire and police to military defense food safety and environmental cleanup we all benefit from those services whether ginormously wealthy pitiably poor or somewhere in between any tax code that allows the rich to freeload on that which is paid for by the rest of us is morally bankrupt and in need of overhaul moreover it gives the lie to the right wing s lavish contempt for the poor in the wake of propublica s report maybe we should reconsider who the makers really are and who is taking what from whom leonard pitts jr is a columnist for the miami herald readers may write to him via email at lpitts miamiherald com send questions comments to the editors previous next
as inflation continues to heat up and markets are once again on the verge of breaking out on thursday the bureau of labor statistics released the much anticipated consumer price index data the came in at a full 5 0 year over year through may the so called rate which excludes food and energy showed an annual increase of 3 8 that represents the biggest jump since all the way back in 1992 meanwhile federal reserve officials continue to downplay the inflation threat they insist the recent surge is transitory and doesn t reflect a major trend to come but as denver s local 9news reported not all economists are echoing the fed s messaging on inflation we are again talking about inflation that s when prices rise for all sorts of goods and services therefore our money buys less it is happening now although many economists think it s only temporary and will stabilize once supply disruptions and other effects of the pandemic wear off but the chief economist for deutsche bank disagrees saying that the aggressive stimulus and economic changes in the u s will cause inflation to get worse for the next several years investors seem unconcerned about the prospects for future high inflation at least judging by the market s response to friday s cpi headline the crept up to a slight new record high while bond yields actually moved lower by the end of the day as for precious metals markets gold and silver each advanced slightly toward the tops of their recent trading ranges above 1 900 and 28 respectively metals markets stand to benefit from rising inflation expectations and interest rate sensitive markets including bonds stand to suffer given an inflation rate of 5 bondholders and cash savers stuck in low yielding instruments are already suffering significant real purchasing power losses yields would have to move markedly higher in order to generate positive after inflation returns but the last thing the u s treasury wants is to have to pay more interest on its ballooning debt key to keeping the government afloat financially is making sure rates stay suppressed at the same time as the fed pursues policies of higher inflation that knock down the real value of debt the scheme works as long as the public can be convinced that high inflation is transitory and that when the official measures of inflation come in relatively tame they actually capture the full extent of price levels in the economy the fed s preferred core rate of inflation excludes food and energy and fails to track actual home prices some of the biggest real world costs for consumers when the public stops believing the propaganda about inflation and starts seeking protection from it we could see a massive flight from bonds and cash into quality assets in an inflationary environment quality assets are those that can retain or gain value in real terms some stock market sectors may fare relatively well the natural resource sector in particular has the potential to generate gains amid rising inflation in general companies that have pricing power and the ability to raise their dividends would be considered high quality at the end of the day though stocks are financial assets and are vulnerable to selling off in the event of broader market instability although no asset is impervious to losing value over any given day week or month real money itself has an unparalleled track record for retaining value over time real money isn t represented by u s federal reserve notes or other fiat currencies real money is represented by gold and silver unlike financial assets physical precious metals carry no counterparty risk and are not dependent on third party promises to pay the value of gold and silver is the metal itself an argument can be made that precious metals are the highest quality assets an investor can own gold in fact is considered by the bank for international settlements to be a tier 1 asset within the banking system even central banks around the world despite refusing to redeem their fiat currencies in gold continue to hold and accumulate gold in their own reserves they evidently don t consider a portfolio consisting entirely of paper promises to be prudent a flight to quality may be coming it will be to investors advantage to accumulate quality assets including physical precious metals before the herd sends their prices much higher
by robin emmott and sabine siebold brussels berlin reuters if the u s military were a nation state it would be the world s 47th largest emitter of planet warming greenhouse gases a 2019 study found though the british universities of lancaster and durham took account only of emissions from fuel usage in their study it pointed to the huge impact that armed forces across the globe are having on the earth s climate facing a battle against global warming nato has for the first time made it a central focus of planning and strategy leaders of the western military alliance are set on monday nasdaq to agree on a climate action plan to make their armed forces carbon neutral by 2050 and to adapt to threats posed by global warming nato diplomats say efforts to focus on climate change were stymied during donald trump s u s presidency he called climate change a hoax and pulled the united states out of the international paris agreement to fight climate change trump also expressed a lack of trust in the north atlantic treaty organisation and in 2018 threatened to withdraw the united states from the alliance formed in 1949 to contain a soviet military threat now with u s president joe biden prioritising climate action the diplomats said nato was able to act on concerns that climate change is a threat both to transatlantic security and to alliance personnel this is a defining challenge of our time and we must be an organisation that leads on it a senior european nato diplomat told reuters polluters nato member states militaries have long been aware that climate change will have huge security implications expected to include increased migration flooding at coastal nato bases and a larger russian presence in the arctic as sea ice melts but to reduce their own climate warming emissions from fossil fuel use the member states require reform at the centre of the alliance because nato sets fuel standards across the organisation by committing to eliminate its net co2 emissions

february that the carbon footprint of eu military expenditure in 2019 was about 24 8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent about the same as the co2 emissions released by around 14 million cars

called on to help tackle climate driven natural disasters such crisis management is one of nato s fundamental tasks because of its ability to provide food supplies and logistical and medical support quickly in 2018 eight of the 10 countries that host the largest number of personnel involved in multilateral peace operations were in areas highly exposed to climate change according to a study by the stockholm international peace research institute allies are also testing more equipment to operate in extreme cold durability of assets on the battlefield has always been a priority european defence sources told reuters stoltenberg a former u n special envoy on climate change began pushing for a nato climate agreement before biden replaced trump calling on the alliance to take action on climate in a speech in september 2020 allies have yet to decide how much climate related investment to fund jointly at nato the security policy community now sees more clearly that climate change is a driver of conflict said jamie shea a former senior nato official now at the friends of europe think tank in brussels because military assets take decades to develop and have a longer life than civilian vehicles one of nato s biggest contributions in the medium term experts say will be in increased use of synthetic fuels instead of fossil fuels produced from water co2 and renewable energy synthetic fuels do not produce sulphur or nitrogen pollution and still have a high energy density nato s standard fuel to power planes or ships is kerosene one of the more polluting fuels the german military the bundeswehr may start adding synthetic fuel to traditional fuel in several years electric tanks however are not an option it will prove difficult to install charging stations on the battlefield in time before the fighting starts said a german defence source who declined to be named
the markets are dealing with an army of investors who are after heavily shorted stocks but there are also fundamentally strong names where initiating a short position can be risky these are the so called unshortable stocks true short squeeze rallies have delivered multi fold returns for investors amc entertainment nyse amc is the recent case of a short squeeze rally however this does not change the fact that some stocks are worth going short it s very likely that amc stock will witness an equally sharp correction that s not the case with unshortable stocks investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips my focus is on four unshortable stocks where short interest as a percentage of free float is approximately 1 two of these stocks trade near all time highs the other two are in a consolidation mode and there seems to be a high probability of a breakout on the upside the reasons for these stocks being unshortable are strong fundamentals high growth and strong cash flows additionally there are ample positive business growth catalysts on the horizon let s take a deeper look into the reasons that make these stocks unshortable nvidia nasdaq nvda target nyse tgt shopify nyse shop apple nasdaq aapl unshortable stocks nvidia nvda nvidia nvda logo displayed on phone screen source rafapress shutterstock com nvda stock is currently trading near 52 week highs however the short interest in the stock is just 1 of the free float this is probably an indication of the point that nvda stock is among the unshortable stocks from a fundamental perspective nvidia has been on a high growth trajectory for the first quarter of 2022 the company reported revenue growth of 84 to 5 66 billion growth was healthy in the gaming as well as data center segment in addition nvidia reported operating cash flow of 1 9 billion for the quarter this would imply an annualized operating cash flow of nearly 8 billion the company has high financial flexibility to invest in innovation and pursue inorganic growth story continues in a recent news nvidia has asked chinese regulators to approve the 40 billion acquisition of arm a possible approval in the coming quarters will ensure that the stock momentum remains positive with focus on artificial intelligence nvidia has also made inroads in multiple industries this includes ai chips and solutions for robotics self driving and healthcare among others therefore with multiple growth catalysts nvda stock remains attractive target tgt image of the target tgt logo on a storefront source jejim shutterstock com tgt stock is another name that i would include among unshortable stocks the stock trades near all time highs and looks good for further upside ubs analyst michael lasser sees target as structurally improved as its strong positioning becomes even clearer in upcoming quarters lasser has a price target of 265 for the stock as the u s economy witnesses wider reopening target is positioned to benefit according to moody s analytics americans were holding 2 6 trillion in excess savings as of mid april the possibility of a post pandemic consumption boom is likely to be good news for target among other retailers target has already been delivering stellar growth for the first quarter the company reported comparable sales growth of 22 9 on a year on year basis digital comparable sales growth was 50 clearly target is emerging from the pandemic with superior omni channel capabilities initiatives such as order pick up drive up and same day shipment services are likely to ensure that comparable sales growth remains strong from a financial perspective target reported cash flows of 1 1 billion for the quarter with more than 4 billion in annualized cash flow visibility dividend and share repurchase will continue overall tgt stock looks attractive considering the growth momentum with an impending spending boom it might be best to avoid shorting the stock unshortable stocks shopify shop shopify logo sign on building facade source beyond the scene shutterstock com shop stock seems to be trading at premium valuations however the stock has consolidated in the broad range of 1 000 to 1 200 short interest is low and considering the company s growth outlook the stock is among the top unshortable stocks for the first quarter shopify reported revenue growth of 110 on a year over year basis to 988 6 million an important point to note is that monthly recurring revenue accelerated by 62 to 89 9 million with sustained growth in monthly recurring revenue the company is positioned for robust long term cash flows with the pandemic e commerce growth has accelerated globally shopify is likely to benefit from positive tailwinds in the coming years it s also worth noting that the company has expanded offerings for merchants this includes shopify capital shopify shipping and shopify plus as merchants scale up there is ample scope for revenue growth as of march shopify reported 7 87 billion in cash and equivalents as the company expands globally there is ample financial flexibility to invest in platform upgrade and new merchant solutions as an example the company recently introduced shopify pos offering to merchants overall shop stock looks attractive with strong top line growth and clear visibility for robust cash flows in the long term apple aapl apple aapl logo on an apple store in santa monica california source view apart shutterstock com aapl stock is another name that too risky to bet against the company has always surprised investors and it seems that the stock is positioned for a breakout after the current consolidation with strong growth and a production innovation pipeline it s not surprising that short interest in aapl stock is less than 1 of the free float as i write reuters reports that apple is in talks with chinese manufacturers for a car battery factory in the u s the company seems to be gradually working towards its first electric vehicle that s likely to keep the markets excited apple has also witnessed strong growth in the wearables and services segment besides strong top line growth revenue is more diversified at the same time iphone sales are likely to remain robust with 5g being a key growth driver apple s cash glut also implies sustained value creation through share repurchase and possibly higher dividends of course the cash buffer gives the company ample headroom to invest in product innovation and possible acquisitions overall as strong growth sustains it s too risky to short aapl stock on the contrary current levels look attractive for considering some long term exposure on the date of publication faisal humayun did not have either directly or indirectly any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article

well known american journalist of indian origin fareed zakaria s story on how freedom is eroding in india world s largest democracy is doing the rounds on social media these days his show gps is one of the more keenly watched shows on cnn he has used the latest freedom house ranking of india and quoted leftist indian historian ram guha to substantiate his claims given zakaria s background and credentials this charge does not come as a surprise but the question is whether he is right or is he part of the opposition that includes out of power politicians pseudo liberals self aggrandising intellectuals and parts of media that deliberately refuses to recognise the fact that mr modi is a two time elected prime minister of choice in the world s largest democracy frankly there is a very strong case to see the last seven years as a period when freedom of speech and thought has been at its zenith in india since independence it requires a bit of dispassionate reflection to accept this assertion on one hand we have not seen such extensive base irrational and personality centered criticism of any other prime minister on the other the volume of anti india ranting by parts of media opposition and other bjp haters has been at its peak since they are doing so even today after seven years where is the reason to believe that freedom of speech or thought is eroding in the country in fact such freedom is at its pinnacle since 1947 there are many reasons to say this and some obvious ones are prior to bjp coming to power in 2014 some influential media personalities liberals and intellectuals who are today part of the opposition were indirectly running and influencing the past governments from the outside by being inside the political power circles they enjoyed immense power and financial health but now they are out of work this has prompted them to spread the falsehood of erosion of freedom but the fact is that these people are still running free in the capital without any erosion of any of their freedoms the government has accepted anti modi rhetoric as part of freedom but it has not been so magnanimous when national interests have been at stake if some mavericks or upstarts in politics or social circles propagate breaking up of the nation or promote communal hatred should they not be taken to task if their freedom is curtailed to safeguard national interests how can that be termed as erosion of freedom nationalism is not taboo anymore and it is a good word in india today in last seven years some in the hindu majority have found a voice and are not hesitant to speak up for their nation or counter those who speak against it this is a fundamental change in the indian society that irks the opposition surely this is not erosion of freedom on the contrary it is strengthening of freedom the opposition deliberately presents the government as pro hindu with a hindutwa agenda a charge that they cannot substantiate with any hard evidence since the governance has followed the principle of sabka saath sabka vikaas in pursuance of their falsehood the opposition makes a lot of noise if a muslim is the victim in any communal incident but observe pin drop silence if it is a hindu opposition makes a beeline to visit muslim victims homes to flood their families with funds and jobs but that zeal and zest is noticeably missing if it is a hindu if some bjp cadres and supporters raise their voice against this injustice the opposition terms it as majority domination and minority suppression in one breath how can raising voice for minorities be freedom but doing the same for majority be otherwise majority that was never heard of for decades has found some voice today and that does not go well the opposition it is termed as rise of hindu fundamentalism but these very people fail to see any rise of fanaticism in islam despite the entire non muslim world being seized of this problem for decades now freedom had eroded when over 80 of indians had no voice for decades if today a part of this 80 has found a voice it can only be viewed as strengthening the cause of freedom government freebies are being controlled and distributed without middlemen who were mainly from the opposition so siphoning off government resources with impunity is a thing of past many of these middlemen are poorer today is freeing the common man from their clutches not a move towards strengthening of freedom corruption at higher levels has nearly been rooted out resulting in a dwindling of ill gotten gains for politicians and their parties ad hoc grants to liberals ngos and others to ensure their goodwill and support which was rampant under previous government is history now dubious funding from abroad for anti national activities too is now under the scanner the cries of erosion of freedom emanate from the frustrations of erstwhile beneficiaries of such grants and funding can any indian term the integration of jammu and kashmir into mainstream india as anti national was this correction not long overdue that has cost india dear in the last seventy years were the governments in the past not guilty of maintaining the status quo to please a few in the state were the governments not blind and impotent when it came to taking action against major anti national happenings in the border state like the planned ethnic cleansing of lakhs of hindus from the valley in 1990 was it not freedom of expression when critics of all hues and colours were given all the freedom to speak against the government on the abrogation of articles 370 and 35a they do so even today without any fear of any rule book being thrown at them by all counts the citizens of this border state are freer today than ever before they are free from the clutches of the three families that have ruled them for over six decades they are free to enjoy full democratic rights as enjoyed by indian citizens elsewhere and have the freedom to seek growth and development something that was denied to them by design since independence the same is true for the citizen amendment act that was passed by the parliament the protests raged on for months with hate and anti national speeches galore at the protest sites even children were coached to raise anti government slogans and issue threats against elected leaders did these protestors not enjoy full freedom of speech expression or thought a few who have been charged have full recourse to law of the land it is to governments credit that it did not exhibit any high handedness or excessive force yet the charge is that freedom is eroding in india this is bizarre to say the least diplomatically india s stock has risen many notches in last few years mr modi counts among the top leaders of the world today internationally his personal equation with some of the tallest leaders in the world irks many many important islamic nations that have always cheered for pakistan support india now these are no mean achievements but the opposition cannot stomach this international success since they still view him as a humble chaiwala from gujarat the aid that flew into india during the second coronavirus wave in last few months holds testimony to mr modi s stature and india s diplomatic success if india was indeed floundering on the freedom index this goodwill would never have been seen from different corners of the globe even the pandemic was not spared by those who blame the government for erosion of freedom while exercising it fully albeit at the cost of the nation when the need was for standing with the government and augmenting its efforts they exercised their freedom of expression thought and action to create hurdles in the path of the government from calling the indigenously developed covaxin a bjp vaccine they went all out to promote vaccine hesitancy among the people instead of helping migrant workers reach their native states they played politics on the issue instead of setting their own house in order they invariably blamed the centre and mr modi for the shortcomings in fighting the virus was the opposition not exploiting their freedom in doing so the last in the list is freedom of the media a large section of media that is no friend of the present government has continued to enjoy as much freedom as those who are supportive of the government the fact that the prime minister sticks mainly to state run media is a matter of choice and can in no way be termed as curtailment of freedom of the media all private media houses continue to air not only their viewpoints but also those of the opposition with impunity is freedom an absolute right can it ever be infinite the bombay high court had rightly ruled in september last year that the freedom of speech and expression provided under article 19 of the constitution was not an absolute right in a democratic society one has the right to freedom of all kinds as long as it does not hurt or curtail the same for someone else this also means that if national interests are compromised by the freedom being exercised by some then the government is duty bound to curtail the same this is so because national interests translate into the interests of citizens of the nation no government can always be correct and so is the case with mr modi s government as a corollary it is also true that no government can always be wrong there will always be people who are opposed to a government in power that is an inherent part of a democracy the citizens in a democracy have the freedom and the right to elect the leaders and government of their choice the opposition must honour this freedom of choice if they do not then they abuse the democratic rights and freedom of the entire nation the opposition has the right to support or oppose the government if this is merit based it helps the nation however if the opposition pursues the singular agenda of only opposing an elected government come what may that will be undemocratic if they do so then they are guilty of misusing the rights and freedom that the constitution gives them facebook twitter linkedin email disclaimer views expressed above are the

a few words about the makers and the takers that as you may recall was the formulation once favored by fox news and other organs of the political right to describe the dynamic between those at the top of the economic pyramid and those at the bottom the poor characterized as scavenging animals by more than one conservative were said to contribute nothing to our society while mooching off their financial betters but it is worth re examining the whole makers and takers paradigm in light of last week s jarring report from propublica the nonprofit online newsroom it was based on a trove of irs information provided by an anonymous source and it laid out in granular detail the strategies used by the wealthiest people in america to get away with paying little or nothing in taxes take for instance jeff bezos amazon founder and world s richest man with a net worth estimated by forbes at 192 billion we are told that he paid nothing in taxes in 2007 and 2011 and a relative pittance in other years not to pick on bezos elon musk michael bloomberg warren buffett and other ginormously rich people all reportedly employ the same strategy to avoid taxes which is to say they pay themselves minimal salaries as little as a dollar a year in some cases and keep their wealth in the form of stocks bonds and other financial instruments which the irs does not consider income and taxes at a much lower rate for comparison propublica says the median american tax rate in recent years is 14 but it calculates bezos true tax rate between 2014 and 2018 i e factoring the growth of his assets in with his reported income at under 1 it says that when people like him need actual cash they simply borrow against their massive assets interest on such loans runs in the low single digits and the proceeds are not considered income and therefore are not taxable all of this is perfectly legal by the way also perfectly infuriating and here let me just say i believe in capitalism i believe that when you incentivize earning you incentivize risk taking innovation and hard work but i also believe something is wrong when ceo pay rose by about 1 000 percent between 1978 and 2018 while worker pay edged up just 12 percent something is wrong when working full time doesn t put a roof over your head or food on your table something is wrong when an amazon driver complains of 14 hour shifts and peeing in bottles to make his delivery quotas something is wrong when employees at tyson and other meat packers report wearing diapers to work because conveyor belts are relentless and bathroom breaks denied i also believe that paying taxes is a patriotic duty onerous you bet but patriotic just the same it s how we fund our governments local and national and the services they provide everything from road maintenance fire and police to military defense food safety and environmental cleanup we all benefit from those services whether ginormously wealthy pitiably poor or somewhere in between any tax code that allows the rich to freeload on that which is paid for by the rest of us is morally bankrupt and in need of overhaul moreover it gives the lie to the right wing s lavish contempt for the poor in the wake of propublica s report maybe we should reconsider who the makers really are and who is taking what from whom leonard pitts is a columnist for the miami herald tribune content agency distribute his columns

the phrase poor jeff bezos is probably not much uttered i won t try to say it now without irony but when propublica reported this week that jeff bezos michael bloomberg warren buffett bill gates rupert murdoch elon musk george soros and mark zuckerberg were among billionaires who paid little or no income tax in recent years bezos took most of the social media vitriol the founder of amazon had a net worth of about 18 billion in 2011 but reportedly paid no taxes and he got 4 000 in child tax credits bezos paid no taxes because most of his wealth came from company stock which isn t taxed until it s sold he has four children with his then wife mackenzie scott which entitled them to a 1 000 tax credit for each child why would someone worth 18 billion be given any child tax credits we spoke with elaine maag principal research associate in the urban brookings tax policy center at the urban institute who also once worked at the irs did we intend for jeff bezos to get this credit she asked probably not i can t imagine he had too much trouble finding and paying for child care she says that when the child tax credit was introduced in 1998 its purpose was to aid low and middle income families ninety percent of u s taxpayers with children receive that credit now set at 2 000 per child and even higher this year with a temporary increase from the american rescue plan which i think is good for the country maag told us to keep the percentage of families who receive the credit high all any taxpayer including jeff bezos has to do is enter their income on their tax form and the number of dependent children people claim the credit as part of the regular tax filing process maag said i don t even know how anyone would opt out maag like many tax analysts who spoke out this week said the crucial question isn t why a billionaire gets a child tax credit it s how can so many wealthy people utterly legally avoid paying taxes by getting paid in stocks rather than wages then borrow against their total assets to purchase multiple estates private aircraft historic artwork and the services of attorneys and tax consultants who i ll just guess charge more for their services than a 2 000 child tax credit i think the child tax credit is good for us all maag said i just wish more people would pay more taxes on what is their real income that would be fair copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

disruption in the global container shipping industry shows no sign of being resolved quickly and could lead to shortages in the run up to christmas say industry experts photo satellite image 2021 maxar technologies afp an outbreak of covid 19 in guangdong province in southern china has caused acute congestion at the region s ports as a result shipments have been delayed exacerbating tensions within global supply chains and the knock on effects could take many months to resolve the problems in guangdong are just the latest in a series of severe setbacks for the industry shipping firms have been struggling to cope with dramatic fluctuations in demand triggered by the pandemic as well as the consequences from the recent blockage of the suez canal the global nature of the sector and the lack of spare capacity within it means that problems in one region can have ripple effects around the world for several months yantian international container terminal is one of a number of ports in the shenzhen region which collectively form a vital gateway for exports from the pearl river delta a major chinese centre for manufacturing and technology but since late may the terminal has been operating at a fraction of its normal capacity with operations restricted due to attempts to control the spread of covid 19 this has led to severe congestion with dozens of ships waiting outside the port for a berth to become available one of the biggest ports in china has basically closed down for close to three weeks they have some berths in operation but nowhere near enough said nils haupt communications director at the german shipping line hapag lloyd over the past few days shipping lines have been diverting vessels away from yantian to other nearby terminals in the delta area but according to haupt that has been creating its own problems you can use ports like shekhou you can use nansha you can use hong kong but what we re seeing right now is that delays are piling up there as well he said traffic jams the growing crisis in southern china is just the latest blow to hit the shipping industry which has been suffering from acute disruption for more than a year a dramatic slowdown in the early stages of the pandemic was followed by a frenzy of activity as customers unable to travel or socialise in their normal ways ordered more consumer goods this sudden shift in demand from famine to feast threw delicately balanced supply chains out of kilter ports in europe and north america became clogged with too many vessels arriving at the same time while the supply of empty containers for new consignments dried up because too many of them were sitting at quaysides around the world then came the blockage of the suez canal in march the closure of one of the world s busiest shipping lanes delayed hundreds of ships but when it reopened the sudden arrival of the delayed vessels triggered new congestion at european hubs such as rotterdam and antwerp we were just beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel said haupt but then unfortunately we ran into this situation in yantian photo rnz kymberlee fernandes constant crisis according to peter sands chief shipping analyst at the industry organisation bimco the sector is used to responding to crises on a global network scale these states of emergency are a permanent situation right now he explained but the issue with yantian is we need more transparency and openness from the local authorities and we aren t getting that which means there is a lot of uncertainty in developing contingency plans the hope within the industry is that the situation in yantian will be resolved as rapidly as possible although experts warn that when that happens it will lead to a surge in shipments from the region which could cause further bottlenecks elsewhere in the supply chain because the system is so overloaded every time one of these things happens now the system is already at breaking point or past breaking point so anything else just adds grist to the mill explained james baker containers editor at shipping industry publication lloyd s list for this reason he expects the disruption to continue for at least another 12 months with consumers in europe and north america continuing to face much longer waits than normal for their goods crazy christmas for retailers this raises the real prospect of a shortage of goods ahead of the christmas shopping period even under normal circumstances they begin to acquire seasonal stocks from china months in advance with the process beginning in the late summer one of the issues at the moment which is aiding the congestion is the fact that everyone knows that the lead times are really slow so retailers are booking their christmas goods already baker said traditionally the peak season for container shipping starts in the third quarter as everyone stocks up for the holiday season in the west but this year we re just in a permanent peak season already and heaven knows what s going to happen come august or september it could get crazy it s very hard to tell the situation could improve he said but slightly tongue in cheek perhaps he has some advice for consumers if you want to get something for your family for christmas start shopping now bbc

doesn t have to worry about setting cash aside to cover credit delinquencies when inevitable recessions arise this is a big reason why mastercard s operating margins are consistently north of 40 with

dear editor jeannette schael in a previous letter to the editor rightly slams deforestation for cattle and livestock feed but obvious ideas like spurning brazilian beef and meat from any soya fed livestock are sadly not a silver bullet other destruction includes coca colombia coltan dr congo sugar cane for biofuels brazil palm oil south east asia rubber trees vietnam plus logging other cash crops and different mineral extraction across various countries criticism is easy but developing countries can be seduced by such ideas in their understandable pursuit of western lifestyles and jobs to afford them profits determine land and resource usage while human activities are capable of wrecking the planet several times over even if more food is produced in far less space there is a far saner alternative tribal people show conservation can be combined with careful usage although we can t all live like that but harvard biologist eo wilson took the idea further in the diversity of life he showed how rainforests could be carefully and profitably be used in situ the problem here is equally obvious though major investment is needed up front coupled with persuading or even bribing the countries involved to adopt such measures ecuador found oil in its yassuni national park a few years ago and offered to leave it in the ground if the country were compensated all the words about conserving rainforests being vital then counted for little as most wallets remained firmly closed well off westerners need to realise that avoiding ecological meltdown does not just depend on limited lifestyle changes but will have major impacts on their convenience choice and finances this won t be popular iain climie whitchurch brexit view dear editor you kindly invited those of us who hold a different view of brexit to the one espoused by jennifer godshall johnson letters to the editor june 4 2021 my view is some of us do not view the eu through rose tinted spectacles as worn by jennifer like many i voted to join the common market 47 years ago and have not forgotten the butter mountain and olive oil and wine lakes as the common agricultural policy funded french italian and danish farmers to over produce but 47 years later we have the eu attempting to position itself as a global superpower while enforcing protectionist measures to protect french and german interests the european commission has traditionally protected the interests of the self interested germans and massaged the huge egos of the spiteful french jennifer should ask how many uk companies were awarded eu contracts or how many uk citizens were employed by the commission or its agencies during our membership after 10 years of trade negotiations the swiss have withdrawn from trade talks as the eu is impossible to deal with ask the greeks if the eu was helpful in restoring the greek economy after the financial crisis the italian economy does not meet the criteria for eu membership the eu parliament and commission is a huge cash cow and provider of jobs for the belgians who acquiesce every german or french proposal or demand the budget to which the uk was the second largest contributor has never been successfully audited millions are unaccounted for and further millions are wasted annually as the eu parliament de cants from brussels to strasbourg for a few days to satisfy the french rest assured the eu france and germany in particular were never our friends this has been confirmed by the attitude of merkel and macron and their predecessors both pre and post brexit ask our fisherman if they had fair access to the fish stocks in our own waters brexit was not the success we hoped for yet but that is due to the belligerence of the eu junker verhofstadt tusk selmayer et al barnier is french the outcome was all we could hope for my alternative view is formed from living and working in germany 15 years where my children were born the usa 3 years norway 1 year and latterly belgium 3 years britain never had the internal influence to be an eu superpower brexit can never be overturned we are where we are onwards allan law andover tale of a volunteer dear editor as news of the new coronavirus started to emerge from china in january 2020 i like many i suspect thought that it wouldn t affect us here but then as the virus swept the world and the numbers piled up we began to face the enormity of it but what could i do i m an ex teacher with grade 4 cse maths so i m not going to be much use then came the call for volunteers to help at the vaccine centre to be set up at the lights theatre in andover i submitted my name and received an email confirming i was on the list the very day that i received another letter saying i should continue to shield until march 31 salvation was at hand in that i had the date booked for my first dose of the vaccine on january 21 so i requested that i remain on the list until three weeks after that first jab when i would feel safe enough to do some of the outdoor duties so on february 26 i reported for my first shift two hours 8am 10am ushering people into the car park and pointing them in the right direction that first shift was remarkable i hadn t expected the effect it would have on me i was suddenly overwhelmed as i realised that i was a tiny tiny wheel in this huge movement that was going on not all over the uk but all over the world in an effort to rid ourselves of this threat there is something in the british psyche that instantly seeks this response to be involved and do our bit within days of the threat of lockdown becoming real a volunteer group to help with shopping etc had been set up in the village where i live i joined that list as a volunteer but had to withdraw as a result of the shielding order and almost immediately after informing the organisers that i would have to withdraw i was contacted to see if i needed any assistance the atmosphere at the vaccine centre is one of complete positivity almost without exception everyone who comes in is excited and pleased to be there as they arrive and then as they leave the sense of gratitude relief and euphoria is palpable there is a great sense of camaraderie among the volunteers i ve met great people who are giving up their time to be part of history because that is what we are living in now children in the future will come home from school and say gran you were alive in the great pandemic of 2020 21 what was it like it makes you realise just how effective that ww1 poster what did you do in the great war daddy must have been at the time inside the actual vaccine centre all is calm and business like as person after person comes in and is treated in exactly the same way asked the same questions time after time those who may be feeling apprehensive for whatever reason are given some extra time with a vaccinator who answers questions to help them come to terms with their fears and to ease their way through to getting their dose in my life i have been involved in community drama cricket hockey and many other organisations this is the best thing i ve ever done it has helped me to deal with the tension that we all have felt as the crisis unfolded when i was a student i appeared in shakespeare s play hamlet no i didn t play hamlet i was bernardo probably the smallest role in the cast but i had the first line who s there if i didn t come on and say that line the rest of the play couldn t happen that was when i discovered i liked being part of a team sometimes you get to play hamlet but more often than not you re just bernardo asking who s there name and address supplied
senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky is looking to split president biden from his progressive base by expressing an openness to a possible bipartisan infrastructure deal that is much smaller than biden s preferred plan liberal lawmakers also want a bigger package and they distrust mcconnell who they think may be aiming to string democrats and biden along with signals of support for a bipartisan deal crafted by 10 senators yet it is difficult for biden to stiff arm the deal since he has been making a serious effort to reach a bipartisan consensus on infrastructure while pivoting a gridlocked washington from the trump era senate republican aides say mcconnell is daring biden to split with progressives who want to shut down the bipartisan talks and pile as much of biden s 4 1 trillion spending agenda as possible into a budget reconciliation package which under complicated senate rules could bypass a filibuster and avoid the need for gop support if democrats stick together one republican aide who requested anonymity to discuss strategy said mcconnell s posture all along has been he s willing to work with biden if he s moderate the question is whether democrats are willing to swallow that and that s unclear at this point the gop aide added the source predicted that senate democrats will either coalesce or liberals led by sens bernie sanders i vt and sen elizabeth warren d mass will firebomb the package because it doesn t give them what they want progressives in the senate and house have been ramping up calls to drop negotiations with republicans and move forward with the reconciliation package mcconnell by contrast has encouraged moderate republicans to come up with a bipartisan deal as long as it s focused on traditional infrastructure and doesn t cost much more than 600 billion in new funding or raise taxes mitch is open said a republican senator who met with mcconnell on wednesday the lawmaker who requested anonymity to discuss a private meeting said mcconnell told negotiators they can disclose that he is interested in seeing progress on a bipartisan deal democrats are expected to try to move a reconciliation package whether they get a bipartisan deal or not but mcconnell s calculation is that if there is a bipartisan bill passed democrats will have a tougher time getting votes for the reconciliation package mcconnell s strategy is divide and conquer he wants to drive a wedge between biden and progressive democrats and he knows if he can do that one he creates big problems for biden and two he limits biden s ability to pass transformative legislation said darrell west director of governance studies at the left leaning brookings institution the early indication from the white house is that biden and his senior staff don t like some of the bipartisan group s proposals for paying for their spending plan such as adjusting the gas tax to inflation and requiring a mileage fee for electric vehicles that may be enough of an excuse for biden to come out against the bipartisan framework or simply withhold his support shooting down the bipartisan proposal would make it more likely democrats move only one infrastructure package this year which would be welcome news to progressive democrats progressives such as sanders warren sen bob casey d pa and sen sheldon whitehouse d r i want hundreds of billions of dollars for expanded child care universal pre kindergarten and long term home health care as well as authority for the government to negotiate lower prescription drug prices and new incentives for clean energy production they think those proposals stand a better chance of becoming law if combined with traditional infrastructure in the reconciliation package progressives worry that passing a scaled down package focused on core physical infrastructure with republican votes in the summer or early fall will diminish the appetite within their party for passing the rest of biden s social infrastructure agenda the trillions are starting to add up each trillion in new expenditure makes it more difficult to do anything else west said it just becomes harder to keep democrats on the same page a few centrist democrats are raising concerns about a recent uptick in inflation which larry summers who served as director of former president obama s national economic council warns could get worse if the federal government keeps spending we are printing money we are creating government bonds we are borrowing on unprecedented scales summers warned those things that surely create more of a risk for a sharp dollar decline than we had before and sharp dollar declines are much more likely to translate themselves into inflation than they were historically mcconnell has seized on summers s warnings to further split democrats one survey just found that more than 80 percent of american families are tightening their household budgets because of the threat of inflation the gop leader said on the senate floor wednesday no wonder larry summers says he s concerned that these proposals are quote substantially excessive way overdoing the requisite response he said key democratic moderates including senators who signed their names this week to the bipartisan infrastructure framework are paying more attention to inflation it s concerning said sen joe manchin d w va in response to a report thursday that the consumer price index for may had risen 5 percent compared to a year ago it s challenging it makes it hard on the average person out there trying to make it manchin said sen jon tester d mont another signatory to the bipartisan deal says that fast rising lumber prices is a major issue in his home state the other democrats backing the new bipartisan infrastructure deal are sens jeanne shaheen n h mark warner va and kyrsten sinema ariz republican strategist vin weber said moderate democrats may be having second thoughts about passing all of biden s 4 1 trillion infrastructure agenda after polls show the president s approval rating didn t get much of a boost from the passage of the 1 9 trillion american rescue package which didn t get a single republican vote in either chamber he did exactly what he wanted for a hundred days and it didn t help his standing so if you re a democrat looking at the thing you re thinking maybe we better be careful about how aggressive we get because maybe don t have the mandate that we thought we had in the wake of those two georgia senate wins he said referring to the two democratic upset victories in the january senate runoff elections in georgia which gave democrats the senate majority biden s job approval rating stood at 54 percent in mid may according to gallup while that was 15 points better than where president trump was at the same point in his presidency it was 11 points lower than where president obama stood in may 2009 the average approval rating as measured by gallup for u s presidents after their first four months in office is 53 percent the average goes back to 1938 i don t if the democrats are divided yet but i bet there are a whole lot of them that are really having second thoughts about the aggressiveness of the biden fiscal agenda weber said

they share several things in common including potential catalysts most investors would be pleased as punch if their stocks doubled within five years that s the kind of return that could lead to game changing wealth but what if you could find stocks that could deliver 100 or more gains in a much shorter period of time such stocks with that potential do exist i d put ayr wellness ayrw f 2 93 and cresco labs crlbf 5 24 near the top of the list of possible contenders here s why these two stocks could realistically double in the second half of 2021 common denominators ayr and cresco share several common denominators most importantly they re both u s multi state cannabis operators ayr currently operates in six states while cresco has operations in 10 states the two marijuana stocks have performed pretty well so far this year but they re a long way from delivering 100 gains that shouldn t be a problem though both ayr and cresco more than doubled in the second half of 2020 neither stock would have been likely to achieve such impressive returns without also generating strong sales growth the momentum from last year for ayr and cresco has continued into 2021 ayr reported 74 year over year revenue growth in its first quarter cresco also delivered better than expected q1 results with revenue soaring nearly 169 year over year there are other u s pot stocks that are also growing fast why single out ayr and cresco as the most likely to double in the second half of 2021 valuation the shares of both ayr and cresco currently trade at price to sales multiples that are well below their peers potential catalysts i fully expect that ayr and cresco will continue to benefit from the expanding cannabis markets where they already have established operations however that probably won t be enough to fuel 100 gains over the next six months or so the good news is that there are potential catalysts that could enable both of these stocks to double during the period for one thing ayr and cresco should see turbocharged growth thanks to key acquisitions ayr recently closed on its purchase of liberty health sciences a deal that gives the company the fourth biggest retail footprint in florida s medical cannabis market it expects to finalize an acquisition in the fast growing new jersey market this summer likewise cresco is now competing in the florida medical cannabis market thanks to its april acquisition of bluma wellness the company should wrap up its buyout of massachusetts based cultivate in the fourth quarter of this year the biggest potential catalysts for ayr and cresco though would benefit all marijuana stocks i m referring to the prospects for significant cannabis reform at the federal level in the u s legislative efforts are under way to remove restrictions that limit cannabis companies from accessing traditional banking services and to remove marijuana from the controlled substances act the latter legislation wouldn t legalize marijuana at the federal level however if enacted into law it would mean that marijuana is no longer federally illegal that would pave the way for ayr and cresco to list their shares on a major u s stock exchange a move that would almost certainly cause the stocks to skyrocket no slam dunk note that i m not predicting that ayr or cresco stocks will for sure double by the end of this year there are far too many things that could go wrong for me to step out on that limb however while it s by no means a slam dunk i think there is a realistic path for both stocks to double in the second half of 2021 ayr wellness ceo jonathan sandelman recently stated in an interview with my motley fool colleague eric volkman public sentiment is clearly on the side of cannabis legalization and state and local governments will continue to follow even if the federal government takes a while to figure out how to approach federal cannabis legalization i think sandelman is right even if ayrs and cresco stocks don t double this year both should be able to deliver tremendous gains for investors over the long run

boils down to this the company is experiencing a groundswell campaign to boost its shares a wave led by a group of extremely amateur online investors events similar to the ones that unfolded around gamestop last winter in january amc its business largely shuttered by the pandemic sported a market valuation of under 1 billion it s worth approximately 25 billion today as ever volatile stock ended last week a little under 50 it has averaged close to a quarter million mentions across social media recently a dramatic swing from only a few thousand daily mentions a year ago according to data from meltwater a maker of social listening software one of trey collins first youtube videos devoted to covering amc back in january collins has emerged as a something like a de facto chieftain within the insurgent amc investor group when fox business and cnbc recently went looking for someone to speak for the average joe horde they put him on the air and when amc chief executive adam aron wanted to address this crowd last week he did so not by speaking with a traditional media outlet like a fox business or a cnbc but by granting an interview to collins a conversation collins split into two youtube videos since his trey s trades youtube channel launched in december it has accumulated 330 000 subscribers a red hot start for any newcomer on the site where fame tends to take considerably longer to build than on instagram and tiktok collins is indicative of the investing set behind the extreme price movement upending the shares of gamestop amc and other companies like wendy s and blackberry seemingly irrespective of their corporate fundamentals to use these investors slang these are meme stocks or put with crude humor stonks collins has no formal finance education and is not some professional investor stationed behind a bloomberg terminal he maintains a day job while living on the web as much as possible he s gotten rich quickly turning 8 000 in savings last december into roughly 1 million today through trading amc stock and options i think people appreciate that i m just a regular guy collins says they view it as confirmation you don t have to have been in the market for five ten 15 years to make money his outsized voice and unabashed enthusiasm for amc amount to flagrant violations of finance s traditional rules and norms where retail investors are rarely seen and certainly not heard while media members covering or commenting on a company are not also investors in the business it does make for compelling youtube content it s the same psychology as if you re in a casino you walk by the roulette table and you see someone throw down 50 000 says matt kohrs 26 who runs a competing youtube channel covering amc it s a crazy bet there s no way you re not going to watch it play out that s the attraction to it and then maybe once caught up in the moment you also throw down some money on black too b y rights collins shouldn t have been gambling like this at all he grew up in minnesota and had a rotc scholarship to get through st john s university an hour north of minneapolis his father died a year into college and in summer 2019 collins found himself living on his own working as a bartender and server at a buffalo wild wings i d work from 11 in the morning until 11 at night he recalls and i would have my car in the parking lot of the wild wings i d crash in the backseat after i got done working then wake up and do it again at st john s he studied nutrition and ran track and field and we got a lot more out of him than we might ve expected given his high school credentials says his university coach tim miles he s a terrific runner and well he s in every way a personality collins graduated in may 2020 and assumed active duty after an injury forced him to stop long distance running he found himself with more free time a buddy had already caught the day trading bug and passed it along to collins he s hype all the time and i like that says one amc investor who is also a fan of collins youtube it transfers to me it makes me hyped about it to bone up i read some books and watched successful traders on youtube he says from september until november i spent about two to three hours a day studying technical analysis examining charts showing short term stock price movements an activity akin to talmudic scholarship for some traders and little more than tea leaf reading for other investors collins thin sandy haired his right arm sheathed in tattoos had previously tried to achieve youtube stardom with a channel devoted to running advice it flopped never getting more than 400 subscribers when trey s trades started in december his first few videos touched on a variety of stocks but when the gamestop mania started to spread to amc in the spring collins switched to vlogging almost exclusively about amc a side from an active twitter presence and a few initial videos posted to reddit investing forums collins insists his youtube growth has been entirely organic going from 13 500 subscribers at the end of january to over 150 000 three months later he cultivated a cult following further by borrowing the cliquey slang from the reddit board behind the gamestop rally an amateur investor interested in a meme stock is an ape a reference to the elevated primates in the planet of the apes movies and stock gains are tendies a circular allusion to other relishable items chicken tenders collins won t say exactly what he does other than he works 8 to 5 in the army that s as much as i m allowed to say or i can get in trouble somehow he finds time to post several 15 to 20 minute videos per day covering what happened with the stock and offering pointers on the trading chart sometimes he also does a multi hour livestream too he sees amc both as a potential for quick trades and extended plays too viewing it as a more plausible comeback story than gamestop i believe it s got a stronger fundamental future i don t think the market for movie theaters is going to go anywhere his recording set up is basic two computer screens and a cheap 4k webcam purchased at bestbuy set up on the desk at the oklahoma hotel he s been lodged at for the past few months the barebones video quality doesn t bother trey s trades fans such as nicolas davies a 25 year old baptist pastor from mt savage maryland online investors like davies say collins videos analyzing and promoting amc are why they ve bought the stock and stuck with it they re equally unbothered by his obvious conflict of interest trading the shares while heralding them too he s hype all the time and i like that says davies who invested a few thousand dollars into the stock when it traded for under 20 a couple weeks ago i think it s important to see somebody being passionate and energetic it transfers to me it makes me hyped about it my wife is probably sick of hearing about amc at this point but i ve dove headfirst into it amc ceo adam aron has embraced the retail investors buoying his stock speaking directly to them and even offering a free in theater popcorn giveaway for shareholders getty images for cinemacon his most popular videos have been his interview with amc s chief executive adam aron an audience that came together somewhat spontaneously i tweeted at him on twitter and he reached back out to me on twitter about a week and a half later he said he followed my channel because his son watches me on youtube collins says a recent appearance on cnbc s squawk box went less successfully the show s cohost andrew ross sorkin tripped up collins and collins seemed to admit he had overvalued the shares in the past collins says he botched an attempt to draw a distinction between the stock s short term potential and long term fundamental value my plan when the amc storybook is done being written which i don t think it is continue to educate the new breed of investors in the stock market the apes he says

andrew biggio veteran and founder of annual wounded vet ride pens first book adrew biggio s basement at his winthrop home has been converted into a museum of sorts with display cases of war memorabilia artifacts and other keepsakes he s collected since serving his tours of duty as a us marine in iraq and afghanistan biggio who founded the boston wounded vet ride that would roar through east boston and revere every year to raise money for wounded vets is busy organizing a countertop stacked with autographs of the 22 world war ii veterans that have been immortalized in his first ever book there are people who got the book and want an autograph of one of the vets that appears explains biggio with a book tour and book signings on the immediate horizon biggio says this is the best way to ensure readers get an autograph of one of the vets that appears in the book we just don t know how much longer they ll be around he says according to the us department of veterans affairs statistics 325 574 of the 16 million americans who served in world war ii are alive but around 296 die every day in the us in a race against time biggio began a quest five years ago to get as many world war ii veterans on the record from across the us and from every branch of the military and tell their story the result was the rifle combat stories from america s last wwii veterans told through an m1 garand which was released on amazon last week and quickly became the 1 best selling united states military veterans history book on the website the idea from the book stemmed from his experience returning home from the wars in iraq and afghanistan i served in iraq and afghanistan and i came home and i m pretty confident i m okay i m fine said biggio what bothered me was coming to winthrop every day and seeing that andrew biggio square sign it s not dedicated to me but to my grandfather s brother who was killed in world war ii and i m named after him so to see a sign that says andrew biggio memorial square just made me feel really bad for that andrew biggio so i began to ask what happened to him that didn t happen to me i really started asking questions about this poor 19 year old kid from winthrop who was killed in italy in 1944 biggio remembered his grandmother saying she had saved letters from her late brother in law that he wrote home before he was killed so i went into a shoe box at their bedside and began reading the letters said biggio one of the first letters he talked about how much he enjoyed the m1 garand rifle so i immediately ran out and bought one because i wanted to hold it i want to connect to this long lost relative and feel what he felt holding that rifle while showing friends and relatives his new purchase biggio said they didn t seem that impressed with the world war ii relic so he had an idea i figured i d do one better and bring it to a marine i knew who lived in west roxbury said biggio biggio headed over the westie with the rifle to visit 91 year old joe drago so i knocked on his door and i noticed he had gotten really skinny his legs were atrophied and he was bound to a recliner like most men in their 90s he said but when i put the rifle into his hands to show him what i got i got a totally different reaction than everyone else he puts it to his shoulder he s waving it around he s aiming and he s talking endlessly about the rifle so that s what i knew i was on to something because i just saw this 91 year old man become a 19 year old kid again so biggio had drago sign the rifle s stock because he didn t want to ever forget the moment we talked about his participation in the battle of okinawa for about two hours and after i left his house i looked down at the rifle and i was hooked said biggio i decided right there and then i wanted to get as many signatures on this rifle as possible if joe drago was a little taste of the pacific i wanted to get a guy who fought in europe next and then italy for the next five years with the rifle in tow biggio visited every corner of the us seeking wwii vets willing to talk about their experiences in the war and sign the one thing that bound them all together i was very careful to let them know this wasn t going to be a book that glorifies war said biggio some of the guys signed the rifle but wouldn t hold it because they vowed they d never hold a gun again after the war and those are some of the stories i wanted to hear i wanted to hear the reasons why they felt that way because the younger generation of vets coming home can really learn a lot from this generation that is getting smaller and smaller by the day so now that his research and work is complete and the book published after years of work biggio said he was really surprised by the reaction as it shot to 1 in its category on amazon before it was released there was a lot of anticipation and anxiety said biggio i knew i was doing good by bringing a lot of light to wwii veterans but to put a physical book out there that s going to be looked at by other historians and authors who ve already written multiple books about wwii was a little nerve wracking but what makes my book a little different is that it s really just a bond between a young veteran and the veterans of wwii and for us the young veterans it s really a way for us to learn from the older generation about the costs of war and life after war many in the book definitely hit bumps in the road but they bounced back raised families and went on to live long successful lives after war ultimately it is proof that if they can go through the hell and carnage they went through and live as long as they did we all can

the phrase poor jeff bezos is probably not much uttered i won t try to say it now without irony but when propublica reported this week that jeff bezos michael bloomberg warren buffett bill gates rupert murdoch elon musk george soros and mark zuckerberg were among billionaires who paid little or no income tax in recent years bezos took most of the social media vitriol the founder of amazon had a net worth of about 18 billion in 2011 but reportedly paid no taxes and he got 4 000 in child tax credits bezos paid no taxes because most of his wealth came from company stock which isn t taxed until it s sold he has four children with his then wife mackenzie scott which entitled them to a 1 000 tax credit for each child why would someone worth 18 billion be given any child tax credits we spoke with elaine maag principal research associate in the urban brookings tax policy center at the urban institute who also once worked at the irs did we intend for jeff bezos to get this credit she asked probably not i can t imagine he had too much trouble finding and paying for child care she says that when the child tax credit was introduced in 1998 its purpose was to aid low and middle income families ninety percent of u s taxpayers with children receive that credit now set at 2 000 per child and even higher this year with a temporary increase from the american rescue plan which i think is good for the country maag told us to keep the percentage of families who receive the credit high all any taxpayer including jeff bezos has to do is enter their income on their tax form and the number of dependent children people claim the credit as part of the regular tax filing process maag said i don t even know how anyone would opt out maag like many tax analysts who spoke out this week said the crucial question isn t why a billionaire gets a child tax credit it s how can so many wealthy people utterly legally avoid paying taxes by getting paid in stocks rather than wages then borrow against their total assets to purchase multiple estates private aircraft historic artwork and the services of attorneys and tax consultants who i ll just guess charge more for their services than a 2 000 child tax credit i think the child tax credit is good for us all maag said i just wish more people would pay more taxes on what is their real income that would be fair copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
the next stock market crash is inevitable here are three tips to prosper when it arrives have you been reading the financial news lately if so you know what the pundits are saying a stock market crash correction is coming yikes the truth is stock market corrections are a normal part of the investment cycle as our colleague sean williams writes at no point over the past 60 years has there been a bear market that didn t correct between 10 and 19 9 at least once within three years of hitting a bottom we re now more than 14 months removed from the march 2020 bottom and have yet to see a double digit percentage retracement in the benchmark s p 500 so you have to believe a correction is imminent there s good news about these crashes though the stock market has always roared back to even higher highs which is good news for investors who know the secrets to prospering in the market even when the bear is striking below three motley fool contributors share their secrets to surviving and thriving when the next correction occurs get paid while others panic eric volkman my suggestion is a straightforward one put capital into good dividend stocks or hold on to the ones you already have the better and more reliable dividends are almost always that way for one big reason they re from companies that have proven over the years that they can make money even during the bad times economies ebb and flow markets boom and swoon the best businesses have the resources and the capability to survive these lurches which always come sooner or later much of this is about resources namely cash a business that can regularly produce piles of the green stuff is in an ideal position to fund a healthy dividend and to at least sustain it during the lean times strong cash generators tend to be businesses with products that enjoy sustainable demand from their customers and ideally sell their products at better than average margins a classic example of this we re all familiar with is microsoft msft 0 71 for any pc user microsoft products are nearly unavoidable when was the last time you used a pc without windows after all and while the company periodically tweaks and updates windows the costs of this maintenance and development are peanuts compared to what it has historically charged for it microsoft is a profitable cash amassing monster this dividend stock is a fine stock market crash hedge numerous other examples abound one obvious place to look for stars in this galaxy is the list of dividend aristocrats this is the exalted group of s p 500 index component stocks that have raised their shareholder payouts at least once per year for a minimum of 25 years running while some dividend aristocrats are better investments than others all have proven to be resilient and many will provide good shelter in a market crash there are plenty of solid companies to choose from target tgt 0 01 would be one of my picks as it s an exceptionally well managed business that s a go to retailer for millions of american shoppers many investors feel the same about walmart wmt 1 39 aflac afl 0 30 meanwhile has a strong niche in supplemental insurance products and even in market crashes and through economic recessions we ll still be buying spices and condiments made by comestibles mainstay mccormick mkc 1 12 there are of course plenty of quality dividend stocks that aren t aristocrats i m thinking in particular of real estate investment trusts reits which are obligated to pay at least 90 of their net profits out as dividends many other companies across a variety of sectors are also fine dividend plays there are plenty of places on the market to look for these and it s rewarding and potentially very lucrative to find them get your greed on barbara eisner bayer billionaire investor warren buffett gave the best advice of all and one of his big secrets in his 1986 letter to berkshire hathaway shareholders we simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful that advice will serve you well during a market crash you ll often hear that the trick to stock market success is buying when equities have plummeted and selling when they re frothy sure that s great advice but how do you know when that occurs the truth is that no one can time the market and if you try to you ll quickly discover firsthand that it s almost impossible especially if you wind up losing money by trying to trade stocks no one knows when a stock is reaching extremes in either direction however during a stock market crash you have a great opportunity to purchase stocks that could be 10 to 30 or more off their highs and you can grab some great companies at a relatively low price but there are two things an investor must have to make that happen first you ll need cash in the bank not the cash that you need to pay your monthly bills see chuck s section below but money above and beyond that so you can buy crash created bargains always have on hand a list of great companies you d like to buy then when the bottom temporarily falls out of the market you ll have the funds necessary to scoop them up the second thing you ll need is courage it takes a strong stomach and great confidence both of which warren buffett possesses to pull the trigger on buying stocks when the market is tanking this is especially true when you purchase a stock and it continues to drop lower but remember you can t time the market so you don t have to buy a company at its lowest lows just at a price that s reasonable especially if the stock had been trading in nosebleed territory opportunity costs money to capitalize on but with cash in the bank and a stomach of steel you can buy great stocks at low prices to hold for the long term this way you re almost guaranteed stellar returns when you decide it s time to sell keep money you ll need soon out of stocks chuck saletta one of the most important differences between investing and gambling is that when you invest you might be able to own your shares for many years on the flip side with most gambling each deal of the cards or roll of the dice is generally a discrete win or lose event and when you lose your money is gone that difference is crucial because it means that when you re investing you haven t permanently lost money just because your shares may be down a bit shortly after you buy them as benjamin graham the investor who taught investing to warren buffett famously said in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine in other words on a day to day basis a stock s price may tank or soar but over long periods of time its price should pretty fairly reflect what the underlying business is really worth to get to that long term value you have to be willing and able to hold on to quality companies shares through what could be significant short term pain if you need your money to cover your costs of living or some other high priority expense you simply can t hold on when the market moves against you in addition when you ve only got money you won t soon need invested in stocks it simply gets easier to be rational when faced with a market that s moving sharply against you with this in mind a strong guideline to follow is that money you expect to spend within the next five years does not belong in stocks instead for that near term money consider things like cash money market funds time matched cds treasuries or investment grade bonds if the market cooperates you won t earn as

the bank is buying a specialized home improvement lender with high quality loans but it s also spending a lot in the process regions financial s rf 4 88 recent acquisition of enerbank usa certainly looks a little different from other bank acquisitions this year as the 153 billion asset bank based in alabama is acquiring a subsidiary bank from an energy company enerbank is one of the country s largest specialty home improvement lenders mainly financing projects such as pools solar roofing and siding windows and doors and hvac heating ventilation and air conditioning for the past 20 years the company has been owned by cms energy and it s insured by the federal deposit insurance corp let s take a look at some of the pros and cons of the deal as well as some of the merits behind it and concerns i have con the financials don t look great regions is paying 960 million in cash for roughly 2 8 billion in loans and 2 7 billion in deposits enerbank has a tangible book value equity minus goodwill and intangible assets of 318 million so regions is paying an amount equivalent to 300 tangible book value that s a hefty price even in this current climate where banks are trading at high valuations the price of enerbank is expected to dilute regions tangible book value by 1 to 2 which certainly seems like a lot for such a small deal the deal is also not very accretive to earnings per share eps meaning that when the transaction closes regions will only see eps in 2022 improve in the low single digit percentage range with the potential to see the deal be 5 accretive to eps bank investors hardly like acquisitions that are dilutive let alone those that don t bring a lot of eps accretion although this is a smaller deal and revenue synergies are not baked in roughly 55 of the loans made by enerbank in the last year have been made in regions retail footprint so there may be opportunities for regions to create more holistic banking relationships with these new customers however the deposit base regions is acquiring is not great either being composed of all time deposits which have a set maturity date once the customer puts the money into the account examples include certificates of deposit these deposits tend to pay out a higher rate which is not ideal for banks the cost of the deposits at enerbank is roughly 1 5 interest which is really bad in this kind of low rate environment although regions plans to eventually replace that funding with its own deposits over time although consistent with regions previously stated strategy of prioritizing strategic investments the capital being used to make this acquisition is capital that can no longer be used for share repurchases so it s certainly a big trade off if the deal doesn t pan out pro putting liquidity into good assets i can certainly see why regions is making this deal like most of the industry regions has been very successful at bringing in deposits since the pandemic began non interest bearing deposits at regions which don t cost any interest have jumped from roughly 37 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2020 to nearly 56 billion at the end of the first quarter of this year non interest bearing deposits now make up nearly 43 of total deposits at the bank which is a very strong number but while deposits have been a success story loan growth has been mighty hard to come by at the end of the first quarter total loan balances had declined roughly 4 billion year over year the bank s loan to deposit ratio had declined to 65 at the end of the first quarter meaning the bank had only deployed 65 of deposits into loans furthermore management is guiding for adjusted period end loan balances to only grow in the low single digit percentage range for the full year in 2021 the acquisition will allow regions to soak up some of its liquidity with nearly 3 billion of high quality loans the loans from enerbank have a gross yield of 9 and once regions replaces enerbank s current high cost deposits with its cheaper deposits the margins are going to look very good additionally the loans from enerbank are to prime and super prime lenders who s credit quality has held up well during the great recession and the pandemic the loans are also fixed rate which obviously has ups and downs depending on the rate environment but does diversify regions balance sheet and would have been particularly beneficial in the ultra low rate environment last year final takeaway in some regards i do like this deal because it does generate some high quality and high yielding loan growth at a time when both loan growth and yield are hard to come by regions also has a ton of extra liquidity so it should be able to replace the higher costing deposits with cheaper ones and expand the current margins on the loans but ultimately for this deal to really pay off regions needs to successfully cross sell other banking products to enerbank s loan customers and grow the home improvement business to its customer bases as well the deal also concerns me however because it suggests regions is concerned about muted loan growth on a somewhat longer timeline which is why it s willing to pay such a high acquisition cost in theory if the loan growth were readily available it could take the 960 million of capital it s spending on the less than 3 billion of loans at enerbank and originate 9 6 billion of loans banks tend to hold 10 of reserves for each loan they originate additionally regions has bought some more specialized finance lenders before and is in some fast growing and attractive markets like florida georgia and texas so you would think organic loan growth might be a little easier to come by ultimately the deal makes me wonder how well positioned regions lending franchise really is

taxes were already set to be a key area of political contention this year amid president biden s proposal to raise levies on corporations and high income americans but now that leaked personal tax records appear to show billionaires paying little to nothing in income taxes the debate could move to center stage propublica published details of the personal tax returns of 25 of the wealthiest americans documents the news organization said it received from sources within the internal revenue service the nonprofit outlet did not specify who provided the documents merrick garland the u s attorney general has vowed to investigate the matter as a top priority the revelation of minute true tax rates among the richest americans comes amid a yawning wealth gap and increased discussion of what to do about it even before covid 19 arrived more of the nation s wealth was winding up in fewer hands the pandemic widened that disparity lower income americans fell behind owing to job losses and other disruptions but the rich flourished as real estate business interests and the stock market soared in value the timing of the leak doesn t appear coincidental propublica contends that the public interest in knowing this information at this pivotal moment outweighs legitimate concerns over a breach of privacy the organization a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power has promised further updates about the tax practices of billionaires including their use of loopholes and audit avoidance tactics what the report revealed in some respects the propublica report wasn t all that earth shattering it is widely suspected that many of the richest americans pay relatively little in taxes sometimes even below what middle class households pay this is largely because the rich derive most of their wealth from investments rather than salaries wages or other income that gets taxed each year tax rates on capital gains are below those on ordinary income and there s more flexibility to delay taxes on gains what was revealing however were details on actual tax returns many of the wealthiest people paid no income taxes in one or more years over the past decade and a half that list includes jeff bezos elon musk michael bloomberg carl icahn and george soros according to the report others such as warren buffett paid well under 1 in taxes as a percentage of how much their wealth increased the 25 wealthy americans whose returns were leaked paid a combined 13 6 billion in income taxes over the five years from 2014 to 2018 propublica said yet their collective wealth surged by 401 billion over that period meaning they paid the equivalent of 3 4 in taxes based on wealth increases over the period you might have noticed that propublica mixed apples and oranges in its comparison the news organization computed what it figured would be the tax bill if changes to the billionaires net worths were taxed on an ongoing basis like income under current law wealth increases aren t taxable nor are gains taxable if the underlying assets aren t sold how is this possible the propublica analysis examined several tax avoidance strategies all legal that the wealthy rely on more than most americans some billionaires pay little or no income taxes simply because they don t earn much income that s because they don t draw much in the way of salaries or wages preferring instead to ride their substantial portfolios higher but they still need living expenses and for this many of the wealthy borrowed against their growing assets propublica said loan proceeds aren t taxable and certain debt expenses are deductible some rich individuals also live off dividends which typically are taxed at the lower rates that apply to capital gains another practice was for billionaires to donate heavily to charities or other philanthropic causes allowing them to lower their taxable income but the main strategy utilized by the rich as highlighted by propublica centers around capital gains because long term investment profits or gains are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income the wealthy can shave their obligations this enables them to pay an effective overall tax rate that might be below those of middle class americans why are gains so crucial all americans have access to low capital gains rates but not everyone owns stocks real estate or other assets on which to generate such gains millions of americans don t own any such assets which also helps to explain the widening wealth gap not only are tax rates lower on long term gains the top rate of 20 compares to 37 for regular income but owners of stocks and other investments have more control over when to pay these taxes wages are taxed in the year received collected through payroll withholding or estimated payments but capital gain taxes aren t triggered until an investment is sold that could be years if not decades later in fact taxes on some gains might never be collected because of various estate planning rules one is the automatic exemption of nearly 11 7 million in assets from taxes per person at death or 23 4 million for a married couple another involves the ability to eliminate much or most of an accumulated taxable gain at the owner s death through what is known as the step up in basis basis is the amount of an asset not subject to tax stepping up or increasing this to the asset s value around the time of death as allowed by the tax code can wipe the tax slate clean for heirs the result is that large fortunes can pass largely intact from one generation to the next propublica said where does the debate go from here biden s proposed reforms would change the nation s policies in several ways that could generate more tax revenue from the wealthiest americans or at least top earners these include raising the top income rate for individuals to 39 6 from 37 on annual income above 400 000 and ending the lower rates on capital gains for these people meaning gains would be taxed the same as income then there s a proposed millionaire s surtax of 10 percentage points that would apply to income as well as capital gains dividends the democrat backed measure would affect 0 2 of taxpayers those with income above 1 million or 2 million for couples as a more fundamental change the government could tax unrealized capital gains under a proposal by sen ron wyden d oregon accrued gains would be taxed each year treating these assets as if they had been sold this provision wouldn t apply to more than 99 of taxpayers and it would exempt retirement accounts family homes and farms it also wouldn t apply when assets lose value the tax revenue received under wyden s proposal would shore up social security taxing unsold property would be easy enough on assets such as stocks mutual funds and the like that have regularly updated prices it would be trickier for harder to value property such as artwork or shares in private companies for these assets wyden has suggested a look back rule that would impose the tax when the asset is ultimately sold the complexities of taxing unrealized gains do pose hurdles but if the wealth gap continues to widen these and other proposals might get a fresh look reach the reporter at russ wiles arizonarepublic com support local journalism subscribe to azcentral com today
king banaian and rich macdonald special to the times every three months st cloud state university economists king banaian and rich macdonald analyze the latest central minnesota business and worker data as well as the results of an exclusive survey of local business leaders the result is the st cloud area quarterly business report it has been published four times per year since 1999 central minnesota firms struggle with worker shortages supply chain issues the st cloud area economy is poised to exit recession as a variety of indicators suggest a broad based recovery is on the horizon while year over year data comparisons are now complicated by the historic decline in economic activity that occurred 12 months ago there are signs that the pace of local economic activity continues to improve for many area firms the pandemic has created scars in the local economy that will likely persist for months and years to come but many area firms now seem to be experiencing challenges that are typically associated with rapid expansion labor shortages price increases accelerating wage growth etc employment data released by the minnesota department of employment and economic development deed indicate st cloud area employment increased 7 8 over the 12 months ending april 2021 but is still 4 4 below its pre pandemic level of february 2020 much of the recent job growth has come in three sectors that were most impacted by covid 19 social distancing requirements leisure and hospitality other services and retail trade current employment in these three sectors is still 3 128 lower than it was in april 2019 there is considerable upside potential for job gains in these three areas the st cloud index of leading economic indicators rose 2 0 in the recent period as the local economy is expected to improve from the weak numbers that have been seen since the onset of recession current business activity at surveyed firms surged compared to three months ago 62 of surveyed firms report an increase in business activity over the past three months and only 14 of firms experienced a decrease in activity over the past quarter the future outlook of surveyed firms is also improved as local companies expect better business conditions over the next six months in special questions three fourths of surveyed firms have not offered any incentives for their employees to receive a covid 19 vaccine and 62 of firms have not attempted to verify which of their employees have received the vaccine many surveyed firms also indicate it has become more difficult to find workers because of increased unemployment compensation for example 60 of survey respondents indicate their applicant pool is smaller than it was last fall at a time that more generous unemployment compensation benefits were phased out firms also report considerable supply chain issues a majority of surveyed firms expect supply chain issues to continue or worsen in the coming months finally in written responses area firms explain how their business practices have been permanently altered by covid 19 key takeaways private sector payroll employment in the st cloud area rose 8 4 from one year earlier in the 12 months through april 2021 the unemployment rate in the st cloud area was 4 4 in april 2021 which was much lower than the 8 3 figure observed one year ago we note that these comparisons are impacted by the historic economic decline that occurred at the beginning of the pandemic in march 2020 the local labor force contracted by 1 8 over the past year as there are now 2 078 fewer adults working or available for work in the st cloud area than there were one year ago nearly all area sectors experienced employment gains over the year ending april 2021 sectors with the largest job gains include leisure hospitality 47 4 other services 28 7 retail trade 12 7 and local government 13 3 there were also strong gains in the mining logging construction professional business services wholesale trade and manufacturing sectors the only local sectors experiencing job loss over the past 12 months were financial activities 3 7 and state government 10 2 the st cloud index of leading economic indicators lei rose by 2 0 in the current period five of the six lei indicators rose in the current quarter the st cloud 12 stock index rose 17 0 over the three months ending april 30 2021 over the same period the s p 500 rose 6 6 all 12 stocks in the st cloud index rose in this most recent period the future outlook of those area businesses responding to the st cloud area business outlook survey was improved as surveyed firms remain optimistic about economic performance over the next six months 51 of surveyed firms expect an increase in business activity over the next six months and 14 expect decreased activity 49 of surveyed firms expect to expand payrolls by november 2021 and 54 anticipate increased prices received over the next six months 57 of surveyed firms expect to pay higher wages and salaries by november the local labor shortage is a concern for area firms 43 of surveyed firms expect it to be more difficult to attract qualified workers over the next six months and only 3 expect these difficulties to decrease in addition in a special question business leaders indicate higher unemployment compensation is impacting their ability to find new workers 60 of survey respondents report a smaller pool of job applicants than in fall 2020 and nearly half of firms indicate there are fewer applicants accepting interviews or reporting for scheduled interviews more than one third of surveyed firms are experiencing a larger number of people turning down job offers or not reporting for work once hired in another special question few surveyed firms less than 25 have provided incentives for their workers to receive the covid 19 vaccine in addition 62 of survey respondents report that they have not attempted to verify which of their employees have been vaccinated a fourth special question asks firms to indicate the extent to which they are being impacted by supply chain issues few firms 11 have never experienced supply chain issues during the pandemic two thirds of firms have experienced supply chain issues that they expect to either continue or worsen in the coming months a final special question asks firms to explain how their business practices have been permanently altered by covid 19 labor force declines unemployment insurance extended our special questions this quarter focus on issues of business recovery from the pandemic business owners deliver goods and services that their customers demand to meet that demand they buy inputs including labor the pandemic has disrupted both of these output and input markets many observers have recently highlighted the disruption of labor markets caused by unemployment insurance it is worth remembering that a year ago we paid workers 600 per week in federal benefits on top of their state benefits at the time this seemed eminently sensible insofar as we perceived the workplace as being at significant covid 19 infection risk over time we have learned more about workplace risk nevertheless current unemployment benefits extend an additional 300 per week in benefits we initially discussed these new benefits in the december 2020 st cloud area quarterly business report in which we reported that the federal pandemic emergency unemployment compensation peuc program added 13 weeks of benefits to the normal period of 26 weeks for claims of unemployment insurance in minnesota at that time 83 409 minnesotans were receiving peuc payments which were scheduled to expire at the end of 2020 bills signed into law on dec 27 2020 and march 11 2021 since then have extended those payments to sept 6 2021 the number of minnesotans who have received peuc now stands at 184 482 within the st cloud metropolitan statistical area as seen in a nearby graph the share of workers qualifying for peuc expanded from 19 in september 2020 to 45 in april 2021 to put these data in perspective in april 2019 there were 1 802 continuing claims for unemployment insurance during the state s initial stay at home orders continuing claims grew to more than 17 000 in april 2020 but fell to 7 595 in october restaurant closings likely contributed to raising the number of claims to more than 10 000 in january of this year it has now only fallen to 9 173 in april 2021 by contrast private sector payrolls are about 6 000 7 000 lower than pre pandemic levels in the st cloud metro area and the area labor force is about 5 000 lower over the same period two articles in the most recent minnesota economic trends by deed employees have investigated the claim that these payments are responsible for lower labor market participation one paper looks at micro level data between the second and third quarters of 2020 and finds more than 3 of 4 workers who received benefits returned to work by september 2020 undoubtedly more have returned since then the other article makes an important point that the job market to which those workers return is different than the one they left some workers whose skills would be in demand may be unable to work due to supply chain issues as we see later in this report others may still have concerns regarding covid or issues with child care we agree that it is not only extended benefits that present an issue however the other elements that are holding back labor supply are likely to recede as the year progresses while the current expiration of benefits in september will likely be preceded by calls for their extension we remind readers that during the great recession in 2008 emergency unemployment compensations was passed and then extended through december 2013 the national unemployment rate at that time was 6 7 in the graph pua refers to pandemic unemployment assistance a federal program to assist workers who were self employed gig workers or otherwise not qualified to receive regular unemployment benefits this program makes comparisons difficult publicly available data combine pua and state continuing claims for unemployment insurance persons receiving pua likely would not be counted as part of the labor force unless they responded that they were looking for work for hire to an interviewer in a household jobs survey alessia leibert reemployment after covid 19 layoffs in minnesota early findings and shawn herhusky and carson gorecki more than simply supply and demand both in minnesota economic trends june 2021 online at results of standard quarterly business report survey questions current central mn economic activity tables 1 and 2 report the most recent results of the st cloud area business outlook survey responses are from 37 area businesses that returned the recent mailing in time to be included in the report as we have recently noted participation in the survey has declined since the onset of the pandemic so we will be rebuilding the sample in our upcoming august survey participating firms are representative of the diverse collection of businesses in the st cloud area they include retail manufacturing construction financial health services and government enterprises both small and large survey responses are strictly confidential written and oral comments have not been attributed to individual firms table 1 shows that the three month period ending in may 2021 was improved from the previous quarter and is of course significantly better than was found one year ago when the local economy was plagued by covid 19 restrictions for example the diffusion index on current business activity is 48 7 the highest may reading since 2017 by comparison one year ago the current business activity index was 44 7 a diffusion index represents the percentage of respondents indicating an increase minus the percentage indicating a decrease in any given quarter for any given item a positive index usually indicates expanding activity while a negative index implies declining conditions other index values in table 1 were also strong this quarter the survey items that reflect local labor market activity were particularly favorable over the recent three month period for example the accompanying chart shows that the length of work week survey item jumped this quarter to an all time high of 35 1 it appears local firms are coping with labor shortages by lengthening the work week for their existing workers surveyed firms are also trying to attract and retain workers by offering higher employee compensation the index value on this survey item see accompanying chart is the highest it has been in more than 22 years other current conditions survey readings also suggest an improved local labor market the current employment index recorded its highest value in three years and firms also report more difficulty attracting qualified workers than at any time since may 2018 the current capital expenditures index remains elevated this quarter its index value is at its highest level since august 2013 in addition as we reported last quarter prices received by area firms have increased over the past several months this can be seen in the accompanying chart which shows that the current prices received index is at an all time high of 56 8 more than half of surveyed firms report receiving higher prices over the past three months and no firm reports lower prices it is unclear whether higher prices received are an adjustment to increased firm costs or reflective of enhanced pricing power of area firms but we do note that overall inflation has picked up in recent months national business activity was also strong over the past quarter the diffusion index on this survey item is the second highest value ever recorded in the current conditions surve only the february 2014 reading was higher as always firms were asked to report any factors that are affecting their business these comments include we are in trucking trucking always feels the economic effects first our supply chain is in trouble with the shortage of truck drivers the lack of employees directly affects the number of orders we are able to produce i am sure there are a number of factors driving the lack of employees in the work force but it is time to remove the stimulus to be unemployed material and labor costs are outpacing our ability to raise prices increasingly becoming difficult to work with service providers where people work from home home workers are hard to get a hold of responsiveness takes too long and they do not collaborate as well as they previously did to find solutions the total decimation of travel has been really rough road to go down we look forward to better days ahead as borders open eviction moratorium is not a big problem regarding collections but it is much more difficult to enforce behavior standards prices increased from every vendor by 10 15 raw material prices have increased logistics pricing has increased labor costs it is a mess government policies contributing to all facets of business we are a seasonal business with 80 of our revenue in quarters 2 and 3 central mn economic activity outlook the results from the future conditions survey in table 2 are generally improved from last quarter and are much stronger than was seen one year ago when the may survey was conducted within the first couple of months of the pandemic however one survey item that is weaker than last quarter is the future business activity index at 37 9 this index is considerably lower than the 51 5 value reported three months ago to some extent this is a normal seasonal observation we note that 51 percent of surveyed firms expect improved business activity by november and only 14 percent of firms expect weaker conditions so there appears to be little reason to be concerned about this data reading the future capital expenditures index is also relatively weak in this quarter s future conditions survey the readings on this index in both the current and future conditions surveys have been very strong in recent quarters so the pullback in this index may be a natural business response to a recent buildup in capital purchases by area firms with 49 percent of surveyed firms expecting to expand employment by november and only one firm expecting to decrease employment the future employment index is at its highest level since november 2018 employee compensation is also expected to remain strong over the next six months fifty seven percent of surveyed firms expect increased employee compensation over the next six months and no firms expect a reduction in wages salaries and benefits in table 2 note an interesting contrast to one year ago in may 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic the index at a value of 8 5 of future employee compensation was 48 points lower than it current value similar to what was seen in table 1 the diffusion index on future prices received is elevated at a value of 54 1 fifty four percent of surveyed firms expect to receive higher prices by november and no firms believe prices will be lower national business activity is expected to remain strong over the next several months as can be seen in the accompanying chart the national business activity index has only been higher than this quarter s value of 43 3 one other time since we have been surveying area business leaders it reached a value of 46 4 in january 2004 the impact of fiscal stimulus expansionary monetary policy and the possibility of a significant increase in infrastructure spending may help explain why area firms expect national business activity to remain strong finally as we have frequently done over the years this quarter s final survey chart looks at the future difficulty attracting qualified workers index the value of this series is 40 5 which is significantly higher than the 18 2 value recorded last quarter we have often noted that this index has served as one of our unofficial indicators of local recession historically this series has followed a similar pattern as the aggregate economy so we always pay close attention to the value of this survey item with this quarter s elevated reading it appears that the area economy is poised to soon begin its official recovery from the pandemic recession the last time this index was this high was in february 2018 when the economy was flying high and worker shortages were plaguing area firms aided by generous unemployment benefits see special question 3 below it now once again appears that local firms are having considerable difficulty attracting qualified workers special question 1 vaccine incentives as of june 5 the minnesota government website reported that 65 percent of minnesotans aged 16 and older this corresponds with the age structure used in measuring the size of the labor force had received at least one dose of the covid 19 vaccine in recent weeks as vaccination rates have increased the economy has opened up and socially distancing masking requirements have been relaxed now that the vaccine has become widely available we were interested in the extent to which area firms are encouraging their employees to get vaccinated we asked the following question special question 1 has your firm offered any incentives to your employees to receive a covid 19 vaccine if so what have you offered a little more than three fourths of surveyed firms indicate they have offered no incentives to workers to get the vaccine 16 of firms have offered paid time off to employees to receive their vaccination and one firm has offered a cash inducement to employees no firms have offered child care while workers go to get vaccinated we note that minnesota gov tim walz has recently announced your shot to summer vaccine rewards for 100 000 of those aged 12 and older who receive their first vaccine dose between may 27 and june 30 these rewards include such things as minnesota zoo admission great lakes aquarium passes northwoods league baseball tickets minnesota state fair tickets valleyfair admission a 25 visa card etc so there is now precedent for providing inducements to receive the covid 19 vaccine there were several interesting comments on this question they include we do not believe it would persuade them to get the shot we have found that those that elect to get the vaccination want it even without incentive those that don t want the vaccination won t get it even with incentive do we really have to put an incentive on everything for people to do it we have had no need to do this our employee group is motivated to do it themselves do not see the value at this time most of our employees have been vaccinated we leave it up to the employee to decide if they want the covid 19 shot or not most of our employees are getting vaccinated only one employee vaccinated we have accommodated their time to get the shot 50 amazon gift card this practice should be illegal if you can do this you should incentivize people to get healthy special question 2 verifying vaccination status this quarter s second special question extends the topic discussed above we asked whether firms are actually monitoring which of their employees have received the covid 19 vaccine we asked special question 2 has your firm attempted to verify which employees have received the covid 19 vaccine 27 percent of surveyed firms indicate that they have attempted to determine who has received the vaccine approximately 62 of survey respondents have not attempted to determine which employees are vaccine recipients some employers have strong views on this topic written responses help tell the story the employees are volunteering the information other than through casual conversation we have not however that casual conversation has indicated it s about 50 50 we would like to have all of our staff vaccinated but because of hippa we are not asking questions that are not allowed so we are trying to keep track in a very non invasive fashion only two employees out of eight have not been vaccinated we feel they will share that information if they choose to we do encourage it amazon gift card offered with proof of the last vaccination this is unethical your health is a private matter it is none of our business it is personal considering this not sure if it s legal special question 3 unemployment benefits impact the greater st cloud development corp in collaboration with the st cloud area chamber of commerce recently commissioned greenfield communications a local firm that has undertaken similar projects around the region and the state to conduct an informal email survey of area firms to among other things identify the most important factors firms face in trying fill available employment positions among the interesting survey findings is that more than half 56 of respondents identified expanded unemployment benefits as one of the challenges they encounter in trying to fill their available positions the survey finds that the inability of area firms to find qualified workers is causing some of them to cut back on expansion plans and even consider relocating elsewhere area firms difficulty attracting qualified workers has been an ongoing issue that we have tracked each quarter in the st cloud area business outlook survey since our survey was first sent out in december 1998 over the past 23 years there have been several periods in which worker shortages have plagued area firms and there have been other periods typically associated with local recession when firms had little difficulty attracting qualified workers the chart discussed in an earlier section of this report helps show the variation in local worker shortages since 1998 readers may recall that unemployment compensation benefits were extended in length during the great recession it was not uncommon at that time for us to hear from area employers that they felt they were competing against unemployment benefits in trying to hire workers the current recession is somewhat different unemployment compensation benefits have been both extended and expanded so that those receiving assistance are replacing a larger share of their lost wages salaries than usual while there have been a couple of waves of expanded unemployment compensation benefits including currently during the pandemic recession the initial phase of expanded benefits implemented in spring summer 2020 was phased out last fall allowing us to ask area employers how the current hiring process compares to what was experienced at that time so this quarter s third special question asks special question 3 we are aware of local stories of businesses having difficulty finding workers due to increased unemployment compensation relative to your experience last fall what has changed in the following steps of the hiring process note that survey respondents were invited to select all that apply in responding to this question so many firms are encountering multiple difficulties throughout the hiring process in finding workers 60 percent of firms indicate their applicant pool is smaller than last fall nearly half of surveyed firms indicate they are having difficulties with getting potential employees to accept an interview or show up for a scheduled interview a little more than one third of firms report having more applicants turn down job offers or not show up for work when an offer has been accepted 19 of firms report increased quit rates in the first month of employment only 16 of survey respondents indicate they have experienced none of these problems written comments include we continue to be surprised at the number of people that will go through the process and then not show up most of our applicants lately set up a time for an interview but fail to show up response to job postings are extremely low compensation requests are getting unreasonable it is beyond difficult to grow a business in a state that has no regard or respect for business owners and the obstacles we face we are stressed tired and feeling no reason to stay in minnesota much less grow we have begun the search for property in south dakota even with increased starting pay and more benefits finding and keeping employees that want to work is difficult we have been able to recruit for a handful of open positions through contacts of our current employees they like the job we offer and the pay but then tell us to call them back when the federal unemployment bonus goes off and they might be interested in taking the job unemployment benefits are ridiculous in an environment where there are so many openings for jobs that pay well above the minimum wage carry strong benefits and can provide future wage appreciation at strong stable organizations we believe that younger applicants that haven t been in the work force long have just decided to stay home even if it s a little less than they could make working for us younger people don t look at retirement the same as middle aged and older we have downsized to stay afloat and have everyone on the mn workshare program i have chosen to no longer seek employees work is staffed out to independent contractors have not had to hire anyone since last fall we have raised our starting pay by as much as 5 hour to attract employees as well as increasing wages of current employees to retain them haven t had to hire anyone yet our difficulty in attracting entry level is at an all time high other positions have not been quite as difficult starting wages are much higher until unemployment stops this will be an issue we are experiencing more pressure from current part time employees looking elsewhere number of applicants that accept interview and to not show up is really high special question 4 supply chain issues given the unique situation that government restrictions and or company policies associated with covid 19 can halt entire production processes the possibility that supply chain issues would develop has seemed inevitable since the onset of the pandemic with a large share of the u s population now vaccinated although global supply chains are still potentially compromised by limited vaccine availability in many other countries we are now in a position to see if area firms are experiencing continuing supply chain issues for more than a year supply availability has been disrupted by plant closures reductions in cargo transportation schedules canal blockages cyberattacks etc so we thought we would ask area firms where they currently stand on supply chain issues we asked special question 4 which of the following best represents your firm s experiences with supply issues since the onset of covid 19 the results from surveyed firms are clear area businesses continue to experience supply chain issues and these issues are expected to persist or worsen over the coming months for example 30 of firms continue to experience supply chain issues and expect them to continue in the coming months another 37 of firms continue to experience supply chain issues and expect them to worsen in the coming months only 11 of survey respondents expect continuing supply chain issues to improve in the coming months another 11 of firms have never experienced supply chain issues during the course of the pandemic firms written responses are instructive our suppliers are telling us it will get moderately better we are having trouble procuring raw material to make our product our vendors along with us are having trouble securing labor to keep lead times in check i continually hear that they are going to be late due to a labor shortage we cannot get parts for our trucks trailers or special equipment prices have gotten ridiculous and our prices to customers cannot keep up we do feel that our suppliers are getting on top of the issues they have encountered either production or shipping and over the next few months the normal will happen whatever the new normal may be parts keep getting harder to find we seem to be losing ground each week instead gaining any ground disrupting so much of our business the consumer is losing patience over the long waits it is not just availability it is significant price increases that cannot be passed along to the customer as well raw material shortages exist and look to continue just not a problem domestic supply is fine just more expensive imports have also gone way up in price due to the weakening dollar and increased shipping cost and never arrive when expected deliveries are very stretched starting to see more customers want domestic product we re on an allotment at the present time some materials we use in our industry aren t available for months so we try to change them to products we may be able to obtain we don t have supply chain issues but we have other issues to deal with that s for sure our busiest season is august and september i expect significant supply chain issues especially with cost and availability of rental cars it will get worse before it gets better we have been told by suppliers to expect shortages into 2022 lumber and other building products much more expensive and certain products unavailable special question 5 permanent business changes due to covid 19 this quarter s final special question is an open ended invitation to area firms to explain how their business practices have been permanently altered by covid 19 from the onset of the pandemic we have cautioned that the impact of the coronavirus may be more than cyclical in nature the potential for long term structural change in the area economy cannot be ruled out even after the local economy has emerged from recession some of this structural change may take the form of permanent scarring of area firms in ways that damage business prospects into the foreseeable future of course many other area firms have seized this opportunity to re evaluate business practices in ways that will make their company more productive going forward without trying to shape company responses to this important question we simply asked them the following special question 5 please explain how your business practices have been permanently altered by covid 19 we let firms written responses tell the story more virtual meetings with our remote locations we accommodate the coming and going of employees in a manner that may never change our customers are not getting the service they are used to because our employees forgot how to work hard we shortened the work week for leaders remote working for a few may never return back to the office long term substantial payroll cost increases are required to maintain employees i expect this to worsen zoom meetings more zoom meetings don t expect business travel to return to pre pandemic levels customers are comfortable with zoom rather than meeting we see a shift in companies customers and suppliers doing business the way we have for years less face to face business more phone internet use we will likely work by appointment in a post covid world our doors are locked we accept appointments only require masks our market has slooooowwwwed way down recovery will be very long material supply issues are increasing as are costs trucking continues to be an issue increased cost of goods sold with no sales increase due to the third party insurance companies not raising our dictated labor and material rates it s not the covid 19 but government s response to it that has caused the problems we have had to create an online presence earlier than we planned to we can t promise delivery all of the time reduced hours relaxed dress code option to work from home whenever needed employees getting tested and missing work masks barriers more video conferences with vendors and customers vs in person meetings we have become more flexible and adaptive in conclusion everything looks good compared to april 2020 one year ago we noted that employment levels in st cloud had declined less than other areas of minnesota the opposite effect is occurring now when comparing any economic data in april 2021 to april 2020 st cloud has less employment loss to recover than other parts of the state thus private sector employment rose 8 4 in april 2021 compared to april 2020 during which time minnesota was under safe at home orders from gov walz as seen in table 3 this is less than the approximately 10 rise in private sector employment for the state as a whole and for the twin cities in the sector most affected by those orders leisure and hospitality the rise in st cloud employment of 47 4 is far less than the nearly 70 increase in other markets but annual changes are deceptive when comparing numbers to the pre pandemic month of february 2020 st cloud employment in the leisure and hospitality sector is down 23 6 while minneapolis st paul is down 24 7 similar stories apply in other sectors for example while the manufacturing sector in st cloud shows a 4 6 employment gain over the 12 months to april 2021 it is still down 6 7 from february 2020 the two months between february and april 2020 make a lot of difference the sectors that are above their pre pandemic levels are the construction which may be partially a seasonal effect wholesale trade and government sectors the unemployment rate for st cloud shown in table 4 is 4 4 compared to 8 3 in april 2020 similar declines occur elsewhere in minnesota while employment of st cloud metro area residents rose 2 3 from april 2020 the labor force fell 1 8 put another way had the labor force not declined area unemployment would be 6 1 but our region still has a fairly high labor force participation rate in 2018 the estimated population in the st cloud metro over age 15 was 156 019 meaning in april 2020 the labor force participation rate would have been 72 4 far above national levels the improvement in initial claims for unemployment insurance appears very strong but again the comparison is to a month april 2020 when many workers were unemployed due to businesses closing due to government orders there were less than 500 initial claims in the region in february 2020 so job markets still have a way to go to see those levels building permit activity in the st cloud area was down mildly in the quarter table 4 shows strong growth in the st cloud 12 stock price index which has now reached a new high the previous high of jan 24 2018 was eclipsed on march 8 2021 at 952 06 and the index rose over 1 000 for the first time on april 15 growth in the index was broad based with all 12 stocks rising in the quarter ending april 30 capital one financial led all gainers with a 43 1 increase in the three months ending april 30 while textron increased 42 0 an almost identical story appears for the st cloud area index of leading economic indicators the index was up 2 in the quarter ending april 2021 and 4 8 over the last 12 months the index is forward looking over a 4 6 month time horizon so the 2 gain is hopeful that further gains to recover from the pandemic are on hand for summer five of the six indicators contributed positively to the index led by responses of area business owners regarding current conditions in our quarterly st cloud area business outlook survey and the gain in the st cloud 12 stock price index the only negative contribution came from professional employment which includes temporary help employment this sector has been challenged to return to pre pandemic levels throughout minnesota there is a labor shortage in america and st cloud is part of it for whatever reason many adults are not in the workforce there is also the fact that some of the jobs that workers left in march april 2020 are not returning there is demand for different kinds of workers and different kinds of employers who can attract talent these adjustments are not unprecedented but will look unique as they spring out of the aftermath of the pandemic overall demand for products is strong so those firms who master both their labor issues and input supply chains will find a marketplace with money to spend about the authors king banaian school of public affairs st cloud state university 320 308 4797 rich macdonald school of public affairs research

outstanding then its eps will be 2 100 million divided by 50 million if it has 100 million shares its eps will be 1 advertisement when companies issue more shares of stock to raise money that dilutes

crashes and steep corrections are your opportunity to pick up these dominant businesses at a discount it s not a matter of if a stock market crash will occur it s a simply a matter of when looking back one thing is certain corrections and crashes are a normal part of the investing cycle there have in fact been 38 double digit percentage declines in the benchmark s p 500 since the beginning of 1950 which works out to a sizable drop in the broader market on average every 1 87 years however these big declines shouldn t be feared rather they should be cheered by long term investors that s because every crash or correction in history has eventually been erased by a bull market rally when a stock market crash strikes it s time to go on the offensive as an investor the following five stocks would be the perfect no brainer buys the next time a crash rears its head alphabet if the faang stocks have taught investors anything it s that their industrywide dominance makes them no brainer companies to buy anytime a sizable correction strikes that s why the advertising dependent alphabet googl 0 29 goog 0 30 is such a smart buy alphabet is comprised of multiple operating segments none of which is more well known or dominant than its google internet search engine how dominant you ask according to data from globalstats google has controlled anywhere from 91 to 93 of worldwide internet search for the past two years with a veritable monopoly on search it s no wonder advertisers willing to pay top dollar for search placement even if ad spending pulls back during recessions history shows that periods of expansion last many years longer than recessions thus google s search operating model is playing a numbers game that it s bound to win alphabet is about more than just google too streaming content service youtube is one of the top three social media destinations in the world and is generating annual run rate revenue of 24 billion through the first quarter meanwhile cloud infrastructure segment google cloud has consistently been growing sales by close to 50 on a year over year basis cloud s higher margins will eventually allow alphabet s cash flow to rocket higher unitedhealth group healthcare stocks are always a smart place to put your money to work during periods of heightened volatility that s because healthcare companies are defensive in other words people can t control when they get sick or what ailment s they develop which means the demand for drugs devices and services remains relatively constant no matter what that s all good news for insurance and healthcare services giant unitedhealth group unh 2 10 most folks are probably familiar with unitedhealth for its employer and individual healthcare plans according to the company it offers health plans to roughly 26 million americans with president joe biden pledging to rebuild and expand the affordable care act there s a good possibility unitedhealth can add to its already large member base and it certainly doesn t hurt that health benefit providers can pass along premium hikes to cover their expenses each year interestingly though it s not health insurance that s been unitedhealth group s key growth driver over the past decade that title goes to healthcare services segment optum optum provides an array of services including pharmacy care and prescription refilling services as well as data analytics to hospitals and health based organizations optum is growing at a faster rate than the insurance portion of unitedhealth s business and it often delivers a superior operating margin optum could well be the company s ticket to surpassing johnson johnson and becoming the most valuable healthcare company trulieve cannabis similar to healthcare stocks marijuana stocks are a wise place to invest your money during a stock market crash as we witnessed during the coronavirus crash and subsequent recession cannabis behaves like a traditional consumer good this is to say that consumers keep buying it no matter how well or poorly the economy is performing that s what makes trulieve cannabis tcnnf 2 97 a no brainer pot stock to buy when a crash strikes trulieve is one of many multistate operators mso trying to make their mark in the lucrative u s weed market but it has a very unique operating model relative to other msos what s interesting is that 82 of its 88 operational retail locations are in medical marijuana legal florida by completely saturating the sunshine state it s been able to effectively build up its brand and create a loyal following without having to spend big bucks on marketing the end result is 13 consecutive profitable quarters and roughly half of the sunshine state s dried flower and cannabinoid oils market share the highly profitable trulieve also hasn t been afraid to use acquisitions to its advantage it recently announced its intention to acquire mso harvest health recreation hrvsf for 2 1 billion in an all stock deal harvest health has a presence in five states one of which happens to be florida on top of further solidifying its presence in its home market it ll be inheriting harvest health s 15 operational dispensaries in arizona which recently legalized recreational cannabis trulieve should be able to successfully apply its florida blueprint to arizona mastercard alphabet isn t the only company that benefits from long winded periods of economic expansion history has shown that anytime investors can get a sizable discount on payment facilitator mastercard ma 0 63 during a crash or steep correction they should take it as with practically all financial stocks mastercard is a cyclical business this means it struggles when the u s and global economy are contracting because that s when consumers and businesses are more likely to pull back on their spending the thing is these periods of contraction or recession usually last no longer than a few quarters by comparison mastercard benefits in a big way from bull markets and periods of economic expansion these expansions often last multiple years if not a full decade mastercard is the perfect example of patience paying off for long term investors take note that mastercard has also avoided becoming a lender while this does mean it s turning down the opportunity to collect interest income and fee revenue during long periods of growth mastercard doesn t have to worry about setting cash aside to cover credit delinquencies when inevitable recessions arise this is a big reason why mastercard s operating margins are consistently north of 40 with multiple regions of the world still underbanked mastercard remains a no brainer growth story to buy during any big stock market downturn facebook finally a stock market crash would be the perfect occasion to buy shares of social media giant and faang stock facebook meta 0 57 facebook s dominance in the social media space is jaw dropping as of the end of march the company had 2 85 billion monthly active users maus visiting its namesake site with another 600 million unique maus visiting whatsapp and instagram which facebook also owns that s 3 45 billion people or 44 of the global population visiting a facebook owned asset at least once a month with this many eyeballs facebook holds massive pricing leverage over advertisers in fact the company s ad revenue surged by a double digit percentage throughout 2020 i e the most challenging year for the u s economy in decades the craziest thing about facebook is realizing that ceo mark zuckerberg hasn t even fully depressed the gas pedal despite pacing more than 101 billion in annual ad revenue in 2021 the company isn t meaningfully monetizing facebook messenger or whatsapp this ad revenue is almost entirely coming from its namesake site and instagram imagine how quickly facebook s operating cash flow i going to grow once it begins monetizing two of the six most visited social platforms in the world
pharmacy chains drugmakers and more should see higher sales if experts forecasts of an especially bad cold and flu season are right brace yourself after an unusually mild recent cold and flu season healthcare experts expect that it will be much worse this winter in this motley fool live video recorded on june 2 motley fool contributors keith speights and brian orelli discuss which stocks could profit if the warnings that a nasty cold and flu season is on the way prove to be right 10 stocks we like better than cvs health when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and cvs health wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 keith speights one of the positive side effects of the efforts to contain the spread of covid 19 has been that we really experienced an unusually weak cold and flu season over this past winter in fact i know of someone who works in a pediatric clinic and said they were just astonished at how few flu cases with kids came in over the last several months they attribute it to all of the preventive measures that were in place with the covid 19 pandemic people wearing masks schools doing remote learning if they were doing on campus classes if any child showed up who had any symptoms they immediately sent them home anyway they were attributing all of those efforts to really just nearly stamping out the cold and flu season not entirely but largely that s one of the positive side effects but now brian experts are warning that we could be in store for an especially nasty cold and flu season coming up near the end of this year and into early 2022 we re investors we re always looking ahead and looking at the investing angle on things are there any stocks that you think might particularly benefit if we have a really nasty cold and flu season coming up brian orelli yeah i think there s probably a couple of different categories here one would be obviously drug stores something in like cvs health cvs 3 01 ticker there s cvs a walgreens boots alliance wba 6 05 ticker there s wba and rite aid rad ticker there s rad r a d i like cvs but it s maybe not necessarily the best pick simply for cold and flu because it also has aetna insurance while it will sell more cold and flu medication it ll also have increased expenses on its aetna insurance side as people go to the doctor because of their flus at least for all these categories you want to evaluate the company on the whole not necessarily buy it just because of the cold and flu season for test makers roche rhhby 0 23 and abbott abt 1 13 both have flu tests but they are pretty large companies i m not sure how much you are going to benefit there if you don t want to go specific on any one test quest diagnostics dgx 0 85 or labcorp of america lh 1 37 they are more general they run a whole bunch of different tests they contract out with doctors to run the tests if you want to go to small specific quidel qdel might be a good option ticker there s q d e l they have stand alone machines that run in doctor s offices and then they re razor and blades model you pay for each individual cartridge that you put into the machines to run the test in terms of vaccines and treatments most of the vaccine makers are pretty large companies sanofi sny 0 84 astrazeneca azn 0 44 are big flu vaccine companies then for treatments roche is probably the biggest there we did have the tamiflu and xofluza then maybe outside the treatment area but ancillary to the treatment area goodrx gdrx 3 86 might be a good option if people are looking for cheaper medications they might turn to goodrx so that could help them speights i like that you started out mentioning some of the big pharmacy retailers brian because not only do they benefit from increased sales of cold and flu products but it also boosts their customer traffic in their stores and customers can buy more products while they re there they really count on some sales boost during cold and flu season but you also mentioned something really important don t just look at the prospects for a company for cold and flu season because there s a bigger picture for all of the companies that you ve mentioned they are not just dependent on cold and flu sales that s just one factor to include in your thinking
the bank is buying a specialized home improvement lender with high quality loans but it s also spending a lot in the process regions financial s rf 4 88 recent acquisition of enerbank usa certainly looks a little different from other bank acquisitions this year as the 153 billion asset bank based in alabama is acquiring a subsidiary bank from an energy company enerbank is one of the country s largest specialty home improvement lenders mainly financing projects such as pools solar roofing and siding windows and doors and hvac heating ventilation and air conditioning for the past 20 years the company has been owned by cms energy and it s insured by the federal deposit insurance corp let s take a look at some of the pros and cons of the deal as well as some of the merits behind it and concerns i have con the financials don t look great regions is paying 960 million in cash for roughly 2 8 billion in loans and 2 7 billion in deposits enerbank has a tangible book value equity minus goodwill and intangible assets of 318 million so regions is paying an amount equivalent to 300 tangible book value that s a hefty price even in this current climate where banks are trading at high valuations the price of enerbank is expected to dilute regions tangible book value by 1 to 2 which certainly seems like a lot for such a small deal the deal is also not very accretive to earnings per share eps meaning that when the transaction closes regions will only see eps in 2022 improve in the low single digit percentage range with the potential to see the deal be 5 accretive to eps bank investors hardly like acquisitions that are dilutive let alone those that don t bring a lot of eps accretion although this is a smaller deal and revenue synergies are not baked in roughly 55 of the loans made by enerbank in the last year have been made in regions retail footprint so there may be opportunities for regions to create more holistic banking relationships with these new customers however the deposit base regions is acquiring is not great either being composed of all time deposits which have a set maturity date once the customer puts the money into the account examples include certificates of deposit these deposits tend to pay out a higher rate which is not ideal for banks the cost of the deposits at enerbank is roughly 1 5 interest which is really bad in this kind of low rate environment although regions plans to eventually replace that funding with its own deposits over time although consistent with regions previously stated strategy of prioritizing strategic investments the capital being used to make this acquisition is capital that can no longer be used for share repurchases so it s certainly a big trade off if the deal doesn t pan out pro putting liquidity into good assets i can certainly see why regions is making this deal like most of the industry regions has been very successful at bringing in deposits since the pandemic began non interest bearing deposits at regions which don t cost any interest have jumped from roughly 37 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2020 to nearly 56 billion at the end of the first quarter of this year non interest bearing deposits now make up nearly 43 of total deposits at the bank which is a very strong number but while deposits have been a success story loan growth has been mighty hard to come by at the end of the first quarter total loan balances had declined roughly 4 billion year over year the bank s loan to deposit ratio had declined to 65 at the end of the first quarter meaning the bank had only deployed 65 of deposits into loans furthermore management is guiding for adjusted period end loan balances to only grow in the low single digit percentage range for the full year in 2021 the acquisition will allow regions to soak up some of its liquidity with nearly 3 billion of high quality loans the loans from enerbank have a gross yield of 9 and once regions replaces enerbank s current high cost deposits with its cheaper deposits the margins are going to look very good additionally the loans from enerbank are to prime and super prime lenders who s credit quality has held up well during the great recession and the pandemic the loans are also fixed rate which obviously has ups and downs depending on the rate environment but does diversify regions balance sheet and would have been particularly beneficial in the ultra low rate environment last year final takeaway in some regards i do like this deal because it does generate some high quality and high yielding loan growth at a time when both loan growth and yield are hard to come by regions also has a ton of extra liquidity so it should be able to replace the higher costing deposits with cheaper ones and expand the current margins on the loans but ultimately for this deal to really pay off regions needs to successfully cross sell other banking products to enerbank s loan customers and grow the home improvement business to its customer bases as well the deal also concerns me however because it suggests regions is concerned about muted loan growth on a somewhat longer timeline which is why it s willing to pay such a high acquisition cost in theory if the loan growth were readily available it could take the 960 million of capital it s spending on the less than 3 billion of loans at enerbank and originate 9 6 billion of loans banks tend to hold 10 of reserves for each loan they originate additionally regions has bought some more specialized finance lenders before and is in some fast growing and attractive markets like florida georgia and texas so you would think organic loan growth might be a little easier to come by ultimately the deal makes me wonder how well positioned regions lending franchise really is

the next stock market crash is inevitable here are three tips to prosper when it arrives have you been reading the financial news lately if so you know what the pundits are saying a stock market crash correction is coming yikes the truth is stock market corrections are a normal part of the investment cycle as our colleague sean williams writes at no point over the past 60 years has there been a bear market that didn t correct between 10 and 19 9 at least once within three years of hitting a bottom we re now more than 14 months removed from the march 2020 bottom and have yet to see a double digit percentage retracement in the benchmark s p 500 so you have to believe a correction is imminent there s good news about these crashes though the stock market has always roared back to even higher highs which is good news for investors who know the secrets to prospering in the market even when the bear is striking below three motley fool contributors share their secrets to surviving and thriving when the next correction occurs get paid while others panic eric volkman my suggestion is a straightforward one put capital into good dividend stocks or hold on to the ones you already have the better and more reliable dividends are almost always that way for one big reason they re from companies that have proven over the years that they can make money even during the bad times economies ebb and flow markets boom and swoon the best businesses have the resources and the capability to survive these lurches which always come sooner or later much of this is about resources namely cash a business that can regularly produce piles of the green stuff is in an ideal position to fund a healthy dividend and to at least sustain it during the lean times strong cash generators tend to be businesses with products that enjoy sustainable demand from their customers and ideally sell their products at better than average margins a classic example of this we re all familiar with is microsoft msft 0 71 for any pc user microsoft products are nearly unavoidable when was the last time you used a pc without windows after all and while the company periodically tweaks and updates windows the costs of this maintenance and development are peanuts compared to what it has historically charged for it microsoft is a profitable cash amassing monster this dividend stock is a fine stock market crash hedge numerous other examples abound one obvious place to look for stars in this galaxy is the list of dividend aristocrats this is the exalted group of s p 500 index component stocks that have raised their shareholder payouts at least once per year for a minimum of 25 years running while some dividend aristocrats are better investments than others all have proven to be resilient and many will provide good shelter in a market crash there are plenty of solid companies to choose from target tgt 0 01 would be one of my picks as it s an exceptionally well managed business that s a go to retailer for millions of american shoppers many investors feel the same about walmart wmt 1 39 aflac afl 0 30 meanwhile has a strong niche in supplemental insurance products and even in market crashes and through economic recessions we ll still be buying spices and condiments made by comestibles mainstay mccormick mkc 1 12 there are of course plenty of quality dividend stocks that aren t aristocrats i m thinking in particular of real estate investment trusts reits which are obligated to pay at least 90 of their net profits out as dividends many other companies across a variety of sectors are also fine dividend plays there are plenty of places on the market to look for these and it s rewarding and potentially very lucrative to find them get your greed on barbara eisner bayer billionaire investor warren buffett gave the best advice of all and one of his big secrets in his 1986 letter to berkshire hathaway shareholders we simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful that advice will serve you well during a market crash you ll often hear that the trick to stock market success is buying when equities have plummeted and selling when they re frothy sure that s great advice but how do you know when that occurs the truth is that no one can time the market and if you try to you ll quickly discover firsthand that it s almost impossible especially if you wind up losing money by trying to trade stocks no one knows when a stock is reaching extremes in either direction however during a stock market crash you have a great opportunity to purchase stocks that could be 10 to 30 or more off their highs and you can grab some great companies at a relatively low price but there are two things an investor must have to make that happen first you ll need cash in the bank not the cash that you need to pay your monthly bills see chuck s section below but money above and beyond that so you can buy crash created bargains always have on hand a list of great companies you d like to buy then when the bottom temporarily falls out of the market you ll have the funds necessary to scoop them up the second thing you ll need is courage it takes a strong stomach and great confidence both of which warren buffett possesses to pull the trigger on buying stocks when the market is tanking this is especially true when you purchase a stock and it continues to drop lower but remember you can t time the market so you don t have to buy a company at its lowest lows just at a price that s reasonable especially if the stock had been trading in nosebleed territory opportunity costs money to capitalize on but with cash in the bank and a stomach of steel you can buy great stocks at low prices to hold for the long term this way you re almost guaranteed stellar returns when you decide it s time to sell keep money you ll need soon out of stocks chuck saletta one of the most important differences between investing and gambling is that when you invest you might be able to own your shares for many years on the flip side with most gambling each deal of the cards or roll of the dice is generally a discrete win or lose event and when you lose your money is gone that difference is crucial because it means that when you re investing you haven t permanently lost money just because your shares may be down a bit shortly after you buy them as benjamin graham the investor who taught investing to warren buffett famously said in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine in other words on a day to day basis a stock s price may tank or soar but over long periods of time its price should pretty fairly reflect what the underlying business is really worth to get to that long term value you have to be willing and able to hold on to quality companies shares through what could be significant short term pain if you need your money to cover your costs of living or some other high priority expense you simply can t hold on when the market moves against you in addition when you ve only got money you won t soon need invested in stocks it simply gets easier to be rational when faced with a market that s moving sharply against you with this in mind a strong guideline to follow is that money you expect to spend within the next five years does not belong in stocks instead for that near term money consider things like cash money market funds time matched cds treasuries or investment grade bonds if the market cooperates you won t earn as much as you would in stocks if the market turns sour however you ll have a much better chance of still having the money you need when you need it that can make all the difference in the world when it comes to making smart decisions in the midst of a market crash

does the fed dare to scale down when fed officials convened the most recent two day monetary policy meeting on tuesday the issue of whether the central bank should start discussing the reduction of its 120 billion monthly bond purchase program will be on the agenda since the fed s last meeting in late april several senior fed policymakers including vice chairman richard clarida have opened their doors to discuss the final slow down these include u s treasury bonds and institutional mortgage backed securities the most recent comments are consistent with those cited in the minutes of the fed s latest meeting which indicated that some participants thought it might be appropriate at some point in the upcoming meeting start thinking about these plans if we continue to make progress towards the central bank s goal of a more inclusive recovery from the pandemic recent economic data supports this timetable consumer prices in the u s are rise rapidlythe cpi report last thursday showed that may increased by 5 year on year the largest increase in the past 13 years in addition last month work numberalthough weaker than expected it still shows signs of improvement in the labor market most investors still expect the fed to only start to scale down in early 2022 and provide more detailed guidance on specific methods by september this year at the latest goldman sachs is expected to issue a more formal announcement in december and will not raise interest rates until early 2024 the federal reserve has signaled that they will start discussing this matter said alicia levine chief strategist at bank of new york mellon investment management they are softening market expectations this summer colby smith are inflation risks in the uk rising due to sluggish demand for goods and services and weak wage pressures consumer prices in the uk have increased at an annual rate of less than 1 for most of the pandemic however as the recent relaxation of covid 19 restrictions released pent up consumer demand the country s headline inflation figures in april doubled from the previous month when the core consumer price inflation data for may was released on wednesday some analysts expected a bigger leap predicting that the annual cpi growth would jump to the bank of england s 2 target robert wood chief british economist at bank of america said that such a surge in inflation will exacerbate the bank of england s tough attitude he also predicts that prices will rise further later this year as rising commodity prices continue to push up energy and food costs additional price pressure will come from supply chain disruption higher transportation costs push up input costs the upside risks of our inflation forecast are increasing from all angles said paul dales chief british economist at capital investment macros who expects consumer price levels to reach a peak of 2 6 in november dales added the reopening may cause the prices of bars and restaurants to rise faster than we expected and labor shortages in some industries such as construction and hotels have also begun to push up wages and prices however both analysts expect the increase in price pressure to be temporary once the rise in commodity prices affects consumer prices inflation will fall again wood said predicting that uk inflation will fall below the bank of england s target by the end of 2022 valentina rome will the bank of japan maintain interest rate policy japan s economic recovery this year is different from that of europe and the united states because it is struggling with the covid vaccination campaign and due to the pandemic tokyo and other major cities continue to be partially blocked in a state of emergency although last thursday japan s wholesale prices rose at the fastest annual rate in 13 years due to soaring commodity costs but compared with the united states japan faces less price pressure in other areas this means that when the bank of japan ends its two day meeting on friday analysts believe it will not change monetary policy i don t expect any changes in policy said harumi taguchi chief economist at ihs markit in tokyo they added flexibility in march and i expect they will continue to focus on this after a policy review the bank of japan in march canceled its promise with an average annual purchase of 6 trillion yen 54 8 billion u s dollars of stocks the purchase rate of its exchange traded funds dropped significantly in april and may these moves marked a shift from aggressive monetary stimulus to support the bank of japan s so called more sustainable policies john vail chief global strategist at nikko asset management said japan is one of the few countries where real estate prices have not risen since rent is a major component of the consumer price index significant inflation is unlikely in the future in tokyo interest rates may remain extremely low which in turn puts the yen in a weakening trend weir added robin harding
the phrase poor jeff bezos is probably not much uttered i won t try to say it now without irony but when propublica reported this week that jeff bezos michael bloomberg warren buffett bill gates rupert murdoch elon musk george soros and mark zuckerberg were among billionaires who paid little or no income tax in recent years bezos took most of the social media vitriol the founder of amazon had a net worth of about 18 billion in 2011 but reportedly paid no taxes and he got 4 000 in child tax credits bezos paid no taxes because most of his wealth came from company stock which isn t taxed until it s sold he has four children with his then wife mackenzie scott which entitled them to a 1 000 tax credit for each child why would someone worth 18 billion be given any child tax credits we spoke with elaine maag principal research associate in the urban brookings tax policy center at the urban institute who also once worked at the irs did we intend for jeff bezos to get this credit she asked probably not i can t imagine he had too much trouble finding and paying for child care she says that when the child tax credit was introduced in 1998 its purpose was to aid low and middle income families ninety percent of u s taxpayers with children receive that credit now set at 2 000 per child and even higher this year with a temporary increase from the american rescue plan which i think is good for the country maag told us to keep the percentage of families who receive the credit high all any taxpayer including jeff bezos has to do is enter their income on their tax form and the number of dependent children people claim the credit as part of the regular tax filing process maag said i don t even know how anyone would opt out maag like many tax analysts who spoke out this week said the crucial question isn t why a billionaire gets a child tax credit it s how can so many wealthy people utterly legally avoid paying taxes by getting paid in stocks rather than wages then borrow against their total assets to purchase multiple estates private aircraft historic artwork and the services of attorneys and tax consultants who i ll just guess charge more for their services than a 2 000 child tax credit i think the child tax credit is good for us all maag said i just wish more people would pay more taxes on what is their real income that would be fair copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

continues below article content consider this a gentle shuffling of the rs hierarchy with some cars taking a first among equals position and even those that find themselves at the rear of the pack still delivering a phenomenal driving experience here s our ranking of each and every generation of the audi rs avant wagon 1994 1995 audi rs2 avant photo by audi what to do when you need to build a high performance wagon but are starting largely from scratch turn to porsche which played a major role in helping audi tap into the speed and style segment that was still relatively new to the suddenly upmarket automaker in the early 90s porsche had already tried its hand tuning rival metal with its successful mercedes benz collaboration the 500e and the rs2 represented a similar type of project featuring a 2 2 liter 315 horsepower five cylinder motor the wagon roared to 100 km h in a scant 5 3 seconds which was incredible for the 1994 model year throw in suspension and braking upgrades to match and you ve got an autobahn screamer that proved just how serious audi was about hauling well whatever you could stuff in the rs2 s cargo compartment advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content 2019 present audi rs 6 avant photo by audi the current audi rs 6 avant is the first to have been sold in north america where it arrived for the 2021 model year suffice it to say it s also one of the woolliest when it comes to pure power the car s 4 0 liter twin turbo v8 churns out 591 horses and 580 lb ft of twist awd launching to 100 km h in an exotic baiting 3 1 seconds even with a costco run strapped down behind the rear seats with a curb weight of 5 000 lbs you might think that the c8 version of the rs 6 isn t as nimble as its predecessors while this might be true under the most extreme handling conditions the car is loaded with electronic nannies that keep its advanced all wheel drive setup locked to the asphalt when driven at speed yet still impressively comfortable on a daily basis the latest evolution of the rs 6 formula certainly hews more to the shock and awe side of the equation than any model that has come before it save for one which we ll get to next and its graceful low profile stands in stark contrast to the legions of tall riding suvs that currently dominate the muscle mover segment advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content 2008 2011 audi rs 6 avant photo by audi the c6 generation rs 6 avant offered between 2006 and 2011 may not have been the sharpest implement to bring to the track from a handling perspective but it does hold down the title as brashest wagon ever to emerge from an audi factory front and center of the c6 s bad attitude was a 5 2 liter v10 engine lifted from the r8 supercar giving it 580 horsepower 479 lb ft of torque and an exhaust note few other wagons can match if you ditch the stock mufflers for an aftermarket setup saddled with a complicated adaptive suspension system and a six speed automatic transmission the c6 doesn t feel quite as engaging as the models that succeeded it but it was a major shot across the bow in terms of power and a true step up over the original c5 rs 6 advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content built in part to counter bmw s own 10 cylinder m5 touring menace like its rival the c6 rs 6 avant never left the european market the car represents the peak of parent company volkswagen s no limit investment in performance and luxury across nearly its entire line up and it remains the only wagon in the audi portfolio whose drivetrain shares heritage with corporate stablemate lamborghini which featured a similar v10 in the gallardo 2006 2008 audi rs 4 avant photo by audi finally some love for the rs 4 the smaller cousin to the rs 6 powerhouse with its eye on the mercedes benz c63 amg and the bmw m3 the rs 4 prized a rowdy rev happy v8 paired with a default six speed manual transmission at the time of its launch the rs 4 was a breath of fresh air versus the big cube amg and the straight six m3 with its 414 horsepower and 317 lb ft of torque out muscling the competition and providing a soaring soundtrack on the way to its 8 250 rpm redline despite its high strung character the b7 rs 4 avant still made plenty of torque available down low and with its grabby brakes torsen equipped awd and taut suspension it represented a four seasons family truckster that could also double as a track day star advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content 2013 2015 rs 6 avant photo by audi the c7 version of the rs 6 went wagon only which scores it major points but it also ditched the v10 which was a bit of a bummer it s a good thing then that the 4 0 liter v8 featured a choice between 560 and 605 horsepower tunes letting buyers decide whether they wanted more or less grunt than the abandoned lambo mill either way the c7 was lighter and crisper than the c6 and its 190 mph 305 km h top speed and eight speed automatic transmission were both improvements to a formula that was becoming increasingly high tech and one that would be further refined by the c8 2000 2001 audi rs 4 avant photo by audi the second ever audi rs was also a wagon and it leveraged the same in house know how that had helped put together the rs2 only without a porsche influence this time with no sedan version in the cards it was strictly a family affair for the b5 rs 4 which featured a 2 7 liter twin turbo v6 a similar engine would head across the ocean under the hood of the standard s4 but in the rs 4 it was massaged by the race engineers at cosworth to produce 375 horsepower and 325 lb ft of torque advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as a pioneer this was the first rs to show that there was a market for an audi hot rod that wasn t necessarily ultra limited in its production it was also notable for being a legitimate daily driver that didn t ask you to make any real sacrifices in terms of practicality or comfort in the name of a sub 5 0 second zero to 100 km h time 2018 present rs 4 avant photo by audi did the move from a snarling v8 to a more muted twin turbo v6 deaden the audi rs 4 s drama somewhat undoubtedly was the 2 9 liter 444 horsepower unit more than up to the task of motivating the b9 generation avant with alacrity definitely offering a torque vectoring differential to complement its sure footed quattro traction and dropping in a smooth eight speed automatic the most civilized rs 4 avant to date was also one of the quickest sprinting to 100 km h in 4 1 seconds and matching models like the mercedes amg c63 in terms of handling and poise even with its cylinder deficit completely configurable from mild to wild the b9 s more filtered experience pushes it down this list but it s one very much in keeping with current luxury expectations advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content 2012 2015 rs 4 avant photo by audi the b8 rs5 avant packs almost the same package as its b7 predecessor with one major difference the move away from a clutch pedal to a seven speed automated manual gearbox removed much of the car s visceral thrills and despite a boost to 444 ponies from its 4 2 liter v8 it s hard not to see the 2012 2015 model as somewhat of a step back for the rs in terms of attitude this wagon only offering with the rs5 nameplate taking up the two door banner is a perfectly competent car that followed a legend and it preceded a more modern package 2002 2004 rs 6 avant photo by audi the very first audi rs generation to make it to north american order sheets alas only in sedan form the c5 rs 6 avant also featured cosworth intervention in its twin turbo v8 drivetrain with 450 horsepower available right out of the box and a leap to 473 horsepower available from the rs 6 avant plus it was a fitting and thunderous introduction to big bore audi performance unfortunately the c5 platform s reputation for reliability has made it somewhat of an outlier even among hardcore fans of the german brand dragging it to the bottom of our list despite its importance in building the rs legend share this article in your social network

the phrase poor jeff bezos is probably not much uttered i won t try to say it now without irony but when propublica reported this week that jeff bezos michael bloomberg warren buffett bill gates rupert murdoch elon musk george soros and mark zuckerberg were among billionaires who paid little or no income tax in recent years bezos took most of the social media vitriol the founder of amazon had a net worth of about 18 billion in 2011 but reportedly paid no taxes and he got 4 000 in child tax credits bezos paid no taxes because most of his wealth came from company stock which isn t taxed until it s sold he has four children with his then wife mackenzie scott which entitled them to a 1 000 tax credit for each child why would someone worth 18 billion be given any child tax credits we spoke with elaine maag principal research associate in the urban brookings tax policy center at the urban institute who also once worked at the irs did we intend for jeff bezos to get this credit she asked probably not i can t imagine he had too much trouble finding and paying for child care she says that when the child tax credit was introduced in 1998 its purpose was to aid low and middle income families ninety percent of u s taxpayers with children receive that credit now set at 2 000 per child and even higher this year with a temporary increase from the american rescue plan which i think is good for the country maag told us to keep the percentage of families who receive the credit high all any taxpayer including jeff bezos has to do is enter their income on their tax form and the number of dependent children people claim the credit as part of the regular tax filing process maag said i don t even know how anyone would opt out maag like many tax analysts who spoke out this week said the crucial question isn t why a billionaire gets a child tax credit it s how can so many wealthy people utterly legally avoid paying taxes by getting paid in stocks rather than wages then borrow against their total assets to purchase multiple estates private aircraft historic artwork and the services of attorneys and tax consultants who i ll just guess charge more for their services than a 2 000 child tax credit i think the child tax credit is good for us all maag said i just wish more people would pay more taxes on what is their real income that would be fair copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
a few words about the makers and the takers that as you may recall was the formulation once favored by fox news and other organs of the political right to describe the dynamic between those at the top of the economic pyramid and those at the bottom the poor characterized as scavenging animals by more than one conservative were said to contribute nothing to our society while mooching off their financial betters but it is worth re examining the whole makers and takers paradigm in light of last week s jarring report from propublica the nonprofit online newsroom it was based on a trove of irs information provided by an anonymous source and it laid out in granular detail the strategies used by the wealthiest people in america to get away with paying little or nothing in taxes take for instance jeff bezos amazon founder and world s richest man with a net worth estimated by forbes at 192 billion we are told that he paid nothing in taxes in 2007 and 2011 and a relative pittance in other years not to pick on bezos elon musk michael bloomberg warren buffett and other ginormously rich people all reportedly employ the same strategy to avoid taxes which is to say they pay themselves minimal salaries as little as a dollar a year in some cases and keep their wealth in the form of stocks bonds and other financial instruments which the irs does not consider income and taxes at a much lower rate for comparison propublica says the median american tax rate in recent years is 14 percent but it calculates bezos true tax rate between 2014 and 2018 that is factoring the growth of his assets in with his reported income at under 1 percent it says that when people like him need actual cash they simply borrow against their massive assets interest on such loans runs in the single digits and the proceeds are not considered income and therefore are not taxable all of this is perfectly legal by the way also perfectly infuriating and here let me just say i believe in capitalism i believe that when you incentivize earning you incentivize risk taking innovation and hard work but i also believe something is wrong when ceo pay rose by about 1 000 percent between 1978 and 2018 while worker pay edged up just 12 percent something is wrong when working full time doesn t put a roof over your head or food on your table something is wrong when an amazon driver complains of 14 hour shifts and peeing in bottles to make his delivery quotas something is wrong when employees at tyson and other meat packers report wearing diapers to work because conveyor belts are relentless and bathroom breaks denied spend your days with hayes subscribe to our free stephinitely newsletter columnist stephanie hayes will share thoughts feelings and funny business with you every monday loading you re all signed up want more of our free weekly newsletters in your inbox let s get started explore all your options i also believe that paying taxes is a patriotic duty onerous you bet but patriotic just the same it s how we fund our governments local and national and the services they provide everything from road maintenance fire and police to military defense food safety and environmental cleanup we all benefit from those services whether ginormously wealthy pitiably poor or somewhere in between any tax code that allows the rich to freeload on that which is paid for by the rest of us is morally bankrupt and in need of overhaul moreover it gives the lie to the right wing s lavish contempt for the poor in the wake of propublica s report maybe we should reconsider who the makers really are and who is taking what from whom leonard pitts jr is a columnist for the miami herald 3511 nw 91st ave miami fla 33172 readers may contact him via e mail at lpitts miamiherald com 2021 miami herald distributed by tribune content agency llc
by barani krishnan investing com inflation is here and the conventional wisdom is that we should buy gold conventional should actually be underlined as gold s history as an inflation hedge is anything but certain gold has had spotty returns over the past few months despite creeping price pressures and fears that u s inflation in 2021 could be the worst in 35 years those surprised or frustrated by this might benefit from studying the history of the precious metal s returns over the past 40 years a morningstar analysis of gold s returns during some of the highest u s inflation periods since the 1980s shows a negative yield for long only investors in the yellow metal commodities other than gold as well as reits or real estate investments trusts and or treasury inflation protected securities actually performed better than gold and more like an inflation hedge during these periods year to date benchmark gold futures on new york s comex are down 1 4 the spot price of gold which reflects live trades in bullion is almost 1 lower on the year in comparison to these the a globally accepted measure of inflation expanded by an annual rate of 5 in may in the united states the a tamer measure of inflation used by the federal reserve rose 3 6 in the year to april until the covid 19 outbreak and the chronic disruption of u s supply chains that followed the fed s target of keeping annual inflation at or under 2 has barely been challenged over the past decade now that it has inflation is the one risk that s on top of investors minds but gold hasn t delivered to expectations at least gold is really not a perfect hedge for inflation morningstar portfolio strategist amy arnott said in a cnbc post this week that analyzed the returns of various asset classes during periods of above average inflation in the united states there s no guarantee if there s a spike in inflation gold will also generate above average returns arnott added gold s correlation to inflation has been relatively low 0 16 over the past half century arnott said this metric shows how closely gold and inflation track together a correlation of 0 means there s no relationship while a correlation of 1 means they move in unison arnott s study shows that long only investors in gold lost 10 on average from 1980 to 1984 when the annual inflation rate was about 6 5 similarly gold yielded a negative 7 6 return from 1988 to 1991 a period when inflation was about 4 6 reits returned 11 5 20 4 and 9 over 1973 79 1980 84 and 1988 91 respectively commodities other than gold yielded 19 4 2 3 and 21 over the same time frames in modern day history gold s most glorious run was during a five month stretch last year when it went from a low of nearly 1 477 in march 17 to a record high of 2 120 by august 7 a gain of 44 but as an inflation hedge gold really outperformed between 1973 and 1979 when it gained 35 while the annual inflation rate in that period averaged 8 8 my own analysis shows that the gold speculator regardless bull or bear may have found the perfect play for now buy at near 1 850 and sell well before 1 900 the 40 50 target for each trade may seem like a dumbed down way to trade gold when a myriad of chart signals and the intersection of treasury yields and the dollar should be setting the course yet a look at the weekly fluctuations on comex since mid may suggests that the former would have generated more wins than any artsy fancy strategy involving multiple hedges as the latest week rolled to a close an all too familiar pattern reinforced itself forcing gold once again below the key bullish mark of 1 900 the comex high for the week was 1 906 15 while the low was 1 871 95 keeping within the 30 50 range of the past month wobbly since its return on thursday to 1 900 pricing gold took a decisive turn lower after friday s release of the university of michigan s closely followed for june which came in at 86 4 versus expectations for 84 2 and the may reading of 82 9 that nudged the higher but not by much to 1 462 the bigger damage to gold probably came from friday s somewhat inexplicable rebound in the although the greenback also did not get too far with an intraday high of 90 61 phillip streible precious metals strategist at blueline futures in chicago said the logic bending move in the dollar did not make friday s trade in gold any easier it s the same mind numbing thing each week said streible between gold the dollar and yields you have three different plates spinning at the same time and you re trying to decide which one to go with when none really is appealing for now gold market and price roundup on new york s comex did a final trade of 1 879 25 an ounce before the weekend after settling friday s trade at 1 879 60 down 16 80 or 0 9 for the week it fell 0 7 the of gold reflective of real time trades in bullion settled friday s trade at 1 877 72 down 20 31 or 1 1 for the week it fell 0 7 traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price which reflects bullion for prompt delivery instead of futures oil market brief price roundup oil prices rose for a third straight week on speculation of runaway summer demand for fuels although some investors were keeping a wary eye on gasoline which hasn t performed to expectations since the start of the peak u s driving season the benchmark for u s

lately amid projections for one of the biggest ever summer demand periods for fuel in the united states as the country reopens fully from covid 19 lockdowns the international energy agency which represents the interests of western oil consumers said in its monthly report that global producers would need to boost output to meet demand set to recover to pre pandemic levels by the end of 2022 opec needs to open the taps to keep the world oil markets adequately supplied the paris based iea said referring to the 13 member organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its 10 non member allies despite the optimism over global oil demand us gasoline take up has been tepid since the may 31 memorial day that marked the start of the peak summer driving period in the world s largest oil consuming country that suggests to some that more time was probably needed for u s fuel demand to accelerate the problem was particularly highlighted by the u s energy information administration s weekly petroleum status report released wednesday which showed rising by 7 05 million barrels during the week ended june 4 nearly six times above analysts estimates for a 1 2 million barrel build the washington based eia also reported that which include diesel and rose by 4 4 million barrels against expectations for a 1 8 million barrel rise offsetting some of the build in gasoline and distillates fell by 5 2 million barrels in the week to june 4 the eia said versus a forecast decline of 3 5 million barrels we need to start showing some strong weekly draw numbers on
