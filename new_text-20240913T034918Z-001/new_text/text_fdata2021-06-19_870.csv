new york new york new york four decades of success excess and transformation by thomas dyja simon schuster 544 pp 22 many wonder whether new york can recover from the covid 19 pandemic but the city was already ailing from years of mismanagement and drift under mayor bill de blasio from last summer s riots and from a sense that its energy has been drained over the last few decades new yorkers should be celebrating the city s post 1975 renaissance but instead they re anxious enter thomas dyja s new york new york new york four decades of success excess and transformation a dizzying tour of recent new york history that offers an insightful but ultimately frustrating interpretation of how the city rescued itself from the depths of despair and arrived where it is today motivating dyja s book is the pre covid feeling that while so much had gone right in new york way too much had gone wrong new york dyja writes had experienced the most dramatic peacetime transformation of a city since haussmann rebuilt paris with safer streets and a revived economy gotham became fashionable again not just for artists and urban pioneers but for college educated professionals young adults and immigrants but this transformation left many new yorkers sour such books as jeremiah moss s 2017 vanishing new york how a great city lost its soul railed against the hyper gentrification that accelerated during the bloomberg years while the social justice craze took dead aim at nypd policies that helped drive crime down to historic levels it added up to disenchantment with a city that just a few years earlier had been seen as a national success story dyja attempts to explain this reversal with a quirky but myopic history from the perspective of his native upper west side he takes a view heavy on culture and the arts but lighter on economics and finance his writing strains to emulate the subversive edge of tom wolfe his sensibility resembles that of a liberal who benefited from the city s transformation but feels guilty about it the book s title comes from sociologist william holly whyte s answer when someone asked him to name his three favorite american cities this is a manhattan focused book the outer boroughs appear only in a discussion of the origins of hip hop the book contains plenty on keith haring and jean michel basquiat but has little to say about middle class homeowners in queens small business owners or even recent immigrants dyja divides new york s transformation into four parts first came a renaissance under ed koch as the city dug out from under its 1970s fiscal crisis and a stock market boom filled its coffers next was the reconsideration under david dinkins who tried to revive the city s liberal traditions after that came the reformation under rudy giuliani as crime plummeted and the city again blossomed last was the reimagination under michael bloomberg who sought to use the resources of the newly safe and prosperous city to remake and redevelop it dyja is ambivalent about koch repelled by his neocon tendencies but appreciating his talents as a politician and mayor like many liberals he wants to give dinkins credit for the success of the 1990s but also understands that the mayor let the city go adrift the book is best in its discussion of the bloomberg administration which dyja calls the most effective city hall in memory at what it chose to be effective at indeed the billionaire mayor hired talented staffers and enacted ambitious reforms from bike lanes to schools to redevelopment yet as new york became a luxury city under bloomberg complaints added up dyja doesn t devote much space to the de blasio mayoralty and does not seem impressed dyja can t come to grips with rudy giuliani whom he calls one of the most venomous mayors in city history he characterizes giuliani as a barely disguised racist whose successes owed to policies inherited from dinkins dyja s judgment stems partly from the damage that the former mayor did to his reputation during donald trump s presidency and partly from a racial progressivism that casts policing and welfare reforms in the harshest light to dyja the giuliani administration was little more than the embodiment of white supremacy dyja even identifies city journal and the manhattan institute as malignant forces in new york s body politic he blames the manhattan institute for sponsoring george gilder s wealth and poverty and charles murray s losing ground books he describes in a cartoonish manner he sees only white supremacy in city journal articles about public order communitarian ideas often found in city journal that involved letting average new yorkers determine standards writes dyja assumed that average meant white a cauldron of majority mores passing as melting pot nostalgia busy attacking dyja distorts the factual record he spends two pages mischaracterizing a 1991 city journal roundtable that featured among others nathan glazer fred siegel joe klein and jim sleeper in dyja s telling klein s praise for a more decentralized less bureaucratic way of delivering government services demonstrates that city journal argued that the poor weren t really citizens and if the poor aren t really citizens then social services are no longer a basic responsibility come again dyja cites another quote claiming that post 1960s moral foundations had shifted concluding that in the roundtable s view no matter what you tried to do for it wouldn t make any difference liberal sociologist jonathan rieder indeed wrote in the roundtable our moral foundations have shifted he then continued the sixties marked a major change in the sensibility of liberalism liberalism emerged as a righteous and patrician upper middle class endeavor at odds with both the pragmatic bread and butter ethos of the new deal and the gritty plebeian spirit of working class ethnic neighborhoods which includes the communal sanctions that keep people on the straight and narrow path later in the discussion rieder calls the rights revolution of the 1960s a remarkable triumph despite its excesses dyja leaves out this context misrepresenting rieder s nuanced and reasonable argument such a flawed retelling of the city s past produces shallow recommendations for its future dyja complains that the white moneyed establishment of new york has always dictated how new york would change the city needs to make sure everyone has access to all the different kinds of capital being produced and has agency in how they get them and should seek not only to preserve the huge network of new york but make that network bigger and denser communities need to become stronger live in your community not on top of it dyja advises public administration must be as nonpartisan as possible we are told new york must follow through on the promise to deliver the benefits of growth to all new yorkers and create a city built on a bedrock of justice not just noblesse oblige finally dyja repeats calls for police reform demanding that the city must purge its police department of racism and stand up to the police union these proposals represent a standard combination of good government rhetoric mixed with moderate social justice ideology anyone looking for plans to grow the city s economy while making sure that prosperity is broadly shared or to prevent crime and violence amid a new surge of both will be disappointed new york at its best balances itself between order and disorder the city has become a victim of its own success and now finds that the forces of disorder are growing the widespread angst regarding new york s future spans ideology race and class but dyja s new york new york new york works less as a history of the city s recent past than as a primary source documenting why some new yorkers have grown disillusioned with their city photo by gary hershorn getty images
last year proved to be a gold speculator and investor s dream after gold prices rallied hard to hit historical highs thanks to a perfect storm of a global pandemic massive government stimulus packages a weakening dollar and a stock market bull run that was finally running out of gas the torrid rally represented the sharpest gain the metal has mustered in more than a decade unfortunately the rally has run out of steam with gold prices pulling back sharply since its all time high of 2 075 per ounce gold futures have once again slumped below 1 800 oz posting their biggest one day loss in seven months on thursday after the federal reserve sped up its expected pace of policy tightening on wednesday fed chairman jerome powell said during his post decision press conference that rising inflation is due to mostly transitory factors but also admitted that inflation may be more persistent than they currently expect if we see inflation moving materially above what we see as consistent to our goals and persistently so the fed would act to bring it down the markets did not like the fed s doublespeak with the dollar rising but gold commodities and stocks falling august comex gold xauusd cur tumbled 4 1 to trade at 1 784 oz which would represent the biggest one day drop since last november according to factset data while july silver xagusd cur fell 5 5 to 26 27 oz not surprisingly gold mining stocks have not been spared the vaneck vectors gold miners etf gdx fell 5 5 on thursday and another 1 6 on friday for a total 10 2 loss over the past five trading sessions gdx has a 4 47 ytd return vaneck vectors junior gold miners etf gdxj lost 4 74 on thursday s session and 9 47 over the last five trading sessions gdxj is down 11 2 ytd this has come as a major disappointment for gold bulls with some wall street hedge funds having been extremely bullish on gold with some eyeing prices of 3 000 and even 5 000 per ounce summers are usually a quiet time for the markets especially for gold but some wall street punters such as oanda senior market analyst edward moya have been saying this time it could be different moya previously said this volatility could be excellent news as the precious metal gears up to make a run towards 1 900 but now he has been forced to change his tune the fed s hawkish pivot is a major buzzkill for gold bulls that could see some momentum selling over the short term short term treasury yields will continue to rise and that should provide some underlying support for the dollar which will keep commodities vulnerable at this juncture we believe the gold outlook is a mixed bag here s why vaccine optimism on the opposite side of the spectrum a successful vaccination campaign and reopening of the global economy is bearish for gold a big reason why the gold bears have lately been gaining an upperhand is due to growing optimism that the global covid 19 vaccine rollout will help many economies return to a semblance of normalcy sooner than expected for instance in its april update of the world economic outlook the imf upgraded its forecast for global gdp growth for 2021 and 2022 to 6 and 4 4 respectively thanks mainly to the country s the countrys swift vaccine rollout and hefty stimulus packages that is a big turnaround from a contraction of 3 3 in 2020 when the world was hit by the pandemic the united states has so far unveiled the world s fastest vaccine rollout as per bloomberg placing itself in a good position for a full re opening of the economy generally the global rollout is progressing at an adequate clip despite the presence of numerous hiccups such as a major second wave in india and brazil with the pandemic risk becoming increasingly subdued safe haven investors have been losing interest in gold sluggish labor markets back in march the fed set an inflation target at 2 4 with the hopes that an overheated economy would ultimately drive workers back into the labor market with the u s returning to full employment the fed expected that at that point we would resolve the rampant shortages and supply chain issues thus helping the so called transitory price hikes to normalize but as things stand right now it could be another 12 14 more months before we come anywhere near full employment meaning inflation will run hotter for longer than we anticipated an environment of stagflation tends to favor safe havens such as gold and silver

also style indexes such as the russell 1000 growth and russell 2000 value it is often the heaviest trading volume day of the year as investors and fund managers scramble to buy or sell shares to dozens or even hundreds of companies to reflect changes in indexes many this year will be watching meme stocks like gamestop or amc entertainment whose value soared companies that went public through mergers with a specialty purpose acquisition company spac will also be on the radar as of the end of 2020 about 10 6 trillion in investor assets was benchmarked to russell s u s indexes according to ftse russell while ftse russell has occasionally tweaked its rules for inclusion in its indexes such as allowing companies with multiple share classes to remain in or be permitted for inclusion this year s reconstitution has no methodology changes our policy team obviously regularly talks to the market participants and our committees and there were no new rules identified that were needed said catherine yoshimoto ftse russell director of product management market capitalization for the russell 3000 index vaulted from 31 4 trillion in 2020 to 47 7 trillion as of russell s rank day on may 7 2021 stock market volatility took the index on a wild ride in the past two years in early 2020 stocks sold off when the pandemic hit but then rebounded late in the first quarter to remain about flat from the previous year this year the market cap for the index surged as stocks have rebounded along with vaccine distribution and a reduction in pandemic induced lockdowns graphic performance of russell indexes between rank days it s more assets more appreciation you ve got some stocks that have gotten bigger weight changes so they are going to see more trading volume because there is jumping around so this is a bigger trade this year than it has been in previous years said steve desanctis equity strategist at jefferies in new york the market cap breakpoint russell uses to determine inclusion in the large cap russell 1000 or the small cap 2000 also increased to 5 2 billion in 2021 from 3 billion in 2020 perhaps no group of stocks exemplified the pandemic trading environment more than the so called meme stocks such as gamestop and amc entertainment shares for those companies had languished and even been shorted by many institutional investors due to poor fundamentals they took off like a rocket as retail investors using commission free trading services looked for places to invest government stimulus checks the market cap of amc for instance stood at 4 3 billion on the may 7 rank day but has surged to over 30 billion by june 17 well above the top end of the market cap band for the russell 2000 index of 7 3 billion set by russell gamestop is expected to graduate to the russell 1000 large cap index managers who have chosen not to own those stocks prefer they stay within the index so as not to disrupt their performance versus the benchmark where those stocks move will dictate a lot of active manager s relative performance over the following six eight or 10 months after the rebalancing said keith buchanan senior portfolio manager at globalt in atlanta i would rather have amc in the benchmark because obviously since i don t own it i think it is overvalued therefore if amc falls his investments would look better against the benchmark goldman sachs expects 255 additions to the russell 3000 and 295 deletions and expects 57 stocks will enter the russell 1000 including 34 currently in the russell 2000 goldman anticipated a total of 279 stock will enter the small cap index comprised of 232 new components and 47 being knocked down from the large cap index a big portion of expected adds will be companies that went public through a merger with a spac jefferies desanctis estimates over 25 of additions to the russell 3000 are spac companies it is the year of the spac the year of the meme stock and here they are having ramifications on real money said ross mayfield investment strategist at baird in louisville kentucky during the event every year volume surges near the close often resulting in the biggest trading volume day of the year the nasdaq and new york stock exchange have contingency plans for the event kbw analyst melissa roberts expects the bulk of passive fund trading related to the reconstitution will occur in the last 15 minutes or so of the session and estimates the net trade will total nearly 75 billion let s face it for the new york stock exchange russell reconstitution from a trading standpoint is the greatest show on earth that s where it all comes down said gordon charlop a managing director at rosenblatt securities in new york reporting by chuck mikolajczak editing by alden bentley and david gregorio

in recent weeks the world socialist web site has made appeals on social media groups of mexican workers providing information and requesting statements of support for the strike at the volvo trucks new river valley plant in virginia and the two month long strike by warrior met coal miners in alabama on june 14 jeffrey hermanson consultant and former mexico program director for the solidarity center a foreign arm of the afl cio funded by the us state department intervened against one such appeal by the wsws requesting statements on the facebook group of the rank and file generating movement at the general motors plant in silao mexico responding specifically to the call by the wsws to support the fight by the volvo workers rank and file committee vwrfc at the new river valley plant against the american charro uaw hermanson wrote in spanish the difference between the uaw the umwa and the charro unions in mexico is immense the uaw and umwa value the decisions of workers even when they disagree with the leaders then he characterized the decision of both organizations to re start the strikes and re negotiate once workers voted down the contracts reached by the unions as proof of how important union democracy is for improving wages and working conditions the generating movement group was formed in opposition to the charro union affiliated to the confederation of mexican workers ctm the term charro refers to corrupt gangster ridden and corporate and state controlled unions the militant group joined calls organized by the wsws with american autoworkers and resisted increased production in order to support the gm strike in the united states in 2019 since then the afl cio and the state department have been working to direct it behind so called independent unions they have trained and financed the claim that the uaw and umwa are paragons of union democracy is designed to sell us government backed unions to mexican workers for more than 100 years the afl and then afl cio have worked to establish unions across latin america aligned with the efforts of the cia us corporations and wall street to secure their hegemony including through military coups and fascist dictatorships this included decades working exhaustively to purge the mexican ctm itself of militant workers and officials demanding greater democracy within the organization hermanson makes his claims about the uaw and umwa as both a defender of the interests of the corporatist and bureaucratic afl cio apparatus of which he is a part and as a veteran in the attempt to conceal the reality confronting us workers in order to better promote state department democratic unions abroad these claims however are thoroughly refuted by just some of the recent statements made by american workers describing their experience with the uaw and umwa as silao workers were being fired by gm for supporting the us strike the uaw was selling it out by ramming through a contract expanding temporary work with poverty wages and the closing of four facilities workers widely denounced the vote as fraudulent with one commenting on the uaw facebook page i m quite sure uaw membership did not ratify this contract in my past 24 years whenever membership votes no it still passes in an open letter monday to the uaw that every worker should read the volvo workers rank and file committee at the new river valley plant wrote matt blondino says that the strike will continue until an agreement is ratified given that you have told us nothing about what you are proposing that is different from the agreements we have rejected this seems more a threat against us than the company you are telling us that we will remain isolated and starved on the picket lines until we accept what we have already rejected at the warrior met strike in alabama the umwa regional vice president larry spencer and a district representative both members of the executive board of the alabama afl cio violently assaulted podcasters that they mistakenly identified as wsws reporters even threatening one with racist language i ll beat your mother f king brains out boy in response a striking warrior met miner told the wsws that thuggery is all he knows and added i think they are thieves themselves making six figure salaries while the rank and file gets 300 a week last month former uaw president dennis williams was given a minimum 21 month prison sentence by a federal court as one of 15 individuals charged in an ongoing corruption investigation into the uaw twenty one months for stealing millions of dollars stealing from all these locals he s getting off light a volvo truck worker in virginia told the wsws comparing the uaw leaders to crime bosses back in the day like al capone just like the ctm the uaw has forced workers to keep producing vehicles during the deadly covid 19 pandemic while helping management cover up outbreaks resulting in hundreds of cases and deaths across the country amid an ongoing outbreak in april a worker at the stellantis sterling heights assembly plant told the wsws the fact that the union has said nothing refusing to answer calls or emails from its membership paints a pretty good picture as to their true colors they re not representing our best interests our health and safety and with covid rampant in the plants our families health and safety as well another stellantis worker in indiana stated they are playing roulette with our lives all they want is numbers the union is almost like management they don t care what we think it is almost like talking to the wall in their anti democratic activities their intimate ties to the state and the billions they have accrued including through union management funds and corporate stocks the uaw and umwa make the mexican charros look like petty thieves striking auto parts and other workers in matamoros mexico in 2019 hermanson s intervention in opposition to the world socialist web site s appeal to mexican workers for support for the volvo strikers in virginia exposes two things first the afl cio and its misnamed and government funded solidarity center are determined to prevent any unification of mexican and us workers and to keep them in the dark as much as possible as to the struggles being waged by their class brothers and sisters on the opposite side of the rio bravo rio grande second the afl cio its local agents and the us government which stands behind them are extremely concerned about the growing influence of the wsws and growing support for its socialist and internationalist perspective among key sectors of the mexican working class it is no accident that hermanson s intervention came just days after us vice president kamala harris visit to mexico city during which she called upon mexican officials and trade unionists to fight for democratic unions while pledging 130 million in us assistance for this cause the us government s aim is to utilize these unions to police the mexican working class and prevent their struggles from disrupting the vital supply chains from mexico to the us auto arms and other industries workers in mexico the united states and every other country are waging one and the same insurgency not only against transnational corporations and global finance but also against corporatist unions everywhere that have overseen decades of attacks on their living standards and jobs for the sake of defending capitalist profits the international committee of the fourth international icfi is fighting to unite these struggles across national borders and to provide them with the necessary conscious strategy for this purpose it has called for the formation of genuinely democratic organizations in every workplace elected and controlled by workers themselves and their unification under the international workers alliance of rank and file committees iwa rfc
the las vegas strip could be in for a great year at its peak in 2006 the las vegas strip generated 569 million in monthly gambling revenue and the region s casinos had never been healthier but a wave of expansion and a pandemic in 2020 left the region in dire straits in 2020 las vegas averaged just 311 1 million in monthly gambling revenue and for a period of time the entire strip was shut down casino stocks adjusted by raising money and cutting costs but for more than a year the question for investors has been how long will the recovery in las vegas take companies have been hinting that by fall 2021 business should return to a more normal level but we re seeing a jump in gambling activity already in april the las vegas strip reported 483 4 million in gambling revenue and it s likely that will continue to rise as covid 19 infection numbers fall and vaccination rates rise las vegas may already be back and could be better than ever by the end of the year a partial recovery so far the recovery in las vegas is impressive but it hasn t been even corporate customers who drive weekday stays have not returned in any meaningful way but weekend consumers have come back quickly in early may caesars entertainment czr 5 64 coo anthony carano said the las vegas strip was sold out on the weekend for the foreseeable future it will likely take much more time for the weekday business to return conventions and business travel is normally planned months or even years in advance so we likely won t see the full recovery of las vegas group stays until late in 2021 or into 2022 carano said that caesars could have better convention and group business in the future than it did in 2019 saying group and convention room nights on the books for the second half of 21 versus 19 are currently pacing up approximately 20 and we re seeing good rate growth as well 2022 group revenue on the books is pacing up approximately 15 wynn resorts wynn 2 11 ceo matt maddox had similar thoughts on his conference call the back half of 21 looks good 22 is really strong mgm resorts mgm 3 73 ceo bill hornbuckle was more muted saying with the larger groups expected to return at scale in 22 our business in 22 and 23 is on pace with pre covid levels there s a partial recovery today with weekends performing well but weekdays are still struggling based on management s comments the weekday business could be extremely healthy by late 2021 could las vegas be better off than pre pandemic what s wild is to think that las vegas could actually be better off post pandemic than it was in 2019 but that could happen and bullish management comments indicate they expect a strong recovery it s hard to project revenue and ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a proxy for cash flow from casinos in las vegas but we can get an idea of demand by looking at room rates i ll use wynn las vegas as an example of where it seems room rates are headed in 2019 wynn resorts average daily room rate adr was 269 per night that fell to 235 in 2020 although revenue per available room was only 70 but looking at wynn s booking calendar rates are exploding casino companies don t give out rooms booked for future dates or rates but we can get an idea of the booking trends based simply on their booking sites for a weekday in july monday thru thursday rates for a standard king room at wynn las vegas range from 159 to 399 per night weekend nights friday thru sunday which remember are in high demand range from 254 to 719 per night if we look out to september weekday rates range from 319 to 509 per night and weekends are 339 to 899 per night with nearly half of weekend nights currently priced over 800 there are also six nights in september that are completely unavailable at wynn this isn t a perfect proxy for demand and prices can depend on events and the time before a booking but the direction of rates seems clear the trend to higher room rates bolsters management comments that demand is extremely high later in 2021 and it s possible that room rates could exceed 2019 highs by later this year that could translate to better revenue and profitability as well do casino stocks have more room to run is it too late to get into casino stocks the three biggest publicly traded operators in las vegas have actually done well for investors over the last three years only wynn resorts is down and that s partly driven by the decline in macau where the company generates most of its revenue i do think casino stocks will continue to do well as the economy recovers and people flock back to las vegas there s likely to be high demand for entertainment and conventions over the next few years as consumers and businesses reconnect as a bonus we could also see casino companies reinstate or increase dividends once cash flow starts flowing again casinos are actually built to be great dividend stocks because casinos require high upfront costs but generate cash for decades and if revenue is growing then there s more leftover for investors just another reason to be bullish on las vegas over the next few years

new york ap the declaration of juneteenth as a federal holiday is putting the pressure on more u s companies to give their employees the day off accelerating a movement that took off last year in response to the racial justice protests that swept the country hundreds of top companies had already pledged last year to observe juneteenth in the wake of the police killing of george floyd and the national reckoning on race that followed but most private companies take their cues from the federal government the country s largest employer in drawing up their holiday calendars president joe biden signed legislation thursday establishing juneteenth as a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery following the passage of a bipartisan congressional bill more than 800 companies have publicly pledged to observe juneteenth according to hellacreative a group of black creative professionals in the san francisco bay area that launched a campaign last year to build corporate support for making the june 19th an official holiday that is nearly double the number of companies that had joined the pledge last year patagonia the outdoor apparel retailer announced that all of its u s stores will be closed saturday and its corporate offices would be closed monday other brands including target j c penney and best buy had pledged last year to adopting juneteenth as paid holiday though they are keeping stores open several major banks have said employees will get a floating paid day off many companies however had little time to shuffle their holiday calendars some offered employees a regular paid day off or promised to consider adding it to their calendars next year nasdaq said its u s exchange would stay open friday and monday to maintain a fair and orderly market and to minimize operational risks but that it would discuss its future holiday schedule with regulator and companies state governments that had not already declared juneteenth a holiday were also scrambling to respond the new federal holiday illinois gov j b pritzker announced that all state government offices will be closed friday superseding a state law signed just two days earlier that would have made june 19 a state holiday next year even though federal holidays like thanksgiving are widely observed private companies are under no obligation any particular day off but since many workers don t know that they will likely wonder why they are not getting a paid holiday for juneteenth this year said carolina valencia a director in research firm gartner s human resource practice in an area of increasing employee activism and a fierce competition for talent valencia said she expects the number of companies offering juneteenth to surge next year after employers have had more time to react many employees are going to resent their employers for not giving them the holiday because they don t understand that it s a complicated process valencia said but she said the devil will be in the details many companies will likely offer it as floating day off making it unlikely that juneteenth will become a national holiday on par with july 4th or memorial day anytime soon and many notable companies have not joined the movement walmart which employs 300 000 black hourly workers and is the country s largest private sector employer told the associated press in an email that its employees are free to used paid time off to observe any holiday they wish including juneteenth raheem thompson a social media specialist for a retail company said he was disappointed he didn t get a paid day off instead he said the company sent an email acknowledging the federal holiday and pledging to consider time off in the future it s kind of bare minimum said thompson who lives in atlanta but didn t want his company named for fear of repercussions i don t think as people of color we really care that you acknowledge it via email that doesn t really have any true meaning to it juneteenth commemorates june 19 1865 when union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved black people in galveston texas two months after the confederacy had surrendered that was also about 2 1 2 years after the emancipation proclamation freed slaves in the southern states black americans especially in texas have long celebrated juneteenth with church picnics and speeches but the federal holiday declaration brought it to the attention of some americans for the first time jamie hickey founder small fitness company in philadelphia said he had never heard of juneteenth until he heard about it last week on the radio then his four trainers started talking about it at lunch and he asked them if it was important to them he decided to make it a day off next year since it was too late to cancel on clients this year they said are you serious you are just now hearing about this said hickey who founded truismfitness last year after the chain fitness company where he and he other trainers closed because of the pandemic hickey said he took he lead from his employees because as a white man he worried about about jumping into trends only to be accused of tokenism i don t want to fake if you are fake you get caught and it s a million times worse hikey said that s a major concern among even the biggest employees said erin eve ceo of ichor strategies which advises firm on connecting businesses with their communities eve said companies will get called out by their employees customers and even investors if they take steps like observing juneteenth without investing in black communities or looking an their own internal diversity still eve said the declaration of juneteenth as a federal holiday will make companies that don t follow suit increasingly look bad for current employees it will

expectations for the economy and inflation the s p 500 fell 55 41 points or 1 3 percent to 4 166 45 in a widespread slump it was the worst day for the index in a month as unease grows about the

the fed also began talks about slowing its bond buying program that s helping to keep longer term rates low on friday st louis federal reserve president james bullard said on cnbc his personal prediction was that the first rate increase may come as soon as next year it s an acknowledgment that a rebounding economy with near record prices for homes and stocks may not need super low rates much longer a recent burst of inflation may also be upping the pressure but any pullback in fed support would be a big change for markets which have been feasting on ultra low rates for more than a year it marked a u turn on easy street as strategists at bofa global research described it that s hurt stocks of banks oil producers and other companies whose profits are closely tied to the strength of the economy in particular on the other side stocks of companies able to grow almost regardless of the economy s fortunes have held up better advertisement the dow jones industrial average which is

economy and some supply shortages have helped send prices soaring across the economy recently from lumber to airline tickets to used cars the fed has said it expects high inflation to be only transitory and prices for lumber at least have already started to moderate a bit much of wall street also says inflation looks to be only temporary but part of the fed s mission is to keep prices under control you just don t have the firms able to build capacity to meet demand said ken johnson investment strategy analyst at wells fargo investment institute investors are nervous about that the first action the fed is likely to take would be a slowdown in its 120 billion of monthly bond purchases which are helping to keep mortgages cheap but the fed s chair said such a tapering is still likely a ways away besides keeping inflation steady the fed s other main job is to keep the job market healthy employment has been improving but growth has slowed in recent months that gives investors

alexandra olson associated press new york the declaration of juneteenth as a federal holiday is putting the pressure on more u s companies to give their employees the day off accelerating a movement that took off last year in response to the racial justice protests that swept the country hundreds of top companies had already pledged last year to observe juneteenth in the wake of the police killing of george floyd and the national reckoning on racism that followed but most private companies take their cues from the federal government the country s largest employer in drawing up their holiday calendars president joe biden signed legislation thursday establishing juneteenth as a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery following the passage of a bipartisan congressional bill more than 800 companies have publicly pledged to observe juneteenth according to hellacreative a group of black creative professionals in the san francisco bay area that launched a campaign last year to build corporate support for making the june 19th an official holiday that is nearly double the number of companies that had joined the pledge last year patagonia the outdoor apparel retailer announced that all of its u s stores will be closed saturday and its corporate offices would be closed monday other brands including target j c penney and best buy had pledged last year to adopt juneteenth as a paid holiday though they are keeping stores open several major banks have said employees will get a floating paid day off many companies however had little time to shuffle their holiday calendars some offered employees a regular paid day off or promised to consider adding it to their calendars next year nasdaq said its u s exchange would stay open friday and monday to maintain a fair and orderly market and to minimize operational risks but that it would discuss its future holiday schedule with regulators and companies state governments that had not already declared juneteenth a holiday were also scrambling to respond the new federal holiday illinois gov j b pritzker announced that all state government offices will be closed friday superseding a state law signed just two days earlier that would have made june 19 a state holiday next year even though federal holidays like thanksgiving are widely observed private companies are under no obligation to offer any particular day off but since many workers don t know that they will likely wonder why they are not getting a paid holiday for juneteenth this year said carolina valencia a vice president in research firm gartner s human resource practice in an era of increasing employee activism and a fierce competition for talent valencia said she expects the number of companies offering juneteenth to surge next year after employers have had more time to react many employees are going to resent their employers for not giving them the holiday because they don t understand that it s a complicated process valencia said but she said the devil will be in the details many companies will likely offer it as a floating day off making it unlikely that juneteenth will become a national holiday on par with july 4th or memorial day anytime soon and many notable companies have not joined the movement walmart which employs 300 000 black hourly workers and is the country s largest private sector employer told the associated press in an email that its employees are free to use paid time off to observe any holiday they wish including juneteenth raheem thompson a social media specialist for a retail company said he was disappointed he didn t get a paid day off instead he said the company sent an email acknowledging the federal holiday and pledging to consider time off in the future it s kind of bare minimum said thompson who lives in atlanta but didn t want his company named for fear of repercussions i don t think as people of color we really care that you acknowledge it via email that doesn t really have any true meaning to it juneteenth commemorates june 19 1865 when union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved black people in galveston texas two months after the confederacy had surrendered that was also about 21 2 years after the emancipation proclamation freed slaves in the southern states black americans especially in texas have long celebrated juneteenth with church picnics and speeches but the federal holiday declaration brought it to the attention of some americans for the first time jamie hickey founder small fitness company in philadelphia said he had never heard of juneteenth until he heard about it last week on the radio then his four trainers started talking about it at lunch and he asked them if it was important to them he decided to make it a day off next year since it was too late to cancel on clients this year they said are you serious you are just now hearing about this said hickey who founded truism fitness last year after the chain fitness company where he and he other trainers worked closed because of the pandemic hickey said he took the lead from his employees because as a white man he worried about jumping into trends only to be accused of tokenism i don t want to fake if you are fake you get caught and it s a million times worse hickey said that s a major concern among even the biggest employees said eric eve ceo of ichor strategies which advises firms on connecting businesses with their communities eve said companies will get called out by their employees customers and even investors if they take steps like observing juneteenth without investing in black communities or looking at their own internal diversity still eve said the declaration of juneteenth as a federal holiday will make companies that don t follow suit increasingly look bad for current employees it will reaffirm a dissonance with their values eve said associated press writers urooba jamal anne d innocenzio michelle chapman and roger schneider

some government agencies remain open citing short notice establishing a new federal holiday effective immediately caused some scrambling at courts and government agencies they typically observe federal holidays but this time there have been a variety of outcomes many nonessential government offices did shut down the u s postal service remained open expressing support for the holiday but saying that it is not possible to cease the operations of the postal service with just 24 to 48 hours to plan for it some federal courts shut down but not all did similarly school districts that usually honor federal holidays had to individually decide whether to stay open on friday or shut with very little notice to families there was no consistent strategy for instance baltimore city schools closed while baltimore county schools stayed open businesses and nonprofits aren t required to close and some had to swiftly decide whether to pivot federal holidays aren t mandatory for businesses in the u s but a small number of businesses acted swiftly to observe the holiday even with just a few hours notice stanley black decker announced late thursday that it would take friday off for hope and healing and would honor the new federal holiday in future years as well but many others stuck with their previous plans saying it was just too tough to declare a day off without more warning there just was not enough time to plan and prepare to announce and implement this holiday appropriately alesia jones the head of human resources at the university of alabama birmingham told npr jones said she was excited and surprised that the federal government and the state of alabama moved so quickly to create the new holiday but shutting down a large research institution and hospital without more advance notice could create a level of disruption or uncertainty that would be counterproductive she said the university is committed to recognizing the holiday and working on the details for what it will do in the future while many others were already planning to observe juneteenth many businesses had already planned to mark the holiday some started the practice last year after the racial reckoning prompted by the murder of george floyd reactions to these corporate policies vary with some rejecting them as empty symbolism while others welcome them as a sign of inclusivity and attention to racial issues a mercer surveyreleased on june 3 found that 9 of surveyed companies planned to observe juneteenth as a holiday in 2021 the same percentage as planned to observe columbus day indigenous people s day a long established federal holiday for some businesses notably nike observing juneteenth means actually closing retail establishments for others like starbucks and best buy locations will remain open but employees receive extra pay for working other companies say they re recognizing juneteenth without actually observing it google is not giving people the day off but is encouraging them to cancel meetings at t held internal events recognizing the holiday but also encouraged people to use their existing leave to take juneteenth off rosa nunez the director of diversity equity and inclusion at the law firm foley hoag argues that nodding to the holiday without paid leave is insufficient it should be a paid holiday and not just a check the box holiday added to your calendar says nunez whose organization began observing juneteenth as a paid day off last year you really have to be meaningful and authentic in order to be impactful more workplaces may observe the holiday in years to come now that a federal holiday has established many companies that have so far declined to observe the holiday may change course many big banks say they ll start observing the holiday next year and in the meantime they re are offering employees a floating day off to use sometime this year the stock exchanges remain open for this year although they may reevaluate in the future and many other organizations while not embracing the holiday this year have indicated plans to work it into their calendars in the years ahead jones says that the top leaders of the university of alabama birmingham have committed to recognizing the holiday in years ahead although the details are still being worked out and she says she s not sure if that would have happened without the state and federal recognition nunez says marking juneteenth is only one of many steps a company should take toward greater equity and equality and she hopes the federal holiday although not mandatory for most workplaces inspires companies to follow suit the recognition of the stain of slavery and slavery in the united states and the work that needs to be done i mean it should be followed by many many organizations she says the private sector doesn t have to follow the government but it s just the right thing to do copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

schools stayed open businesses and nonprofits aren t required to close and some had to swiftly decide whether to pivot federal holidays aren t mandatory for businesses in the u s but a small number of businesses acted swiftly to observe the holiday even with just a few hours notice stanley black decker announced late thursday that it would take friday off for hope and healing and would honor the new federal holiday in future years as well but many others stuck with their previous plans saying it was just too tough to declare a day off without more warning there just was not enough time to plan and prepare to announce and implement this holiday appropriately alesia jones the head of human resources at the university of alabama birmingham told npr jones said she was excited and surprised that the federal government and the state of alabama moved so quickly to create the new holiday but shutting down a large research institution and hospital without more advance notice could create a level of disruption or uncertainty that would be counterproductive she said the university is committed to recognizing the holiday and working on the details for what it will do in the future while many others were already planning to observe juneteenth many businesses had already planned to mark the holiday some started the practice last year after the racial reckoning prompted by the murder of george floyd reactions to these corporate policies vary with some rejecting them as empty symbolism while others welcome them as a sign of inclusivity and attention to racial issues a mercer survey released on june 3 found that 9 of surveyed companies planned to observe juneteenth as a holiday in 2021 the same percentage as planned to observe columbus day indigenous people s day a long established federal holiday for some businesses notably nike observing juneteenth means actually closing retail establishments for others like starbucks and best buy locations will remain open but

meetings at t held internal events recognizing the holiday but also encouraged people to use their existing leave to take juneteenth off rosa nunez the director of diversity equity and inclusion at the law firm foley hoag argues that nodding to the holiday without paid leave is insufficient it should be a paid holiday and not just a check the box holiday added to your calendar says nunez whose organization began observing juneteenth as a paid day off last year you really have to be meaningful and authentic in order to be impactful more workplaces may observe the holiday in years to come now that a federal holiday has established many companies that have so far declined to observe the holiday may change course many big banks say they ll start observing the holiday next year and in the meantime they re are offering employees a floating day off to use sometime this year the stock exchanges remain open for this year although they may reevaluate in the future and many other organizations while not embracing the holiday this year have indicated plans to work it into their calendars in the years ahead jones says that the top leaders of the university of alabama birmingham have committed to recognizing the holiday in years ahead although the details are still being worked out and she says she s not sure if that would have happened without the state and federal recognition nunez says marking juneteenth is only one of many steps a company should take toward greater equity and equality and she hopes the federal holiday although not mandatory for most workplaces inspires companies to follow suit the recognition of the stain of slavery and slavery in the united states and the work that needs to be done i mean it should be followed by many many

juneteenth as a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery following the passage of a bipartisan congressional bill more than 800 companies have publicly pledged to observe juneteenth according to hellacreative a group of black creative professionals in the san francisco bay area that launched a campaign last year to build corporate support for making the june 19th an official holiday that is nearly double the number of companies that had joined the pledge last year patagonia the outdoor apparel retailer announced that all of its u s stores will be closed saturday and its corporate

fierce competition for talent valencia said she expects the number of companies offering juneteenth to surge next year after employers have had more time to react many employees are going to resent their employers for not giving them the holiday because they don t understand that it s a complicated process valencia said but she said the devil will be in the details many companies will likely offer it as a floating day off making it unlikely that juneteenth will become a national holiday on par with july 4th or memorial day anytime soon and many notable companies have not joined the

the declaration of juneteenth as a federal holiday is putting pressure on more u s companies to give their employees the day off accelerating a movement that took off last year in response to the racial justice protests that swept the country hundreds of top companies had already pledged last year to observe juneteenth in the wake of the police killing of george floyd and the national reckoning on racism that followed but most private companies take their cues from the federal government the country s largest employer in drawing up their holiday calendars president joe biden signed legislation thursday establishing juneteenth as a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery following the passage of a bipartisan congressional bill more than 800 companies have publicly pledged to observe juneteenth according to hellacreative a group of black creative professionals in the san francisco bay area that launched a campaign last year to build corporate support for making june 19 an official holiday that is nearly double the number of companies that had joined the pledge last year patagonia the outdoor apparel retailer announced that all of its u s stores will be closed saturday and its corporate offices would be closed monday other brands including target j c penney and best buy had pledged last year to adopt juneteenth as paid holiday though they are keeping stores open several major banks have said employees will get a floating paid day off many companies however had little time to shuffle their holiday calendars some offered employees a regular paid day off or promised to consider adding it to their calendars next year nasdaq said its u s exchange would stay open friday and monday to maintain a fair and orderly market and to minimize operational risks but that it would discuss its future holiday schedule with regulators and companies state governments that had not already declared juneteenth a holiday were also scrambling to respond to the new federal holiday illinois gov j b pritzker announced that all state government offices will be closed friday superseding a state law signed just two days earlier that would have made june 19 a state holiday next year even though federal holidays like thanksgiving are widely observed private companies are under no obligation to offer any particular day off but since many workers don t know that they will likely wonder why they are not getting a paid holiday for juneteenth this year said carolina valencia a director in research firm gartner s human resource practice in an era of increasing employee activism and a fierce competition for talent valencia said she expects the number of companies offering juneteenth to surge next year after employers have had more time to react many employees are going to resent their employers for not giving them the holiday because they don t understand that it s a complicated process valencia said but she said the devil will be in the details many companies will likely offer it as a floating day off making it unlikely that juneteenth will become a national holiday on par with july 4 or memorial day anytime soon and many notable companies have not joined the movement walmart which employs 300 000 black hourly workers and is the country s largest private sector employer told the associated press in an email that its employees are free to use paid time off to observe any holiday they wish including juneteenth raheem thompson a social media specialist for a retail company said he was disappointed he didn t get a paid day off instead he said the company sent an email acknowledging the federal holiday and pledging to consider time off in the future it s kind of bare minimum said thompson who lives in atlanta but didn t want his company named for fear of repercussions i don t think as people of color we really care that you acknowledge it via email that doesn t really have any true meaning to it juneteenth commemorates june 19 1865 when union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved black people in galveston texas two months after the confederacy had surrendered that was also about 2 1 2 years after the emancipation proclamation freed slaves in the southern states black americans especially in texas have long celebrated juneteenth with church picnics and speeches but the federal holiday declaration brought it to the attention of some americans for the first time jamie hickey founder of a small fitness company in philadelphia said he had never heard of juneteenth until he heard about it last week on the radio then his four trainers started talking about it at lunch and he asked them if it was important to them he decided to make it a day off next year since it was too late to cancel on clients this year they said are you serious you are just now hearing about this said hickey who founded truismfitness last year after the chain fitness company where he and other trainers closed because of the pandemic hickey said he took the lead from his employees because as a white man he worried about jumping into trends only to be accused of tokenism i don t want to fake if you are fake you get caught and it s a million times worse hickey said that s a major concern among even the biggest employees said erin eve ceo of ichor strategies which advises firms on connecting businesses with their communities eve said companies will get called out by their employees customers and even investors if they take steps like observing juneteenth without investing in black communities or looking at their own internal diversity still eve said the declaration of juneteenth as a federal holiday will make companies that don t follow suit increasingly look bad for current employees it will reaffirm a dissonance with their values eve said

on june 17 2021 the cal osha standards board voted to adopt revisions to the emergency temporary standards ets and governor gavin newsom signed an executive order allowing the revised ets to go into effect immediately the revised ets now applies to nearly all workers in california not covered by cal osha s aerosol transmissible diseases standard the revised ets mostly eases requirements for employers especially with respect to their vaccinated employees though some requirements first adopted in november 2020 with the original ets remain in effect at the same time cal osha has imposed certain new requirements some of the major changes in the revised ets include significant changes for all employees regardless of vaccination status no physical distancing or barrier requirements regardless of vaccination status except during an outbreak or major outbreak employers must evaluate whether it is necessary to implement physical distancing and barriers during an outbreak 3 or more cases in an exposed group of employees and must generally implement physical distancing and barriers during a major outbreak 20 or more cases in an exposed group of employees no face covering requirements outdoors except during outbreaks regardless of vaccination status employers may not retaliate against employees for voluntarily choosing to wear face coverings clarifications to exclusion pay under the revised ets exclusion pay is to be paid at the employee s regular rate of pay no later than the pay period covering the period of time the employee was excluded and is subject to all normal enforcement provisions for unpaid wages if an employer decides that an employee is not eligible for exclusion pay the employer must provide notice of the denial to the employee and note the applicable exception exclusion pay may be enforced through all normal wage enforcement procedures meaning that a failure to provide exclusion pay when required could trigger wage statement waiting time and paga penalties employers should review carefully all circumstances in which exclusion pay may be owed updates to the definition of worksite and exposed group the revised ets clarifies the definition of worksite and exposed group for purposes of counting towards an outbreak sending notifications and testing an exposed group would include all individuals present in a work location work area or common area where a covid 19 case was present but does not include areas where people pass through without congregating while everyone is wearing face coverings if the covid 19 case was part of a distinct group of employees that was not present at the workplace at the same time as other employees i e shifts that do not overlap or if the covid 19 case was in a work area for less than 15 minutes during the high risk exposure period and all persons in the area were wearing face coverings cal osha has maintained the broader definition of worksite for sending notifications of positive cases updates for outbreak and major outbreak situations in an outbreak situation employers no longer need to test employees in the exposed group on a weekly basis instead employers must make testing available to employees on a weekly basis employees who were fully vaccinated prior to the implementation of the revised ets and who remain asymptomatic as well as employees who have had covid 19 in the past 90 days do not need to be provided testing in a major outbreak respirators must be offered to employees regardless of vaccination status and without waiting for a request from the employee the employer must offer respirators immediately upon determining a major outbreak is underway any unvaccinated employees in the exposed group who are not wearing respirators must be separated from others by six feet unless the employer can show that six feet of distance is not feasible employees at fixed work locations where physical distancing cannot be maintained at all times must have cleanable partitions installed changes applicable to fully vaccinated employees fully vaccinated employees do not need to wear face coverings consistent with the california department of public health s cdph guidance employers no longer need to ensure fully vaccinated employees wear face coverings at work except during outbreaks in outbreaks all employees must wear face coverings indoors and outdoors when six feet physical distancing cannot be maintained regardless of vaccination status fully vaccinated employees do not need to be tested or excluded after close contacts with covid 19 cases unless they have symptoms unlike the prior ets fully vaccinated employees and individuals who have had covid 19 in the past 90 days no longer need to quarantine after close contact so long as they remain asymptomatic these loosened quarantine requirements mean employers do not need to provide exclusion pay for fully vaccinated or recently covid 19 positive individuals ideally allowing more employees to remain at the worksite after close contact when they previously would have been excluded will address staffing shortages and impacts to production the revised ets defines fully vaccinated to mean the employer has documented that the person received at least 14 days prior either the second dose in a two dose covid 19 vaccine series or a single dose covid 19 vaccine cal osha has issued further guidance clarifying that an employer may document an employee s vaccination status by having a copy of the employee s proof of vaccination vaccine card image of vaccine card or health care document showing vaccination status on file keeping a record of employees who presented proof of vaccination but not having a copy of the proof of vaccination itself having employees self attest to vaccination status and maintaining a record of who self attests vaccines must either 1 be fda approved 2 have an emergency use authorization from the fda or 3 for persons fully vaccinated outside the united states be listed for emergency use by the world health organization who changes applicable to unvaccinated employees employers must provide respirators such as n95s to all unvaccinated employees working indoors upon the employee s request whenever the employer provides respirators to its employees for voluntary use it must also encourage the use of respirators ensure employees are provided a respirator of the correct size as well as train the employee on how to properly wear the respirator perform a seal check according to the manufacturer s instructions each time a respirator is worn and the fact that facial hair interferes with a seal employers providing respirators for voluntary use must also provide those employees with a copy of appendix d a guide to respiratory protection at work an employer may either stock respirators and offer them to employees or may poll workers to determine which employees wish to be provided a respirator before obtaining them once an employer has established that it has employees who wish to wear respirators it should have enough on hand of the correct size and type to fulfill reasonably foreseeable requests upon demand if an employee prefers to select and purchase their own respirator an employer may permit this alternative as long as the employer reimburses the employee in timely manner in a major outbreak respirators must be offered to employees regardless of vaccination status and without waiting for a request from the employee the employer must offer respirators immediately upon determining a major outbreak is underway employers must make covid 19 testing available at no cost to unvaccinated employees with covid 19 symptoms during employees paid time given the fact that employers must continue to maintain effective methods to screen employees for covid 19 symptoms employers may see an increase in testing demand employers should be prepared to immediately refer employees screened by a symptom check to testing requirements that remain from the original ets unvaccinated employees must still wear face coverings while indoors unless alone in a room while eating or drinking and at least six feet away from others when specific tasks cannot be performed with a face covering or other existing exceptions under the prior ets employers must still maintain an effective written covid 19 prevention program employers should work with counsel to update their covid 19 prevention program to reflect the revised ets employers must still provide training and instruction to employees on the employer s prevention plan including new topics such as how employees can participate in the employer s identification and evaluation of covid 19 hazards updated information on methods to decrease the spread of covid 19 how to access covid 19 testing and the fact that vaccination is effective at preventing covid 19 protecting against both transmission and serious illness or death the employer s policy for providing respirators to unvaccinated employees upon request and the conditions where face coverings are required employers should carefully review and update their training documents providing training on these new required topics as soon as is practicable employers must still provide notification to public health departments of outbreaks employers must still provide notification to employees of exposure and close contacts employers must still offer testing to unvaccinated employees after potential exposures employers must still quarantine covid cases and unvaccinated employees after close contact employers must still provide exclusion pay to unvaccinated employees who may have been exposed to covid while at work the legal landscape continues to evolve quickly and there is a lack of clear cut authority or bright line rules on implementation this article is not intended to be an unequivocal one size fits all guidance but instead represents our interpretation of where applicable law currently and generally stands this article does not address the potential impacts of the numerous other local state and federal orders that have been issued in response to the covid 19 pandemic including without limitation potential liability should an employee become ill requirements regarding family leave sick pay and other issues

is putting the pressure on more u s companies to give their employees the day off accelerating a movement that took off last year in response to the racial justice protests that swept the country hundreds of top companies had already pledged last year to observe juneteenth in the wake of the police killing of george floyd and the national reckoning on racism that followed recommended videos but most private companies take their cues from the federal government the country s largest employer in drawing up their holiday calendars president joe biden signed legislation thursday establishing juneteenth as a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery following the passage of a bipartisan congressional bill more than 800 companies have publicly pledged to observe juneteenth according to hellacreative a group of black creative professionals in the san francisco bay area that launched a campaign last year to build corporate support for making the june 19th an official holiday that is nearly double the number of companies that had joined the pledge last year patagonia the outdoor apparel retailer announced that all of its u s stores will be closed saturday and its corporate offices would be closed monday other brands including target j c penney and best buy had pledged last year to adopt juneteenth as a paid holiday though they are keeping stores open several major banks have said employees will get a floating paid day off many companies however had little time to shuffle their holiday calendars some offered employees a regular paid day off or promised to consider adding it to their calendars next year nasdaq said its u s exchange would stay open friday and monday to maintain a fair and orderly market and to minimize operational risks but that it would discuss its future holiday schedule with regulators and companies state governments that had not already declared juneteenth a holiday were also scrambling to respond the new federal holiday illinois gov j b pritzker announced that all state government offices will be closed friday superseding a state law signed just two days earlier that would have made june 19 a state holiday next year even though federal holidays like thanksgiving are widely observed private companies are under no obligation to offer any particular day off but since many workers don t know that they will likely wonder why they are not getting a paid holiday for juneteenth this year said carolina valencia a vice president in research firm gartner s human resource practice in an era of increasing employee activism and a fierce competition for talent valencia said she expects the number of companies offering juneteenth to surge next year after employers have had more time to react many employees are going to resent their employers for not giving them the holiday because they don t understand that it s a complicated process valencia said but she said the devil will be in the details many companies will likely offer it as a floating day off making it unlikely that juneteenth will become a national holiday on par with july 4th or memorial day anytime soon and many notable companies have not joined the movement walmart which employs 300 000 black hourly workers and is the country s largest private sector employer told the associated press in an email that its employees are free to use paid time off to observe any holiday they wish including juneteenth raheem thompson a social media specialist for a retail company said he was disappointed he didn t get a paid day off instead he said the company sent an email acknowledging the federal holiday and pledging to consider time off in the future it s kind of bare minimum said thompson who lives in atlanta but didn t want his company named for fear of repercussions i don t think as people of color we really care that you acknowledge it via email that doesn t really have any true meaning to it juneteenth commemorates june 19 1865 when union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved black people in galveston texas two months after the confederacy had surrendered that was also about 2 1 2 years after the emancipation proclamation freed slaves in the southern states black americans especially in texas have long celebrated juneteenth with church picnics and speeches but the federal holiday declaration brought it to the attention of some americans for the first time jamie hickey founder small fitness company in philadelphia said he had never heard of juneteenth until he heard about it last week on the radio then his four trainers started talking about it at lunch and he asked them if it was important to them he decided to make it a day off next year since it was too late to cancel on clients this year they said are you serious you are just now hearing about this said hickey who founded truism fitness last year after the chain fitness company where he and he other trainers worked closed because of the pandemic hickey said he took the lead from his employees because as a white man he worried about jumping into trends only to be accused of tokenism i don t want to fake if you are fake you get caught and it s a million times worse hickey said that s a major concern among even the biggest employees said eric eve ceo of ichor strategies which advises firms on connecting businesses with their communities eve said companies will get called out by their employees customers and even investors if they take steps like observing juneteenth without investing in black communities or looking at their own internal diversity still eve said the declaration of juneteenth as a federal holiday will make companies that don t follow suit increasingly look bad for current employees it will reaffirm a dissonance with their values eve said ___ associated press writers urooba jamal anne d innocenzio michelle chapman and roger schneider contributed to this story
stock markets open post office open federal courts schools banks businesses it depends juneteenth the holiday commemorating the end of slavery by marking the day enslaved people in texas learned they were free is now a federal holiday the move comes after growing support nationwide for observing the day of celebration and reflection but actual practices for marking the holiday still vary widely some government agencies remain open citing short notice establishing a new federal holiday effective immediately caused some scrambling at courts and government agencies they typically observe federal holidays but this time there have been a variety of outcomes many nonessential government offices did shut down the u s postal service remained open expressing support for the holiday but saying that it is not possible to cease the operations of the postal service with just 24 to 48 hours to plan for it some federal courts shut down but not all did similarly school districts that usually honor federal holidays had to individually decide whether to stay open on friday or shut with very little notice to families there was no consistent strategy for instance baltimore city schools closed while baltimore county schools stayed open businesses and nonprofits aren t required to close and some had to swiftly decide whether to pivot federal holidays aren t mandatory for businesses in the u s but a small number of businesses acted swiftly to observe the holiday even with just a few hours notice stanley black decker announced late thursday that it would take friday off for hope and healing and would honor the new federal holiday in future years as well but many others stuck with their previous plans saying it was just too tough to declare a day off without more warning there just was not enough time to plan and prepare to announce and implement this holiday appropriately alesia jones the head of human resources at the university of alabama birmingham told npr jones said she was excited and surprised that the federal government and the state of alabama moved so quickly to create the new holiday but shutting down a large research institution and hospital without more advance notice could create a level of disruption or uncertainty that would be counterproductive she said the university is committed to recognizing the holiday and working on the details for what it will do in the future while many others were already planning to observe juneteenth many businesses had already planned to mark the holiday some started the practice last year after the racial reckoning prompted by the murder of george floyd reactions to these corporate policies vary with some rejecting them as empty symbolism while others welcome them as a sign of inclusivity and attention to racial issues a mercer surveyreleased on june 3 found that 9 of surveyed companies planned to observe juneteenth as a holiday in 2021 the same percentage as planned to observe columbus day indigenous people s day a long established federal holiday for some businesses notably nike observing juneteenth means actually closing retail establishments for others like starbucks and best buy locations will remain open but employees receive extra pay for working other companies say they re recognizing juneteenth without actually observing it google is not giving people the day off but is encouraging them to cancel meetings at t held internal events recognizing the holiday but also encouraged people to use their existing leave to take juneteenth off rosa nunez the director of diversity equity and inclusion at the law firm foley hoag argues that nodding to the holiday without paid leave is insufficient it should be a paid holiday and not just a check the box holiday added to your calendar says nunez whose organization began observing juneteenth as a paid day off last year you really have to be meaningful and authentic in order to be impactful more workplaces may observe the holiday in years to come now that a federal holiday has established many companies that have so far declined to observe the holiday may change course many big banks say they ll start observing the holiday next year and in the meantime they re are offering employees a floating day off to use sometime this year the stock exchanges remain open for this year although they may reevaluate in the future and many other organizations while not embracing the holiday this year have indicated plans to work it into their calendars in the years ahead jones says that the top leaders of the university of alabama birmingham have committed to recognizing the holiday in years ahead although the details are still being worked out and she says she s not sure if that would have happened without the state and federal recognition nunez says marking juneteenth is only one of many steps a company should take toward greater equity and equality and she hopes the federal holiday although not mandatory for most workplaces inspires companies to follow suit the recognition of the stain of slavery and slavery in the united states and the work that needs to be done i mean it should be followed by many many organizations she says the private sector doesn t have to follow the government but it s just the right thing to do copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

missed some market news this week here s a quick recap ag marketing iq the weather dominated the markets for the most part this week dry fields are impacting the corn and soybean plants and that s a big weight on many farmers shoulders and if the weather isn t enough of a concern then throw in renewable fuels soybean oil rally screeches to a halt this week the biden administration was discussing possible relaxation of renewable fuels standard mandates to help petroleum refiners hurt by higher biofuel prices like many shoot first ask questions later events in the commodities market it was highly unclear whether any changes would actually take place of course soybean oil the primary feedstock for biodiesel really isn t the issue in the seemingly never ending showdown between the corn and petroleum industries over ethanol but it was caught in the crossfire between the two camps over controversial waivers granted some small refiners who say the high cost of ethanol is forcing them out of business the curious timing of the latest stories just a day after usda increased its estimate of 2020 corn crop ethanol demand only added to the intrigue one inch won t be enough the recent drawback in grain prices has revealed the markets bias as overly bearish when it comes to the slightest bit of moisture in the forecast if i were to write a letter to the market it would say a couple of things first it has to rain eventually even to get just an average crop traders are acting as if a single rain will guarantee a bumper crop and send us on direct path for higher ending stocks when nothing could be further from the truth second at this point in time for a large part of the midwest even if the best case scenario of half an inch to an inch does materialize in the forecast it will not even begin to address the deterioration that we are seeing as one of our customers puts it in north central iowa the corn is rolling up today beans are not growing this could be a regional disaster of epic proportions soon in corn at least related farm progress show husker harvest days an update my farm is a couple hours from him and the situation is not much different my crop does not need one inch of rain it needs four inches so it s easy to understand how the problem could grow really fast trading a potential drought my corn is burning up the plant looks like more like a pineapple than a corn plant and it s not just my corn that looks like this it s all over iowa and the northern plains i ve heard this more than once this week probably closer to a dozen times the drought crippling iowa north dakota south dakota and now minnesota is intense the images on social media show exactly how stressed the corn crop is in those states related vilsack to re evaluate organic livestock rule it is going to be hot for much of the midwest this weekend there is a chance for rain early next week thanks to a tropical storm forming in the gulf of mexico this storm is expected to reach the shores of louisiana on saturday trade is hopeful that this storm and changing weather fronts will bring much needed moisture into midwest it might not be a soaker of the rain to alleviate the drought but it might be enough to get the crop to survive one more week weather continues to dominate markets this has been a very serious price decline for reasons that we either do not know or the market truly did not represent the news we had to decipher as of thursday s close both corn and beans fell a record 77 25 cents and 1 86 respectively for the week this unprecedented volatility created huge adverse swings for any account with an ownership position of futures or short puts this move however has also created a huge unexpected opportunity for anyone needing to buy grains weather change last week hot and dry last sunday night the models changed and called for below temps and above precip including a general 1 3 inch rains followed by more the market opened 20 lower versus a 20 higher call that change in pattern has not happened and as of tonight 2 models have gone dryer for central ia and west one front has already moved through and the most potential rain is on sunday some follow up scattered stuff next week and then some models are hotter and drier from june 22 to mid july thus if on sunday we realize the western belt missed most of the rain and the warmer and drier pattern verifies this market could be volatile higher ag exports the 2021 22 marketing year has already begun for the wheat crop as of june 1 and there are only a handful of weeks left in the 2020 21 season for corn and soybeans as such a shift from old crop sales to new crop sales is slowly unfolding as evidenced by some data from the latest usda export sales report out thursday morning and covering the week through june 10 old crop corn sales tumbled 95 below the prior four week average to less than 709 000 bushels new crop sales fared better but were still disappointing overall with 10 9 million bushels that was toward the lower end of trade estimates which came in as high as 35 4 million bushels ahead of today s report cumulative sales for the 2020 21 marketing year still far exceed last year s pace with 2 148 billion bushels corn export shipments were much more robust with 65 4 million bushels but that was still 16 below the prior four week average china 24 2 million and japan 21 7 million were the top two destinations mexico colombia and morocco rounded out the top five net sales for old crop soybeans were tepid at 2 4 million bushels and new crop sales only chipped in another 240 000 bushels for a total of 2 8 million bushels that was on the low end of trade guesses which ranged between zero and 18 4 million bushels cumulative totals for the current marketing year are still nearly 800 million bushels ahead of the prior year s pace with 2 127 billion bushels the markets are closed but all eyes will be on the markets monday

sitting on a gilded louis xvi chair in the miraflores office a spacious neo baroque palace in northwestern caracas venezuelan president nicolas maduro projects perfect confidence the country according to an 85 minute interview with bloomberg television has released irrational extreme cruel oppression in the united states russia china iran and cuba are allies their domestic opposition is powerless if venezuela suffers from a bad image it is because it and its socialist government have been well funded in its campaign to demonize it the bombing is predictable but among the accusations of yankee imperialism maduro who is letting dollars circulate and private companies flourish makes a public request and directs joe biden message it s time to make a deal venezuela the world s largest oil reserve is hungry for capital and wants to regain access to the debt and commodity markets two decades after the anti capitalist transformation and four years after us sanctions were suspended the country is the default the infrastructure is crushed and it is a struggle to survive millions of lives if venezuela cannot produce and sell oil if it cannot produce and sell its gold if it does not produce and sell its bauxite if it does not produce iron etc and if it is unable to earn income in the international market will venezuelan bondholders have to pay 58 he says his palms raised on appeal this world needs to change this situation needs to be changed in fact much has changed since donald trump imposed sanctions on caracas and appointed opposition leader juan guaido as president his explicit goal to oust maduro from office failed today guaido is sidelined venezuelans are suffering more than ever and maduro remains in power i m here in this presidential palace it is noticed however there has been little that is urgently needed to end the most serious humanitarian catastrophe in the western hemisphere commitment on the part of maduro on the part of his opposition from washington maduro hopes an agreement to ease sanctions will open the door to foreign investment create jobs and reduce misery it could even ensure the legacy of the torchbearer of chavismo a unique mark of venezuela s left wing nationalism venezuela will become a land of opportunity he says i invite u s investors not to be left behind in recent months democrats have argued that gregory meeks chairman of the house foreign affairs committee representative jim mcgovern and senator chris murphy among others should re examine their policy maduro who rarely leaves miraflores or a sleeping military base these days has been waiting for a signal that the biden administration is ready to negotiate there hasn t been a single positive sign he says none it hardly seems like a sudden roundabout with the broad support of congress the trump administration cited venezuela for human rights violations rigged elections drug trafficking corruption and currency manipulation the punishments he imposed on maduro his wife dozens of civil servants and state owned companies remain the same although biden s policy of restoring democracy with free and fair elections differs from trump s the u s still believes that guaido is a direct leader in venezuela maduro has been giving a bit of land in recent weeks he has taken six executives five of them u s citizens from house arrest given the political opposition two of the five seats on the national election council and allowed the world food program to enter the country although maduro is looking for better relations with washington he has established close ties with russia iran and china all the while the maduro chain was backing down trying to start negotiations with the us he sent the foreign minister to the meeting at the trump tower in new york and his brother then communications minister to mexico city maduro says he almost had a deal with trump at the september 2018 united nations general assembly the white house he recalled called for agreements to be suspended maduro has blamed foreign policy hawks on trump s orbit many of them in the face of florida s venezuelan expulsions the pressures were unbearable for him he says if we knew each other history might be different a former bus driver and union leader maduro has proven to be a survivor he defeated his rivals to control the united socialist party after chavez was assassinated in 2013 suffered attacks in 2018 and 2019 and overcame trump guaido who worked closely with the u s campaign to oust maduro has been forced to move from regime regime change to negotiations i support any effort that provides free and fair elections guaido says at his offices in eastern caracas according to unofficial covid 19 cases and states venezuela is exhausted not only a democratic alternative but also a dictatorship the whole country if maduro feels hot he doesn t show up several times a week often for 90 minutes he appears on state television to blow up the economic blockade and promise to enslave the power of the people populist theater takes home a carefully written narrative venezuela s sovereignty dignity and right to self determination are being suppressed as a result of the immoral abuse of financial power during the interview maduro stressed that he will not claim if the us continues to say it has weapons in its head any request for changes in domestic policy has been completed we would become a colony we would become a protectorate he says no country in the world no country let alone venezuela is ready to get on its knees and betray its heritage the reality as all venezuelans know is that maduro is already forced to make big concessions vice president delcy rodriguez and his adviser led by former ecuadorian economy minister patricio rivera abolished price controls reduced subsidies curtailed imports allowed bolivars to float freely against the dollar and created incentives for private investment the rural area continues to suffer but the impact in caracas has been tremendous customers no longer have to pay with piles of tickets and supermarket passages far from being naked are often piled up maduro also passed a law full of guarantees for private investors henrique capriles spoke to residents of the valles del tuy region of venezuela on june 8 the reforms are so orthodox that they could be confused with a program to stabilize the international monetary fund almost like the things of chavez s bolivarian revolution maduro responded that they are tools of the war economy sure dollarization has been a useful escape valve for consumers and businesses but the gestures he and capitalism are reluctant to make are temporary before it is too late the bolivar will once again play a strong and dominant role in the economic and commercial life of the country he says not so long ago the us saw venezuela as a strategic ally exxon mobil corp conocophillips and chevron corp were heavily involved in the country s oil industry and refurbished the texas and louisiana refineries to process the heavy crude orinoco belt because wealthy venezuelans traveled to miami so often they spoke of it as a second home that all changed when chavez was elected in 1998 he expropriated billions of dollars in u s active oil and formed alliances with the socialists in cuba bolivia and ecuador maduro has gone further embracing washington s most threatening enemies he said the relationship with russia was extraordinary and sent a birthday card to chinese president xi jinping biden is horrible keep abusing venezuela and you will deal with another castro a leader who hopes to reach a no win deal guests of the vip lounge at simon bolivar international airport were reminded of venezuela s new friendships the three clocks mounted in a vertical row showed the time in caracas moscow and beijing asked what they mean in the interview maduro replied that the world of the future is in asia but an idea goes through his mind maybe he says there should be clocks for new delhi madrid and new york as well the next evening there are six clocks on the wooden wall in this country maduro is still powerful except for one thing like so many others in venezuela clocks don t work

stock markets open post office open federal courts schools banks businesses it depends juneteenth the holiday commemorating the end of slavery by marking the day enslaved people in texas learned they were free is now a federal holiday the move comes after growing support nationwide for observing the day of celebration and reflection but actual practices for marking the holiday still vary widely some government agencies remain open citing short notice establishing a new federal holiday effective immediately caused some scrambling at courts and government agencies they typically observe federal holidays but this time there have been a variety of outcomes many nonessential government offices did shut down the u s postal service remained open expressing support for the holiday but saying that it is not possible to cease the operations of the postal service with just 24 to 48 hours to plan for it some federal courts shut down but not all did similarly school districts that usually honor federal holidays had to individually decide whether to stay open on friday or shut with very little notice to families there was no consistent strategy for instance baltimore city schools closed while baltimore county schools stayed open businesses and nonprofits aren t required to close and some had to swiftly decide whether to pivot federal holidays aren t mandatory for businesses in the u s but a small number of businesses acted swiftly to observe the holiday even with just a few hours notice stanley black decker announced late thursday that it would take friday off for hope and healing and would honor the new federal holiday in future years as well but many others stuck with their previous plans saying it was just too tough to declare a day off without more warning there just was not enough time to plan and prepare to announce and implement this holiday appropriately alesia jones the head of human resources at the university of alabama birmingham told npr jones said she was excited and surprised that the federal government and the state of alabama moved so quickly to create the new holiday but shutting down a large research institution and hospital without more advance notice could create a level of disruption or uncertainty that would be counterproductive she said the university is committed to recognizing the holiday and working on the details for what it will do in the future while many others were already planning to observe juneteenth many businesses had already planned to mark the holiday some started the practice last year after the racial reckoning prompted by the murder of george floyd reactions to these corporate policies vary with some rejecting them as empty symbolism while others welcome them as a sign of inclusivity and attention to racial issues a mercer surveyreleased on june 3 found that 9 of surveyed companies planned to observe juneteenth as a holiday in 2021 the same percentage as planned to observe columbus day indigenous people s day a long established federal holiday for some businesses notably nike observing juneteenth means actually closing retail establishments for others like starbucks and best buy locations will remain open but employees receive extra pay for working other companies say they re recognizing juneteenth without actually observing it google is not giving people the day off but is encouraging them to cancel meetings at t held internal events recognizing the holiday but also encouraged people to use their existing leave to take juneteenth off rosa nunez the director of diversity equity and inclusion at the law firm foley hoag argues that nodding to the holiday without paid leave is insufficient it should be a paid holiday and not just a check the box holiday added to your calendar says nunez whose organization began observing juneteenth as a paid day off last year you really have to be meaningful and authentic in order to be impactful more workplaces may observe the holiday in years to come now that a federal holiday has established many companies that have so far declined to observe the holiday may change course many big banks say they ll start observing the holiday next year and in the meantime they re are offering employees a floating day off to use sometime this year the stock exchanges remain open for this year although they may reevaluate in the future and many other organizations while not embracing the holiday this year have indicated plans to work it into their calendars in the years ahead jones says that the top leaders of the university of alabama birmingham have committed to recognizing the holiday in years ahead although the details are still being worked out and she says she s not sure if that would have happened without the state and federal recognition nunez says marking juneteenth is only one of many steps a company should take toward greater equity and equality and she hopes the federal holiday although not mandatory for most workplaces inspires companies to follow suit the recognition of the stain of slavery and slavery in the united states and the work that needs to be done i mean it should be followed by many many

usually honor federal holidays had to individually decide whether to stay open on friday or shut with very little notice to families there was no consistent strategy for instance baltimore city schools closed while baltimore county schools stayed open businesses and nonprofits aren t required to close and some had to swiftly decide whether to pivot federal holidays aren t mandatory for businesses in the u s but a small number of businesses acted swiftly to observe the holiday even with just a few hours notice stanley black decker announced late thursday that it would take friday off for hope and healing and would honor the new federal holiday in future years as well but many others stuck with their previous plans saying it was just too tough to declare a day off without more warning there just was not enough time to plan and prepare to announce and implement this holiday appropriately alesia jones the head of human resources at the university of alabama birmingham told npr jones said she was excited and surprised that the federal government and the state of alabama moved so quickly to create the new holiday but shutting down a large research institution and hospital without more advance notice could create a level of disruption or uncertainty that would be counterproductive she said the university is committed to recognizing the holiday and working on the details for what it will do in the future while many others were already planning to observe juneteenth many businesses had already planned to mark the holiday some started the practice last year after the racial reckoning prompted by the murder of george floyd reactions to these corporate policies vary with some rejecting them as empty symbolism while others welcome them as a sign of inclusivity and attention to racial issues a mercer surveyreleased on june 3 found that 9 of surveyed companies planned to observe juneteenth as a holiday in 2021 the same percentage as planned to observe columbus day indigenous people s day a long established federal holiday for some businesses notably nike observing juneteenth means actually closing retail establishments for others like starbucks and best buy locations will remain open but employees receive extra pay for working other companies say they re recognizing juneteenth without actually observing it google is not giving people the day off but is encouraging them to cancel meetings at t held internal events recognizing the holiday but also encouraged people to use their existing leave to take juneteenth off rosa nunez the director of diversity equity and inclusion at the law firm foley hoag argues that nodding to the holiday without paid leave is insufficient it should be a paid holiday and not just a check the box holiday added to your calendar says nunez whose organization began observing juneteenth as a paid day off last year you really have to be meaningful and authentic in order to be impactful more workplaces may observe the holiday in years to come now that a federal holiday has established many companies that have so far declined to observe the holiday may change course many big banks say they ll start observing the holiday next year and in the meantime they re are offering employees a floating day off to use sometime this year the stock exchanges remain open for this year although they may reevaluate in the future and many other organizations while not embracing the holiday this year have indicated plans to work it into their calendars in the years ahead jones says that the top leaders of the university of alabama birmingham have committed to recognizing the holiday in years ahead although the details are still being worked out and she says she s not sure if that would have happened without the state and federal recognition nunez says marking juneteenth is only one of many steps a company should take toward greater equity and equality and she hopes the federal holiday although not mandatory for most workplaces inspires companies to follow suit the recognition of the stain of slavery and slavery in the united states and the work that needs to be done i mean it should be followed by many many

the declaration of juneteenth as a federal holiday is putting the pressure on more u s companies to give their employees the day off accelerating a movement that took off last year in response to the racial justice protests that swept the country hundreds of top companies had already pledged last year to observe juneteenth in the wake of the police killing of george floyd and the national reckoning on racism that followed but most private companies take their cues from the federal government the country s largest employer in drawing up their holiday calendars president joe biden signed legislation thursday establishing juneteenth as a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery following the passage of a bipartisan congressional bill more than 800 companies have publicly pledged to observe juneteenth according to hellacreative a group of black creative professionals in the san francisco bay area that launched a campaign last year to build corporate support for making the june 19th an official holiday that is nearly double the number of companies that had joined the pledge last year related biden signs bill making juneteenth a federal holiday patagonia the outdoor apparel retailer announced that all of its u s stores will be closed saturday and its corporate offices would be closed monday other brands including target j c penney and best buy had pledged last year to adopt juneteenth as a paid holiday though they are keeping stores open several major banks have said employees will get a floating paid day off many companies however had little time to shuffle their holiday calendars some offered employees a regular paid day off or promised to consider adding it to their calendars next year nasdaq said its u s exchange would stay open friday and monday to maintain a fair and orderly market and to minimize operational risks but that it would discuss its future holiday schedule with regulators and companies state governments that had not already declared juneteenth a holiday were also scrambling to respond the new federal holiday illinois gov j b pritzker announced that all state government offices will be closed friday superseding a state law signed just two days earlier that would have made june 19 a state holiday next year even though federal holidays like thanksgiving are widely observed private companies are under no obligation to offer any particular day off but since many workers don t know that they will likely wonder why they are not getting a paid holiday for juneteenth this year said carolina valencia a director in research firm gartner s human resource practice in an era of increasing employee activism and a fierce competition for talent valencia said she expects the number of companies offering juneteenth to surge next year after employers have had more time to react many employees are going to resent their employers for not giving them the holiday because they don t understand that it s a complicated process valencia said but she said the devil will be in the details many companies will likely offer it as a floating day off making it unlikely that juneteenth will become a national holiday on par with july 4th or memorial day anytime soon and many notable companies have not joined the movement walmart which employs 300 000 black hourly workers and is the country s largest private sector employer told the associated press in an email that its employees are free to use paid time off to observe any holiday they wish including juneteenth raheem thompson a social media specialist for a retail company said he was disappointed he didn t get a paid day off instead he said the company sent an email acknowledging the federal holiday and pledging to consider time off in the future it s kind of bare minimum said thompson who lives in atlanta but didn t want his company named for fear of repercussions i don t think as people of color we really care that you acknowledge it via email that doesn t really have any true meaning to it juneteenth commemorates june 19 1865 when union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved black people in galveston texas two months after the confederacy had surrendered that was also about 2 1 2 years after the emancipation proclamation freed slaves in the southern states black americans especially in texas have long celebrated juneteenth with church picnics and speeches but the federal holiday declaration brought it to the attention of some americans for the first time related juneteenth these films on race inequality and emancipation are free to stream jamie hickey founder small fitness company in philadelphia said he had never heard of juneteenth until he heard about it last week on the radio then his four trainers started talking about it at lunch and he asked them if it was important to them he decided to make it a day off next year since it was too late to cancel on clients this year they said are you serious you are just now hearing about this said hickey who founded truism fitness last year after the chain fitness company where he and he other trainers worked closed because of the pandemic hickey said he took the lead from his employees because as a white man he worried about jumping into trends only to be accused of tokenism i don t want to fake if you are fake you get caught and it s a million times worse hickey said that s a major concern among even the biggest employees said erin eve ceo of ichor strategies which advises firm on connecting businesses with their communities eve said companies will get called out by their employees customers and even investors if they take steps like observing juneteenth without investing in black communities or looking at their own internal diversity still eve said the declaration of juneteenth as a federal holiday will make companies that don t follow suit increasingly look bad for current employees it will reaffirm a dissonance with their values eve

stock markets open post office open federal courts schools banks businesses it depends juneteenth the holiday commemorating the end of slavery by marking the day enslaved people in texas learned they were free is now a federal holiday the move comes after growing support nationwide for observing the day of celebration and reflection but actual practices for marking the holiday still vary widely some government agencies remain open citing short notice establishing a new federal holiday effective immediately caused some scrambling at courts and government agencies they typically observe federal holidays but this time there have been a variety of outcomes many nonessential government offices did shut down the u s postal service remained open expressing support for the holiday but saying that it is not possible to cease the operations of the postal service with just 24 to 48 hours to plan for it some federal courts shut down but not all did similarly school districts that usually honor federal holidays had to individually decide whether to stay open on friday or shut with very little notice to families there was no consistent strategy for instance baltimore city schools closed while baltimore county schools stayed open businesses and nonprofits aren t required to close and some had to swiftly decide whether to pivot federal holidays aren t mandatory for businesses in the u s but a small number of businesses acted swiftly to observe the holiday even with just a few hours notice stanley black decker announced late thursday that it would take friday off for hope and healing and would honor the new federal holiday in future years as well but many others stuck with their previous plans saying it was just too tough to declare a day off without more warning there just was not enough time to plan and prepare to announce and implement this holiday appropriately alesia jones the head of human resources at the university of alabama birmingham told npr jones said she was excited and surprised that the federal government and the state of alabama moved so quickly to create the new holiday but shutting down a large research institution and hospital without more advance notice could create a level of disruption or uncertainty that would be counterproductive she said the university is committed to recognizing the holiday and working on the details for what it will do in the future while many others were already planning to observe juneteenth many businesses had already planned to mark the holiday some started the practice last year after the racial reckoning prompted by the murder of george floyd reactions to these corporate policies vary with some rejecting them as empty symbolism while others welcome them as a sign of inclusivity and attention to racial issues a mercer surveyreleased on june 3 found that 9 of surveyed companies planned to observe juneteenth as a holiday in 2021 the same percentage as planned to observe columbus day indigenous people s day a long established federal holiday for some businesses notably nike observing juneteenth means actually closing retail establishments for others like starbucks and best buy locations will remain open but employees receive extra pay for working other companies say they re recognizing juneteenth without actually observing it google is not giving people the day off but is encouraging them to cancel meetings at t held internal events recognizing the holiday but also encouraged people to use their existing leave to take juneteenth off rosa nunez the director of diversity equity and inclusion at the law firm foley hoag argues that nodding to the holiday without paid leave is insufficient it should be a paid holiday and not just a check the box holiday added to your calendar says nunez whose organization began observing juneteenth as a paid day off last year you really have to be meaningful and authentic in order to be impactful more workplaces may observe the holiday in years to come now that a federal holiday has established many companies that have so far declined to observe the holiday may change course many big banks say they ll start observing the holiday next year and in the meantime they re are offering employees a floating day off to use sometime this year the stock exchanges remain open for this year although they may reevaluate in the future and many other organizations while not embracing the holiday this year have indicated plans to work it into their calendars in the years ahead jones says that the top leaders of the university of alabama birmingham have committed to recognizing the holiday in years ahead although the details are still being worked out and she says she s not sure if that would have happened without the state and federal recognition nunez says marking juneteenth is only one of many steps a company should take toward greater equity and equality and she hopes the federal holiday although not mandatory for most workplaces inspires companies to follow suit the recognition of the stain of slavery and slavery in the united states and the work that needs to be done i mean it should be followed by many many organizations she says the private sector doesn t have to follow the government but it s just the right thing to do copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
