boardriders chief executive arne arens declined to comment on any pending transaction but confirmed the private equity owners are mulling a sale after receiving interest from several possible buyers of boardriders we have and we also continue to evaluate the inbound interest from multiple parties the dutch national and former nike executive told afr weekend he confirmed there are no current plans by oaktree to sell off any smaller brands like dc shoes but declined to say if regional licensing deals are being considered by its owners selling assets boardriders has been closing unprofitable company owned stores but makes most of its sales from wholesale customers and has a growing online business it has also been selling assets in october it offloaded billabong s beachfront house on the north shore of oahu at pipeline in 2019 ip generation purchased the former quiksilver headquarters in torquay from boardriders for an estimated 15 million it also sold and leased back its burleigh heads office formerly billabong hq that same year advertisement oaktree which has us163 billion 256 billion in assets under management is best known as a vulture fund that has been involved in several other high profile australian recapitalisations including nine entertainment publisher of afr weekend and blue sky asset management mr arens took the helm in march 2021 from dave tanner the former head of california based oaktree s special situations team mr tanner remains a significant investor and board member at boardriders shannon north who worked at billabong for over 25 years left in april while garry wall the former md of quiksilver exited in september 2021 after three decades with the business howard marks co founder and co chairman of oaktree capital management is mulling a sale of boardriders louise kennerley one surf industry source said there are two ways to look at senior exits and layoffs either it s necessary or it s preparing for its next chapter under a different structure multiple sources speculated that possible buyers are likely private equity although with cheap financing days now over and investment committees worried about the economic backdrop they would all be looking for cheap deals advertisement strategic owners would stay clear it s an obvious play for a licensing company too said one industry source mr arens does not expect to have to cut jobs deeply in future and said the recent cuts were aimed at putting the company in a better position ahead of expected rough weather next year noting the macroeconomic backdrop of rising interest rates sky high inflation and falling consumer sentiment we re looking at consumers starting to pull back a little bit on their discretionary spending although the recent changes we made were difficult it s only prudent as a company and as leadership team to be ahead of the curve and make sure that we are diligent in the way that we manage our cost structure he said mr arens added segments of the company s cost structure are coming down after a tough year of battling surging freight and higher fuel costs as well as higher inputs for products like board shorts and wetsuits boardriders suffered amid covid 19 as did many global retailers with supply chain and inventory bottlenecks in the last 24 months but mr arens said he was comfortable with inventory levels in the us and australia he was confident about driving more full priced sales across the holiday season but conceded some us consumers were looking for discounts and the brands have to remain competitive advertisement boardriders top line sales for the 2021 financial year grew 20 per cent to us1 62 billion revenue growth is likely to slow to low double digits in the 2022 financial year ended october 31 and reach nearly us1 8 billion mr arens said people starting to travel again to key markets like florida and hawaii and price increases have helped to mitigate some cost increases pressuring gross margin over the year negative outlook but s p global analyst amanda o neill said boardriders capital structure and its indebtedness are her biggest concerns she has forecast a leverage ratio at 10 times in fiscal 2022 and believes boardriders must address a us50 million senior term loan maturity to avoid default advertisement while top line sales are growing the company is barely generating enough earnings to cover interest payments and unpaid preferred stock dividends are also accumulating being treated as debt which also are concerns companies with unsustainable capital structures may explore a sale so it wouldn t be surprising if this option was being considered she said from new york they are rated ccc with a negative outlook and that s one of our very low rating levels where we re saying we envision a default in 12 months so getting a straight refinancing done at that rating level can be quite challenging ms o neill flagged the challenges of store closures in australia and other surf areas and towns amid the pandemic which made boardriders recovery choppier than other major apparel and footwear companies on the positive side the group s brands still have a place with their core demographic and travel slowly returning also bodes in boardriders favour she said owner oaktree is also a senior term lender along with others this could mean negotiations with debt holders may be somewhat favourable to the company because it is not in the owner s interest to enforce creditor rights which could threaten their own control ms o neill said advertisement mr arens declined to comment on refinancing risks facing the company saying that the board is very focused on this issue oaktree is also entangled in a court case related to a 110 million 2020 debt transaction a judge on october ruled that the suit that claims some lenders to boardriders in this financing deal unfairly benefitted other creditors and oaktree as australia heads into peak selling summer period customers are snapping up wetsuits swimwear and board shorts despite the company increasing pricing by up to 9 per cent in some categories boardriders asia pacific boss greg healy warned discretionary spending is likely to contract as consumers face a squeeze on household budgets after multiple rates hikes and inflation persists in everyday items like groceries however he added rates of domestic travel bookings continue to be strong and was confident that customers would be drawn to the brands and the high quality of the product offer our mainstay brands of quiksilver billabong and roxy are in really good shape our forward order books are looking solid he said

a recent survey of japanese companies found that long term lng contracts that start before 2026 are already sold out a worrying sign for importers japan has now added its voice to the natural gas bulls claiming that underinvestment in supply will lead to intense competition for lng in the coming years analysts are uncertain about the future of natural gas markets with the eia predicting a decline in natural gas prices while the iea warned of a supply shortage a cross section of energy analysts have lately provided a mixed outlook on the natural gas sector in its latest short term energy outlook the u s energy information eia was bearish and forecasted that natural gas spot price at henry hub would average 6 per million british thermal units mmbtu across 4q22 and 1q23 more than 1 mmbtu lower than their october forecast mainly due to higher than expected storage levels heading into winter the eia also said that it expects natural gas prices to decline after january as the deficit to the five year average in inventories decreases however just three weeks ago the paris based international energy agency iea warned that europe could face a gap of as much as 30 billion cubic meters bcm of natural gas during the key summer period for refilling its gas storage sites in 2023 according to the iea the process of filling eu gas storage sites this year benefitted from key factors that may well not be repeated in 2023 the iea also noted that these include russian pipeline gas deliveries that although they were cut sharply during 2022 were close to normal levels for much of the first half of the year total pipeline supply from russia to the eu in 2022 is likely to amount to around 60 bcm but it is highly unlikely that russia will deliver another 60 bcm of pipeline gas in 2023 and russian deliveries to europe could halt completely now there is another punter that has taken sides with the bulls japan has warned that global competition for liquefied natural gas is set to intensify over the next three years due to an underinvestment in supply a survey of japanese companies conducted by the trade ministry and released on monday found that long term lng contracts that start before 2026 are already sold out which is worrying for lng buyers because these types of contracts offer stable pricing and reliable supply for many years the report notes that there is little new supply coming online before 2026 even from major exporters like the u s and qatar meanwhile europe is desperately trying to replace russian pipeline gas with lng further exacerbating the global shortage of fuel being the world s largest lng importer japan probably has useful insights into how the lng market works lng giant cheniere energy inc nyse lng has revealed that it s had the most active year for contracting since 2011 meanwhile volatile spot prices and a worsening supply outlook have triggered a rush by importers to negotiate long term deals as they attempt to lock in prices according to a report by the oil gas journal 10 year lng contracts are currently priced at 75 above 2021 s rates with tight supplies expected to persist as europe aims to boost lng imports last year the volume of long term lng contracts signed to end user markets climbed to a 5 year high and the momentum is showing no signs of abating in the current year so far this year more than 10 million tonnes year tpy of lng has been signed to end market users according to a report by wood mackenzie for instance louisiana based lng company sempra infrastructure a majority owned subsidiary of sempra energy nyse sre bmv sre has inked its sixth long term contract in five months the deal calls for sempra infrastructure s cameron lng in hackberry to supply 2 million metric tons of lng annually to the polish oil gas co sempra infrastructure struck another 2 million ton deal with polish for its upcoming port arthur lng facility in port arthur texas most new contracts are from u s supply as operators move projects forward all these contracts are linked to north american prices meanwhile chinese buyers continue to dominate the market signing more than 8 million tpy of new lng sale and purchase agreements this year the russian invasion of ukraine has had a dramatic impact on long term lng contracts many traditional lng buyers will neither procure spot gas or lng nor renew or sign additional lng contracts with russian sellers spot prices have also been high and volatile pushing many buyers towards long term contracts additionally some buyers are returning to long term contracting on behalf of governments to protect national energy security wood mackenzie principal analyst daniel toleman has said natural gas shortage the lng report from japan appears to be on the money this year the united states became the world s biggest liquefied natural gas lng exporter as deliveries to energy starved buyers in europe and asia surged in the current year five developers have signed over 20 long term deals to supply more than 30 million metric tons year of lng or roughly 4 bcf d to energy starved buyers in europe and asia unfortunately whereas the united states has the world s largest backlog of near shovel ready liquefied natural gas projects takeaway constraints including limited pipeline capacity are seen as the biggest hurdle to growth of the sector in the appalachian basin the country s largest gas producing region churning out more than 35 bcf d environmental groups have repeatedly stopped or slowed down pipeline projects and limited further growth in the northeast indeed eqt corp nyse eqt ceo toby rice recently acknowledged that appalachian pipeline capacity has hit a wall advertisement analysts at east daley capital inc have projected that u s lng exports will grow to 26 3 bcf d by 2030 from their current level of nearly 13 bcf d for this to happen the analysts say another 2 4 bcf d of takeaway capacity would need to come online between 2026 and 2030 in the haynesville this assumes significant gas growth from the permian and other associated gas plays any view where oil prices take enough of a dip to slow that activity in the permian and you re going to have even more of a call for gas from gassier basins the analysts have said by alex kimani for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

as it happens 6 08 writer says he posted insulin is free tweet to make a point about corporate greed sean morrow says his tweet claiming insulin was free didn t fool anyone and that was kind of the point morrow a writer for the progressive online publication more perfect union has claimed responsibility for the viral tweet that impersonated u s pharmaceutical giant eli lilly i never saw anybody saying oh hooray insulin is free now which drives home the absurdity morrow told as it happens host nil köksal no one believed it because no pharmaceutical company would ever do this in the united states the parody account tweet which was accompanied by twitter s trademark blue verification check mark got 1 500 retweets and 10 000 likes in the six hours it was live on nov 10 it forced the real eli lilly to issue a correction the next day the company s stock value plunged the tweet caused panic inside the company according to the washington post and prompted it to pull all advertising from twitter but morrow says he s not worried about getting in trouble the joke he says was obvious to anyone who has ever had to buy medicine in the united states it s unfortunate but a pharmaceutical company saying that their product is free or even cheaper is absurd and that s the trademark of a satire blue check mark chaos when tech giant elon musk took over twitter one of his first orders of business was to change how the social media company doles out verification originally blue check marks on twitter indicated that an account was authentic and the person organization or company tweeting was who they say they were but for a brief period in november musk changed verification to a subscription service anyone willing to pay 7 99 us monthly could get a verified account this tweet appears to be from pharmaceutical company eli lilly but in fact it s from a parody account that snagged a blue verification checkmark by paying for it twitter the move prompted a surge of official looking parody accounts with blue check marks tweeting absurd things morrow says he seized the opportunity to rename one of his twitter accounts elilillyandco and tweeted we are excited to announce insulin is free now i thought hey i feel like this is an opportunity to speak to corporate greed he said i was not expecting it to blow up as much as it did cbc cannot confirm with complete certainty that morrow is behind the tweet but he shared screenshots with as it happens that appear to show official emails from twitter pertaining to the elilillyandco account including one notifying him that he had logged onto a new device and another informing him the account had been suspended he also shared screenshots of himself logged into the account on his browser and receiving notifications from people liking retweeting or replying to the post and he shared an image of an email confirming that he d subscribed to the blue check mark verification system twitter has since halted subscription verification musk said monday he would delay its relaunch until he had a high confidence of stopping impersonation eli lilly admits prices are high but during its brief existence morrow says the tweet did what he intended it to sparked a conversation about what he sees as the absurdly high price of a life saving drug that millions of americans depend upon not only did eli lilly have to tweet that insulin in fact is not free but the company s ceo david ricks said the fake tweet debacle probably highlights that we have more work to do to bring down the cost of insulin for more people an employee works in an unit dedicated to the production of insulin pens at the factory of the u s pharmaceutical company eli lilly in fegersheim eastern france in 2015 frederick florin afp getty images t1international a u s organization that advocates for affordable insulin for all called on eli lilly to put its money where its mouth is while we are glad to see that eli lilly is admitting this reality it should not have to take another giant corporate mishap to lead to such a statement the group said in a press release not to mention t1international and other advocates have been saying what rick s said for years eli lilly did not respond to a request for comment from cbc according to a 2022 press release the company currently charges 82 41 us for individual vials of their insulin lispro injection or 159 12 us for a pack of five pens why is insulin so expensive in the u s the canadian trio who discovered insulin famously sold their patents to the university of toronto in 1923 for 1 each with scientist frederick g banting noting insulin does not belong to me it belongs to the world cut to 2022 and the price of insulin has risen dramatically especially in the u s a 2019 report by the independent health care cost institute found that the annual cost of insulin for americans with type 1 diabetes rose 97 per cent between 2012 and 2016 from 2 900 us to 5 700 us the small group drove five hours from minnesota to ontario in 2019 to buy insulin at one tenth the cost in the united states rachel nystrom the soaring prices have led many americans to cross the border into canada where insulin is much cheaper minnesota s nicole smith holt told cbc news in 2019 that she pays 300 per vial in the u s for her fast acting insulin in canada she was able to get it for 30 the cheaper price in canada is largely due to a federal agency that sets a maximum price that can be charged for patented drugs attempts to pass legislation regulating drug prices south of the border have fizzled a 2017 lancet paper linked insulin price increases to newer incrementally improved products covered by numerous additional patents but dr jing luo who researches pharmaceutical pricing and policy told vox in 2017 that he s skeptical of that explanation noting that he s come across many examples in his research of insulin products that have remained unchanged for years and yet the prices have still risen at a higher rate than inflation they are doing it because they can luo said referring to drug companies as it happens reached out to luo and several other experts for comment on thursday which is american thanksgiving but did not hear back before deadline morrow says the fallout from his tweet may have been a wake up call for eli lilly but he also noticed the company s ceo was careful in his remarks not to promise any price reductions it seems that it s still all about keeping their margins high and keeping their profits high enough morrow said it s not about the fact that the product that this corporation happens to sell is something that a lot of people need to live

previously based on 15 5 times its 2022 estimated earnings projection 9 3 lower to reflect the resolution of the political deadlock we believe the market will assess the effectiveness of the unity government which is unprecedented in malaysia and in uncharted waters said the research unit kenanga research also opined that under a power sharing model the most likely outcome is the continuation of the prevailing policy inclinations at least over the immediate term these include pro business stance protectionism for local industries business as usual for government linked companies and strong fiscal support to the economy including cash handouts and fuel and food subsidies these will help to cushion consumers from the rising cost of living amid sustained high inflation globally as well as pump priming via the rollout of public infrastructure projects to shield the economy from external slowdown and headwinds it added the research house believes that the unity government will be supportive of domestic consumption and advise investors to seek refuge in domestically driven sectors including banks telcos automakers and distributors mid market retailers and construction amid rising external headwinds also the ringgit is expected to continue strengthening against the us dollar due to factors such as malaysia s economic fundamentals an end to the recent domestic political impasse market perception of slower interest rate hikes by the us federal reserve fed and a stronger chinese yuan according to cimb group holdings bhd group wholesale banking co ceo chu kok wei the

perceived political uncertainties chu told starbiz that his year end tactical target for the ringgit is rm4 40 versus the greenback he pointed out that financial market participants and the investor community would look forward to the new cabinet line up as the next focus after the choice of prime minister the line up would likely provide some signals that may hint at any policy direction changes given the status of budget 2023 a new or revised budget tabling is expected this should provide more concrete direction regarding critical policies in areas such as education trade and industry and the rationalisation of subsidies for a more sustainable long term federal budget added chu midf research head imran yassin md yusof told starbiz that with expectations of a us fed pivot slower pace of rate hikes in december the ringgit could continue to strengthen versus the greenback in fact the ringgit has been on a strengthening trend prior to the general election we believe that indicates external factors are a more significant factor for the ringgit we had suggested in our report in august that the ringgit is undervalued due to the strength of our economic fundamentals he noted imran however said that the aggressive rate hikes by the fed had seen the greenback strengthening against other major currencies and not just the ringgit besides the fed malaysia s economic fundamentals and commodities prices could also be factors that influence the strength of the ringgit he said meanwhile united overseas bank research senior foreign exchange strategist peter chia noted that the ringgit has pared some of its losses and recovered to about rm4 51 versus the us dollar as at 2 30pm yesterday from the lows of rm4 75 in early november and rm4 57 earlier this week one other key factor that could impact the ringgit is the trend of the yuan we note that the ringgit is highly correlated to movements of the yuan against the us dollar since april till about mid november this is not surprising given that china is one of the key trade partners of malaysia chia said he pointed out that a sooner than expected easing of china s covid 19 measures and new initiatives to support its troubled property sector after the 20th chinese party congress had helped stabilised sentiments in the yuan since early november that has also spilled over positively to the rest of asian currencies including the ringgit he said chia noted that going forward as china transits into a more targeted and less prohibitive virus containment model a firmer economic recovery in china next year would likely be a strong tailwind for asian currencies thus cushioning them from the expected recessions in the united states the united kingdom and european union other potential catalysts for the ringgit include political resolution that paves the way for pro growth policies and domestic reforms and further overnight policy rate hikes he said

the intense firefight over ukraine has the pentagon rethinking its weapons stockpiles if another major war broke out today would the united states have enough ammunition to fight it s a question confronting pentagon planners not only as they aim to supply ukraine for a war with russia that could stretch years longer but also as they look ahead to a potential conflict with china russia is firing as many as 20 000 rounds a day ranging from bullets for automatic rifles to truck sized cruise missiles ukraine is answering with as many as 7000 rounds a day firing 155mm howitzer rounds stinger anti aircraft missiles and now nasams air defence munitions and thousands of rounds of small arms fire much of ukraine s firepower is being supplied through us government funded weapons that are pushed almost weekly to the front lines on thursday nz time the biden administration announced an additional round of aid that will provide 20 million more rounds of small arms ammunition to kyiv we ve not been in a position where we ve got only a few days of some critical munition left pentagon comptroller michael mccord told reporters this month but we are now supporting a partner who is us defence production lines are not scaled to supply a major land war and some like for the stinger were previously shut down that s putting pressure on us reserves and has officials asking whether us weapons stockpiles are big enough would the us be ready to respond to a major conflict today for example if china invaded taiwan what would happen if something blew up in indo pacom not five years from now not 10 years from now what if it happened next week bill laplante the pentagon s top weapons buyer said referring to the military s indo pacific command he spoke at a defence acquisitions conference this month at george mason university in virginia what do we have in any degree of quantity that will actually be effective those are the questions we re asking right this minute he said the army uses many of the same munitions that have proven most critical in ukraine including high mobility artillery rocket systems known as himars stinger missiles and 155mm howitzer rounds and is now reviewing its stockpile requirements doug bush the army s assistant secretary for acquisition told reporters on monday they re seeing what ukraine is using what we can produce and how fast we can ramp up all of which are factors you would work into okay how does your pre war stockpile need to be bush said the slower you ramp up the bigger the pile needs to be at the start the military aid packages the us sends either pull inventory from stockpiles or fund contracts with industry to step up production at least us 19 billion nz30 32b in military aid has been committed to date including 924 000 artillery rounds for 155mm howitzers more than 8500 javelin anti tank systems 1600 stinger anti aircraft systems and hundreds of vehicles and drones it s also provided advanced air defence systems and 38 himars although the pentagon does not disclose how many rounds of ammunition it sends with the rocket systems the infusion of weapons is raising questions on capitol hill this month the administration asked congress to provide 37 billion nz59b more in military and humanitarian aid to ukraine in the post election legislative session and to approve it before republicans take control of the house in january house republican leader kevin mccarthy of california who is seeking to become speaker has warned that republicans would not support writing a blank check for ukraine even with fresh money stockpiles cannot be quickly replenished several of the systems proving most vital in ukraine had their production lines shut down years ago keeping a production line open is expensive and the army had other spending priorities the pentagon awarded raytheon a us 624 million nz 995m contract for 1300 new stinger missiles in may but the company said it will not be able to increase production until next year due to parts shortages the stinger line was shut down in 2008 laplante said really who did that we all did it you did it we did it he said referring to congress and the pentagon s decision not to fund continued production of the army s anti aircraft munition which can be launched by a soldier or mounted to a platform or truck based on an analysis of past army budget documents centre for strategic and international studies senior adviser mark cancian estimates that the 1600 stinger systems the us has provided to ukraine represent about one quarter of its total arsenal the himars system which ukraine has used so effectively in its counteroffensive faces some of the same challenges laplante said the thing now that is saving ukraine and that everybody around the world wants we stopped production of it he said himars production was shut down by the army from about 2014 to 2018 laplante said the army is now trying to ramp up production to build up to eight a month or 96 a year bush said himars effectiveness in ukraine has increased interest elsewhere too poland lithuania and taiwan have put in orders even as the us works to rush more to ukraine if the conflict drags on and more himars ammunition is prioritised for ukraine that could potentially limit us troops access to the rounds for live fire training the pentagon this month announced a 14 4 million nz 22 97m contract to speed production of new himars to replenish its stocks this conflict has revealed that munitions production in the united states and with our allies is likely insufficient for major land wars said ryan brobst an analyst at the centre on military and political power at the foundation for the defence of democracies the us also recently announced it would be supplying ukraine with four avenger air defense systems portable launchers that can be mounted on tracked or wheeled vehicles to provide another shorter range option against the iranian drones being used by russia s forces but the avenger systems rely on stinger missiles too pentagon deputy press secretary sabrina singh said stockpile concerns were taken into account we wouldn t have provided these stinger missiles if we didn t feel that we could singh said at a recent pentagon briefing tara copp ap

interest rates must keep rising even though the hikes are adding to the painful squeeze on millions of households and small firms a deputy governor of the bank of england said yesterday dave ramsden a hawk who has backed even higher hikes at rate setting monetary police committee mpc meetings says it has to act to bring inflation back to 2 per cent ramsden said millions of households and businesses are experiencing great hardship as a result of the cost of living crisis i am acutely conscious that our actions are adding to the difficulties dave ramsden a hawk who has backed even higher increases during rate setting meetings earlier this year warned the bank must take the necessary steps to bring inflation back to 2 he added however challenging the short term consequences might be for the uk economy the mpc must take the necessary steps in terms of monetary policy to return inflation to the 2 per cent target sustainably in the medium term fellow rate setter catherine mann said there was little monetary policy could do to help households struggling with soaring energy and food prices ramsden s comments boosted the pound already strengthening against the dollar as minutes from the us federal reserve meeting pointed to a slower pace of rate hikes in america sterling added as much as a cent to 1 2153 a three month high it rose by more than half a cent versus the euro to 1 1662 the bank of england has hiked its benchmark interest rate eight times since december taking it from 0 1 per cent to 3 per cent and is expected to add another 0 5 per cent next month it wants to cool rampant inflation which recently hit a four decade high of 11 1 per cent amid soaring energy costs and pressure on wages amid record job vacancy levels yet with the uk already thought to be in recession and unemployment predicted to rise the hikes are inflicting pain on mortgage holders and firms whose loan repayments are rising some more dovish members of the mpc fear increases could go too far and result in a deeper recession but ramsden said history demonstrated the damage to households and businesses that would result if high inflation persisted he said yesterday he was not yet confident that some of the inflation pressures had started to ease i expect that further increases in bank rate are going to be required if the outlook suggests more persistent inflationary pressures then i will continue to vote to respond forcefully he added but he also made clear in a speech at kings college london that if inflation threats fade he would consider cutting rates his remarks come after jeremy hunt s autumn statement last week announced 55billion worth of tax rises and spending cuts designed in part to tackle inflation yet ramsden said that since many of the chancellor s measures will not be enacted until april 2025 they would have very little effect he added that britain s international reputation had not yet fully recovered from the financial turmoil unleashed by kwasi kwarteng s mini budget in september echoing recent remarks by bank governor andrew bailey that the uk s standing had taken a knock that prompted a sell off in the uk bond market which only stabilised after a 65billion bank of england intervention

when federal reserve officials met at the start of the month to weigh another rate increase some of them were thinking about what the central bank might have to do should the treasury market run into trouble those concerns were aired in meeting minutes for the rate setting federal open market committee s nov 1 2 policy meeting released wednesday then officials pressed forward with aggressive rate increases that are part of a campaign to lower the highest levels of inflation seen in 40 years the speed of fed rate hikes which have also been joined with ongoing central bank action to shed treasury and mortgage bonds to contract the size of its balance sheet have generated worries the fed could break something in financial markets thus far the treasury market which serves as the backbone of the world s credit system has held together although there has been ample concern about low liquidity that s made trading difficult fed officials have thus far described the market as resilient participants observed that despite elevated interest rate volatility and indications of strained liquidity conditions the functioning of the treasury securities market had been orderly the minutes said fed staff briefing officials concurred the minutes flagged recent events in britain as a point of concern there the central bank was forced to intervene and buy bonds to restore market stability in a policy that ran counter to the bank of england s overall effort to tighten rather than loosen the stance of monetary policy some have worried the fed might have to restart asset buying in the united states should some sort of trouble develop and some in congress have already warned the fed not to go down this road according to the minutes a few participants noted the importance of being prepared to address disruptions in u s core market functioning in ways that would not affect the stance of monetary policy especially during episodes of monetary policy tightening the minutes however did not say what the fed could do to calm markets in the face of trouble without taking action to buy bonds as the central bank did in late 2019 and in the spring of 2020 when markets became unsettled some observers have said a fed tool called the standing repo facility which allows eligible firms to quickly convert treasuries into cash loans could be an important tool in restoring liquidity that facility was adopted in the summer of 2021 and is as yet untested the minutes also said several participants noted the risks posed by nonbank financial institutions amid the rapid global tightening of monetary policy and the potential for hidden leverage in these institutions to amplify shocks the discussion on financial stability reflected in the minutes took place before the latest shocks to market stability emerging from the nonbank sector specifically the cryptocurrency space it was not until after officials had adjourned their meeting that crypto exchange ftx collapsed and filed for bankruptcy and it appears that other failures are in the offing the fed s top financial stability official vice chair for supervision michael barr last week told congress he was worried about blowback to the wider financial system from crypto related failures we re concerned about the risks that we don t know about in the nonbank sector barr told the senate banking committee at november fed meeting officials flagged market resilience amid volatile conditions source reuters

nutrien stock tsx ntr might be worth adding to your portfolio at current levels after its most recent decline on the stock market nutrien ltd tsx ntr released its earnings report for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 at the start of the month and the leading agricultural stock missed its expected earnings by a wide margin the earnings results triggered a rapid 16 2 decline in its valuation on the stock market as of this writing nutrien stock trades for 105 12 per share while it is up by 15 20 year to date the agricultural giant is down by almost 29 from its 52 week high at current levels what happened with nutrien stock wall street expected nutrien to report q3 revenue of us 8 7 billion nutrien s revenue was up by 36 year over year still it missed the expected mark reporting us 8 2 billion in revenue the market consensus for nutrien stock s earnings per share eps was us 3 97 however nutrien reported an eps of us 2 9 the earnings miss in the quarter caught many by surprise considering the stock received a boost through an impairment reversal worth us 330 million for its phosphate business owing to a favourable outlook for its profit margins the breakout of the russia ukraine conflict earlier this year saw the company forecast higher prices for agricultural commodities if the higher prices are sustained the company should rake in substantial cash flows and maintain its record earnings and revenue spree for the year with its earnings report missing the mark the disappointment and subsequent sell off did not come as a surprise management s decision to lower its earnings guidance for the full year did not help either a growth spurt or sprint nutrien has been consolidating the largely fragmented agriculture industry for several years its organic and acquisition based growth has led to massive growth in revenues and earnings however the company recorded lower sales in north america in its latest quarter its potash sales declined by almost 60 in the region compared to the same period last year higher prices indeed help its profit margins but affordability is a critical issue that kept its sales volumes down rising interest rates have impacted every industry and it has not spared nutrien stock the company accordingly adjusted its earnings guidance for the year it was previously expected to generate an ebitda of anywhere between us 14 billion and us 15 5 billion since its earnings release nutrien has lowered the range to us 12 2 billion and us 13 2 billion the ag solutions provider is still profitable as a business but its margins are significantly lower than previously expected foolish takeaway the question is is nutrien stock a buy at current levels as an undervalued stock or not the troublesome situation in its north american market amid rising interest rates could result in a goodwill write down what does that mean the cash flow discount rates companies use in impairment testing for goodwill rise because of higher interest rates nutrien stock s cash generating units cgus in the region have a combined goodwill allocation of us 6 9 billion its cgus barely passed the impairment test in the preceding quarter another hike of 25 basis points in the key interest rates could result in a us 500 million write down in goodwill carrying amounts on north american business units considering its ebitda estimates for the year as they stand now the company s management might not have the grounds to improve its earnings assumptions by the end of the year trading at a 5 6 trailing price to earnings ratio ntr stock looks attractively priced at current levels growing affordability concerns potential price normalization and climate change concerns may negatively impact its revenue in the coming years nutrien stock can be a good bet if things normalize for the better however it appears too risky to buy as things stand

people than last year and is the highest estimate since the national retail federation began tracking this data in 2017 while there is much speculation about inflation s impact on consumer behavior our data tells us that this thanksgiving holiday weekend will see robust store traffic with a record number of shoppers taking advantage of value pricing nrf president and chief executive officer matthew shay said in announcing the survey results according to the survey more than 69 of holiday shoppers plan to shop during thanksgiving weekend this year the survey of 7 719 adult consumers was

be looking for a little christmas spirit here s where to meet santa on the space coast events marking the holidays holiday events kick off this week on the space coast that s followed by 63 9 million 38 4 on the monday after thanksgiving cyber monday many planned to shop on more than one day this weekend what are black friday and cyber monday black friday is the friday after thanksgiving when u s retail stores traditionally launched the start of christmas shopping many retailers started the sales this year much earlier it is called black friday because historically it was when retailers made enough sales to become profitable or go in the black instead of being in the red for the year cyber monday takes place three days afterward marking the busiest day of the year for online shopping in the united states what is small business saturday small business saturday is a day dedicated to supporting small businesses and communities across the country and is part of the larger shop small movement founded in by american express in 2010 this day is celebrated each year on the saturday after thanksgiving in the united states in a statement about the day american express said as a consumer you re a key part in helping small businesses thrive by shopping or dining at small businesses throughout the year you re showing your support for the small businesses in your neighborhood and in the community you call your own why are people shopping this weekend the top reasons consumers plan to shop are because the deals are too good to pass up 59 because of tradition 27 or because it is something to do over the holiday 22 among the 114 9 million black friday shoppers 67 say they expect to head to stores up from 64 in 2021 others will shop online have many people begun shopping already yes similar to 2020 and 2021 this year 60 of holiday shoppers had started browsing and buying for the season as of early november this trend of earlier shopping was accelerated by the pandemic in 2019 56 of holiday shoppers had started their shopping around this time shay said the nrf survey found that about 45 of holiday shoppers say it s better to get gifts and seasonal items before november national retail federation senior director for industry and consumer insights katherine cullen said although the black friday weekend continues to be among the biggest shopping days of the year the nature of this five day shopping event has changed in the past it was more of a kickoff to the shopping season cullen said now it s more of the halfway point as consumers have realized that they enjoy spreading out their shopping budget giving themselves a little bit more time to find some of those key gifts and other top items where will people be doing their shopping this season the nrf survey found that 56 of holiday shoppers plan to be doing at least some of their shopping online 48 plan to shop at discount stores 47 at department stores and 45 at grocery stores and supermarkets when it comes to individual retailers jll which is the property manager for the avenue viera as well as a number of other retail centers nationwide found in its own survey that 64 3 planned to do at least some holiday shopping via amazon the jll holiday survey asked shoppers to list the top three retailers they plan to visit for holiday shopping others in the top 10 were walmart 47 9 target 38 8 kohl s 9 8 best buy 8 2 macy s 7 5 costco 5 2 ebay 4 0 t j maxx 3 2 and j c penney 3 2 etsy fell out of the top 10 list this year replaced by t j maxx why do many people like to shop in stores rather than online according to the jll survey 54 5 cited being able to see and touch the product before buying other responses included the holiday ambiance including decor and scents 36 9 avoiding shipping costs and delays 32 7 enjoying the shopping experience with friends or family 23 8 getting questions answered by expert sales representatives 20 7 and visiting santa with the kids 9 6 many shoppers use a hybrid approach ordering online then picking the item up in the store or curbside how are spending plans changing among shoppers because of inflation jll is calling it a tale of two yuletides its survey found that 49 7 of consumers earning less than 50 000 plan to significantly cut their budgets because of inflation while only about 24 of those earning 150 000 or more will do the same cullen said inflation and higher prices are certainly top of mind for shoppers at the moment as a result many are looking for value and deals including shopping at different brands than they would otherwise and they re also considering discount stores cullen said how big a deal is retailing to the u s economy retail is the nation s largest private sector employer contributing 3 9 trillion to annual gross domestic product and supporting one in four u s jobs 52 million the nrf expects retailers will hire between 450 000 and 600 000 seasonal workers but it added that some of this hiring may have been pulled into october because many retailers were eager to supplement their workforces to meet increased consumer demand according to careersource brevard the retail trade sector accounted for 29 400 jobs in brevard county in october up 2 4 from october 2021 when in accounted for 28 700 jobs jimmy heckman bureau chief of workforce statistics and economic research for the florida department of economic opportunity said while some seasonal retail hiring occurs in october in florida the real increases to seasonal hiring happen in november and december what percentage of annual retail sales do the holidays represent holiday sales in november and december have averaged about 19 of total retail sales over the last five years but the figure can be higher for some retailers how are shoppers coping with higher prices the jll survey found that to counter rising prices consumers plan to use a variety of cost saving methods about 52 8 said they will look for sales while 32 4 will take advantage of deal days specifically to fight inflation 29 8 will buy less expensive gifts and 23 1 will buy for fewer people about 13 7 plan to forgo buying something for themselves because of inflation 10 2 will regift items they have received and 7 7 will buy more used or refurbished items what is the impact of returns on the holiday season the national retail federation said retailers last year expected returns to amount to about 17 8 of their holiday sales most returns occur in january after the winter holidays in addition to returning items for a refund many consumers use holiday returns as an opportunity to make an additional purchase or shop retailers post holiday sales some retailers make return policies more lenient during the holiday season understanding that there can be a lag time between when a gift is purchased and received however many retailers also have begun to change their return policies to account for an increase in return fraud how are retailers addressing supply chain disruptions this holiday season the nrf says supply chain issues have been a key concern for retailers throughout the covid 19 pandemic retailers have implemented various strategies in anticipation of the holiday shopping season including moving up their peak shipping season to bring in product earlier than normal they also have invested in enhanced technology that allows customers to see what products are currently in stock if items are available at alternate locations and how long items are expected to take for delivery dave berman is business editor at florida today contact

haines said the gro yield models didn t change too much throughout the season each spring the models start with a trendline yield estimate but based on weather models and early season data gro s corn yield model dropped to around 170 bpa pretty quickly then the crop never was really able to recover from the drag of that late planting and early difficulty in late july and early august one of the larger input components of gro s yield models the american weather model which is also called the global forecast system gfs weather model predicted some very hot temperatures at critical pollination periods that caused some volatility in the corn yield model but when the weather didn t materialize as forecast the model corrected gro intelligence s corn and soybean yield models powered the dtn digital yield tour in mid august you can read more about the yield models and state by state crop forecasts here so we ended up just below 170 bpa by the end of the season but we were really there the whole time and much much earlier than usda s methodology would allow them to go haines said one of the biggest differences between usda and gro s yield estimates is the illinois corn crop usda is forecasting a 215 bpa statewide average while gro is at 205 gro intelligence senior analyst will osnato said usda s illinois estimate if true would break the 210 bpa record set in 2018 gro s yield models factor in what s called the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which gauges the relative greenness of a crop based on nasa satellite imagery at no point was it higher than previous peaks osnato said gro s yield estimate for illinois is still the highest of the 10 states covered in the dtn digital yield tour but it s not five bushels better than the previous record given how big of a state it is if you take usda s estimate down a little bit then the national usda number comes a little bit closer to us usda will release its crop production annual summary on jan 12 2023 it will contain the agency s final estimates although the agency sometimes makes another revision after the september grain stocks report reveals more details about actual consumption levels katie dehlinger can be reached at katie dehlinger dtn com or you can find her on twitter at katied_dtn c copyright 2022 dtn llc all rights reserved
bonds tend to offer a reliable cash flow which makes them a good investment option for income investors a well diversified bond portfolio can provide predictable returns with less volatility than equities and a better yield than money market funds take the recent performance of bonds versus stocks as an example the australian share market hit a six month low in the first week of october this year prompted by fears that interest rates will have to stay higher for much longer the good news for investors in bonds is that global yields have surged in recent weeks which has had a positive impact on the bond market in australia while yields are likely to fall when central banks start cutting rates this is not expected to happen until late 2024 the australian government has never defaulted on the interest or repayment of the principal payments on the bonds which is why so many investors consider bonds to be a safe pair of hands even when interest rates are low bonds are still preferred by many investors because of the relative stability they offer compared with for example stocks let alone the highs and lows of cryptocurrency the purpose of fixed income investments is to add diversification to a portfolio says rich powers head of etf product management at vanguard in fact it s not uncommon for default superannuation accounts of australians to be exposed to bonds owing to their high degree of stability

explicit and no longer veiled reference to the use of tactical nuclear weapons in order to defend the threatened national territory have made the current conflict take a real quantum leap forward unlike anything since the beginning of the war let us look at the facts the ukrainian forces using the powerful himars rockets sent by the usa liberated extensive territories at the beginning of september including territory where russian administrations had already been imposed in just a few days they managed to regain part of what russia had occupied in five months of bloody conflict this created discontent both in the ranks of the russian army both among the generals and the soldiers as seen in the letters they have been sending home and in public opinion increasingly alarmed by the disastrous course of the war which putin has continued to define as a special operation against pro nazi rebels it is in this context that the russian president advised by his hawks and after having once again purged many commanders and generals whom he declared traitors and incompetent has taken two extreme decisions with the intention of gaining ground or as some analysts claim avoiding the worst outcome first he organized referenda in the provinces occupied sometimes only in part by the russian army and then he ordered a partial mobilization of about 300 000 reservists thus bringing the war in through the front door or rather as they used to say taking the country to war the war in fact on the russian side had so far been fought mainly by soldiers from the most distant regions of the country such as buryatia and dagestan and by private forces hired for this purpose such as the wagner legion and others from september 23 27 fake referenda were held in the occupied ukrainian provinces of kherson zaporizhzhia where europe s largest now inactive nuclear power plant is located donetsk and luhansk asking locals whether they wanted their land to be annexed to russia according to figures released by the russians between 87 percent and 99 percent of these regions voted in favor of annexation according to the reports of witnesses russian officials went to collect votes house by house accompanied by armed soldiers they voted without the presence of international observers wherever they could on benches in public parks in police stations and even in shops the international community at first spoke out against the legitimacy of such referenda and against possible territorial annexations and then as expected did not recognize the validity of such operations considered a bluff on september 30 in a solemn celebration in moscow s red square putin proclaimed to the crowd the annexation of these territories to mother russia calling them russian forever and stating that he was willing to defend them by any means from possible external attacks this position is in line with the general russian doctrine on the defense of national territory however such annexations as said are not recognized by any other state on the contrary they are openly considered illegitimate and as an impediment to possible negotiations between the parties and to peace the mobilization had two objectives to strengthen the now tired and challenged russian army which is struggling to maintain a 1 000 km front and to strengthen patriotic sentiment bringing russia on to a war footing however people especially young people have contested putin s decision and in many parts of the country there have been demonstrations promptly repressed against the war these young people born in the post soviet era have never known a real war they have never gone to fight on a battlefield they love their own well being like young westerners and would like peace unlike their parents they are indifferent to the myth of national power and glory putin will eventually be unable to ignore them in fact in recent weeks more than 300 000 young people called traitors by the government have left russia and fled to neighboring countries finland kazakhstan and elsewhere and many more despite government restrictions would like to do so as soon as possible the cosmetic aspect of the special military operation was also meant not to alarm the russians and to keep the consensus in support of the government high which was partly successful now on the contrary everyone feels the ghost of war hovering over their homes a considerable number of soldiers are being killed on the plains of ukraine as has been written engineers doctors and computer scientists are fleeing a brain drain that will do great harm to the economy and development of russia the most reliable recent polls tell us that support for putin has fallen below 60 percent which had never happened before according to the economist by these decisions putin has revealed his weakness not only in front of the world but also in front of the public opinion of his country which up to now he wanted to keep somehow immune to the facts of the war now by annexing territories over which he does not have full control he risks undermining the territorial integrity of russia russia could become a country with fluid and internationally unrecognized borders if putin declares the annexation of the entire donbass he will in effect be saying that parts of russia are occupied by ukrainian troops and he will look weak if he cannot drive them out which he probably cannot do this is especially the case as the ukrainian advance continues the town of lyman has been liberated and more recently the port city of kherson kyiv s forces have also advanced into luhansk and donetsk provinces by this policy putin has got himself into a quagmire that is very difficult to get out of and that could lead him to take extreme decisions the great powers against annexations and the nuclear threat some great powers that at first were somewhat friendly to russia and had refrained from condemning the war in ukraine at the un immediately after the invasion such as china and india have condemned putin s words on annexations china as early as the shanghai cooperation organization summit in samarkand on september 15 had expressed concern about the course of the war subsequently its foreign minister in a meeting at the united nations declared that president xi stressed the need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and wants a ceasefire this is a harsh warning aimed at the kremlin leader the eternal friendship that the two countries had promised each other at this year s winter olympics has conditions xi has not turned his back on his friend putin but warns him that the situation must change and that disruption of the international order including the nuclear threat is in no way acceptable india s prime minister narendra modi has also had harsh words to say about putin s decisions this is not a time for war he told the united nations marking a clear change of pace in relations with moscow in recent months modi has tried to remain equidistant from both parties partly because of the huge discounts on russian oil obtained from moscow at the same time however he has observed russia s rapprochement with china with growing concern in any case for the time being india will not break relations with russia but neither will it break relations with the west turkey has also declared at the un that it will not recognize the referenda that russia held in the ukrainian regions it should be remembered that ankara has always considered the referendum on the annexation of crimea illegal for understandable geopolitical reasons regarding the control of the black sea erdoğan s turkey has so far maintained cordial relations with moscow besides the agreement on wheat it had managed to obtain with u s consent a valuable exchange of hostages between russia and ukraine but the mobilization of troops and the announced nuclear threat seem to have taken erdoğan by surprise only a short while earlier he had declared i have the impression that putin wants to end the war as soon as possible a completely erroneous prediction as well as a risky one the u s has commented harshly and decisively on the kremlin leader s remarks secretary of state antony blinken addressing the members of the un security council asked them to send a clear and decisive message to putin in order to stop nuclear threats against ukraine subsequently president joe biden also intervened affirming that the united states and western countries are not afraid of putin s threats and that they are capable of responding with determination to moscow s provocations even extreme ones all this makes one fear the worst this can happen if one has one s back to the wall as a desperate gesture of weakness or worse if one has lost one s reason and moral sense it must not be forgotten however that this language falls at least one hopes in some way within the perverse dynamic whereby the nuclear weapon assumes a character of deterrence the use of tactical nuclear weapons in ukraine is now a possible scenario that must be taken seriously putin has already warned that this time speaking of all means he is not bluffing this however even for moscow presents more risks than benefits first the use of small nuclear bombs would be a clear confirmation of russia s military weakness in waging a conventional war in particular it would be tantamount to admitting defeat on the battlefield second it would turn russia into a pariah nation like north korea and it would lose the support of china and other international powers third such an attack would render several square kilometers of territory uninhabitable possibly killing russian soldiers radiation as the case of chernobyl teaches us would affect parts of russia and eu countries thus involving them in a world war in any case whether credible or not this threat must be taken seriously because we are in a situation of very low probability and very high potential effects pope francis has spoken out against war and in particular against the use of nuclear weapons in the angelus on sunday october 2 he said what about the fact that humanity is once again faced with the nuclear threat it is absurd the pope dedicated his entire speech to the war of aggression in ukraine in his message he mentioned for the first time both the president of the russian federation and the president of ukraine pleading with the former to stop for the love of his people this spiral of violence and death and the latter to be open to serious proposals for peace francis deplored actions contrary to the principles of international law and in the name of god called for an immediate ceasefire this appeal by the pope recalls the historic message launched by john xxiii on october 25 1962 during the cuban missile crisis when for the first time humanity ordinary people as well as heads of state found themselves experiencing the nightmare risk of total destruction recently the situation has become even more complicated following a disastrous explosion on october 8 on the kerch bridge connecting russia to crimea attributed by moscow to ukrainian terrorists the russian leader following the advice of party hawks immediately announced a plan of revenge in fact on october 10 several ukrainian cities kyiv in the lead were hit for several hours by a rain of russian missiles and bombs there were 19 civilian deaths and almost 100 wounded while much non military infrastructure was destroyed the attack was condemned by the international community these attacks said biden only reinforce our commitment to the ukrainian people we will continue to impose costs on russia for its aggression hold putin and russia accountable for its atrocities and war crimes and provide the support necessary for ukrainian forces to defend themselves including advanced air defense systems momentous words noteworthy is the definition of war crimes with respect to such acts and the u s commitment to bolster air defense which is what zelensky is asking western powers to do at this time immediately afterward the western powers gathered in the g7 convened by germany confirmed the u s requests for new military aid to kyiv these interventions however could have the consequence of raising the level of the clash and increase the danger of the use of nuclear arms even though in recent times putin considering the negative reactions of china and india has moderated his bellicose and apocalyptic language one must not however forget that the nuclear threat from being an instrument of propaganda and no longer of deterrence could in extreme situations become an undesirable factor now we would like to go back over albeit briefly the story of the cuban crisis of 1962 to which we have referred so that it may help us with the current talk of a nuclear threat to understand that there is always a way back even when one has gone to an extreme position the crisis in cuba and the vatican there has been much historical discussion on the relevance of the intervention of john xxiii in the resolution of the dramatic crisis in cuba in october 1962 he addressed his words not to the heads of the two superpowers ussr us but to men of good will in the historical sphere the interpretation given to this appeal is still very controversial and not always free from ideological considerations it should first of all be remembered that the holy see already in the aftermath of the cuban revolution in january 1959 had not openly sided with the united states and although the new cuban revolutionary government had sought the protection of the soviet union it had maintained a neutral position as was in the tradition of vatican diplomacy at the moment when the new u s president the catholic john fitzgerald kennedy put into effect a total commercial embargo against the island demanding from all american allies a diplomatic break with the new government of the marxist fidel castro and even threatening a military invasion the pope did not yield to those who asked him in order to support the policy of the u s president to excommunicate the new cuban regime and break off diplomatic relations another effect of this prudent and impartial way of acting on the part of the holy see on that occasion was that all the cuban bishops were able to participate in the imminent second vatican council the crisis began in the summer of 1962 when the positioning of russian fighter planes on cuban territory provoked as a response on the part of the u s administration the sending of a squadron of bombers to florida ready to intervene in case of a soviet attack on american territory on october 16 president kennedy was informed that the soviets had installed offensive missile launching sites in cuba whose missiles could easily reach the territory of the united states and other latin american countries it was according to soviet intelligence a legitimate retaliatory measure in response to u s interference in germany and in particular in berlin which had been divided into two parts by the wall for a year in reality the presence of soviet missiles in cuba was a tactical maneuver to put the american president in difficulty with the imminence of the mid term elections while the soviet premier needed to demonstrate to his internal opponents that he was a strong man capable of facing the west and keeping the u s neocolonialism at bay the situation however over time got out of hand for the contenders becoming more critical day by day than had initially been imagined on october 22 president kennedy addressed the american people on television showing them photos of soviet missile launch pads in cuba in a non negotiable form he announced a naval blockade around the caribbean island to prevent nuclear warheads loaded it was said on soviet ships already on their way to cuba from reaching their destination the world followed with bated breath the dramatic events of those days fearing the outbreak of a nuclear war with unpredictable consequences the council which had begun a little more than a month before and which on october 20 had approved a message addressed to the world experienced a moment of pause some bishops in particular those from eastern europe intended to return to their own countries if the situation did not return to normal while the diplomacy of the two superpowers was frantically engaged in finding a dignified way out of the crisis which was becoming more and more serious a group of soviet and american academics and intellectuals gathered at the phillips academy in andover massachusetts to discuss the relations between east and west after kennedy s alarming message to the nation the conference participants voted to continue their proceedings fr felix morlion rector of the pro deo university in rome was urged by several colleagues from both delegations to telephone the vatican to request an intervention by the pope he was told that john xxiii was very worried about the situation and that before intervening with a message of his own he wanted to be certain that the two parties were agreeable to it and furthermore he wanted to be informed of the conditions set by the contending parties for reaching an agreement in principle at this point the handling of the matter passed to diplomats norman cousins head of the u s delegation and a personal friend of many soviet leaders asked an adviser of the u s president theodore sorensen to inform kennedy of the pope s proposal obtaining a positive response at the same time the head of mission of the soviet delegation in andover reported to moscow which welcomed the pontifical initiative with satisfaction on the morning of the 25th the pope worked intensively on the preparation of the message he listened to the american cardinals present at the council one after the other and then also to some german bishops that morning a statement of the secretary general of the united nations u thant was communicated which in an even handed manner asked the united states to lift the naval blockade on cuba and the soviet union not to send missiles to the caribbean island john xxiii s brief radio message was broadcast by vatican radio in french at noon it did not mention the two heads of state involved in the terrible dispute but was simply addressed to men of good will the language of the message was simple and incisive it confined itself to the materiality of the causes of crisis offered an honorable course for both the message given that the holy see had no diplomatic relations with either superpower was delivered through the ambassadors of the two countries accredited to the quirinale italy meanwhile on october 26 khrushchev sent a letter to the u s president declaring himself in principle in agreement with the request of the un secretary general at the same time he asked for guarantees that in future neither the united states nor any other american ally would invade cuba a subsequent letter from the soviet president sent on october 27 further complicated the issue raising the stakes this time moscow demanded the dismantling of the u s jupiter missiles stationed in turkey which the u s government actually considered obsolete and strategically useless and had decided to eliminate in exchange for the removal of the missiles in cuba furthermore the two superpowers would commit themselves in the united nations security council to respect the territorial sovereignty of turkey and cuba this proposal greatly embarrassed the u s administration logically khrushchev s second letter was an expression more than of the mind of the soviet president of the claims made by the hawks within the communist party after a long discussion it was decided at the white house to reply only to the first letter ignoring the contents of the second on october 28 khrushchev accepted the terms established by the u s president and at the same time made known a long list of grievances expressed by the cuban government about the united states the communiqué was certainly not friendly toward the united states but there was no mention of the missiles stationed in turkey kennedy received the message and agreed that discussions on the negotiations should be initiated in the united nations by the two respective diplomatic representatives the great fear therefore subsided the risk of nuclear war had receded even if somewhat ambiguously but what role did the pope s message play in the resolution of the crisis notwithstanding the due and opportune thanks sent to the pope privately by the american and soviet presidents it must be said that it was above all the latter who held the pontifical intervention to be important according to some scholars the very way in which khrushchev presented the question in the letters sent to the u s president was influenced by the persuasive words of john xxiii khrushchev alberto melloni writes in this regard offered an agreement because the whole world is anxious and to avert the risk of conflict is to restore joy to all mankind the u s administration on the other hand officially never quoted the pope s words and did everything possible to support the thesis that the pope s intervention had had no influence on the decision taken by the president of the united states on such an important political issue as the cuba crisis with regard to khrushchev on several occasions he expressed words of appreciation to the pope for his commitment to world peace in particular with regard to the question we are dealing with in a meeting on december 13 1962 he told his friend cousins that the pope s appeal was a true ray of light and that he was immensely grateful once back in rome cousins personally delivered khrushchev s message and christmas greetings to the pope a few days later john xxiii replied in a cordial tone to the words of the soviet premier wishing the russian people peace and prosperity the hope for the present is that pope francis words against war and against the use of nuclear weapons will be heeded as were those of a pope 60 years before and that serious negotiations for an immediate ceasefire will be undertaken in the interests of the two countries involved and of all humanity doi la civiltà

first published at rosa luxemburg stiftung the world we live in today is racked by crises economic political and ecological hundreds of millions have seen their standard of living decline and prospects for the future dim while hundreds of millions more are dealing with droughts floods and other impacts of climate change which only stand to get worse as time goes on as international climate negotiations stall and mainstream climate activism grows increasingly desperate the need for a different kind of society and a political strategy to get there has never been more urgent but what concretely could it look like developing an effective strategy for radical political change demands a clear vision of antagonisms alternatives and pathways of execution if we acknowledge that today s many crises are common effects of the capitalist project rather than deviations from it to produce answers we have to name the antagonist in a way that enables people to identify the source of the problem and stand in opposition to it this is not easy since capitalist hegemony is also tied to its ability to mask reality foster consent and generate fear among those who dare to question what is wrong next we have to figure out what comes after it is not enough to oppose something without providing an alternative that is both attractive and possible if capitalism is bad what do we want in its place many options have been proposed including some that could potentially be worse than our current terrestrial capitalism if capitalism destroys the planet how about a new age of colonial capitalism in space billionaires have used this vision to stoke imaginations and encourage faith in technological fixes as a way to advance their own business interests and attract more investors scientists and the environmental movement on the other hand respond by stating the obvious there is no planet b our job is to show that replacing capitalism is not enough as replacements can be feeble and temporary what comes next needs to address the current system s flaws and be better in so many ways that the status quo simply will not make sense anymore the alternative needs to make capitalism outdated pointless and obsolete ultimately however we need to actually get there the problem with the question of how is that it has often been perceived as a simple matter of mechanisms and tools that can be chosen from an existing arsenal if we need to get from mexico city to guadalajara we can choose between driving taking the bus flying or even walking a purely instrumental view of the how depoliticizes the conditions and consequences of the methods employed and prevents us from continuously evaluating the compatibility between a chosen tactic and the overall strategy our tools are subject to political conditions time and pace supply chain and resource availability actor engagement substance as well as the possibility for detours and adjustment this means that once we identify capitalism as the main problem and propose that the best alternative is indeed socialism how we do it concerns not simply a choice between reform or revolution but essentially the conditions that have to be built for a new kind of power to take over and stay there we can t just wish capitalism away and replace it with socialism making history today and in the future when karl marx wrote that humans make their own history but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past his point was not that we must accept those circumstances or conditions as constraints but that our job is to build different conditions for us to inherit in the future conditions that will give us a better chance to implement elements of our strategy when we propose socialism as a system that will save us from capitalism it is not enough to simply assert that socialist revolution is necessary because society will not survive without it to those already familiar with the dire need to overthrow capitalism these statements are nothing more than truisms used to assert our own radical positions the reality like it or not is that we are nowhere close to revolutionary uprisings and the establishment of socialist alternatives on a global scale to say so is not defeatist anticommunism but simply acknowledging the concrete conditions we have inherited from our past critically embracing our failures pushes us to deal with the temporal contradictions of socialist construction in a rapidly warming world it makes us face time time we have wasted time we employ now and time we simply do not have if the revolution is the emergency brake on the anthropocene s fast moving train to use walter benjamin s formulation we also need an evacuation plan ecological transition is how we engage safety measures to brace for the impact of revolution and equip ourselves for disembarking onto unchartered terrain more than any other crisis affecting us today the ecological crisis radically alters our sense of urgency because it entails the collapse of the material conditions that make life possible this crisis like the others is mostly produced by the capitalist system factors of the great acceleration ranging from rising global temperatures to loss of biodiversity are tied to the unsustainability of the current mode of production these cannot be stopped through capitalist solutions because capital demands more and more from nature to keep its cycle of accumulation going in that sense green capitalism poses more of a threat than standard climate denialism as it appears to acknowledge the scientific consensus around climate change but conceals capitalism s role in the crisis its misrepresentation of climate change as a problem that can be managed without drastic changes to the mode of production leads to false solutions and is thus itself a kind of denialism its solutions address some critical issues but only to the extent that they are compatible with the ultimate objective of generating future profits merely changing how we purchase goods will not fix the problem carbon offset schemes allow the big polluters to keep at it while other companies make a killing by reducing some of their emissions billionaire investment portfolios value geoengineering methods that are not proven on a mass scale and may have serious ethical and biological implications we cannot simply replace how we power industry and the production of goods and services with a renewable alternative because the resources we have on earth are ultimately finite we will have to adjust both in terms of quality as well as quantity and historically unequal distribution will have to be addressed capitalism must end so that life can go on yet under our current political conditions no solution appears to be both radical as well as fast enough to confront the ecological crisis without contradiction we face the immediate threats of the reorganization of far right and fascist forces including ecofascists and the growing dominance of green capitalism as we organize to fight such threats our job is to also identify and engage with possible courses of action that can tackle many things at once a prevention program that can start under capitalism as david schwartzman argues is of the essence to escape the looming ecological disaster before we have the chance to establish a socialist society we will have to implement ideas policies microsystems reforms and other socio political arrangements that will slow the pace of the crisis while establishing the foundations for popular power that can overcome it and support a new system this is a question of radical sustainability we need a strategy that operates in two different political tides as i call it so that one can account for the contradictions faced by the other strategy requires us to think short middle and long term questions simultaneously but with a flexibility that acknowledges that history is a locked in linear sequence of events and that new contradictions arise as we make it to lay a sustainable foundation for more radical action in the future is to build conditions that will lead to problems we are not yet ready to approach or even aware of today they are however problems we desire as they can only materialize once those that plague us today have been resolved if our strategy is successful our problems will not be simply about postponing the end of the world but will engage with what we actually do on this planet for the centuries to come in the billions of years it has left identifying agency who can implement this strategy only those whose real interests lie in preserving the conditions for life on earth while making said life worth living in a way that is inclusive and peaceful people who need to reclaim time taken away from them by capitalist exploitation in order to extend the time of human society on earth even at the early stages our strategy is not at risk of being enmeshed with green capitalism because our agent of change is the majority of society exploited by this system working class people migrants and refugees indigenous groups people with disabilities racialized majorities women and marginalized lgbtqi people who cannot be absorbed into the very limited space capitalism offers in terms of class mobility our strategy requires building collective power in arrangements that demonstrate to the majority of the subaltern class that it is possible to reorganize society and that the outcomes of such restructuring are desirable indeed desirable outcomes are at the core of a successful strategy life needs to improve early on in the implementation of an ecosocialist programme to ensure long term support for the socialist horizon and the possibility for rupture especially when under external threats of repression sanctions and war these threats should be expected since our strategy will challenge pockets of capitalist hegemony from the beginning by altering how we deal with nature and will create conditions for organized counter hegemonic action the closest we are to widespread socialist consciousness the threats will increase the more we too become a threat such threats should not however be used to justify more hardships than necessary nor divert too much energy from areas that improve lives right away being attacked limits courses of action and puts pressure on how we make decisions and what plans we develop but attacks cannot be an excuse for taking the easy way out namely restricting the kinds of freedoms which are at the core of the socialist project our strategy will indeed prepare for war but will seek to avoid it by laying the foundations for peace in sum our strategy is for an ecological transition that will make the socialist transition possible it transitions from a deeply unsustainable society to one where the risk of collapse will have been delayed by at least a few centuries since planetary collapse is an actual risk this century as evaluated in the global assessment report on disaster risk reduction 2022 the ecological transition should occur within a short timeframe ranging from now to 20 or 30 years in the future thus assuming capitalism will be the dominant system in the next decades the ecological transition happens mostly under it this is not because we choose to enact the transition under capitalism but because if it is not done immediately there is no chance of reaching socialism due to the depletion of life sustaining conditions we are still on the train after all the ecological transition constitutes our initial response and if done properly will allow us to implement the best long term plans of course once there is a rupture from capitalism to socialism even more radical aspects of the ecological transition can be realized in what will be an ecosocialist transition with different pillars of property and power since the reforms promoted by the many plans and deals of the ecological transition are not enough to actually overcome capitalism our strategy requires strong movement building that will guarantee these reforms but also create conditions for rupture andre gorz spoke of non reformist reforms due to their potential to help cultivate counter powers the opposite of the reformism that alters the system by repairing it thus an ecosocialist strategy requires a period of alignment between organizing and a strong ecological transition programme under capitalism so that the fruits of this organizing can ultimately break with the system and build an ecosocialist society two political tides interact and build from each other to form our strategy one tide carries a faster transition from point a to point b where we buy ourselves ecological time and offer glimpses into a better life while still under capitalism the ecological transition involves a combination of transition plans and green deals that harness the limited power of reforms at first with a focus on structural reforms that tackle immediate crisis strengthen the public sector and management encourage political participation at various levels make informed use of campaigning and propaganda to build consciousness empower socialist organizations to handle problems within their reach nationalize resources construct infrastructure that favours efficient use of such resources and more collective living and reach across borders from a perspective of regional integration reparations and international solidarity the other tide consists of movement building whereby we strengthen class consciousness and democratic socialist standards that build collective power for a more radical rupture targeting all the pillars of private property profit and accumulation in what will be the transition from capitalism to socialism movement building provides agency to the ecological transition but surpasses its timing since it builds conditions for socialist power once under ecosocialism movement building is essential to consolidate popular power as one tide envelops the other and our strategy continues to be re evaluated and adjusted going beyond the green new deal the depth of the ecological crisis means that if certain conditions are not met there is no possibility for building a socialist society even if the working class is ready for socialism thus an effective ecosocialist strategy is situated in the knowledge and materiality of the anthropocene but aims to shorten this era through ecological means this conclusion should guide conversations around the various demands for a green new deal gnd generally a gnd is a bundle of reforms investments and adjustments tied to mitigation and adaptation to climate change but also to other aspects of the ecological crisis which must be implemented within a short timeframe gnds must be part of our strategy but are not our strategy as such as they aim at more direct public policy and are vulnerable to changes in government beyond that domestic programmes of this sort also need to be coordinated through regional programmes and follow a more general global orientation the debates over a global green deal set out by social movements and civil society organizations need to outline principles and offer outlets for international agreements and the strengthening of alliances after all the ecological transition requires strong coordinated action to achieve short and medium term goals and such programmes offer a great opportunity to realize projects that can be objectively evaluated different versions of the green new deal have been introduced since the debate re emerged in the us after 2018 some more capitalist and some more radical irrespective of the labels used the advantage of integrating gnd like programmes into an ecosocialist strategy is two fold they contain changes that can be implemented today and they can be tools for mobilization the gnd is sometimes framed by politicians and the media as an investment package but in an ecosocialist strategy it is much more than that investment packages are important especially when we consider the enormous changes in infrastructure required by the climate part of the transition energy conversion to renewables alone will cost between 30 and 60 trillion additional us dollars between now and 2050 depending on the study making housing more efficient and building new comfortable and climate friendly homes would require trillions more changing the transportation grid promoting new technologies and growing our food in an efficient but healthy and sustainable manner will also require a lot of investment currently the financial sector claims it could allocate over 100 trillion dollars in assets to finance the race to net zero emissions but this is business as usual since net zero frameworks still allow fossil capital to bank on the system and cannot work fast enough in the next three decades to prevent us from going over 2ºc let alone 1 5ºc the reason is simple it looks at investment from within the capitalist paradigm where there is a lot more diversification and conversion than actual transition into something else the rationale that climate transition can generate many other trillions in capitalist growth attracts investors and pleases political representatives willing to incorporate the climate agenda but only if they can bank on it the financial markets will invest in carbon neutrality the same way they evaluate stocks they are not concerned with the bulk of ecological concerns caused by the great acceleration because that would require calling into question the logic of capitalist accumulation as a whole moreover important elements of the transition end up downplayed when gnd proposals make it into general political programmes as was the case with joe biden s inflation reduction act of 2022 in the us when policy is dictated more by climate investment than climate justice there is still room to push things to the left but chances are that fossil capital will be fighting for its piece of the pie we should fight some of these battles to secure marginal gains but their logic cannot dictate our strategy in an ecosocialist strategy gnd programmes promote investment with the purpose of fighting multiple crises and match it with initiatives that involve governments communities movements and small enterprises to reconfigure aspects of how we produce consume and live a gnd can focus on things that can be achieved fast and because of the desirability of these changes serve as a focal point to rally more people which in turn is a boon to accountability and helps to raise more radical demands where a green job guarantee is offered for instance mobilization can ensure that the jobs created pay fair wages offer benefits subsidize re skilling and are unionized in combination with these measures more pressure from below can also lead to a gnd that makes the reduction of the workweek a prime demand fighting for and against time reducing working hours at stable productivity levels alters the rate of exploitation of workers making it a radical anti capitalist demand indeed significant reductions have already been secured in several core capitalist states backed by a long history of labour organizing around the issue spain recently began a four day workweek trial france moved to a 35 hour workweek in 2000 and surveys indicate that the newfound free time was allocated to activities such as family time rest and sports where productivity rates are already high shorter workweeks may even mean more efficiency which is desirable in certain sectors due to the positive effect on workers well being more free time leads to health benefits less commuting and opens up opportunities for political organizing feeding both tides of our strategy moreover more time off work can also contribute to more equitable loads of social reproduction labour in the household and alter peoples perceptions of how fast they have to get somewhere slowing down the pace of life has particularly interesting implications for matching gnd investments in public transport and rail infrastructure when forced to choose between taking a train or a plane people consider cost duration and overall convenience the growth in low cost airlines has made travel more accessible but also contributed greatly to climate change the green approach of some airlines is to offset their carbon emissions on the market or allow customers to purchase their own offsets on the other hand research into alternative aviation fuels has advanced solar to fuel technologies tend to be more efficient than biofuels but have major impacts on water usage and the solar grid and require co2 from direct capture or carbon capture and storage options this means that as much as we desire certain technologies to improve thereby simplifying the energy transition through direct conversion from fossil fuel to renewables things are not that straightforward it is one thing to want to transition the aviation sector which also implies changes to its size but it is quite another to bet on simple fuel conversion into renewables ignoring every other ecological pressure associated with the chain of production and sheer volume of flights worldwide especially in richer societies our strategy should encourage research and innovation into better low to no carbon technologies while simultaneously recognizing that technological advancement alone will not fix our problems the supply chain considerations raised when it comes to mining strategic minerals help us to understand that there are limits to production and implementation in the transportation sector thea riofrancos has demonstrated how lithium s central role in renewable energy scenarios is part of a delicate security sustainability nexus influenced by expectations of growth introducing a green chapter in the long history of sacrifice zones created by extractivism usually concentrated in the global south or racialized territories in the global north it is simply absurd to expect that we should open more and more mines in order to extract the materials needed to produce 1 billion passenger electric vehicles evs nevertheless this logic has been completely normalized by current paradigms of green investment with governments in canada norway and elsewhere choosing to grant subsidies to customers dealerships and automakers to encourage the sale of passenger evs rather than massively expand public transport our strategy needs to set out clear priorities one way to do so is by aligning the interests of people with the necessary infrastructure if we need to reduce the number of airplanes in the sky how can we offer people alternative means of long distance transportation that are attractive in terms of cost duration and convenience we could for example give people more high speed trains in lieu of certain plane routes take advantage of centrally located stations and make them cheap perhaps even free the cost of living and energy crises that hit europe in 2022 led germany and spain to experiment with temporary subsidies for regional trains and local transit by taking the climate crisis seriously countries and regions can invest in gnd like programmes and change the way people use transportation with added infrastructure other positive effects follow such as the reduction of congestion and car accidents even if a high speed train is not as fast as a plane ride when we slow down the pace of life by allowing people more time off work the trade off may not look so bad the convenience of simply boarding a train rather than having to go through an airport check in or of taking a free bus without worrying about turnstiles and ticket purchases helps to modify behaviour and gain the population s consent when capitalism offers convenience it usually comes at a price for customers and the environment pre diced vegetables are convenient in a world where we have limited time for domestic chores but we pay more and have to deal with excess packaging usually plastic an ecosocialist strategy creates convenience of a different kind by providing green public infrastructure that makes life easier and cheaper for workers reconciling the needs of people and nature in the ecological transition because we need to mitigate and adapt fast the ecological transition will only win this race against time if it also creates time through the rearrangement of production and living environments some things have to come first our strategy is also uneven and combined we understand that capitalism has developed unequally across the planet and that colonialism still plays a role in industrial advancement and the international division of labour the underdevelopment of the global south is combined with the advancement of the global north when brazilian sociologist florestan fernandes explains this phenomenon he highlights that the persistence of dependent capitalism in peripheral countries is part of a capitalist calculation the development of capitalism at the margins ends up heavily dissociated from democratic structures and favours the establishment of autocracies imperialist intervention contributes to and takes advantage of the democratic deficit to further the interests of more powerful states installing dictatorships if necessary as has been routine in latin america but also in africa and the middle east this centre periphery divide also has deep ecological implications the climate action tracker estimates that the world is set to reach 2 7ºc of warming by the end of the century if current policies are applied the 2021 glasgow climate pact failed once again to deliver more radical pledges and cuts not only are current policies watered down but there is also an implementation gap that will lead to even worse unequal outcomes the anthropocene may be characterized by human intervention but in asymmetrical ways richer countries carry far more historical responsibility for climate change than the least developed countries our world in data estimates that the us uk and the 27 members of the european union together account for 47 percent of global cumulative emissions moreover although climate change affects the entire planet poorer countries are less prepared to adapt to the effects thus richer countries ought to bear most of the costs of the ecological transition domestic gnd programmes need to be publicly financed and the wealthiest ought to be taxed more heavily threats of layoffs downsizing and attempts to shift the burden onto consumers must be fought off by a strong alliance between workers organizations and the environmental movement moreover international mechanisms must ensure that poorer countries get access to funds patent waivers for key technology and technical support for their own set of programmes we have to go beyond green finance and pledges made to the un given that their voluntary nature has resulted in underwhelming execution so far at cop15 in copenhagen rich countries pledged to deliver 100 billion dollars per year in finance for climate mitigation and adaptation projects in the global south but fell short every year to make matters worse a significant portion of the billions made available were in the form of loans japan and france have shouldered more than their fair share of the pledge especially when compared to the us but repayable loans were at the core of their contribution this helps to explain the imbalance in financing where mitigation initiatives are often privileged over adaption projects that fail to generate profits in return adding to the devastating indebtedness that chokes the economies of poorer nations in his inaugural address colombia s new left wing president gustavo petro emphasized how debt is an obstacle to transition in the global south authors like olúfémi o táíwò have called for a paradigm of climate reparations and debt forgiveness that will allow poorer nations to address the negative legacy of slavery and colonization as part of their ecological transition reparations belong in both tides of our strategy going beyond money transfers and offering a framework for just transition that politicizes present and past conditions the amazon forest spans across nine countries and although these nations certainly have the right to improve the lives of their citizens they also share the responsibility to care for the amazon in ways that global north countries did not care for their own ecosystems the mentality that they did it first so can we too that permeates some developmentalist discourses in the region is both dangerous and foolish socialist organizations in peripheral countries must demand reparations but the credibility of this action rests on owning up to their own responsibility to explore alternative development paths ecosocialist strategy recognizes that global south states have eco systemic responsibilities but unless rich countries must make up for historical liabilities the rest of the world will be materially unable to transition even today a certain strand of anti imperialism argues that climate change is a hoax devised by imperialist countries to delay the development of the global south although a marginal position variations on this argument make their way into left wing approaches to the climate crisis oil is a good example venezuela has about 300 billion barrels in crude oil reserves the largest in the world and many argue that its sovereignty depends on it oil development and exports guarantee a massive influx of foreign capital to support investments in public services and infrastructure as was the case in the best years of the hugo chávez presidency dependent capitalism however sustains a scenario in which venezuela cannot become a self sufficient oil producer it lacks the infrastructure and subsidiary resources needed for refinement and at the same time is the target of foreign interventions on behalf of the venezuelan right infringements on local sovereignty and brutal sanctions that destabilize its economy and worsen living standards to create a permanent crisis but even if venezuelan socialists had everything they needed to use all of their oil reserves the long desired sovereignty would remain out of reach as the level of emissions it requires would render the planet uninhabitable and there is no sovereignty without life the only thing left would be eco apartheid and ecofascist forces aligned with corporations combing through what remains of the earth for scraps and condemning the majority of humans to fight for survival cutting fossil fuel emissions is not a choice but a necessity different accommodations must be made according to development levels so that peripheral countries are not overly penalized and yet expanded production of venezuelan fuel would certainly rely on sales to the same global north countries who must phase out their reliance on oil as soon as possible the necessity of the ecological transition means that venezuela could not rely on the global south market either the good news however is that countries that have been stuck on the margins of development do not need to go through a linear stage of more oil coal and gas dependence providing electricity to poor communities for the first time can be a cleaner move going straight from no power to a renewable electric grid drawing on mixed sources and taking ecological and community impacts into account there is no need for a fossil fuel stage as long as a reparations framework focused on energy democracy is part of our strategy an underdeveloped country cannot plan its sovereignty around fossil fuels because its ownership of the resource makes it a target at the same time its current level of development is not simply fate but a result of international political economy while phasing out of fossil fuel dependence is a task facing countries both rich and poor alike a fossil fuel non proliferation treaty within a just transition framework could help to manage this process fairly making internationalism sustainable ecosocialist strategy calls for a reframing of sovereignty in terms of radical sustainability energy transition alone buys us time and if focused on addressing basic needs also contributes to organizing around public utilities housing community planning technological impact and a post extractivist mining paradigm ecological transition will look different in each country according to historical liabilities but must be combined with the planning of trade and development to optimize how nations address their eco systemic responsibilities history has taught us that powerful countries will not voluntarily sacrifice their economic interests for the greater good this kind of ecological imperialism goes hand in hand with political military imperialism and its own contribution to extinction and barbarism programmes for ecological transition require workers participation in order to align their interests across wealthier and poorer nations and to apply common pressure on governments and international institutions energy use in oecd countries is almost ten times as high as it is in low income countries while adjustments in efficiency will narrow this gap patterns of consumption and the general mode of living of wealthier societies must also change that said the developed world is also riven by inequality and many workers do not share in what ulrich brand and markus wissen call the imperial mode of living this mode of living puts major ecological pressure on earth and is connected to the industrial extractivism that impacts local communities in the north while turning entire regions of the south into sacrifice zones the mineral resources needed to feed the capitalist appetite and sustain a mode of living that promises big cars big houses lots of meat and cheap air travel will also be problematic even if powered by renewables thus an ecosocialist strategy also has to imply uneven and combined degrowth selective degrowth is about economic sectors borders and territory some regions will need much higher levels of investment so people can enjoy good food housing transportation and stable jobs for the first time other regions especially in high income countries will also invest in and grow strategic sectors while relying on transfers to build inclusive and convenient infrastructure for workers facing high costs of living and bad jobs this in turn requires popular control of resources currently a hot topic in mexico bolivia chile colombia and elsewhere and alternatives to the hegemonic extractivist model the class struggle within climate politics is indeed between workers and capital as matt huber has argued but this should not be antithetical to the understanding that workers and capital are organized in often contradictory ways across the global north and global south as degrowth eco socialist and marxist dependency theory authors have outlined political and economic contradictions often confuse the interests of workers in different countries but properly acknowledging them helps us to identify where class interests coincide our strategy will only work if we also dedicate ourselves to critical political education in labour and movement organizing so that transformative praxis offsets the influence of capitalist ideology it is possible to recognize the existence of an imperial mode of living as well as its uneven distribution sometimes the imagery of a monolithic global north and a global south can set us back analytically as it implies geographical lines of conflict rather than historical patterns of production and distribution of resources including labour automotive industry workers in germany and brazil face different realities in terms of infrastructure salaries rights and geopolitics but in their respective societies they are subject to similar class antagonisms and face the same challenges the ecological transition needs to make sense for workers everywhere the conventional imperative for economic growth has led to precarious employment and high rates of exploitation meaning that a conversation around uneven and combined degrowth can actually improve demands for socially necessary good green jobs and the kind of living arrangements that communities may desire if that is we centre our strategy on alternative frameworks of sufficiency solidarity and justice as suggested by bengi akbulut to succeed in making the ecological transition the global working class will have to adjust its expectations we have to reject capitalism s consumerist lifestyle and take energy and material constraints into consideration when planning a good life these constraints foster conflicts over who gets to use a resource and how much not all of which can be resolved by improved technology in fact sometimes older technologies are what can save us such as the turn to agroecology and its more efficient use of soil and contribution to lower emissions agrarian reform and a fair indigenous land settlement process are pre conditions for rural workers to gain from the ecological transition by overcoming poverty and changing how we feed the world since there is no just transition without indigenous sovereignty our understanding of what goes where be it wind turbines or regrown forests requires improving our approach to territorial rights and living arrangements urban workers around the world stand to gain from this and should coordinate demand so that resource exploitation does not lead to the creation of new sacrifice zones we must also be honest that many jobs promised in the transition are temporary as they are tied to the construction of new infrastructure overcoming planned obsolescence will also mean more efficient production fewer replacements and less intense maintenance some jobs can be converted from dirty to clean sectors while others will have to disappear completely such as in the arms industry being honest about this fact will help to deepen the tide of organizing at unions associations and general social movements so as not to leave any worker behind these kinds of calculations will occur within and across borders possibly many times a day the success of our ecosocialist strategy depends on the quality of internationalist movement building and our capacity for coordinated planning the working class is very diverse it includes industrial workers and unions have a strong role to play that said it also contains a lot of informal labour according to the international labour organization there were about 2 billion informal workers around the world in 2019 some of them such as those with temporary jobs at farms and fisheries or the 15 20 million people who earn their living in recycling face particularly high risks of job loss and health issues as climate change advances we should also view these jobs not only factory jobs in the production of solar panels or lithium batteries as climate jobs women performing care work are also key to the transition and not only due to the strategic role of the care sector in improving lives in low carbon ways women tend to be principal leaders in the resistance to fossil capital enterprises in demanding the reduction of the workweek and its gendered double burden of time and can help to build bridges between workers in the north and south through the feminist movement organizing across these sectors is vital for a real internationalist just transition and can strengthen campaigns to pressure governments for the programmes that we need the more successful they are the more likely we are to get billions of people to join not only the more environmentally conscious professional class and engaged activists but also the social movements born out of sacrifice zones that have been involved in centuries long struggles for land water forests and a good life around the world this internationalist movement is working class based in terms of its challenging of capitalism and how it is the source of our present crisis but populated by the various marginal groups who stand to lose everything if fossil or eco fascism has its way thus the tide of movement building in our strategy will always deal with the pressing issues of the ecological transition but must also plan for rupture as a consequence of the deeply unsustainable nature of the capitalist machine our strategy requires bold action today oriented by the utopia that can guide us from this century to the next in order to build a just and desirable society our strategy is about more than survival it is about life a better life and this alone sets us apart from the capitalists and the tragedies they cause the long path of transition is full of contradictions and will present more challenges than the socialist movement has ever faced time is of the essence and we cannot afford to waste it any longer as our ultimate goal is to win an emancipated society and maintain it for centuries to come sabrina fernandes is an ecosocialist activist from brazil and host of the popular marxist youtube channel tese onze she is

group nyse tme is one of the best asian stocks to buy heading into 2023 bireme capital made the following comment about tencent music entertainment group nyse tme in its q3 2022 investor letter we made a few material trades in the quarter first we sold our stake in tencent music entertainment group nyse tme which we wrote about in our cio corner newsletter we sold our stake primarily because of the massive underperformance of tme s social entertainment segment that portion of the business which operates primarily through a group karaoke app called wesing lost 27 of its users during the year that we owned the stock this seems to have been caused primarily by competition from other streaming platforms such as tiktok douyin in china a risk which we underestimated since this segment produces essentially all of tme s profits the loss of users had a dramatic impact on our valuation of the business secondarily we had expected growth of average revenue per user arpu in their music subscription business in which tme has 70 share in china despite this near monopoly competition from upstart netease cloud music has been fierce over the last year netease gained material market share by offering discounts of 15 20 off the standard 8 rmb monthly price tme has been forced to respond in kind and tme s arpu fell 11 yoy in the second quarter with users falling dramatically in social entertainment and arpu growth in question in online music there was simply nothing left to support our original bullish stance on the stock even the fall from 6 at the end of 2021 to 4 per share in july was not enough to compensate for this change in our assessed value so we sold our position 11 kanzhun limited nasdaq bz number of hedge fund holders 19 kanzhun limited nasdaq bz is a beijing

the holiday season of 2023 is quickly approaching and now is the perfect time to save some money on gifts for your loved ones and yourself with the best black friday sales already live for every major retailers there are discounts on just about everything anyone could ever need going on right now what of cyber monday this year though the well known online shopping holiday always kicks off after black friday and tends to offer similar discounts from major retailers if you re wondering whether or not you should wait for cyber monday sales to make a purchase the answer is usually no the differences between black friday and cyber monday are almost non existent these days and if you find a great deal today there s really no reason to hesitate that being said let s dive into some of the subtle differences between the sales black friday vs cyber monday deals historically cyber monday sales have been better for online shoppers this was largely due to black friday being somewhat of a brick and mortar event in the earlier times of the shopping holiday the days of the best discounts only being reserved for folks that camp out overnight are pretty much over however and almost all major retailers have all of their discounts online starting on thanksgiving because of this the difference between black friday and cyber monday deals have pretty much become negligible although these two retail holidays have pretty much become intertwined there are still reasons to choose one over the other shipping differences black friday deals started very early this year as retailers have been encouraging folks to make purchases earlier than ever this is most likely due to some lingering supply chain issues that continue to make shipping some products difficult although you should be able to get most things delivered in time for christmas even if you make a purchase on cyber monday buying earlier pretty much ensures you ll have time to send it back and get a refund in time if needed for that reason it can be practical to do most of your shopping now rather than later limited stock another thing to keep in mind is that some discounts will be a associated with a certain amount of stock available although you can buy a ps5 pretty much everywhere there are still things like the ps5 slim bundle that likely won t last forever some of the biggest discounts on black friday on big ticket items like consoles ipads tvs and gaming laptops may not last forever a lot of the better apple black friday deals are on older generations of the devices and can sell out quickly at a low enough price because of this waiting for cyber monday could cost you the ability to grab some of the hottest deals convenience one of the biggest advantages of shopping cyber monday deals instead of black friday deals is that they aren t usually happening right in the middle of family time with most of the cyber monday sales beginning over the weekend it may be a lot more relaxing to do your shopping then rather than just after you eat thanksgiving dinner being able to wait until things have calmed down to actually do your holiday shopping can make the whole experience less stressful black friday and cyber monday terms explained black friday the term black friday has origins stretching all the way back to 1869 but the most recent interpretation of the term comes from the 1980s it was during this time that retailers would see an increased profit around this time of year which would be indicated by the use of black ink rather than red ink after this the window between thanksgiving day an the weekend started becoming well known in the media as black friday these days black friday seemingly refers to most of november as retailers start offering discounts the day after halloween cyber monday the term cyber monday is a fairly recent one in comparison to black friday it was a marketing term used to describe a boost in e commerce transactions that occured the monday after thanksgiving in the united states the term itself was coined in 2005 and was made main stream thanks to a press release from shop org although it was originally used to encourage more people do do their shopping online it has since become one of the biggest shopping days of the year looking for more shopping info take a look at our tips for shopping black friday sales for more

official of the biden administration to visit the philippines a longtime military and economic partner of the united states harris made her stop after her appearance at the asia pacific economic cooperation apec summit held in bangkok on monday harris met with marcos and her counterpart vice president sara duterte now and always the u s commitment to the defense of the philippines is ironclad and we are committed to strengthening our economic and investment relationship the white house said in a statement the pronouncement is a noticeable shift from marcos earlier posturing in july when he pitched an independent foreign policy it s not hard to see traces of his father the former dictator in his courting the backing of america for his regime his china friendly predecessor rodrigo duterte had a rocky relationship with the u s government though he had an evident affinity for former president donald trump marcos insisted that his plan was to pivot toward the u s all along telling reporters i have said many times i do not see a future for the philippines that does not include the united states caught in between security concerns were prominent in the discourse surrounding harris s visit the philippines and china have been locked in a territorial tug of war for nearly a decade over certain areas of the south china sea apart from meeting the country s leaders harris also visited palawan on tuesday it is the closest a u s executive branch official has been to the contested sea since china laid claim to them harris said she came to uphold international rules and norms here in the south china sea and around the world she added communities like this have seen the consequences and people here know the impacts when foreign vessels enter philippine waters and illegally

influence in the region photo credit reuters tpg images philippine president ferdinand bongbong marcos jr waits for u s vice president kamala harris at the malacanang presidential palace in manila philippines november 21 2022 foreign policy expert professor bobby tuazon of the center for people s empowerment in governance cenpeg believes that the u s continues to have eyes for the philippines as an ally in the region partly because it is a former colony that has mostly been subservient even in the post war period he said the philippines was expected to comply with the u s s wishes against china which biden has singled out as an existential threat to american hegemony tuazon also told the news lens the philippines is seen by the u s as key to its geographical priorities in the region a caveat however is that although some asean countries engage in military cooperation with the u s many asean members loathe getting dragged into any situation that forces them to pick sides between china and the u s tuazon said the re forging of ties between the philippines and the u s really surfaced in september when marcos met with biden in new york soon after a joint defense meeting followed in honolulu with top officials from both sides confident of support for american interests u s defense secretary lloyd j austin iii told his counterpart jose c faustino jr our countries share a vision of an open secure and prosperous indo pacific free from coercion or bullying taiwan prominent the approach toward taiwan in the conflict with china also surfaced as a major talking point between the two leaders during the last asean summit marcos threw his support behind the one china policy adding that china and taiwan must resolve those issues peacefully to avoid confrontation the recent meeting signaled a change in direction as marcos called for a joint response if tensions escalate tuazon feels that the fates of the philippines and taiwan are invariably linked to american interests in the asia pacific he said u s military strategists appear to be preparing their treaty ally for an important role amid the rising tensions including a war scenario in the taiwan strait where u s forces can be easily mobilized from military bases in the philippines edca slammed students protest the enhanced defense cooperation agreement edca signed in 2014 allows american soldiers to make use of philippine bases for joint and covert operations ahead of the meeting between marcos and harris a senior white house official announced that the u s was allocating over 82 million toward edca implementation at the five existing locations and more is on the way five additional joint military sites are set to be added after talks between the two leaders he also told reporters this will allow for more security cooperation exercises combined training activities and it will allow us to respond to disaster relief and humanitarian assistance needs the international league of people s struggle a global alliance of hundreds of organizations opposed to american aggression said the edca will virtually make the entire country a u s military base like in the past it is expected that with the presence of u s troops women children and the lgbtqi community will become more vulnerable to crimes and violence committed by u s soldiers the reinjection of resources into the military pact albeit small compared to the money poured into the ukraine and russia conflict reminds many activists of the historical crimes americans perpetrated in and around local bases the league of filipino students

strategic autonomy remains an important ambition for the european union but the bloc is still a long way from achieving that goal amid changing global developments analysts said the eu has long had the goal for it to make independent choices and act freely based on the region s interests cutting across the economic security and foreign policy spheres but in the eyes of many progress has fallen short of ambition strategic autonomy has been on the eu s agenda since the adoption of its global strategy report in 2016 it was given even higher priority in 2021 after a series of events that served as a reality check for the bloc but many of those looking for further progress on the eu s goal were disappointed when after the outbreak of the russia ukraine conflict in february the eu member countries once again fell into the pattern of following in the footsteps of the united states aside from their sustained military assistance for ukraine these countries also followed the us in imposing severe sanctions on russia regardless of the pain inflicted on their own economies and the resulting surge in energy prices and living costs for their people light years away in an interview published on the website of the german newspaper handelsblatt on nov 14 wolfgang ischinger a former chairman of the munich security conference said that although strategic autonomy is great europe is light years away from strategic autonomy cui hongjian director of the european studies department at the china institute of international studies said the russia ukraine conflict has disrupted the eu s pace of pushing forward on the path to strategic autonomy at first the bloc planned to strengthen autonomy in multiple fields at the same time the economy technology energy and security he said but the ukraine conflict forced the eu to change its focus from long term strategic planning to a short term crisis response this shift means the eu has ended up strengthening its security dependence on the us the scholar said sven biscop director of the europe in the world programme at the egmont royal institute for international relations said that the eu countries despite their limited stocks of arms and equipment have done all they can to support ukraine and for the very first time the eu paid for arms transfers to a country at war now both nato and the eu have accelerated their efforts to increase european defense capabilities strategic autonomy remains an eu objective biscop said he said that in economic and diplomatic terms the eu is an autonomous actor and that means it should stand up for its own interests recognition of this status is evident in the decision by german chancellor olaf scholz to visit beijing at the start of this month and by the actions of leaders of other eu countries in meeting with chinese president xi jinping also this month at the g20 summit on indonesia s resort island of bali the eu certainly will continue to set its own course vis à vis china and will not immediately decouple rather than just following the us he said when meeting with european leaders president xi emphasized a spirit of independence and autonomy when speaking on how bilateral relations can be further developed zhang lihua a professor in the department of international relations and director of the center for china europe relations at tsinghua university in beijing said the eu has been working toward true strategic autonomy but that it is still far from achieving that goal the biggest constraint for the eu to achieve its strategic autonomy is that it has no independent defense power and must rely on the us and nato for defense and security so they have to follow the policies of the us in terms of defense zhang said in response to the ukraine crisis some european countries have further strengthened their defense capabilities but they are still far from being able to protect themselves she said moreover on issues such as the migrant flows into the region it is difficult for them to make concerted efforts in these areas and that means reduced autonomy she said however on matters such as the response to climate change the eu still has its independence

southeast asian nation s new leader faces challenges from a falling ringgit to one of asia s biggest wealth gaps kuala lumpur malaysia in his first address as malaysia s 10th prime minister anwar ibrahim pledged to prioritise the welfare of ordinary malaysians to make good on his word anwar will have to tackle a host of economic challenges from the lingering scars of the pandemic and rising living costs to a falling currency and one of asia s biggest wealth gaps anwar whose appointment caps a remarkable three decade journey from leader in waiting to jailed opposition leader and back again has laid out few specifics of his economic plans apart from promising to tackle the rising cost of living and spearhead development that is racially inclusive and free of corruption but anwar whose confirmation as prime minister on thursday after days of political gridlock immediately sent malaysia s stock market and ringgit higher has gained a reputation as a reformist with inclinations towards economic liberalisation throughout his long political career anwar has a good understanding of the economy and is thoughtful and eclectic in his approach he is likely to seek a broad range of views and focus on economic reforms geoffrey williams an economist and non resident senior fellow at the malaysia university of science and technology told al jazeera there will be fewer handout based policies and more structured long term solutions i also think he will offer a very attractive prospective for international investors and financial markets on the campaign trail anwar who leads the multiethnic pakatan harapan ph coalition highlighted his connections to international business and finance arguing he could attract investors he counts among his friends he also stressed the need to restore malaysia s image overseas which was battered by the 1mdb corruption scandal involving jailed former prime minister najib razak corruption is no doubt malaysia s most critical systematic issue that can lead to uneven wealth distribution compromising the quality of education and healthcare leading to an overall lower standard of living for malaysians grace lee hooi yean head of monash university malaysia s department of economics told al jazeera in a corrupt economy resources are inefficiently allocated and companies that otherwise would not be qualified to win government contracts are often awarded projects as a result of bribery as deputy prime minister and finance minister during the 1990s anwar 75 presided over a boom period that saw malaysia become one of the fastest growing economies in the world at the onset of the 1997 98 asian financial crisis anwar implemented spending cuts and market oriented reforms recommended by the international monetary fund winning respect in western financial circles but straining relations with his political mentor and then prime minister mahathir mohamad as ties between the two men deteriorated mahathir sacked anwar who went on to lead the reformasi movement against the government before his imprisonment on sodomy and corruption charges which were criticised at home and overseas as politically motivated given his legacy as the finance minister during the 1990s when the economy enjoyed near double digit growth aided by manufacturing exports i expect anwar to be more market oriented and favourable to foreign direct investment and infrastructure investment niaz asadullah a professor of economics at monash university malaysia told al jazeera compared to past leaders he ll seek global integration and strive to repair malaysia s tainted international image as an investment destination by aligning domestic policies with global norms and international best practices asadullah said he expected anwar s agenda to be pro business but also people centric focusing more on allocating resources on the basis of need rather membership of an ethnic group a divisive topic in malaysia where the majority malay population receive certain privileges not afforded to the sizeable chinese and indian communities the last ph government elected in 2018 in a historic vote that ended six decades of rule by the malay majority barisan nasional bn collapsed in part due to a reform agenda malay nationalists feared would undermine malays special position in the constitution while he ll remain committed to social protection policies he ll seek to minimise fiscal leakages by rationalising subsidies and ensuring smart targeting of resources and services asadullah said after suffering the biggest contraction since the 1997 98 asian financial crisis malaysia s economy has rebounded strongly from the pandemic gross domestic product grew by 14 2 percent during the july september period after an 8 9 percent expansion during the second quarter yet southeast asia s fourth largest economy is facing slowing growth amid fears the global economy will tip into recession in the coming months inflation while modest compared with europe and north america and rising interest rates are stretching lower and middle income households budgets thin while the ringgit hovers near quarter century lows for malaysia s longer term prosperity structural reforms are needed to ensure its transition to a high income economy according to economists the oecd and world bank have highlighted the strengthening of social protections and the introduction of competition in state dominated sectors such as transport and energy as priorities for reform a prerequisite to achieving a high income and developed nation is the progression to a high productivity high income workforce said lee the monash professor however low economic growth has plagued the malaysian economy after the asian financial crisis one of the main contributing factors to the low growth is the low labour productivity growth as the head of a unity government that includes several rival groupings including the bn anwar whose first tasks will include passing a long awaited budget for 2023 could find it difficult to implement significant reforms given the unity government he is heading it will be tough for him to implement structural reforms quickly without protracted negotiations and consensus among coalition members yeah kim leng director of the economic studies programme at the jeffrey cheah institute on southeast asia at sunway university told al jazeera with the big bang likely to be risky and politically destabilising he will inevitably gravitate towards deng xiaoping s feeling the pebbles while crossing the stream that is emblematic of a gradualist approach yeah added referring to china s reformist leader who presided over a period of economic liberalisation during the 1980s harris zainul a senior analyst at the institute of strategic and international studies isis malaysia said anwar is unlikely to shake up the status quo due to political uncertainties including upcoming state elections i don t expect anwar to make any big changes in economic policy especially regarding taxes in the near term zainul told al jazeera reason being that there is little political appetite to be increasing the tax base right now with a few key states in malaysia still needing to have their elections by mid 2023 until that happens i don t think anwar will be risking anything that may be viewed as politically unpopular

islamabad former premier imran khan has lamented that the us has been using pakistan like a hired gun in the war against terror and america s ties with his country are very undignified as compared to a very civilised relationship with india his comments came days after khan signaled his readiness to mend ties with the united states after repeatedly accusing washington of conspiring to remove him from power in april when asked by public broadcasting service an american public broadcaster about his recent u turn and his past remarks that america treats pakistan like a slave khan said firstly i mean it is just a fact that the pakistan us relationship has been lopsided it is not for instance the us india relationship which i call a very civilised relationship a dignified relationship in pakistan we have been well the war on terror we were like a hired gun and i think it is a very undignified relationship he said khan 70 who was ousted in april in a no confidence vote in an interview with the financial times this month said he wants to mend relations with the us if re elected and no longer blames it for his removal as pakistan prime minister when asked if he believes he could have a good working relationship with the united states khan said the united states is a democracy democracies accept criticism democracies accept other people s point of view master slaves don t pakistan s relationship with the us is very important for us so just because of the regime change it shouldn t mean that i should not have a future relationship with the us and yes i have my right to criticise he added khan earlier had been claiming that he was ousted as a result of a conspiracy between prime minister shehbaz sharif and the us a top security partner to pakistan that has provided the country with billions of dollars in military aid khan has repeatedly claimed that donald lu the top american official dealing with south asia in the us state department was involved in a foreign conspiracy to topple his government khan the chairman of the pakistan tehreek e insaf pti party suffered bullet injuries in the right leg earlier this month when two gunmen fired a volley of bullets at him and others standing on a container mounted truck in the wazirabad area where he was leading the march against the government to press for snap elections he has blamed prime minister shehbaz sharif interior minister rana sanaullah and major general faisal naseer for hatching a plot to assassinate him well i was very lucky i had three bullets in my right leg and some shrapnel in my left he said so the two the flesh wounds are healing well but the bone where my bone got cracked by the third bullet that s causing me a bit of discomfort but i expect in the next two three weeks i should be walking putting weight on my leg khan said general elections must be held in pakistan less than 60 days after the dissolution of the national assembly which is set to dissolve in august next year when asked about his protest march against the government and why is his party pressing for an early election khan said we talk about the injustice that is taking place in this country where these this cabal of crooks have been foisted on us and secondly the economy has gone to the ground financial markets outside pakistan and within the country have lost confidence in this government and all the economic indicators are going down so if they don t hold elections immediately it doesn t bother my party because we are gaining all the time but our worry is that they will leave the country in a state where it will be beyond anyone s control he added

does america simply lack the political will to face economic reality in the teeth of the depression treasury secretary andrew mellon famously told president herbert hoover to liquidate labor liquidate stocks liquidate farmers liquidate real estate in other words to resist bailing out any industry through state intervention this was a tough sell even in those days and of course hoover succumbed to politics and took the opposite approach greatly and needlessly damaging the us economy for decades to come less often quoted are mellon s follow up words to hoover liquidation would purge the rottenness out of the system so people will work harder and live a more moral life mellon having lived most of his life in an america without a central bank understood economic recessions as necessary cures rather than ills to be avoided but he also understood the human price that would be paid in the aftermath of a period of phony economic prosperity only hard work and personal sacrifice person by person and town by town could get america out of its economic mess fiscal and monetary policy would provide no free lunch as millions of americans learned the hard way in the 1930s fast forward to 2022 and it s hard to imagine janet yellen calling for liquidation or telling americans to improve their moral fiber nobody votes for austerity or personal responsibility and any politician or bureaucrat or central banker who even suggests it is doomed today yet this mythology of austerity persists that a stingy federal treasury and reticent central bank don t intervene enough in economic crises consider this howler from paul krugman back in 2011 apparently delivered with a straight face one thing is clear mellon style liquidationism is now the official doctrine of the g o p keep in mind he wrote this several years into the most extraordinary monetary intervention in the history of the world one which ultimately saw the us fed purchase several trillions worth of treasury debt from the market yet for krugman it is never enough as the bruising midterm elections recently demonstrated america is a deeply unserious country a serious political discussion at the federal level would center on existential structural problems of war and peace debt and the dollar and entitlements but these issues can be addressed only by real austerity and real pain so instead we distract and divert ourselves worrying about whether donald trump should be allowed on twitter we argue over flu viruses guns transgenderism climate and abortion none of which the federal government has the slightest jurisdiction over rather than the material standard of living we will leave our grandchildren this is possible only because millions of americans maybe a majority are simply economics deniers they either don t believe economic laws exist or think economics can be overcome by legislation regulation or central bank actions and there are plenty of deniers among the ranks of professional economists the profession does itself no favors when it cheerleads for politics providing an intellectual veneer for interventionism human nature makes us want to believe untrue things but economics should help disabuse americans of political fantasies let s face it the us is not a free market economy because we don t much believe in markets despite our lip service most americans and virtually all political media academic corporate and banking elites believe economic intervention fiscal and monetary stimulus form the basis of our economy not production and saving so what would a serious america do to correct our disastrous economic path this may seem like an academic or rhetorical question but it s worth laying out the actual steps necessary to build a real economy rather than a fake one dependent on monetary or fiscal interventionism as dr mark thornton recently explained these steps may be conceptually simple even as they are wildly beyond political imagination today a wholesale adoption of laissez faire economic doctrine by national politicians immediate deep tax and regulatory reductions immediate sharp reductions in government spending at every level leaving federal spending well below federal revenue rigorous entitlement cuts using some combination of means testing and raising age eligibility for both social security and medicare rigorous defense spending cuts of at least 50 percent combined with a radically reduced us military footprint overseas cessation of new debt issuance by the us treasury cessation of active monetary policy by the federal reserve bank meaning no intervention with respect to the money supply interest rates or credit and debt markets including us treasurys a radical reduction in the fed s balance sheet by letting existing treasurys mature and roll off an entirely hands off approach allowing the us dollar to float freely relative to other currencies and commodities an express policy against bailouts or subsidies of any kind to any industry or company regardless of the severity of an economic downturn allowing troubled industries or companies no matter how big to fail through bankruptcy and asset sales investor losses and firing boards management and employees when restructuring is possible actively encouraging business and individuals to save through market floating interest rates elimination of any price ceilings or floors on prices wages and profits elimination of any unemployment subsidies to individuals along with abolition of minimum wage laws and finally the immediate sale of federal land and other assets to reduce debt service on the 31 trillion in treasury obligations and to restore worldwide confidence in the us economy this ladies and gentlemen is what a real program of austerity looks like that these actions are politically unfeasible complete nonstarters shows how politics dominates economics in america the profession charged with explaining how no free lunch is possible instead mostly operates as a handmaiden to the state and its bosses but politics won t fix this and we won t vote our way out of trouble the best path forward is at the state and local levels attempting to build regional economies with less fragility in the face of the warring borrowing spending and devaluing mania of uncle sam note the views expressed on mises org are not necessarily
