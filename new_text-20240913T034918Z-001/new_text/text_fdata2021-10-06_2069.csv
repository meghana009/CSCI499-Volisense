this article is more than 2 years old stablecoins have come a long way from being labeled as not real crypto and some commonsense measures around transparency can provide the next leg up toward broader adoption getty the conversation and tone around blockchain and cryptoassets has continued to shift from an initial lack of understanding to a hands off approach to one that most accurately be described as vigorous even with the backdrop of increased compliance and enforcement efforts however the trend toward more systemic integration has continued virtually unabated with almost every major banking institution and most major payment processors now offering some level of blockchain or crypto related services it is clear that cryptoassets are firmly part of the mainstream conversation even with all of this investment interest and implementation however a fundamental problem and issue with cryptoassets has remained unaddressed price volatility put simply most individuals and entrepreneurs simply do not feel comfortable either accepting or making payments using a medium of exchange that can swing upwards or downwards by double digit percentages unexpectedly that is where stablecoins come into the conversation built and designed as a true currency alternative stablecoins are intended to represent the best of both the fiat and crypto worlds running on a blockchain and therefore obtaining all of the benefits of such a connection stablecoins are also backed tethered supported or otherwise linked to external assets these assets can include fiat currencies commodities other cryptoassets or a combination therein the objective of price stability is the same a question that needs to be and increasingly is asked is just what measures and steps are in place to ensure that 1 these stablecoins are actually stabilized and that 2 the assets stabilizing these stablecoins are what is being reported let s take a look at why classifying stablecoins issues as banking institutions while somewhat odd on the surface might be a logical step that will help encourage wider crypto adoption trust and transparency the original idea of bitcoin and blockchain at large might have been to develop a trustless and permissionless platform for individuals and institutions to conduct transactions on a peer to peer basis while this has indeed occurred in the bitcoin space the reality is that for most non expert individuals and institutions want and in some cases require some sort of third party analysis of either the coin in question or the issuing entity implementing regulations and frameworks that would require regular audits of both the stablecoin issuers and the coins themselves would increase the trust placed in these by marketplace actors audits might not be as scintillating at watching crypto price volatility but are an integral part of how financial market actors interact reducing the f ear u ncertainty and d oubt the acronym fud has become synonymous with regulators investors and businesspeople that do not and have not invested into blockchain or crypto due to either a lack of understanding or a lack of trust in certain market actors perhaps the most obvious case as how fud can influence investor decision making are the continuing issues around tether issuer of usdt the largest stablecoin by market capitalization and trading volume following earlier allegations lawsuits and finally a settlement to resolve issues around how the usdt was backed tether once again made headlines due to how its flagship token was actually supported after revealing that these tokens were not 100 backed by cash and that an audit would be available in months several months ago at this point the need for consistent and comparable audits is clear objectively speaking how can regulators be expected to treat and take stablecoins seriously if even a request for a simple audit causes such issues and remains unresolved for the sector overall setting global norms it is impossible to regulate or even attempt to set global standards for such a fast moving and globally decentralized space like crypto that said it is worth noting that the development of stablecoins central bank digital currencies and other more centralized cryptoassets is not just occurring in the united states over 100 nations across the global are currently actively working on developing such products and there is no guarantee that the u s will be first to market with that backdrop in mind a commonsense step that can and should be taken is to attempt to develop and implement regulatory rules that encourage transparency auditability and the protection of individual privacy developing and implementing audit standards for stablecoin issuers is a reasonable first step in that direction open systems and networks always win out and crypto does not appear to be an exception to this rule stablecoins have come a long way in the last several years and even though they are not supported by every corner of the crypto community the upsides and benefits of these cryptoassets are clear as these cryptoassets become increasingly mainstream and continue to attract the attention and focus of regulators both in the united states and internationally it makes sense that a renewed focus on transparency and auditability will come to the forefront regulating stablecoin issuers as banking institutions might seem like an unusual step given the aim of some crypto organizations but developing a consistent and comparable audit process is necessary and critical step to further understanding and adoption of stablecoins

yet again our sceptred isle has been turned into a septic one shakespeare s precious stone set in the silver sea is once more being lapped by stinking sewage last weekend southern water notorious even in the disgracefully dirty water industry pumped raw sewage out of more than half its outlets around the south east coast soiling clear water and beautiful beaches from the isle of wight to kent in places the discharges continued for more than 40 hours this latest episode is no isolated outrage last year shockingly there were more than 400 000 such incidents involving streams rivers and the sea around the country lasting a staggering three million hours last weekend southern water pumped raw sewage out of more than half its outlets around the south east coast soiling clear water from the isle of wight to kent stock image this appalling record is the result of decades of failure by the water companies to clean up their act despite raking in vast profits and a light touch approach by the authorities designed to regulate them some of the pollution is from sewage works but most gushes from overflow pipes which are only supposed to release such filth in exceptional circumstances southern water s action will raise a special stink since less than three months ago it was fined 90million after pleading guilty to 51 charges of releasing raw sewage in the worst case brought by the environment agency in its history the prosecution claimed that this was done deliberately because it was a far cheaper alternative than to properly treat it and that as a result the company ultimately owned by american australian and british investment funds had reaped considerable financial advantage the court heard that the discharges which caused very considerable environmental damage were known about and permitted at a high level in the company and yet despite this it had failed even to report them to the environment agency the judge mr justice johnson noted southern had previously been fined substantial amounts for similar offences but there was no evidence it took any notice adding its offending simply continued less than three months ago southern water was fined 90million after pleading guilty to 51 charges of releasing raw sewage stock image there are few signs it has reduced its pollution greatly since even before last weekend s desecration of coastal bathing spots its record showed little sign of improvement during the months since mr justice johnson s judgment black sludge has fouled beaches at pagham elmer aldwick and bognor for example and soggy toilet paper has covered the pocket nature reserve near maidstone after a spill sewage has even been pumped into hampshire s pillhill brook chalk stream a habitat described as unique by the world wide fund for nature meanwhile chichester harbour supposedly one of the country s most protected marine environments has had so much sewage pumped into it this year that it is said to be nearing catastrophe status shamefully the company has set itself a deadline of 2040 to eliminate pollution incidents almost two decades away last year it made more than 138million profit down from more than 212million in 2019 mainly because of fines despite this its chief executive picked up a 550 900 bonus on top of his 435 000 pay packet this summer the sydney based macquarie group bought a majority stake in southern for 1billion dubbed the vampire kangaroo it is notorious for having previously extracted millions of pounds of dividends from thames water and this is part of a pattern across the industry when the water companies were privatised three decades ago ministers promised they would not fall into foreign hands by 2013 most had privatisation was supposed to help water companies raise funds to invest in cleaning up instead they prioritised increasing dividends paying out 56billion to shareholders while racking up 51billion in debt now 53 per cent of british rivers are in a poor state largely because of sewage discharges only 14 per cent are in good ecological condition and none have good chemical status we have been left literally in the s t it has to stop

name mnuchin steven current position secretary during the presidential campaign donald trump accused wall street investment bank goldman sachs of being part of a global power structure that robbed our working class but since his election he has appointed five former goldman alums to his cabinet most notable is trump s pick for treasury secretary former goldman partner steven r mnuchin m noo shin whose aggressive foreclosure tactics against vulnerable homeowners during the great recession are already providing ammunition to his critics during mnuchin s confirmation hearings democrats mounted strong opposition and twice boycotted the confirmation vote republicans responded by unilaterally sending the vote to the full senate where mnuchin s 52 47 confirmation win enjoyed the participation of a lone defecting democrat sen joe manchin iii of west virginia born december 21 1962 in new york city to elaine terner cooper and robert e mnuchin a goldman sachs partner on the firm s management committee steven mnuchin grew up in the rarified world of ultra wealthy new yorkers his grandfather leon mnuchin founded a yacht club in the hamptons steven attended the exclusive riverdale country school and graduated from yale university in 1985 where he was initiated into the secret society skull and bones according to author antony sutton steven mnuchin s early career was not atypical for a yale grad born with a silver spoon immediately after graduating in 1985 he got a job in the mortgage department at goldman sachs where his father was a bigwig dating back 28 years and where his older brother alan had been given a job just a year before mnuchin was brought quickly to the top becoming chief of the mortgage securities department at age 32 and joining the firm s executive committee at age 37 when he left goldman in 2002 at age 39 he walked away with an estimated 58 6 million 46 million in stock and 12 6 million in cash after leaving goldman in 2002 mnuchin was briefly vice chairman of hedge fund esl investments owned by his yale roommate edward lampert but soon founded sfm capital management with financier george soros mnuchin was also ceo of dune capital management a hedge fund he started in 2004 with two goldman alums dune helped finance a series of hollywood films including avatar and gravity between 2005 and 2013 ironically the firm also invested in at least two donald trump projects and wound up being sued in 2008 by trump over a construction loan in chicago in 2009 during the depths of the great recession mnuchin led an investment group that bought california based home lender indymac from the fdic for 1 55 billion taken over by the feds in 2008 because its poor decisions had rendered it insolvent indymac s main assets were 23 5 billion in commercial loans mortgages and mortgage backed securities but the collapse of the real estate bubble had beaten down the inflated market value of the realty underlying those instruments rendering them toxic and largely uncollectable renamed onewest bank the firm eventually became the biggest bank in southern california a big part of the reason according to critics were shared loss clauses that put most of the risk on the government which wound up subsidizing mnuchin and his partners with more than 1 billion in 2015 mnuchin sold onewest to cit group for 3 4 billion and became a member of cit group s board at the time as politico has reported merger critics were opposed by several nonprofits that wrote letters praising mnuchin and onewest nonprofits that had received thousands of dollars in donations from onewest and on some of whose boards mnuchin himself sat a clearly impressed trump cited the indymac deal as a strong influence on his choice of mnuchin he purchased indymac bank for 1 6 billion and ran it very professionally selling it for 3 4 billion plus a return of capital that s the kind of people i want in my administration representing our country senator elizabeth warren d massachusetts who will have a vote on mnuchin s nomination also mentioned his work at onewest though more critically steve mnuchin is the forrest gump of the financial crisis he managed to participate in all the worst practices on wall street he spent two decades at goldman sachs helping the bank peddle the same kind of mortgage products that blew up the economy and sucked down billions in taxpayer bailout money before he moved on to run a bank that was infamous for aggressively foreclosing on families mnuchin foreclosed on at least 50 000 homes in fact in 2011 an investigation by the office of thrift supervision ots forced onewest to agree to the issuance of a consent order to remedy numerous abusive practices that mnuchin s bank was using to make money specifically ots concluded that onewest was 1 filing false affidavits and other legal documents 2 initiating foreclosures without ensuring that the underlying mortgage documents were legally proper 3 spending so little on administration that its oversight internal controls policies and procedures for foreclosures were inadequate to prevent abuses although attorneys with the california department of justice also strongly recommended in 2012 that california file its own civil case against onewest for similar misconduct in california then state attorney general kamala harris now a u s senator declined to file the case in february 2016 mnuchin contributed 2 000 to harris senatorial campaign more recently two nonprofits the california reinvestment coalition and the fair housing advocates of northern california filed a complaint with the department of housing and urban development accusing onewest of violating the fair housing act by redlining an illegal practice of not doing business in minority neighborhoods in order to avoid making home loans to minorities specific horror stories include the following in 2009 a new york state judge cancelled 525 000 in mortgage debt demanded by onewest calling its foreclosure tactics harsh repugnant shocking and repulsive that same year onewest changed the locks on the home of a minneapolis woman during a snowstorm even though the bank had assured her in writing that her concern that at the end of the redemption period you and your mother will be evicted from the property will not take place in 2014 onewest foreclosed on a 90 year old woman over a 27 cent payment error in october 2014 mnuchin became co chairman of relativity media a film production company based in beverly hills mnuchin quietly resigned from his position on may 29 2015

two weeks before the bankruptcy filing as a candidate donald trump railed against hillary clinton for speaking to goldman sachs conferences and against ted cruz for being married to a goldman sachs

interest rates relative to inflation aren t getting back to normal anytime soon that s because institutions including sovereign reserve managers commercial banks and pension funds are buying bonds for regulatory reasons or to match their future liabilities breaking the relationship between a bond s price and the underlying fundamentals according to the newly formed strategic investment advisory group of j p morgan asset management central banks have backed themselves into a corner from which they will be unable to retreat according to the group s inaugural research publication the bond vigilantes are now outgunned by the bond pacifists the strategic investment advisory group is made up of the firm s veteran cios portfolio managers and strategists across asset classes and is chaired by michael cembalest chairman of market and investment strategy in the report called getting real about rates the post war era of substantially positive real interest rates may be gone for good the manager detailed the reasons why the low or negative real interest rates are likely to persist for a long period of time for example a weak recovery from the pandemic and an extended period of financial repression have forced real interest rates to deviate from where the federal reserve wants them to be in the long term the lack of a young workforce makes it hard for the u s government to reduce the current debt burden which is conducive to depressed interest rates to adjust to the prolonged low interest rate environment institutional investors should consider investing in securitized credit equities and real assets according to the report for fixed income investors the traditional strategies that protect them from inflation such as the treasury inflation protected securities are less likely to work well today because they are offering low or negative real yields according to jared gross head of institutional portfolio strategy at j p morgan asset management instead portfolio managers with the obligation to invest in fixed income should consider securitized credit backed by assets like cars real estate and mobile phone contracts because they are linked to the health and credit of the american consumers we think the consumer balance sheet right now is quite healthy gross said so securitized credit is a very interesting opportunity gross also noted that the current low interest rate environment has made value stocks more attractive than growth stocks in particular companies with utility like characteristics such as wireless carriers and telecom companies are a good source of return because their stock prices are less volatile you might be receiving a nice attractive dividend from a company with a high dividend stock but the price changes can wipe out the gains from dividends very quickly gross said lastly the report points out that institutional investors should consider investing in core real assets that offer stable real yields such as real estate infrastructure natural resources and transportation they have relatively low correlations to traditional stocks and bonds and that is what really makes them compelling gross said although these alternative assets are less liquid compared to traditional stocks and bonds they deliver the returns that investors need in the low interest rate environment according to gross most investors do have room to take on additional illiquidity gross said in a market environment such as this one where public liquid markets simply are unlikely to deliver returns that investors need you have to do something to conclude the overarching investment strategy in the low interest rate environment is to own cash flows that rise with nominal gdp gross said investors seeking to maintain and grow the purchasing power of their portfolios in such a world do have choices if they re prepared to embrace the full spectrum of fixed income and hybrid assets dividend paying stocks and core real assets the report said

about 80 hospital workers and supporters are standing outside mckenzie willamette medical center in springfield waving signs announcing an unfair labor practice strike as drivers pass by on 14th street many honk their horns in support four hundred workers represented by the seiu local 49 are without a contract with the springfield hospital the union and workers say the hospital management isn t bargaining fairly and wants to raise health care prices while not providing a livable wage and covid 19 protection as well as outsource some of its staff on the strike s first day oct 5 congressman peter defazio visited in support of the workers he said the hospital s management is a trend of today s economy and that it s time to review monopoly laws so for profit groups aren t purchasing hospitals like mckenzie willamette and cutting wages and benefits i remember when this was a great community hospital defazio told the picketing crowd adding that the management has changed over the years as different corporations have taken it over the majority owner of mckenzie willamette is the publicly traded tennessee corporation quorum hospital corp the contract between the hospital and seiu workers ended in august seiu represents housekeepers certified nursing assistants mri technicians respiratory therapists pharmacy technicians and more according to a press release from seiu workers are on strike because they feel understaffed and are experiencing a high turnover rate as well as a lack of affordable health care and covid 19 protections despite receiving 4 5 million in cares act funds the hospital has ignored worker demands for competitive wages or hazard pay the release says this is a trend in america and it s a sick trend it s a trend where wall street is taking over services that are critical absolutely critical to the american people and trying to bleed out every bit of profit they can get out defazio told workers and supporters the strike began 4 am tuesday oct 5 and runs through oct 7 the hospital is still open the strike received support from teamsters the local roofers union and the university of oregon s gtff graduate employee union as well as lane county commissioner laurie trieger springfield city councilor leonard stoehr state sen james manning eugene city councilor matt keating and oregon bureau of labor and industries commissioner val hoyle before speaking with the crowd defazio said he talked with the union s bargaining team he said they told him some entry level positions at the hospital pay less than at target paying workers low wages is a part of the corporate model that is common with hospitals today he added they cut back on the number of nurses on the floor cut back on what you re going to do with the maintenance of the building all the short sided things they do so they can show a higher profit on wall street he told the picketers the stock goes up a little the ceos get bonuses and they go home to their multimillion dollar mansions an official with seiu tells eugene weekly that some entry positions at mckenzie willamette start as low as 13 an hour this is a huge growing problem with inequity in this country the people who do the work who make this country move are being disrespected you re being disrespected defazio said housekeeper gypsy smith is one of the housekeepers whose jobs could be outsourced to a texas staffing agency speaking to the crowd she called the hospital s treatment of workers modern day slavery nicole pepple a critical care unit monitor technician tells ew that she s been at mckenzie willamette for 10 years during that time she says she s seen mckenzie willamette often pay less in wages than what workers earn at peacehealth hospitals as an employee we ve been begging for respect she adds briana wamsley who works in the respiratory care program says she wants respect from her employer too during the pandemic she says she s seen more patients die from covid 19 than anything else in her 13 year career at the hospital mckenzie willamette management is trying to increase health care costs for employees by 27 percent in the long run pepple says it makes health care unaffordable and sends most of their paychecks to insurance premiums which isn t what it once was years ago the hospital s health insurance felt upper middle class allowing easy medical access in the area increasing health care costs on hospital workers at mckenzie willamette means they ll have to try to get on oregon health plan defazio tells ew those aren t great plans he adds that s ironic for the people who work in health care risk their lives every day during covid that they re going to have substandard health care plans that are more expensive mckenzie willamette management s bargaining efforts are a trend of today s economy defazio tells ew where the sharks of wall street are trying to squeeze a penny out of everything to counter this trend he says that congress needs to pass the pro act which would make it easier for workers to unionize but also address the increased presence of industry monopolies we need to look at antitrust as it comes to private corporations buying hospitals defazio says in july president joe biden signed an executive order that is assessing industries where corporations have consolidated monopolistic power and the impact it has on consumers defazio says the biden administration should put corporations that are buying hospitals at the top of the list of antitrust enforcement there are mega corporations that have taken over health care and they re buying up doctor s practices now he says this story is a part of eugene weekly s reporting series on the labor movement in oregon funded by the wayne l morse center for law and politics

from the article but she did learn that snowden was running more than one tor exit node and that he was trying to get some of his buddies at work to set up additional tor nodes h mmm so snowden running powerful tor nodes and trying to get his nsa colleagues to run them too i reached out to sandvik for comment she didn t reply but wired s poulsen suggested that running tor nodes and throwing a crypto party was a pet privacy project for snowden even as he was thinking globally he was acting locally but it s hard to imagine a guy with top secret security clearance in the midst of planning to steal a huge cache of secrets would risk running a tor node to help out the privacy cause but then who hell knows what any of this means i guess it s fitting that tor s logo is an onion because the more layers you peel and the deeper you get the less things make sense and the more you realize that there is no end or bottom to it it s hard to get any straight answers or even know what questions you should be asking in that way the tor project more resembles a spook project than a tool designed by a culture that values accountability or transparency

president joe biden talks with reporters after returning to the white house in washington tuesday oct 5 2021 after a trip to michigan to promote his infrastructure plan ap photo susan walsh to get around republican obstruction president joe biden said tuesday that democrats are considering a change to the senate s filibuster rules in order to quickly approve lifting the nation s debt limit and avoid what would be a devastating credit default the president s surprise remarks come as the senate is tangled in a fiscally dangerous standoff over a vote that s needed to suspend the nation s debt limit and allow the federal government to continue borrowing to pay down its balances congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it will run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load biden has resisted any filibuster rule changes over other issues but his off the cuff comments tuesday night interjected a new urgency to an increasingly uncertain situation advertisement it s a real possibility biden told reporters outside the white house getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60 vote threshold for passage to 50 in the split 50 50 senate vice president kamala harris can break a tie allowing democrats to push past republicans the topic was broached during a private democratic senate lunch session tuesday as senators were growing exasperated with republican leader mitch mcconnell s refusal to allow a simple vote on the debt limit instead mcconnell is forcing democrats to undertake what they view as a cumbersome process taking days if not weeks that will eat into their agenda with republicans putting up hurdles to the vote democratic senators have been discussing a range of options including a carve out to the chamber s filibuster rules but invoking a filibuster rules change seems highly unlikely in part because all democratic senators would need to be on board at his weekly press conference senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y did not embrace or reject the idea of changing the filibuster for this one specific issue instead schumer simply repeated what he biden and others have said that republicans should get out of the way and allow democrats to pass the measure that s already been approved and sent over from the house the best way to get this done is for republicans to just get out of the way schumer said he said the burden to stand aside is on mcconnell s shoulders mcconnell though wants to force democrats to use the process he favors which gives republicans ample time to remind voters about the unpopular vote dug in tuesday mcconnell refused to budge they ve had plenty of time to execute the debt ceiling increase mcconnell said about the democrats they need to do this and the sooner they get about it the better once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load now at 28 trillion the fact is both parties have contributed to the debt and the nation has run a deficit most years for decades the filibuster has been up for debate all year as biden and his allies consider ways to work around republican opposition to much of their agenda biden has not backed earlier calls to end the filibuster for other topics namely voting law changes but tuesday s comments could signal a new phase at least one democrat sen joe manchin d w va sounded resistant tuesday he and sen kyrsten sinema d ariz have raised objections to ending the filibuster on other topics this year the standoff over the debt ceiling that started weeks ago as a routine political skirmish is now entering more serious territory as the senators risk a rare federal default if no agreement is reached that could set off a cascading fiscal crisis rippling through not just the government and financial markets but the ordinary economy and the lives of americans

president joe biden talks with reporters after returning to the white house in washington tuesday oct 5 2021 after a trip to michigan to promote his infrastructure plan ap photo susan walsh washington to get around republican obstruction president joe biden said tuesday that democrats are considering a change to the senate s filibuster rules in order to quickly approve lifting the nation s debt limit and avoid what would be a devastating credit default the president s surprise remarks come as the senate is tangled in a fiscally dangerous standoff over a vote that s needed to suspend the nation s debt limit and allow the federal government to continue borrowing to pay down its balances congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it will run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load recommended videos biden has resisted any filibuster rule changes over other issues but his off the cuff comments tuesday night interjected a new urgency to an increasingly uncertain situation it s a real possibility biden told reporters outside the white house getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60 vote threshold for passage to 50 in the split 50 50 senate vice president kamala harris can break a tie allowing democrats to push past republicans the topic was broached during a private democratic senate lunch session tuesday as senators were growing exasperated with republican leader mitch mcconnell s refusal to allow a simple vote on the debt limit instead mcconnell is forcing democrats to undertake what they view as a cumbersome process taking days if not weeks that will eat into their agenda with republicans putting up hurdles to the vote democratic senators have been discussing a range of options including a carve out to the chamber s filibuster rules but invoking a filibuster rules change seems highly unlikely in part because all democratic senators would need to be on board at his weekly press conference senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y did not embrace or reject the idea of changing the filibuster for this one specific issue instead schumer simply repeated what he biden and others have said that republicans should get out of the way and allow democrats to pass the measure that s already been approved and sent over from the house the best way to get this done is for republicans to just get out of the way schumer said he said the burden to stand aside is on mcconnell s shoulders mcconnell though wants to force democrats to use the process he favors which gives republicans ample time to remind voters about the unpopular vote dug in tuesday mcconnell refused to budge they ve had plenty of time to execute the debt ceiling increase mcconnell said about the democrats they need to do this and the sooner they get about it the better once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load now at 28 trillion the fact is both parties have contributed to the debt and the nation has run a deficit most years for decades the filibuster has been up for debate all year as biden and his allies consider ways to work around republican opposition to much of their agenda biden has not backed earlier calls to end the filibuster for other topics namely voting law changes but tuesday s comments could signal a new phase at least one democrat sen joe manchin d w va sounded resistant tuesday he and sen kyrsten sinema d ariz have raised objections to ending the filibuster on other topics this year the standoff over the debt ceiling that started weeks ago as a routine political skirmish is now entering more serious territory as the senators risk a rare federal default if no agreement is reached that could set off a cascading fiscal crisis rippling through not just the government and financial markets but the ordinary economy and the lives of americans

president joe biden talks with reporters after returning to the white house in washington tuesday oct 5 2021 after a trip to michigan to promote his infrastructure plan ap photo susan walsh washington to get around republican obstruction president joe biden said tuesday that democrats are considering a change to the senate s filibuster rules in order to quickly approve lifting the nation s debt limit and avoid what would be a devastating credit default the president s surprise remarks come as the senate is tangled in a fiscally dangerous standoff over a vote that s needed to suspend the nation s debt limit and allow the federal government to continue borrowing to pay down its balances congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it will run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load recommended videos biden has resisted any filibuster rule changes over other issues but his off the cuff comments tuesday night interjected a new urgency to an increasingly uncertain situation it s a real possibility biden told reporters outside the white house getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60 vote threshold for passage to 50 in the split 50 50 senate vice president kamala harris can break a tie allowing democrats to push past republicans the topic was broached during a private democratic senate lunch session tuesday as senators were growing exasperated with republican leader mitch mcconnell s refusal to allow a simple vote on the debt limit instead mcconnell is forcing democrats to undertake what they view as a cumbersome process taking days if not weeks that will eat into their agenda with republicans putting up hurdles to the vote democratic senators have been discussing a range of options including a carve out to the chamber s filibuster rules but invoking a filibuster rules change seems highly unlikely in part because all democratic senators would need to be on board at his weekly press conference senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y did not embrace or reject the idea of changing the filibuster for this one specific issue instead schumer simply repeated what he biden and others have said that republicans should get out of the way and allow democrats to pass the measure that s already been approved and sent over from the house the best way to get this done is for republicans to just get out of the way schumer said he said the burden to stand aside is on mcconnell s shoulders mcconnell though wants to force democrats to use the process he favors which gives republicans ample time to remind voters about the unpopular vote dug in tuesday mcconnell refused to budge they ve had plenty of time to execute the debt ceiling increase mcconnell said about the democrats they need to do this and the sooner they get about it the better once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load now at 28 trillion the fact is both parties have contributed to the debt and the nation has run a deficit most years for decades the filibuster has been up for debate all year as biden and his allies consider ways to work around republican opposition to much of their agenda biden has not backed earlier calls to end the filibuster for other topics namely voting law changes but tuesday s comments could signal a new phase at least one democrat sen joe manchin d w va sounded resistant tuesday he and sen kyrsten sinema d ariz have raised objections to ending the filibuster on other topics this year the standoff over the debt ceiling that started weeks ago as a routine political skirmish is now entering more serious territory as the senators risk a rare federal default if no agreement is reached that could set off a cascading fiscal crisis rippling through not just the government and financial markets but the ordinary economy and the lives of americans

president biden s administration really is an aging rock band that hasn t had a hit in memory or ever even worse the rock star who once fronted the band has long left and the only guy who remains can t sing and sure can t play the guitar nothing is sadder than watching mr biden up on stage all alone desperately trying to channel that one hit wonder barack obama republicans just have to let us do our job mr biden wheezed at the white house monday just get out of the way if you don t want to help save the country get out of the way so you don t destroy it it s those damned republicans again yes those republicans who literally control nothing in all of washington it s all their fault mr biden s gambit monday echoed mr obama s schtick from years ago about how republicans had driven the car into the ditch and now it was his responsibility to get the car out of the ditch and all republicans could do is stand around drinking their frozen slurpee and complain and offer unhelpful advice watching mr biden speak on television americans could watch the stock market tank in the corner of the screen with every sentence the answer mr biden insists is to plunge america 5 trillion further into debt on top of the 28 trillion these drunken sailors have already piled on us think about that for a moment another 5 trillion that mr biden will never live to pay off no he will leave that to his children and grandchildren and great grandchildren to pay off what monsters and the biggest lie as always is that the 5 trillion in new spending is somehow paid for just a reminder every dime of that 28 trillion you already owe was paid for when politicians like joe biden spent the money specifically mr biden is angry that republicans refuse to go along with yet another hike in the debt ceiling as if there is any such thing in washington joe biden has spent his entire 50 year career in washington maxing out all the credit cards and refusing to pay any of them off now he has just filled out the application for yet another credit card and is startled to find that nobody wants to co sign for it when democrats aren t blaming republicans for refusing to co sign another credit card application they are attacking their own for holding similar reservations it is pretty astonishing to listen to rep alexandria ocasio cortez of new york rant and rave about the 1 trillion crumb she demands you pay for one trillion dollars a crumb she calls it these people are common street criminals only dumber miss cortez is what you would get if greta thunberg took up mathematics the hysteria and forceful sense of entitlement is downright dangerous a mob of angry thugs chased sen kyrsten sinema arizona democrat into the restroom and held her hostage inside a bathroom stall all the while filming for social media can you imagine if a bunch of yahoos in maga hats had done such a thing president trump would have been crucified before sun up but luckily for joe biden the political press in washington are the only groupies and road whores left in america who are still dancing and swaying to his aging one hit wonder rock band without the rock star charles hurt is the opinion editor at the washington times

this month the university of chicago is hosting its third urban october to focus on the issue of improving urban life for the billions of people that live in cities around the world in the wake of a pandemic that s exposed inequities around the globe and in chicago the goal is to help focus attention on the work that is being done to transform the cities of the future and chicago in particular in a post covid 19 and climate change challenged world thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors even prior to the pandemic it s telling that when employment was low and the stock market was soaring that many americans were struggling to get by according to former 47th ward ald ameya pawar who is now a senior advisor at uchicago s inclusive economy lab in 2018 we had historically low unemployment nationally the stock market was going gangbusters and yet only four in 10 americans had 400 in the bank he said a majority lived from check to check and poverty was increasing perhaps counterintuitively pawar notes that poverty in the u s has decreased during a global pandemic and that s because he government has provided unprecedented help what i think is important that undergirds all of this is the fundamental orthodoxy the economic orthodoxy which has guided american public policy for the last 50 years was laid bare says pawar it wasn t just concurrent crises of poverty inequality the wealth gap and climate it s the underlying logic of the last 50 years neoliberalism got laid bare and so my point is that if you want to build back better we need new economic assumptions a new economic orthodoxy pawar notes that vast swathes of chicago have little to no access to capital and that without access to capital you are going to have glaring gaps and so it seems to me that we are always trying to make up for a lack of investment and access to capital in disinvested communities with everything but access to capital he said the philanthropic model is part of the problem according to pawar because it allows a few people who have benefited from inequality to determine what cities are able to do to solve the problems created by inequality he said the people who drive inequality are the ones making decisions about what the city can do about that inequality one obvious impact of the pandemic has been to acceleration of the trend of more people working from home and fewer workers in offices downtown that s a potentially worrying trend according to luis bettencourt director of uchicago s mansueto institute for global innovation who says that most american cities are typically tied together by a central business district he says that if that connection begins to break down because fewer and fewer people are working downtown it s very problematic bettencourt thinks that after the pandemic recedes some sectors particularly creative jobs that benefit from close collaboration are likely to spur a return to the office for some workers but he also thinks that some companies will think that having people work from home is an opportunity to save on office costs speaking to the enormous inequities the pandemic has highlighted and exposed bettencourt says that in order for cities to continue to thrive they must work for all residents in chicago i don t want to necessarily say how well we did or how poorly we did said bettencourt but obviously we could do better and part of the issue is that chicago is a very unequal city and i think it s a place where it s very hard to be poor because of the history of segregation and poverty but also because a lot of the supporting services are very remedial he notes that for a city to operate efficiently and create economic opportunity a network of complex functions must come together and work well and it means in particular that people who live in cities they need support said bettencourt they need good services good housing good environments in which they can be healthy they need conflict resolution they need all kinds of things that allows them to interact with each other and through those interactions create essentially the economic value and the civic life of the city that is really what cities are about bettencourt said that s why they exist one profound change that all cities will have to deal with going forward is the impact of climate change while that impact may be more obvious in some areas than others particularly coastal areas the reality is that all cities will be challenged by the changing climate we are already living through some of the impacts of climate change said sabina shaikh director of uchicago s program on the global environment so it s not something that we should keep thinking about as way off in an uncertain future obviously these impacts are much more visible in some places than others in chicago we don t see the coastal surges and the wildfires and what s happening in other parts of the country or world but we are already living with the predictions which are more extreme and intense rain and heat events and that s going to continue to become more frequent cities will have to plan and invest to become more resilient to the impacts of climate change says shaikh and that while we may have technological solutions we still have to collectively have the will to do it shaikh says our limits in working together to put the pandemic behind us is a good example of what happens when that collective will is not there due to incredible scientific and public health research we had a lot of information on how to manage covid but the behavioral dimension to it has been so challenging said shaikh and i think that s similar with respect to slowing environmental degradation but also in terms of building our resilience to climate change part of that process of adaptation will require a fundamental rethinking about urbanization and land use according to shaikh we were really good at engineering the way we wanted to live but this also created problems by developing places that maybe could have been preserved for coastal protection or for wildfire protection so in modern society if we didn t have water where we wanted it we engineered it to come to us said shaikh i think we need to rethink that a little bit and try to restore the ecosystems that offer the kind of natural protection needed to withstand certain climate effects while the impact of climate change is global shaikh notes that the impacts can be very localized you might think the weather in chicago is the weather in chicago but the effects of climate change can be borne very differently from one neighborhood to another due to historical policies land use and the environmental exposures that are results of the economic system the political system and historical discriminatory practices said shaikh the biggest threat presented by climate change for chicagoans is likely to be more intense flooding and heatwaves part of the solution in terms of creating greater resilience to such events will be more green space and more permeable paved surfaces says shaikh the important thing is that we need to have more resilience to these conditions that is going to require investment at every level from from a particular property or home to the city and global scale starting with investing in those that are most vulnerable due to existing conditions shaikh said and ultimately successful cities have constantly had to reinvent themselves and evolve to remain relevant and draw people the truth is that we are here for reasons that are important bettencourt said cities open up possibilities and opportunities in life in so many different ways they welcome diversity they create collaboration they re the places where democracy was invented so these are processes and cities have been evolving and adapting to change since the beginning and they will continue to do that short of something truly catastrophic so i am very optimistic i think that these noisy dynamics that we often associate with being a problem in cities is normal note this story will be updated with video thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors

washington ap to get around republican obstruction president joe biden said tuesday that democrats are considering a change to the senate s filibuster rules in order to quickly approve lifting the nation s debt limit and avoid what would be a devastating credit default the president s surprise remarks come as the senate is tangled in a fiscally dangerous standoff over a vote that s needed to suspend the nation s debt limit and allow the federal government to continue borrowing to pay down its balances congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it will run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load biden has resisted any filibuster rule changes over other issues but his off the cuff comments tuesday night interjected a new urgency to an increasingly uncertain situation it s a real possibility biden told reporters outside the white house getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60 vote threshold for passage to 50 in the split 50 50 senate vice president kamala harris can break a tie allowing democrats to push past republicans the topic was broached during a private democratic senate lunch session tuesday as senators were growing exasperated with republican leader mitch mcconnell s refusal to allow a simple vote on the debt limit instead mcconnell is forcing democrats to undertake what they view as a cumbersome process taking days if not weeks that will eat into their agenda with republicans putting up hurdles to the vote democratic senators have been discussing a range of options including a carve out to the chamber s filibuster rules but invoking a filibuster rules change seems highly unlikely in part because all democratic senators would need to be on board at his weekly press conference senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y did not embrace or reject the idea of changing the filibuster for this one specific issue instead schumer simply repeated what he biden and others have said that republicans should get out of the way and allow democrats to pass the measure that s already been approved and sent over from the house the best way to get this done is for republicans to just get out of the way schumer said he said the burden to stand aside is on mcconnell s shoulders mcconnell though wants to force democrats to use the process he favors which gives republicans ample time to remind voters about the unpopular vote dug in tuesday mcconnell refused to budge they ve had plenty of time to execute the debt ceiling increase mcconnell said about the democrats they need to do this and the sooner they get about it the better once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load now at 28 trillion the fact is both parties have contributed to the debt and the nation has run a deficit most years for decades the filibuster has been up for debate all year as biden and his allies consider ways to work around republican opposition to much of their agenda biden has not backed earlier calls to end the filibuster for other topics namely voting law changes but tuesday s comments could signal a new phase at least one democrat sen joe manchin d w va sounded resistant tuesday he and sen kyrsten sinema d ariz have raised objections to ending the filibuster on other topics this year the standoff over the debt ceiling that started weeks ago as a routine political skirmish is now entering more serious territory as the senators risk a rare federal default if no agreement is reached that could set off a cascading fiscal crisis rippling through not just the government and financial markets but the ordinary economy and the lives of americans copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
this is an excerpt from the atlantic s climate newsletter the weekly planet subscribe today many fights about climate policy have been raging basically unbroken for the past 40 years but something that sets this moment apart is that a subset of people who care about climate change and who have founded companies to fight it is becoming extremely wealthy on friday the electric car start up rivian filed for its initial public offering if you re not familiar rivian makes electric trucks that look sleek friendly and alert almost pixarian its initial customers however are drawn more from the gucci set than the wall e set its entry level truck the r1t starts at 67 500 the highest trim is more than 73 000 even though americans now regularly pay 40 000 for luxury family haulers that look like pickup trucks rivian s cars are upmarket it says that more affordable models will come in a few years after it hones its technique on luxury offerings tesla followed the same path the start up hopes to raise 8 billion in an ipo around thanksgiving that would value the company at 80 billion if successful the ev maker would enjoy one of the largest ipos in an american market in the past decade raising roughly the same amount as uber did in 2019 another historical comparison is also eyebrow raising in 2010 general motors emerged from bankruptcy and raised 20 billion in an ipo by that point gm had sold hundreds of millions of vehicles over its 102 year history rivian is 12 years old and it claims to have delivered its first vehicles to customers last month but if rivian has its way the stock market will by the end of the year value both firms at about 80 billion without getting rah rah about it rivian does represent the ideal of president joe biden s economy it has a technical founder it actually makes something useful a physical good that you can drive and touch its production facility is not only in the midwest but in a town literally called normal it s going public through a traditional ipo not a trendier and more founder friendly special purpose acquisition company or spac deal because it needs cash quickly at the same time rivian is clearly a type of technology company and it has learned from the modern day west coast giants like apple it wants to be vertically integrated much like buying a new iphone you will buy a new device from rivian directly buy intangible rivian services through that device s software and bring the device into a rivian store when it breaks the physical device will be designed by in house rivian engineers and optimized to run rivian software the only difference is that the device will be a four ton truck not a phone and rivian has arrived at its current position with help from two giants of the u s economy amazon owns at least 5 percent of rivian s stock and has placed an order for 100 000 delivery vehicles with the company which is the largest single purchase of evs ever the megaretailer s name appears in rivian s ipo filing more than 80 times ford also owns a large share of the company the old school automaker and rivian initially planned to collaborate on an electric suv but the deal fell through before the pandemic one of the truisms in financial journalism was that private markets had supplanted public markets that in the 2010s so much cheap money was sloshing around that the ubers and airbnbs of the world could run at an indefinite loss on the back of private equity and venture capital firms without having to face the scrutiny of going public it s unclear whether that preference for private markets will survive the pandemic recovery but you can see how rivian might have gone that route its ipo filing shows that the company is bleeding money it has lost more than 1 billion since the beginning of the year and plans to spend billions more over the next few years but so was uber in 2019 the year that it went public the ride sharing company lost 8 5 billion there s another way to look at this too it s so expensive to commission a new car factory from scratch and spin up a global production line that it s of the same order of magnitude as subsidizing more than 6 billion ride hailing trips but one sector where public markets are clearly superior at least from the founders point of view is electric automaking and here with apologies to grimes we have elon musk to thank musk successfully enticed retail investors that is people who don t work in finance who are sitting at home with robinhood or e trade open to bankroll the high costs of the energy transition since august 2019 tesla s valuation has swelled from about 43 billion to 784 billion experiencing in other words 1 700 percent growth tesla which sold just shy of 500 000 cars last year is now more than twice as valuable as toyota which sold more than 9 5 million its stock price has risen so much that shorting the stock has become too expensive and the company s doubters have all but given up musk proved that the public will fund a specific subset of the energy transition the switch from internal combustion engines to electric cars i would call that an invaluable accomplishment except that it enriched musk personally by 100 billion manufacturers of ev components chargers and batteries now go public so frequently that unless you re paying close attention to financial markets you are probably missing them the ev charging firm wallbox went public through a spac deal yesterday polestar volvo s ev spin off went public last week the ev market is now getting so frothy that climate advocates should maybe start worrying is tesla really almost 10 times more valuable than general motors and if not can the ev industry as a whole survive the popping of tesla s bubble would be decarbonizers may have no choice the venture capitalist william janeway has argued that some kinds of financial bubbles are good because they are how a capitalist society can mobilize sufficient resources to invest in the technologies of the future maybe that s what we re seeing now with rivian emphasis on perhaps i m writing about rivian because the energy transition is far enough along that individual firms participating in it now matter the window is closing for new ev companies to leap in and that means that rivian s history is getting written and society is deciding how to interpret its cultural politics in its filing rivian revealed that it has given 1 percent of its equity to a new philanthropic initiative called forever that will support environmental and conservation causes in that it resembles the outfitter patagonia which has pledged 1 percent of its own profits to conservation and you can see a crux there for the automaker a decision that is not entirely in its hands rivian could become apple a wildly profitable firm that merges engineering and upscale design to bring new high technologies and a certain cultural aesthetic into the mainstream or it could resemble patagonia an upscale brand that represents expedition level quality yes but speaks to a smaller more cosmopolitan segment of society its choice and ours will help determine the role that evs play over the next few decades or so of america s decarbonization
getting your trinity audio player ready maria jimenez swabs her daughter glendy perez 7 for a covid 19 test at canal alliance in san rafael on sept 25 2021 photo by penni gladstone for calmatters sarah voit likes to keep 10 to 15 rapid test kits on hand in case any of the residents of the family emergency shelter coalition in hayward need to be tested for covid 19 they ve had some infection scares and the antigen tests which return results in minutes have been crucial to curbing the virus in the family shelter but in recent weeks the staff has struggled to purchase enough rapid test kits the local walgreens and costco have started limiting sales to one per customer we ran into the same issue at the beginning of the pandemic when we were trying to buy clorox wipes and hand sanitizer said voit the shelter s program director three weeks ago a child living at the shelter was sent home from school after a classmate contracted covid 19 voit s team used the rapid tests on the whole family they all came back positive because we had those kits on hand we were able to send them immediately to the isolation and quarantine hotel the county runs she said otherwise it could have taken three to five days to get those results and many more families could have gotten sick a nearby clinic offers covid 19 tests but only pcr tests which usually take several days for results even a single day s wait could fuel an outbreak among the shelter s 23 adults and children if a resident really needs a test we can send them there voit said but the three to five days is tough to wait voit managed to find an online supplier and ordered 70 kits for the shelter but they aren t coming anytime soon the delivery date is a month out online and in stores major retailers are sold out of the popular at home tests and medical supply vendors can t find enough rapid test kits for schools shelters nursing homes employers and other groups across the state people in low income communities are being turned away as community groups and clinics are forced to ration their tests workers in need of regular screening for employment struggle to find them some parents are spending hundreds of dollars out of pocket to test their school kids and nursing homes are told they may have to wait weeks for testing kits the u s gets a d when it comes to testing said dr john swartzberg an infectious disease expert and professor emeritus at uc berkeley we re not doing enough of it and it s too difficult for people to get tests those with the least resources have the greatest difficulty in finding a free test site or purchasing at home testing experts say quick and easy testing is vital to contain the spread of covid 19 without widespread access to tests people don t know they are infected and need to quarantine causing outbreaks that could have been prevented there should be little stations where you can get rapid tests anywhere anytime said joe derisi professor of biochemistry and biophysics at uc san francisco rapid test kit shortages abound it s a mismatch of supply and demand although the state is reporting record high testing numbers californians seeking same day results and over the counter test kits for sniffling kids employer verification or merely peace of mind say they are unavailable the problem nearly all state run testing facilities offer only laboratory based pcr tests and people want rapid ones instead when the delta variant reared its head the shortage of rapid tests created the perfect storm experts say the surge coincided with schools reopening and employers requiring quick routine testing at the same time local health departments scaled back their testing efforts focusing on vaccinations instead manufacturers seeing decreased summer demand reportedly shuttered production lines and tossed unsold product fewer than 10 of testing locations across the state now offer rapid result antigen tests according to a database from coders against covid and urisa giscorps the test shortage is so severe that the federal government has stepped in to increase production on sept 9 the biden administration announced a national covid 19 action plan that includes the purchase of 280 million rapid point of care and over the counter tests by the federal government and a three month deal with walmart amazon and kroger to sell the tests at cost the u s department of health and human services did not respond to requests inquiring how many rapid tests would be allocated to california industry experts say manufacturers including abbott laboratories are picking up production but adequate supplies have yet to hit the shelves for consumers and it could be weeks off those with the least resources have the greatest difficulty in finding a free test site or purchasing at home testing dr john swartzberg university of california berkeley we have been told by this particular manufacturer that they ve caught up but clearly at the customer level we still see shortages and of course customers are shifting to other brands which cascade the shortage elsewhere said nam tran professor of clinical pathology at uc davis and a member of the state s covid 19 testing task force despite the slightly lower sensitivity of rapid tests compared to laboratory based pcr ones the ease of the at home options make them ideal for community surveillance derisi said pcr tests can detect lower levels of virus and potentially catch an infection sooner but the reality is the inconvenience of scheduling an appointment means people aren t getting tested enough i could get a pcr but that s just a snapshot in time tran said if you want people to test every day pcr is not feasible about 90 of all pcr test results are returned in two days according to state data although that time has steadily crept upward recently the 15 minutes of wait for a home rapid test compared to 48 hours could mean the difference between an infectious person starting quarantine immediately versus spreading the virus for several days and it s clear that rapid testing works fewer than 10 of testing locations across the state now offer rapid result antigen tests the mariposa skilled nursing facility that katrina anderson manages hasn t had a single case of covid 19 among its frail residents since the beginning of the pandemic in addition to other strict infection control policies every person that enters the building is given a rapid test if you come to work in our facility you re tested if you come to fix something that s broken in the facility you re tested anderson said nobody enters without getting a rapid test anderson received word from the state that tests were in short supply she was able to secure enough kits for the next few weeks but other organizations like schools and community groups attempting to set up rapid testing through the california department of public healthmay not be so lucky the testing task force website warns that it will take six to eight weeks to receive the state s rapid test kits schools desperate for test supplies in march the state offered 5 million binaxnow tests to schools as an optional incentive to reopen in the spring rapid testing is a major strategy for schools eager to avoid kids time spent out of the classroom sick or in quarantine but the state program has been swamped with orders and some schools say pcr testing is their only reliable option right now state public health officials told kern high school district in bakersfield that there is a nationwide shortage of antigen rapid tests said erin briscoe clarke a district spokesperson so the school is using pcr tests instead despite the longer wait time for results derisi from ucsf said he heard that hundreds of schools signed up in september for the state tests right when the shortage occurred and right when the delta bump hit the state department of public health did not return requests for comment about its ability to fill schools orders a rapid antigen covid 19 test at canal alliance covid 19 testing in san rafael on sept 25 2021 photo by penni gladstone for calmatters officials at the clovis unified school district northeast of fresno said they have struggled to secure enough rapid tests for their 43 000 students in addition to required masking and daily health screenings the schools there routinely test students involved in extracurricular activities and are gearing up to begin testing faculty weekly the schools also shorten the 10 day quarantine period by three days if a student can prove they are covid negative but the clovis district was notified earlier this month that the state may not be able to fill its test kit order spokesperson kelly avants said we got our order in and heard within a day or two that the state was no longer accepting additional orders because they were out avants said early this month the clovis district contacted more than 40 vendors in search of rapid test kits nobody had any in stock and wouldn t until at least october maybe even december eventually the state was able to fulfill the district s order like so many other supply chains right now it is unpredictable avants said the district has about a two week supply of tests and expects a delivery of 12 800 more from a private vendor soon without rapid testing readily available publicly some parents are spending hundreds of dollars to monitor their kids health nayamin martinez a parent in clovis unified received an email several weeks ago that a child in her daughter s classroom tested positive for covid 19 it was a friday afternoon and the family s local kaiser testing clinic was closed even with insurance martinez couldn t find a rapid test kit or same day appointment anywhere she also knew that results from a pcr test wouldn t come until the following monday or tuesday and didn t want to keep her daughter out of school needlessly martinez wound up taking her to urgent care and paying 270 for the rapid test and her peace of mind hundreds of testing sites shut down the california department of public health says there s a glut of pcr testing capacity thousands of same day appointments for the tests are available through the state testing website and more tests are processed daily now than during the winter surge optumserve which manages the state s testing efforts works with the state to monitor demand and offer drive thru mobile and fixed site options health officials told calmatters yet many californians complain that they can t find an appointment or a rapid test the issue as government run mass testing sites have closed it s not always clear to people where new locations have sprung up you end up with barriers to access that have less to do with capacity and more to do with lack of information said dr jorge caballeros a physician and founder of coders against covid a volunteer group that crowdsources a directory of test sites nationally more of the testing has shifted from a government based or public health service and become privatized a lot has shifted to primary care physicians health systems and to companies that are running these tests he said according to the coders against covid database 900 testing sites have closed in california since april 2020 and that s likely an undercount we got our order in and heard within a day or two that the state was no longer accepting additional test kit orders because they were out kelly avants clovis unified school district working class and immigrant communities that often face technological or language barriers are struggling with the shifting test locations and longer turnaround times community organizations have been left to fill the gaps with what little supplies they have left we re still the only organization in marin county that s doing rapid testing for free and i don t understand why said yolanda oviedo covid 19 response manager at canal alliance it s been really hard for us to maintain canal alliance which provides an array of services for the latino community in marin offers rapid testing two days a week the pandemic hit the county s latino population hard latinos accounted for 80 of the county s covid 19 cases last year despite making up less than 16 of the population most are essential workers with high risks of exposure oviedo said the group received 5 000 test kits from the state in may and have used more than 3 000 demand has grown since august and they have resorted to limiting testing to 100 people per day in order to make supplies last as long as possible people seeking tests at the site are frequently turned away it s a tough decision especially when they know community members are desperate said marina palma san rafael city schools board member and volunteer at canal alliance we have people coming to test with us from richmond petaluma novato san francisco palma said increasingly employers like amtrak and goldman sachs are requiring proof of vaccination or negative test results and many workers can t afford to miss a day of work when you go to other places it takes two days for the results two days means a lot for those families who work labor palma said if they don t have that verification they can t support their families it s a similar story in the central valley where martinez the clovis parent is the executive director of the central california environmental justice network her organization which partnered with uc davis is the only place in yolo stanislaus madera and fresno counties offering rapid tests several weeks ago they too started capping the tests at 100 per day when i heard we were capping tests i asked why don t you order more they said there s no more to order they re on backlog martinez said many of the people they test have medi cal or are uninsured and are unable to get appointments at local health clinics routine testing for employers isn t necessarily covered by insurance everyday around 5 a m people start calling martinez desperately searching for a free test it s bureaucracies after bureaucracies it s exhausting she said calmatters health care reporting is supported by the california
