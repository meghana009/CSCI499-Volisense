with inflation high and talk of recession intensifying virginia s budget writers will be working at a time of uncertainty but gov glenn youngkin said monday that they ve got one thing going for them virginia s financial reserves are up and the current budget calls for them to rise even more from 2 6 billion as of june 30 to 3 8 billion in june 2023 and 4 3 billion in june 2024 with inflation still squeezing virginians household budgets youngkin said he will keep pushing for tax relief on top of the 4 billion written into the current budget when he proposes amendments to the budget next month our backdrop here is one of being cautious and so we don t want to get over our skis he said monday at the patrick henry building but the commonwealth has never been in a stronger financial condition youngkin told the governor s advisory council on revenue estimates a panel of business and political leaders the boost to reserves already written into the budget provides a significant significant cushion in the event of any challenges he told the gacre before the group went into a two hour closed door session youngkin said the gacre agreed during that meeting that the revenue estimates he will use in drafting amendments should be a mix of a standard steady as it goes scenario and a pessimistic one that mix will be pretty much in line with the roughly 30 weighting to a pessimistic scenario that general assembly budget writers have been working with he said those words mean different things to different line items he said for the biggest single source of state revenue income taxes withheld from virginians paychecks the still tight labor market probably means that revenue will be fairly solid but nonwitholding income taxes which include investors stock market gains as well as farmers and self employed virginians income will be hurt by the slump in stock markets corporate profits are also looking to be under pressure as will corporate income tax collections while revenue from recordation taxes paid when real estate changes hands is also likely to be down the wild card is sales tax inflation could make collections rise since the tax is a percentage of the sales price of goods but inflation could mean people buy less we re watching that very closely youngkin said staffers of the general assembly s money committees are looking for a decline in state tax collections this year after fiscal year 2022 s 16 increase to 28 9 billion the money committees preparing for the 2023 session s work on budget amendments are assuming a roughly 7 drop in the current fiscal year with the house appropriations committee staff looking for a somewhat larger decline than the senate finance committee team the house staffers are more optimistic about a bounce back in fiscal 2024 looking for a 5 bump as opposed the senate forecast of a 3 increase

whether you ve been collecting gifts throughout the year or prefer to wait until the holidays have arrived you probably hope to get in on some great deals after thanksgiving the good news is that retailers are well stocked for the gift giving season but when your turkey day plans were made you might have wondered if it s even worth it to brave the crowds on black friday or hang out at home for cyber monday to get the best prices what is black friday in the late 1980s retailers started using the term black friday as a nickname for the day after thanksgiving this is because stores typically turned a profit on this day and accountants used different colors of ink to show whether earnings were up or down red meant negative and black stood for positive what is cyber monday cyber monday didn t come into existence until a couple of decades later then in 2005 shop org which was the online component of the national retail federation coined the term in a press release in the statement the organization explained that online shopping on the monday after thanksgiving was becoming a trend that was driving retailers to plan significant discounts that day on cyber monday consumers set their sights on surfing for holiday gifts and shopping online executive director of shop org scott silverman said in the 2005 release this year online retailers will be capitalizing on the increased traffic by offering special promotions and discounts when should you shop for the best deals now that they are both part of our collective vernacular which offers the best deals it might come down to what you hope to purchase and how you prefer to shop cyber monday tends to outperform black friday for online discounts with the best deals of any during the five days between black friday and cyber monday but not by a significant amount jonathan silver founder and ceo of affinity solutions a global insights firm tracking consumer purchasing habits told gobankingrates statistically the difference is negligible for example in 2021 americans saved an average of 24 on black friday while the average discount during cyber week was 26 black friday can be an excellent time to get big ticket items like tvs and computers at discounted prices while cyber monday might be better for gaming systems and winter apparel ultimately you can look for items on your list during black friday sales and finish up on cyber monday if an item is on sale during black friday and the price is good buy it retailmenot editor kristin mcgrath told nbc news think of cyber monday as a second chance to snag items that sold out during black friday sales because retailers generally repeat their deals you re limiting yourself if you wait until cyber monday since many retailers have transitioned to offering black friday deals online you can shop both from the comfort of your couch however if items go out of stock online you might need to head to a store nearby to find what you want in many cases you might not need to wait for either day to find something on your gift shopping list at a sweet price several major retailers such as amazon and walmart typically launch black friday specials online and in stores long before the unofficial holidays

cardiex a cardiovascular technology company based in both australia and illinois recently acquired blumio a san mateo california based startup focused on cardiovascular sensors the deal will advance both companies vision to accurately and easily measure blood pressure without relying on the use of a cuff according to blumio ceo and co founder catherine liao as a developer of medical devices cardiex s products measure arterial stiffness and central blood pressure waveforms it also makes wearables and devices for remote patient monitoring decentralized clinical trials and home health

executives from docusign velatura and behavioral health providers on econsent health information exchange and compliance with the cms final rule on interoperability blumio claims to have been leading the charge when it comes to creating wearable sensors that can capture a cardiovascular signal without the use of pulse pressure its competitors fit into two buckets liao said in an interview the first bucket is companies that are seeking to develop the same type of novel sensor as blumio liao named pyrames a cupertino based company as an example but pointed out that the company is focused on applying its sensor only in neonatal care the second bucket includes startups that are leveraging existing optical sensors commonly found on smartwatches and fitness trackers as a mechanism to measure blood pressure noninvasively in this category companies like biobeat medical aktiia and livemetric came to mind for liao before the acquisition was announced cardiex and blumio which were founded in 1994 and 2015 respectively had been collaborators for about three years the collaboration began so the two companies could work together to measure arterial stiffness as well as extract different central aortic biomarkers relating to the heart a lot of cardiex s core technology was developed to rely on the use of a tonometer which is essentially a pressure sensor that looks like a pen and allows clinicians to measure the pulsation of a patient s artery according to liao the use of tonometers requires trained clinical staff whereas blumio s sensor technology can essentially immediately replace that and make it easier for clinicians to assess how stiff a patient s artery is as part of an overall health assessment she said sponsored content a deep dive into specialty pharma a

autoimmune conditions diabetes hepatitis c and hiv aids throughout the collaboration blumio was focused on providing its hardware development kits to cardiex as well as working with the company on clinical studies to validate the robustness and accuracy of the signal its sensor acquired during the same period of time blumio was also collaborating with other companies namely infineon and google to enhance its technology liao declared but when it came time to be bought she said cardiex was definitely the right collaborator to make a deal with it was really about the alignment of where our products could come together liao said it was about seeing that we have a path forward we can incorporate our technology directly into their product being part of their product development roadmap this deal also helps both blumio and cardiex from a growth perspective she pointed out liao said cardiex is working to build a big presence in the u s as well as globally cardiex ceo craig cooper agreed that this acquisition makes the company more poised for growth we re singularly focused on the vascular biohealth market or biomarker sector in terms of developing a wearable device and other solutions for vascular disease he said in an interview no one is focused singularly on arterial health which is basically the world s largest health disorder not only just from a cardiovascular and hypertension perspective but also from the point of view of other complementary vascular disorders like alzheimer s disease kidney disease and preeclampsia now that blumio has been acquired liao has joined cardiex as chief strategy officer cooper said that liao shares cardiex s vision of developing wearables to improve arterial health so it just made sense for us all to come together and have her part of the team to liao an enjoyable part about now being part of cardiex is that fundraising activity has been taken out of her day to day responsibilities i can really focus on driving the product development and more importantly the commercialization and go to market strategy for the entire broader cardiex product suite she said the deal s financials were not disclosed by liao or cooper photo

by andrew poreda vice president senior research analyst what it means it sure has been a costly year in terms of weather damage according to insurance broker aon the world has seen at least 29 weather events this year that have caused 1 billion or more in damage all told the tally includes 14 severe weather events thunderstorms hail and or tornadoes six floods five droughts three tropical cyclones and one european windstorm drought has been a particularly acute problem this year damages are approaching 40 billion and it is the ninth most detrimental drought specific year on record on the other hand the hurricane season has been relatively light with only three events causing more than 1 billion in losses hurricane ian the presumptive champion for the most detrimental event will likely eclipse 100 billion when the tab is finalized the other big story has been european heat waves which have affected hundreds of millions of people and killed an estimated 16 000 sage s view looking at aon s list the magnitude and frequency of these events should be quite concerning no part of the world is safe and the variety of weather events illustrates their unpredictability last year in europe significant monetary damage was done via floods this year it was droughts here in the us the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa estimated that there have been 15 separate billion dollar events while cost estimates may differ noaa has a much more modest estimate for hurricane ian the potential severity of the physical risks of climate change should be widely agreed upon where will weather strike next it seems like everyone should be prepared did anyone anticipate the droughts of the midwest us to cause the mississippi river to reach record lows stranding 45 of us grain exports due to unnavigable shallow water and to add insult to injury the low levels also permitted saltwater from the gulf of mexico to make its way upstream impacting louisiana water treatment plants the field of short term and long term climate scenario analysis will become increasingly critical for both companies and government entities and with all this talk about weather events we haven t even begun to discuss the potential impact of slow moving climate related challenges like rising sea levels bottom line the costs of climate change are only going up what it means the russian ukraine war has led to a nuclear power renaissance of sorts even staunch adversaries e g germany have had to acquiesce and are now reconsidering nuclear power s role in the energy landscape for the future of nuclear much of the interest lies in shifting from large light water reactors to small modular reactors smrs supporters believe smrs could be safer quicker to build and have lower upfront costs relative to their larger counterparts many of these new reactors will rely on a more enriched version of uranium specifically high assay low enriched uranium haleu one problem only russia produces it russian uranium is not on the sanctions list but the us department of energy is concerned about an adversarial country holding a monopoly many companies are planning to produce haleu in the united states or an ally country but these projects will take at least five years before any uranium is available and without conviction from stakeholders of what role nuclear power will play there is some hesitancy to invest large resources prior to more commitments nobody wants to order 10 reactors without a fuel source and nobody wants to invest in a fuel source without 10 reactor orders said daniel poneman chief executive of u s nuclear fuel supplier centrus energy corp leu a centrus has an agreement with the us government to produce haleu but it is forecasted to produce only one third of the required fuel annually that the us industry will need by 2030 other companies like the french domiciled orano are willing to contribute to the manufacturing but expect the us government to kickstart it sage s view the clear lesson for 2022 is respect the importance of the supply chain energy is essential to any economy so completely outsourcing key components is extremely problematic many nuclear power startups have popped up over the years so one would expect that somebody would have raised the alarm on russia s influence or maybe they did and no one listened as we continue to voice our concern over chinese dominance in areas like rare earth metal processing solar power components and electric vehicle batteries russian influence in specialty uranium fuel is similarly concerning the current us administration appears eager to address this issue and recently announced they were developing a nuclear strategy but with only 700 million allotted to haleu production in the inflation reduction act it is difficult to be convinced that politicians are serious in general american stakeholders seem overly focused on the final output of clean energy sources and technology and far less serious on all the steps that it takes to make that output a reality lots of lip service on developing domestic and allies supply chains but when we look back a few years from now we will likely be disappointed with the progress what it means pumping oil is currently a very profitable business due to federal subsidies a surprising energy source has emerged that may be even more lucrative methane gas sourced from landfills since incentives make landfill gas twice as profitable as oil from a unit of energy perspective larger oil and gas companies have taken notice bp just spent 3 3 billion to purchase archaea energy a special purpose acquisition company spac spinoff from the rice family known for their efforts in natural gas investing archaea has upwards of 80 landfill gas projects in the works and has already accumulated operating profits of 150 million when garbage rots it produces methane which is 24 times more impactful for global warming in the short term than carbon dioxide so finding ways to capture this gas has the potential for huge environmental benefits and hence the government has granted generous subsidies to do so subsidies are so significant that landfill gas can fetch almost five times the price of natural gas 33mm btu vs 7mm btu with the acquisition of archaea bp only strengthens its position as the us leader in biogas sage s view green garbage gas demonstrates that clean energy sources can be profitable and come from unexpected sources and because society is desperate for clean energy solutions it will likely benefit from an all of the above approach as landfill gas works seamlessly with our current fossil fuel infrastructure there are inherent built in advantages that make this a valuable option though the ability to scale this past a certain point is obviously limited by the number of landfills bp s investments in areas like biogas highlight a trend of the major oil and gas companies investing heavily in clean energy foreign companies like bp and shell lead the way with shell going so far as planning to have an estimated 50 of capital expenditures in clean energy options by 2025 us powerhouses exxon and chevron are not that far behind and both plan to heavily invest in areas like hydrogen and carbon capture with a period of record profits and tons of cash on hand now is a good time to diversify their future revenue models from a government support perspective one must wonder if some of these subsidies need to be updated on a more regular basis while longer term support is necessary to help create stability in the case of landfill gas it looks like these projects would have been profitable with far less generous subsidies perhaps that money would be better suited elsewhere such as supporting domestic mining and processing for rare earth and precious metals which are all vital for our clean energy economy there are far too few projects currently in the works future legislation may have to be more dynamic to balance spurring innovation helping efficient allocation of capital from a cost and environmental perspective and preventing the waste of taxpayer dollars what it means with seemingly everyone weighing in on the esg debate it should be no surprise that influential investor and co founder of microsoft bill gates has his own unique insight surrounding some of the controversies while he understands that some businesses are going to great lengths to exaggerate their esg credentials he asserts that considering esg factors is essential to evaluating a company one particular area that he thinks is worth assessing is company innovation gates also the founder of the venture capital firm breakthrough energy ventures believes that for the e it is imperative to note which companies are making investments in green technologies these companies will be the ones that drive down costs and make various green tech more affordable and for their efforts there are a variety of tangible ways to measure the environmental impact but the rest of the esg evaluation process is a work in progress the whole measurement thing is a little immature gates said of esg criteria the field is going to get mature on that but having that environmental incentive a lot of investors really do want to get that information sage s view innovation is what stimulated the industrial revolution led us through the information age and will certainly play a huge role in fighting climate change the debate clearly lies in how much of a role it should play the other general levers that can be pulled are enhancing efficiency and modifying consumption some stakeholders feel strongly that societies need to change lifestyles whether it be changing the way we commute modifying our diets or living in smaller homes dubbed by some as the de growth movement the hope is to reshape capitalism to deal with some of the world s impending problems some changes to lifestyle like eliminating wasteful food consumption are certainly warranted another group of stakeholders opine that for fighting climate change we shouldn t waste time with unproven technology and instead deal with what is available at our disposal now unfortunately power sources like wind and solar are going to need innovation in energy storage to make them more viable the electric vehicle movement is also going to need a miracle or demand is going to flatline due to limits in the global lithium supply and other resources one word of caution not every good idea is worthy of a blank check those investing in self driving vehicles have learned that the hard way with 100 billion collectively spent and little to show for it how are green hydrogen carbon capture or nuclear fusion among many others going to play out what it means in the united states approximately one third of food never gets eaten the us department of agriculture estimates that 165 million kilograms of food is wasted daily the equivalent of a fully loaded aircraft carrier one traditional option to mitigate wasted food is to get it in the hands of a non profit but are there other solutions all that food ends up in landfills to decay and create methane gas which contributes negatively to global warming which we now know bp will be thanking us for to fight this problem many food suppliers are employing chemistry to increase shelf life and decrease the chance of spoiling a good example of the vital role chemistry plays is an apple harvest which can take a year to get from an orchard to a consumer s plate apples emit ethylene as they mature which is a delicate part of the ripening process to slow that ripening a chemical 1 methylcyclopropene 1 mci is utilized on 90 of stored us apples but now instead of exclusively utilizing 1 mci in storage some farmers are applying it to the tree before harvest to buy more time storage still remains the primary application where apples are placed in bins devoid of oxygen with 1 mci pumped in and sensors are employed to closely analyze the fruit s ethylene levels exporting provides a unique challenge based on the time it takes to transport one quarter of apples are shipped overseas but chemistry provides innovative solutions purfresh a specialist in controlled atmospheric systems installs a device in shipping containers that converts oxygen into ozone the ozone then reacts with the ethylene putting the apples in a cryogenic like state technology has the potential to allow for any fruit to be delivered anywhere in the world anytime but what about saving the food that gets wasted after successfully arriving at the grocery store two thirds of food waste in the us a few companies such as agrofresh and akorn technology have created multi faceted food coatings that have a wax to prevent moisture loss and oil to preserve color and a corn based protein that controls the respiration rate another future option is an anti microbial sticker that can help suppress mold sage s view when food is plentiful and so are people s bank accounts it is easy to dismiss the problem of food waste in the us we are lucky to have a plethora of options for all types of food imaginable and very rarely is there a season when a choice we want is out of stock but other parts of the world aren t so lucky and some can t even get essentials like grain one of the fallouts of the russia ukraine war as the world s population increases and climate change can unexpectedly lead to droughts in the areas most relied upon for production we are going to need a mix of smarter consumption and more breakthroughs in production and storage technologies and since arable land water and fertilizer are also limited resources we have plenty of other challenges that will need solutions to ensure the success of the world s future food economy ultimately the biggest weapon in fighting food waste will be human behavior source list 1 masters jeff world rocked by 29 billion dollar weather disasters in 2022 yale

listen to this article listen to this article general motors says it expects its portfolio of electric vehicles to turn a profit in north america by 2025 as it boosts battery and assembly plant capacity to build over 1 million evs per year ceo mary barra used the pledge to kick off the company s investor day event in new york the profit figure includes vehicle sales revenue benefits from emissions tax credits and revenue from software and parts sales she said barra said the company s ev portfolio appeals to a broader range of customers than the competition in a lineup that includes a small suv for around 30 000 plus a luxury suv pickup trucks and hummer suvs in the next two years the detroit automaker has a goal of selling only electric passenger vehicles by 2035 gm is sticking by a pledge made by barra to sell more evs in the u s than market leader tesla by the middle of the decade our commitment is to lead the industry chief financial officer paul jacobson told reporters ahead on the investor day event we believe that with the infrastructure that we put in place and the vehicles that you ll see today we ll be able to get there the 2025 profit prediction is on a pretax basis that includes the capital costs of building battery factories and converting internal combustion plants to electric vehicles jacobson said it will take time for individual electric vehicles to get to low to mid single digit profit margins in 2025 as costs are spread over more vehicles ev profit margins will go higher once clean energy tax credits from the federal inflation reduction act are applied jacobson said gm customers he said should be able to get half the 7 500 federal ev tax credit next year reaching the full credit by mid decade to get the credits evs and batteries must be built in north america with battery minerals sourced on the continent despite economic volatility and the possibility of a downturn gm appeared more confident in this year s financial results saying thursday it expects full year pretax income to be 13 5 billion to 14 5 billion that s within the previous guidance range of 13 billion to 15 billion gm also said its brightdrop commercial vehicle unit which is making electric vans and carts will contribute over 1 billion of revenue next year the company says its modular ultium ev architecture is flexible enough to allow multiple battery chemistries and cell sizes and it can handle multiple vehicles that s one reason the company says the next two years put it on a path to double revenue by 2030 doug parks product development chief said evs are much simpler to build than internal combustion vehicles for example the chevrolet silverado ev has 45 fewer parts than its combustion equivalent he said as for the new vehicles gm will roll out an all electric version of the chevrolet corvette next year president mark reuss said this will again set the standard of the world for performance he said reuss gave glimpses of other new or revamped gm vehicles that are coming in the next two years new internal combustion vehicles will be based on the existing underpinnings saving costs yet allowing the company to do significant upgrades he said among the revamped or new entries next year are the chevrolet traverse three row suv as well as a new buick suv and a revamped chevrolet trax small suv starting around 19 000 in 2024 gm will redo the three row gmc acadia suv making it more truck like reuss said then it will revamp the internal combustion version of the chevy equinox small suv in the biggest market segment in the world for electric vehicles next year gm will revive the buick electra name for a new suv that will go on sale first in china then in the u s then comes the cruise origin a multi passenger vehicle built for the company s ride hailing service and a cadillac compact suv among the 2024 evs is the gmc sierra full size pickup a full size cadillac suv and full size buick and chevrolet electric cars mainly for china reuss also said gm is revamping the way customers buy electric vehicles giving them the option of fully purchasing online or at the dealership and saving the company 2 000 per vehicle rather than dealers holding huge inventories they would keep fewer vehicles on lots when a customer orders an ev it would come from three u s distribution centers two in california and one in george they would stock vehicles with popular equipment combinations and allow deliveries in as little as four days reuss said the system would automate a lot of financing and insurance costs the 2 000 savings would go to gm reuss also took a shot at u s electric vehicle sales leader tesla telling analysts that more than 11 000 tesla owners had vehicles serviced at a gm dealership he said the dealer network is a big competitive advantage
just as temperatures began to dip this month the state s sunset advisory commission released a report that calls into question whether the public utilities commission of texas will be able to keep our lights on the analysis which is a bit like a progress report for the agency took a hard look at the changes made after 2021 s blackout during winter storm uri it found in short that those changes aren t enough to ensure that the puc is prepared to improve grid reliability it also isn t accurately analyzing data to inform decisions about the state s utility markets puc is woefully under resourced given its critical responsibilities and work that still lies ahead the report says while explaining how 1999 s deregulation worked until it didn t the report pointed out that despite blackouts during an unusually strong winter storm in 2011 state electric policy remained largely unchanged and business as usual continued then came uri which left 11 million homes in texas without power and water for days during one of the coldest winter storms on record the state legislature put the puc under a mandate to more actively oversee the electric reliability council of texas and the market but the puc was ill prepared for the task the report said part of that is because of budget cuts at the time of the legislative mandate the agency employed 166 people that total raised concerns with the sunset commission staff who said the agency lacked the bodies to adequately oversee the industries it is tasked with regulating for instance the puc relied heavily on the participants of markets it was regulating for the analysis it needed to make recommendations and decisions the market participants have private interests to protect which may be at odds with the broader public interest in providing reliable electricity to all texans the report said having independent analysis the sunset staff said would be key as the agency begins to implement market reforms while addressing grid reliability the puc should have more funding to hire its own analysts they said the hefty document also recommended defining better the term reliability as well as making sure that the puc and ercot are actually communicating with each other lawmakers will take a look at the report during next year s legislative session and a public hearing will also be held but the agency already got an earful from some legislators last week when the state senate business and commerce committee held a hearing to discuss the puc s proposed plan to improve reliability by redesigning the utility market in texas the plan which was offered to the committee by puc chair peter lake would pay power generating companies to maintain a reserve of electricity for the grid during times of high demand such as this summer or during a storm like uri after forecasting and then proving that they can reliably provide electricity during peak demand the state would pay companies a performance credit mechanism lake testified that the idea would incentivize power generators to be reliable in a way that just supply and demand would not the cost and the timeline concerned several of the senators as did the fact that the consulting firm hired to review potential plans didn t participate in the hearing and reportedly didn t factor in the massive grid failure during uri into its analysis into what plan would really improve reliability choosing to run its analysis on weather from 1980 to 2019 what we have in front of us is a market based solution the analysis says would give us 10 times the reliability for less money customers would pay in the absence of action lake said however several senators called the plan convoluted and questioned whether the state s power consumers should pay for an untested idea when they already had billions from the 2021 storm passed on to them we have to have the power and the heat and the a c on in the summer but it has to come in a package that people can afford their monthly utilities said state sen jose menendez d san antonio we ve got to be good stewards with the dollars the ratepayers pay state sen donna campbell r new braunfels agreed the idea which hasn t been done anywhere else in the country would cost consumers another 460 million a year the puc told the committee it could also take more than four years to fully implement in the meantime should bad weather hit this winter consumers could be left out in the cold again national oceanic and atmospheric administration disaster and risk mapping shows that between 1980 and 2022 there were nine winter storms and almost half of the state s residents are not ready to respond to another get the d brief newsletter dallas most important news stories of the week delivered to your inbox each sunday
by frank pallotta cnn business bob iger is returning to disney as ceo retaking the reins of a company that s very different from the one he led when he stepped down as chief executive in february 2020 with 1 5 billion in streaming losses last quarter alone park fans unhappy sinking cable networks like espn dealing with cord cutting and a moribund stock price iger has his work cut out for him disney s problems are vast and fixing them all may not be possible particularly in the two years that iger said he d dedicate to the company in his return to the c suite but if anyone can bring back the magic to the walt disney company the company believes bob iger may be uniquely qualified to do it streaming the first priority the streaming business disney s streaming service which includes espn hulu and most importantly disney had been the most vital part of the company s vast media kingdom it served as a life raft for disney in the early days of the pandemic one of the most tumultuous periods in the company s history and grew to 100 million subscribers in just 16 months now that business has become an anchor that s weighing it down the company reported earlier this month that disney exceeded wall street s expectations for subscriber growth but that came at a great cost for the company disney said its streaming business lost 1 5 billion in the quarter news that sent disney s stock tumbling the days of growing streaming at any cost are over for wall street and now iger and the rest of disney s leadership have to prove to investors that its streaming business can achieve profitability while also continuing to grow this more than anything else is what will move the needle on disney s stock which is down roughly 40 for the year he needs to refocus streaming as well as other parts of the company back to the core disney consumer trip miller a disney investor and managing partner at hedge fund gullane capital partners told cnn business this consumer is family friendly global and multi generational that s the beauty of disney right it s not just kids it s not just adults when it s working it can be everybody that refocusing effort is easier said than done especially considering that other parts of the company are not as solid as they used to be espn and movies disney s media networks are struggling as cord cutting accelerates and once lucrative outlets like espn lose viewership that has hurt disney s entire business this was a major point of contention for dan loeb the activist investor and third point ceo who made headlines in august when he suggested a strong case can be made that the espn business should be spun off to shareholders with an appropriate debt load loeb eventually had a change of heart but the point was made streaming is the new frontier for disney and iger needs to prove that it can make money while disney s legacy networks continue to shrink as for the company s studio entertainment when iger stepped down in early 2020 it came after a year in which disney had seven films make 1 billion each at the global box office compare that to this year which has had just two movies make 1 billion each at the global box office across all studios according to comscore that fall shows how much streaming and the pandemic severely disrupted the movie industry although recovering box office sales continue to underperform the year before the pandemic now disney is trying to figure how big releases from signature brands like pixar marvel and lucasfilm fit in a new theatrical ecosystem culture and image iger also has to correct the symbolic miscues that his successor and now predecessor bob chapek made during his run chapek did a good job overseeing the parks unit during a pandemic but once the covid restrictions were lifted the company raised prices and launched new initiatives such as the pricy genie system that sparked the ire of disney s deeply loyal guests many of whom felt they were being price gouged disney s delicate internal culture and brand also took some hits during chapek s tenure the ceo found himself dealing with a pay dispute involving scarlett johansson one of the studio s biggest stars that spilled into public view then there was disney s battles with florida politicians and its own employees regarding the state s controversial law restricting the discussion of certain lgbtq topics in classrooms that in particular was a flashpoint of chapek s stint at disney in march he was forced to apologize for his silence on the bill after initially declining to publicly comment on it ultimately disney s board moved on from those pr bumps and chapek s contract was renewed in july until 2025 yet the damage was arguably done to disney s brand disney s brand image is vital to its success portraying an aura of a magical family friendly cultural institution iger made his first moves as ceo on monday by reorganizing disney s content distribution structure the ceo said in a memo to employees that kareem daniel the chairman of disney s media and entertainment distribution unit will be leaving the company as for disney media and entertainment distribution iger notes in a memo to employees that without question elements of dmed will remain but i fundamentally believe that storytelling is what fuels this company and it belongs at the center of how we organize our businesses disney created the new media and entertainment distribution group in 2020 putting daniel who was formerly the president of disney s consumer products games and publishing division in charge that unit was in charge of monetizing content via distribution and ad sales the group also oversaw the operations of the company s streaming services like disney hulu and espn why iger can do it in the end the disney board decided to bring iger back because of his long track record of success that has earned him an almost mythical status as the only person who can lead the company in its statement reintroducing iger as ceo disney said he was uniquely situated to lead the company through this pivotal period iger was instrumental in forming the modern disney he oversaw the acquisition of major disney brands including pixar marvel and lucasfilm and he closed the 71 billion deal to buy most of 21st century fox he also kicked off the streaming revolution at the company with the creation of disney in november 2019 hollywood insiders viewed iger s previous ceo tenure as one of the greatest in hollywood history the mere fact that he s back at the helm helped calm investor s nerves shares jumped 6 higher monday psychologically him just being back is a boost to investors and the team at disney miller said with iger they know what to expect which is a focus on excellence and a love for the brand i doubt he s coming back for money at this point he s coming back for legacy and the company itself over the years iger s decision making and strategic positioning which ignored the street s often incorrect short term focus would ultimately separate disney from the media pack said michael nathanson a media analyst at moffettnathanson in a note to investors monday nathanson added that iger s communications skills and his ability to stay focused and honestly optimistic in the face of structural challenges provided a constant ballast in the roughest of media waters we believe investors will value the transparency and return disney some of its long lost magic with a stronger narrative driving the stock higher again he wrote but iger s past successes will not guarantee disney s future recovery hollywood is rapidly evolving and disney s problems are being felt industry wide with the media industry in turmoil disney hope iger is up to the tall task of righting its ship the cnn wire

investor alert list because it was not actively soliciting users in singapore in contrast to rival exchange binance the mas said there is a clear distinction between ftx and binance in terms of targeting local users according to a statement released monday afternoon binance in fact went to the extent of offering listings in singapore dollars and accepted singapore specific payment modes such as paynow and paylah it said in the statement adding that it had received numerous complaints about binance between january and august last year the mas went onto reiterate the risks that investors face when trading digital assets the most important lesson from the ftx debacle is that dealing in any cryptocurrency on any platform is hazardous it said adding even singapore licensed crypto exchanges would be regulated solely to address risks on money laundering and not to provide protection to investors as mas has repeatedly stated there is no protection for customers who deal in

from the 1990s to the late 2010s but some experts believe that s changing in today s rising interest rate environment what is value investing in simple terms value investing means buying stocks that you think are worth more than their current market price in other words value stocks are companies whose share prices are lower than they should be judging by fundamental financial metrics such as earnings per share some value investing strategies involve buying stocks that have fallen out of favor with investors in the hope that their strong fundamentals will propel a rebound in their share prices value stocks are often contrasted with growth stocks whose appeal is based on rapid increases in earnings or revenue generally value stocks have better fundamentals than growth stocks says michael chomiak an investment manager and financial advisor at access wealth in east hanover new jersey they re usually more mature businesses that pay steady dividends and that have free cash flow he says given its focus on consistent fundamentals and comeback stories value investing tends to be more long term oriented than growth investing buffett once wrote that our favorite holding period is forever chomiak agrees he says value stocks are more of a consistent grower over time than growth stocks how do you find value stocks value investors use a variety of metrics to identify bargain price stocks chomiak says that the price to earnings ratio or pe ratio is one of the most important a stock s pe ratio is its share price divided by its earnings per share over the last 12 months the higher the number the more expensive the would be he says chomiak says that value investors typically look for stocks with pe ratios below 14 which is a bit less than the s p 500 index s historical average pe ratio of 15 98 he says that positive free cash flow another measure of profitability is another good thing to look for when identifying value companies positive cash flows give them the opportunity to reinvest in the business to do buybacks and to increase dividends chomiak says other signals that value investors look for include low debt to equity ratios and high return on equity ratios all of these metrics can be found on an online broker s stock screener or on a website like yahoo finance do rising interest rates benefit value investors historical data suggests that value investing has been especially profitable when interest rates are high and they re currently on the rise the federal reserve has increased the federal funds rate six times so far this year this is a time for value stocks with interest rates rising the cost of capital becomes much more expensive chomiak says typically growth companies are borrowing at a much higher level than value companies chomiak says the value trade has certainly picked up a lot of steam and for good reason it s a safer place to be in volatile times he says on the other hand dartmouth college finance professor kenneth french said in an email interview that he s not sure if interest rates affect value investing returns in a 2020 paper french and university of chicago professor eugene fama compared the returns of value stocks with those of the market as a whole between july 1963 and june 2019 they found that value stocks had an advantage over the market in the first half of the study period 1963 to 1991 but this advantage disappeared in the second half 1991 to 2019 on average the federal reserve s benchmark interest rate was more than twice as high in the 1963 1991 period as in the 1991 2019 period the federal funds rate was also in a long term upward trend in the first period while it was in a long term downward trend in the second however french said that his research doesn t prove a relationship between these things we can t tell whether just happened by chance or there was a fundamental change in the economic environment he said should you start searching for value stocks whether or not you should invest in value stocks depends on your investing goals and how much time you have value investors are bargain hunters who use metrics like pe ratio and free cash flow to identify cheap stocks with long term potential this kind of investing often involves a lot of time consuming research it also usually means buying individual stocks which can be pricey some advisors think rising interest rates could give value stocks a boost and the relative performance of value stocks appears to be correlated with interest rates but researchers aren t sure there s a causal relationship between the two whether or not we re headed into a value investing renaissance beginner investors should note that it can take a lot of work and money to do the strategy right index funds may offer steadier returns with less maintenance and a lower upfront cost sam taube writes for nerdwallet email staube nerdwallet com twitter samuel_taube the article looking for stock bargains consider value investing originally

screenshot preserving records who does twitter reach twitter s account verification shake up screenshot government agencies that have become accustomed to using twitter as a communication tool have watched the platform undergo tumultuous changes under its new leadership the situation has been fast changing a move away from previous verification methods and the launch of twitter blue since put on hold raised impersonation and misinformation risks early staff resignations also reportedly saw the company s chief privacy officer ciso and chief compliance officer exit perthe flood of employees leaving late last week also included half the trust and safety policy team including a majority of those who work on spotting misinformation spam fake accounts and impersonation an employee told this doesn t necessarily mean an end to government use of the platform some agencies say they re taking a wait and see approach and adjusting their use of the social media platform as needed we re not considering leaving karina shagren communications director for washington state s military department toldon nov 18 it is still a valuable tool for us to use the military department had not yet discussed what factors would influence a decision to leave the platform shagren said with much still unknown staff are remaining flexible and will make changes as necessary twitter s verification changes prompted reaction from the department s emergency management division which posted a twitter thread giving users tips to help distinguish between accounts bearing blue checkmarks because they d been verified and those that have simply paid to display an identical icon john gonzalez communications manager of the northeast ohio regional sewer district neorsd a utility that has drawn a national following to its playful twitter feed said much remains to be seen right now besides the price for twitter blue verification most of the conversation around twitter s future is speculation gonzalez wrote in a nov 17 email our verified badge remains active visible and free as we ve had a verified since around 2016 as an official government public utility agency we continue to engage on twitter where appropriate and are always cautious of trends and related risks that come with any social media interaction agency accounts have also pointed followers to their other social media channels neorsd tweeted about its social media hub sewer social and raised attention to its new account on mastodon a decentralized social media platform that some see as a twitter alternative we have and will continue to explore other venues as the social media landscape evolves so we have a presence where it aligns with our mission our values and the needs of our customers gonzalez said in the email agencies content to remain on twitter may still need to prepare against the possibility that the site loses functionality an unnamed twitter employee told thelast week that the outflux of employeesis leading to a growing number of breakages in twitter services if you want to export your tweets do it now the employee said the washington emergency management division said in a nov 17 tweet that it was doing just that downloading our twitter archive today because really not sure what s going to happen tomorrow much less next month on this platform the account tweeted governments may be obligated to take such action while each of the 50 united states has specific and unique laws on public records social media is considered public record in every state archivesocial a social media archiving software provider states online accurate recordkeeping for compliance includes preserving posts meta data comments even if edited or deleted and original content exactly as it happened across all of your social media platforms and website pages a social media platform s value is its user base although this too is in flux as users decide whether to stay with the site a 2021 pew research survey found that the percentage of adults who said they ever use twitter skews young with 42 percent of 18 to 29 year olds and 37 percent of 30 to 49 year olds having experienced the platform compared to smaller shares of older demographics a quarter of men and slightly more than a fifth of women said they had ever used the platform meanwhile a slightly greater share of adults identifying as black only 29 percent had used it compared to 22 percent who identified as white only and 23 percent who identified as hispanic those who used the platform for news rather than just for entertainment or other purposes were more likely to be democrats college educated and relatively young pew found only 8 percent of those who used twitter as a source of news said it was their most important way of keeping up with news but 63 percent of twitter news consumers said they sometimes or often encountered stories on the site that they wouldn t have come across elsewhere and about 70 percent said they used twitter to follow live news events twitter has traditionally displayed blue checkmarks on accounts where users passed a verification process and the company had confirmed the accounts to be authentic notable and active on nov 9 users lost the ability to apply for verification but anyone who d already completed the process retained their blue checkmarks the icons were then only newly awarded to people who purchased them through a 7 99 month subscription service called twitter blue this has led to confusion in distinguishing between verified accounts and those belonging to twitter blue subscribers who are posing under someone else s name because both will display blue checkmarks there is a reality now that someone could buy a blue checkmark and then they could suddenly say they are a government agency telling you to evacuate for instance the washington emergency management division tweeted so even a blue checkmark might not mean what it used to mean you might want to take other steps to confirm the author columnist with sen ed markey s permission created a twitter blue account impersonating the senator in a few minutes another well publicized example saw insulin maker eli lilly s stocks drop following a tweet from a twitter blue account masquerading as the company the washington emergency management division advised users to vet accounts for themselves by checking that they link to official websites and googling for the entities names plus twitter which is likely to turn up the real twitter account the division also recommended checking the account s age the older the more likely it s real and its followers governments often follow each other as fake accounts proliferated twitter explored offering a separate gray official label for use on twitter accounts verified as belonging to government some political organizations companies media outlets and some others the company has fluctuated canceled and then relaunched the label and politico reported that as of nov 13 it was inconsistently applied to some but not all federal government accounts

carefully before investing principal risk factors risks are inherent in all investing certain risks that may be applicable to a fund are identified below but not all of the material risks relevant to each fund are included below and not all of the risks below apply to each fund the material risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus statement of additional information and other regulatory filings the order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor past performance is no assurance of future results investment return and market value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost a fund s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a fund s investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings securities held by a fund as well as shares of a fund itself are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions political events regulatory or market developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations in addition local regional or global events such as war acts of terrorism spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues recessions or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments such events may affect certain geographic regions countries sectors and industries more significantly than others in february 2022 russia invaded ukraine which has caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in russia europe and the united states the hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities could have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance the covid 19 global pandemic and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets while the u s has resumed reasonably normal business activity many countries continue to impose lockdown measures additionally there is no guarantee that vaccines will be effective against emerging variants of the disease an index etf seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index you should anticipate that the value of an index fund s shares will decline more or less in correlation with any decline in the value of the index an index fund s return may not match the return of the index unlike a fund the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a fund investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants in very large creation redemption units if the fund s authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to the fund s net asset value and possibly face delisting one of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value an actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a fund s investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or sub advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result a fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in a fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically certain funds may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies an investment in a fund containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries a fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative and there is a heightened risk of investing in emerging markets securities financial and other reporting by companies and government entities also may be less reliable in emerging market countries shareholder claims that are available in the u s as well as regulatory oversight and authority that is common in the u s including for claims based on fraud may be difficult or impossible for shareholders of securities in emerging market countries or for u s authorities to pursue investments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and or interest when due in times of economic uncertainty the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations preferred securities high yield securities corporate bonds government bonds municipal bonds and senior loans are subject to credit risk call risk income risk interest rate risk inflation risk and prepayment risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floating rate loans and high yield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher yielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a fund s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a fund s income senior floating rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations and or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities the senior loan market has seen an increase in loans with weaker lender protections which may impact recovery values and or trading levels in the future the absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates this may hinder the fund s ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce the fund s ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss as a result the fund s exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions to the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the london interbank offered rate libor as a reference interest rate it is subject to libor risk the united kingdom s financial conduct authority which regulates libor has ceased making libor available as a reference rate over a phase out period that began december 31 2021 there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate including the secured overnight financing rate sofr will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as libor or that instruments using an alternative rate will have the same volume or liquidity the unavailability or replacement of libor may affect the value liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades any potential effects of the transition away from libor on the fund or on certain instruments in which the fund invests can be difficult to ascertain and they may vary depending on a variety of factors and they could result in losses to the fund in the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or principal payments on a senior loan held by the fund the fund will experience a reduction in its income and a decline in the value of the senior loan which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value of the fund s common shares if the fund acquires a senior loan from another lender for example by acquiring a participation the fund may also be subject to credit risks with respect to that lender although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral the value of the collateral may not equal the fund s investment when the senior loan is acquired or may decline below the principal amount of the senior loan subsequent to the fund s investment also to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates the fund bears the risk that the stock may decline in value be relatively illiquid and or may lose all or substantially all of its value causing the senior loan to be under collateralized therefore the liquidation of the collateral underlying a senior loan may not satisfy the issuer s obligation to the fund in the event of non payment of scheduled interest or principal and the collateral may not be readily liquidated income from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer convertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and as a result are exposed to certain additional risks the values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments each with its own market value a fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives exchange traded notes etns are senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees the value of an etn may be influenced by various factors real estate investment trusts reits and real estate operating companies reocs are subject to certain risks including changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recession master limited partnerships mlps are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments in addition there is the risk that a mlp could be taxed as a corporation resulting in decreased returns from such mlp the use of futures options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when a fund s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a fund s return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by a fund a fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than in kind securities as a result an investment in a fund may be less tax efficient than an investment in an exchange traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in kind securities a fund s investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements alternative investments may employ complex strategies have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be appropriate for all investors certain funds may invest in other investment companies including closed end funds cefs etfs and affiliated etfs which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds in addition a fund s investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds a fund may invest in u s government obligations u s treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and u s government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government income from the first trust managed municipal etf fmb the first trust california municipal high income etf fcal the first trust municipal high income etf fmhi the first trust short duration managed municipal etf fsmb and the first trust ultra short duration municipal etf fumb may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax fmb fcal fmhi fsmb and fumb may invest in zero coupon bonds which may be highly volatile as interest rates rise and fall fcal invests principally in municipal debt securities from issuers located in california such concentration exposes the fund to political fiscal and economic conditions affecting california municipal issuers and may affect the value of the fund s investments short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns in times of unusual or adverse market economic regulatory or political conditions a fund may not be able fully or partially to implement its short selling strategy certain funds may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the fund or at prices approximately the value at which the fund is carrying the securities on its books certain funds are classified as non diversified and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers as a result the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers each fund is subject to risks arising from various operational factors including but not limited to human error processing and communication errors errors of a fund s service providers counterparties or other third parties failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures although the funds and the advisor

rubenstein s new book features interviews with 23 great u s based investors including rubenstein 13 are billionaires by forbes estimation the washington post via getty images in david rubenstein s new book how to invest masters on the craft simon schuster 2022 he openly admits in its introduction that he doesn t consider himself a great investor rubenstein is an attorney who spent time in the carter white house and started his washington d c based private equity firm in 1987 after he decided to give up law for something more lucrative despite his modesty rubenstein in a private equity titan who has amassed a net worth of more than 3 billion largely because his buyout firm which manages 375 billion in assets has had a lot more winning investments than losers carlyle s gross internal rate of return before fees has averaged 26 per year for more than 30 years rubenstein s book features his interviews with 23 great u s based investors ranging from value stock savant seth klarman to hedge fund god ray dalio real estate star jon gray infrastructure investor adebayo ogunlesi and macro trader turned crypto hodler mike novogratz no fewer than 12 of them are billionaires by forbes reckoning including james simons a genius mathematician who gave up a career leading stony brook university s math department to pioneer quantitative investing on wall street for the past 30 years plus his medallion fund and its computer models have achieved net returns of 40 per annum and simons has a net worth of 28 billion while you shouldn t expect specific strategies on how to ferret out or evaluate great stocks or funds there is lots to be learned from the fascinating life and career journeys of these outstanding investors and the way they think about the world and markets in their pursuit of excess returns forbes why did you want to write this book given all the books out there devoted to investing david rubenstein i ve been in the investment world now for 35 years the other books i ve written haven t really been about investment people said to me why don t you do something about what you ve done in the last 35 years i wouldn t say i m a great investor but i ve been around the investment world second there was a book written many years ago that i read when i was younger called the money masters by john train originally published in 1980 the bestseller profiled nine great investors including warren buffett benjamin graham and john templeton it was a really good book about the famous investors of that era it wasn t an interview book but he did a pretty good job so i thought maybe something like that where you take the best investors and explain what they did i m not saying anybody s going to be a great investor by reading my book but it can give the average investor some ideas of what they shouldn t or should do and maybe inspire some young people going into investing i am also trying to say that investors are doing a useful service for our country if you allocate capital to moderna that s a good thing i was trying to say that investors are not just all greedy people making money they actually do useful things for society forbes given all the people you ve interviewed and the people in your book were there any in particular who impressed you the most in terms of their journey rubenstein a lot of them had journeys you couldn t predict jim simons for example was a world class mathematician but nobody thought he was an investor then he wound up in fact essentially inventing quantitative investing stan druckenmiller was going to be a forester or something like that and he winds up trying to get an economics ph d and he ultimately ends up as one of the best investors it s a great interview i really admire him there is a woman i interviewed who is now a chief investment officer at rockefeller university paula volent she was an art conservator and she went to business school to help her art conservation business and she wound up beating yale s david swenson a master in terms of rates of return for endowments so you just never can predict forbes are there any great investors you came across that you feel like had a really unorthodox approach rubenstein stan druckenmiller has a very interesting perspective he does macro he also does stocks and then he sometimes shorts things and sometimes goes long he kind of does whatever he likes or thinks is worth doing but then he likes to say i can change my mind the next day so he says i don t like to give advice to people because i can change my mind the next day and i don t want to have people think i told them something so he s a smart guy very introspective and very modest i think there s a fair amount of modesty in all these guys because they ve all made mistakes they ve all lost lots of money on deals and they get used to it being able to get over your mistakes pretty quickly is a sign of a good investor because otherwise if you linger on your mistakes you re never going to get anywhere forbes druckenmiller was the key investor for george soros rubenstein he was the guy behind it absolutely and that was when a billion dollars was a lot of money he broke the bank of england and made a billion dollars then of course john paulson also featured in the book made 20 billion you may remember the financial crisis that was in the 1990s that was the long term capital management it was going to fall apart the treasury didn t know what to do that loss was a billion dollars that s how much they were talking about today it seems trivial forbes are there any great investors who you wish you could have included in the book rubenstein there were five other people i couldn t put into the book because of the page limitations they are in the audio version of the book one of them is bill ackman who s a very good investor i did an interview but i didn t put it in the book because i decided to make it only american investors another is neil shen the guy who built sequoia china into the greatest venture capital operation in china he is just as spectacular forbes what are the attributes and the skills you found common in these great investors rubenstein here s what the great ones have in common they came from blue collar middle class families they re pretty well educated they re not high school dropouts they have a pretty good facility for math they have enormous intellectual curiosity they really love to read as much as they can even if it s not about the area that they re investing in they are sponges for information they like to make the final decision they don t want to delegate the decision and when they make a bad decision they own up to it and get onto the next thing they are also fairly philanthropic obviously not everybody who works in the investment world is rich because some people work in endowments but if you re in the business of making a lot of money and you do make a lot of money they do tend to give away the bulk of it they also have a fair amount of humility to them obviously there are always some arrogant people but humble people are people that have made mistakes and these guys have all made mistakes they recognize it forbes if you had to pick from among the types of the investment styles that you profile in the book which would you favor rubenstein the safest are going to be value investors because value investors are not going to take highflyers but i d say if i could invest in any of these guys in the book i think they re all good look what sequoia has done in revolutionizing the venture world it s just phenomenal and stan druckenmiller s numbers are not known now but he s a spectacular person if he took new money he d be great to give money to even ron baron who does mutual funds which obviously the super cognoscenti of the investment world don t look favorably on mutual funds but he s done pretty well for his investors forbes at carlyle what have been your best investments and what lessons did you learn rubenstein we did an investment in china years ago china pacific life which was a company that was almost bankrupt it was a life insurance company and we teamed up with some local partners and we turned it around revolutionized the way they did things and we made a very large return we recently did a deal called zoom info which is not zoom it s a different kind of company and we made a very large sum on that people told us not to do it they said this zoom info was not going to get anywhere or china pacific life was not going to get anywhere you have to be very skeptical of people who tell you not to do this or not to do that you really have to examine it because again as i said in the book defying conventional wisdom is what makes great investors you have to go against the grain and that s what we ve done sometimes at carlyle forbes is there an investment that you can recall rubenstein plenty of them we have a company called carlyle capital which was more or less a bond fund and we levered up ginnie maes and fannie maes but when the great recession came the banks wouldn t let you borrow against those securities that much yet and the government hadn t yet guaranteed them so it went under the lesson was that just because somebody will lend 98 cents on the dollar doesn t mean you should take it in those days you could get repo loans that refinance every day basically you could borrow 98 cents against government securities but then at some point when the banks come along and say we re nervous about these securities we re going to lend 90 cents on the dollar then you have some challenges forbes do you think the market is more risky now than it was when you started rubenstein i don t know if the market is riskier but i d say the markets are always getting more sophisticated the trick we have right now is we don t really know if there s going to be a recession and how deep it s going to be i wouldn t say it s riskier but i d say the stakes can be higher because people put more money at risk than they used to in other words the amount of money you can put to work out there because the funds are so much bigger is considerable so the old days you might put in a smaller amount of money today the amount of money that s available is just staggering forbes do you have any comments on meme stock trading rubenstein what i say in my book is make sure you know what you re doing read a lot of the people that were doing some of these stocks were young people who really hadn t read anything they were just following a trend and i think they weren t as well informed as they probably should have been the trick of being a good investor is to read and know what you re doing and a lot of times people just got in the markets and didn t know what they were doing they borrowed more money than they could afford in any era there are always going to be people who try to get rich quickly and it doesn t happen forbes what do you hope investors will take away from reading your book rubenstein here s what i hope if you are a young person and you re thinking about a career in investing i hope you ll be inspired by the great investors and think maybe while i can t be jim simons i might be pretty good at this if i do the things that i need to do get educated work hard and so forth for the average investor who has 100 000 200 000 to put out i hope they ll say i should probably go into a fund and not try to do stock picking myself and then i list in the book things you should look for in a fund such as track record for people saying no i have enough money to pick stocks and i really want to put some time into it i put some cautionary tales in there about what you really need to do the most important thing is to read know what you re getting into and don t think you re a genius because you re good at making widgets just be realistic in your rate of return expectations the most important thing to recognize is that the biggest mistake people make is they sell when markets are going down and they buy when the markets are going up markets are going down now they may go down a little bit more but probably we re close to the bottom i think it s probably a pretty good time to buy things that have reasonable business prospects and certainly if you re interested in yield the yields are going to be really high from dividend stocks now forbes thanks david excerpted from october issue of forbes billionaire investor where you can invest alongside the world s smartest billionaire investors
composite image with background stock image by prathaan istock getty images plus overlay stock photo by st george news st george a local man is in jail facing multiple charges following a domestic related incident that escalated to a wide scale search by ground and air that ended in a tussle that left two officers injured shortly after 11 p m on saturday officers responded to a report of a family fight at a residence on west 540 north in st george involving a suspect austin james sharette 34 of st george sharette reportedly had a no bail warrant for violating a protective order as well as domestic violence charges previously filed in 5th district court according to a statement released by the st george police department on sunday shortly after officers arrived sharette reportedly got into a vehicle and struck a patrol unit multiple times before fleeing the scene the suspect s vehicle was abandoned minutes later and sharette fled from the area on foot meanwhile multiple police units were called in to assist along with a utah department of public safety helicopter that was deployed to the area to assist in the search a reverse 911 message was sent out to residents to shelter in place while officers canvassed the area in search of sharette the statement said but after three hours with no success the search was called off and a second reverse 911 message was transmitted for residents to remain vigilant officers later located sharette hiding near westridge drive and sunset boulevard after a brief foot pursuit and multiple taser deployments the officers and sharette got into a tussle sharette eventually was handcuffed and taken into custody by police and then transported to jail in washington county during the tussle two of the officers sustained minor injuries charging documents filed in 5th district court provided additional details as to how the events unfolded over the weekend several days prior on tuesday evening sharette was at a residence acting strangely in front of his two young children and after a brief altercation police were called and the suspect fled then on saturday emergency dispatch received a call shortly after 11 p m reporting that sharette was back at the residence which police allege was a violation of a protective order that had been issued out of salt lake city that prohibited sharette from being there multiple police units responded to the home and were advised the suspect was still hiding somewhere on the property during a search officers found the suspect in the rear cargo area of a subaru outback parked in the attached garage officers gave multiple orders to exit the vehicle commands the suspect appeared to be complying with initially the suspect reportedly crawled towards the front and put the key in the ignition to start the car before attempting to back out of the garage accelerating quickly all the while officers were ordering him to stop it is worth noting that the main door to the garage was not fully open when austin began backing up the officer noted the subaru struck the partially closed garage door and then struck a police patrol unit parked in the driveway of the residence the suspect repeated the steps two more times reportedly pulled forward and then put the car in reverse and hit the gas striking the patrol car as he maneuvered the subaru around the patrol unit and then fled from the area officers located the suspect s vehicle abandoned a few blocks away the large scale effort to locate the suspect was called off after the three hour search turned up nothing the following morning an officer called for assistance and when backup arrived the responding units found two officers actively fighting with sharette who was later taken into custody by police during the altercation the report states one of the officers sustained three kicks to the head while the suspect reportedly attempted to disarm two other officers of their tasers during the scuffle the suspect was transported to st george regional hospital for medical clearance before being transported to purgatory correctional facility where he faces multiple charges including five second degree felony counts of assault on a peace officer using a dangerous weapon and two counts of disarming a peace officer of energy device each a third degree felony he also faces two additional third degree felony charges for failing to stop at command of law enforcement the suspect was also booked into jail on nine misdemeanor charges that include two counts of failing to stop at command of law enforcement assault on a peace officer two counts of interring with an arresting officer one charge for property damage criminal mischief assault and two counts of domestic violence in the presence of a child charges a records check also revealed a no bail warrant issued out of 3rd district court in salt lake city that was filed in connection with a protective order violation following the arrest the st george police department issued that statement noting that during the three hour search a significant number of resources were deployed by diverting police units away from calls they were responding to in order to search for sharette the statement closed by saying we appreciate the teamwork from the surrounding agencies and the support from the citizens of our community this report is based on statements from court records police or other responders and may not contain the full scope of findings persons arrested or charged are presumed innocent until found guilty in a court of law or as

information have yet to be confirmed and reiterated the financial risks that investors of u s listed chinese companies face they own a stock that has a claim to a cayman islands subsidiary that has no voting rights and no access to assets in the event of a bankruptcy he told cnbc s street signs asia when asked if chinese stocks in the u s were investable chinese companies listed overseas such as alibaba and jd com use a variable interest entity structure in which an offshore entity is set up bypassing chinese restrictions on foreign investment and preventing investors in the u s stock from having majority voting rights the u s listed firm is commonly a holding company formed outside both the u s and china and may not own stock in the china based company investors really are just playing fantasy football with the chinese companies because they actually don t own anything he said jihye lee shares of indonesia s goto fall 6 after company reports nine month losses indonesia s goto group

authorities explain why ftx wasn t on its alert list the monetary authority of singapore mas said embattled cryptocurrency exchange ftx was not on its investor alert list because it was not actively soliciting users in singapore in contrast to rival exchange binance the mas said there is a clear distinction between ftx and binance in terms of targeting local users according to a statement released monday afternoon binance in fact went to the extent of offering listings in singapore dollars and accepted singapore specific payment modes such as paynow and paylah it said in the statement adding that it had received numerous complaints about binance between january and august last year the mas went onto reiterate the risks that investors face when trading digital assets the most important lesson from the ftx debacle is that dealing in any cryptocurrency on any platform is hazardous it said adding even singapore licensed crypto exchanges would be regulated solely to address risks on money laundering and not to provide protection to investors as mas has repeatedly stated there is no protection for customers who deal in cryptocurrencies they can lose all their money it

australia rba governor philip lowe prepares to deliver what economists pundits and punters alike might consider to be his most anticipated address prior to 6 december s cash rate announcement tuesday s 22 november dinner host ceda has unequivocally outlined its vision as to what needs to be done for the australian economy the committee of economic development of australia ceda an independent membership based think tank has called for a boost in labour force skills recognition tackling housing to lift economic productivity and to fix skill shortages according to ceda overhauling occupational licensing in australia and letting home owners renters and social housing tenants move more easily for work can deliver tens of billions of dollars in productivity gains the organisation has found australia s rigid occupational licensing and restrictive housing market are a handbrake on more australians moving for jobs suited to their skills ceda chief executive melinda cilento said at a time when we need to be addressing skills shortages and lifting lacklustre productivity to drive a stronger economy and wages australia must break down entrenched barriers in the jobs market major structural shifts including digital transformation the energy transition and an ageing population will require a much more agile labour market 5 billion per year from licensing reform in a submission to the federal government s employment white paper ceda found that occupational licensing is widespread in australia with around one in five people in jobs with registration requirements ceda analysis of the oecd s indicator of occupational entry regulations showed that the level of licensing on personal services in nsw and queensland is among the top five most restrictive of 21 oecd nations including the us the uk canada and europe australia could gain up to 5 billion each year from reform to match the best performing countries in this area going beyond recent reform efforts focused on mutual recognition it highlighted unlocking the full scale of benefits would involve removing mobility restrictions across all occupations and matching sweden by removing licensing of personal services such as taxi drivers driving instructors and building trades such as electricians plumbers and painters this would also lower consumer prices land tax outweighing stamp duty use now ceda explained that housing is another drag on the labour market and interestingly that australians spend a relatively high share of income on housing heightening its importance when choosing where to work compared with other developed countries australians regularly move home but they rarely do so for work ms cilento said in stark contrast to the united states australian renters are more likely to be forced to move by their landlord than choose to move for work better housing affordability lower transaction costs especially by replacing stamp duty with a land tax and making renting a more viable long term option can deliver tens of billions of dollars in productivity gains via better matching of skills to jobs build to rent not to sell notably ceda also highlighted that institutional investors also play a relatively small role in the australian market with the largest holding just a few thousand units it suggested removing barriers to institutional housing investment such as land tax arrangements negative gearing and foreign investment rules could help by reducing eviction due to the landlord s personal situation it explained one way to do this is via build to rent where the developer maintains ownership of dwellings and rents them out after completion australia must not squander the ideas and opportunities generated at the national jobs and skills summit earlier this year ms cilento said we must pull every available lever to help employers find the best workers and skills for each job could housing affordability be the key as ceda underscored organisation for economic co operation and development oecd estimates showed increasing the responsiveness of housing supply could boost australia s productivity by as much as two per cent by reducing the level of skills mismatch in the jobs market additionally reducing development approval timeframes and transaction costs such as stamp duty could boost productivity by around an additional one per cent each it stated in that context ceda maked six recommendations to make it easier for people to move to a job that better matches their skills these are review planning and zoning rules around the country to reduce obstacles to higher density in areas with good access to jobs and transport federal and state governments should work together to phase out stamp duties and shift to land taxes the federal government should provide revenue support during the transition it explained first home buyer grants should be phased out it recommended improve protections for renters to make their tenure more secure including banning no grounds evictions and restricting rent increases for existing tenants in line with local market changes review land tax negative gearing and foreign investment rules to reduce barriers to institutional investment in rental housing increase the generosity of commonwealth rent assistance payments to at least match recent rent price increases while reforming eligibility rules to better reflect housing need continue to increase social housing supply while trialling portable rent assistance for social housing tenants and better match housing stock to need by reducing the average unit size
in a nov 9 facebook post linn county sheriff michelle duncan said measure 114 which 50 7 of voters approved the day before is a terrible law for gun owners crime victims and public safety the measure would require a permit to buy a firearm and ban magazines holding more than 10 rounds i want to send a clear message to linn county residents that the linn county sheriff s office is not going to be enforcing magazine capacity limits duncan wrote in the post which as of friday had been shared 12 000 times and garnered 9 300 comments duncan was soon joined by jefferson county sheriff jason pollock wallowa county sheriff joel fish and union county sheriff cody bowen who also said they would not enforce the new laws pollock said he believes the provisions in measure 114 run contrary to previously decided judicial decisions bowen said the law would also be a drain on resources and called it another attempt at defunding the police at its finest to the people who chime in with me picking and choosing which laws i want to enforce or not enforce hear this bowen exclaimed in his facebook post when it comes to our constitutional rights i ll fight to the death to defend them no matter what crazy law comes out of salem sheriffs point to short staffs measure 114 was passed by voters not state lawmakers in salem sheriffs are not lawyers and do not interpret the constitution that is the role of judges bowen and pollock as well as the oregon state sheriffs association did not respond to interview requests duncan said her agency constantly has to manage scarce resources she said that because a federal court might find magazine bans unconstitutional as early as this spring she is choosing not to prioritize enforcement i have a hard time saying that we re going to use resources to go arrest people for something that has a high probability of being found unconstitutional very shortly duncan said in an interview with opb this is where i m choosing to hold back my resources until that ruling is confirmed or denied duncan said if the supreme court rules the law is constitutional she may have to rethink her position several other sheriffs said they thought the law was poorly written and expressed hope it would be blocked by the courts but stopped short of saying they would not enforce the provisions marion county sheriff joe kast said he anticipated the new law would add significant strain on limited resources and he would not focus investigations on magazine capacity issues the position of some oregon sheriffs appears to put them at odds with the oregon state sheriffs association which said in a statement the law s constitutionality will be decided by the courts any legal challenge could potentially result in the measure being stayed suspended or a delayed implementation by a court but that is not a certainty the association said while this is a huge undertaking for oregon law enforcement which is already under resourced ossa will work diligently to implement this complex measure fringe influence the law requires a safety course and a permit to purchase a firearm the state has not yet hashed out how the permit system will be administered but it is possible it will be similar to the current concealed carry permitting process which is administered by sheriff s offices such an arrangement would likely add to their workload other aspects of the law would have less impact on sheriffs when the law goes into effect on dec 8 licensed firearms dealers will be prohibited from selling the magazines or be subject to a class a misdemeanor and risk losing their federal firearms license stores have a 180 day grace period when they can transfer or sell their stock to someone out of state individuals will also be barred from selling or giving away banned magazines bradley w parks opb a member of the three percent of oregon militia group watches testimony on senate bill 978 in the capitol in salem ore tuesday april 2 2019 state gun law violations can be investigated by any local or state law enforcement agency but it would violate a person s civil rights if deputies went door to door searching for high capacity magazines as some gun rights advocates have suggested might happen banned items or substances are more commonly policed in instances where officers find the item while investigating some other issue for example during a traffic stop deputies might discover a contraband magazine duncan s claim that her deputies won t enforce the law in such a situation rings hollow with some experts if you pull over a car and the person has a record you re telling me that her office is not going to arrest that person particularly if that person is a person of color or poor or has a pretty long record said jessica pishko a new america fellow writing a book about sheriffs that s one where i m like you can t be serious duncan said if her deputies arrest someone who also has a high capacity magazine it s up to the district attorney to decide if they will press charges but if i have someone who is not a felon or i m not arresting for anything else i m not going to be arresting them for possession of a magazine or do an investigation into the possession of the magazine whether it s lawful or not she said sheriffs like other elected politicians are beholden to voters and duncan said her office has been inundated with messages from concerned constituents measure 114 passed by a thin margin largely carried by broad support in the state s more liberal populous counties voters in 29 of oregon s 36 counties voted against it in more rural parts of the state like linn and union counties the vote was more than 2 to 1 against pishko said sheriffs who make sweeping statements about refusing to enforce gun laws when they haven t been asked to do so are also likely being influenced by the fringe constitutional sheriff movement founded in 2011 by former oath keepers militia board member richard mack mack s organization adheres to the false belief that the sheriff is the most powerful law enforcement officer in the country the president of the united states cannot tell your sheriff what to do he falsely claimed in an interview with the oath keepers a far right militia group whose top members have been charged with seditious conspiracy for their involvement in the jan 6 insurrection that contradicts the constitution s supremacy clause which says federal law trumps state law similarly thanks to a national rifle association lobbying campaign to prevent more liberal cities from passing strict gun laws oregon has what s known as a firearm preemption law meaning state gun laws supersede any city and county laws further complicating constitutional sheriff ideology the county state relationship is far less rigid than the state federal relationship counties are entirely a construct of states portland state university political science professor chris shortell explained to opb in a 2019 interview for a story about oregon sheriffs and extremist ideology states create them states could eliminate them states can redraw their boundaries and as such they are treated as simply a part of the state this is not the first time oregon sheriffs have flirted with extremist ideas eight oregon sheriffs sent a letter to the obama administration in 2013 saying they refused to enforce any new federal gun laws that campaign was led by one of duncan s predecessors then linn county sheriff tim mueller similar ideas were floated by sheriffs refusing to enforce oregon gov kate brown s covid restrictions like these most recent refusals to enforce the high capacity magazine ban sheriffs were not being asked to enforce covid restrictions in 2020 the courts weigh in in 2018 eight counties passed so called second amendment preservation ordinances giving county sheriffs authority to determine if state and federal gun laws are constitutional and barring county resources from being used to enforce them columbia county passed an ordinance claiming to nullify state and federal gun laws those ordinances have not fared well in court harney county withdrew its ordinance after the oregon department of justice petitioned a court to invalidate the law in that petition oregon attorney general ellen rosenblum cited a state law requiring sheriffs to arrest and imprison all persons who break the peace or attempt to break it and all persons guilty of public offenses thus a sheriff and deputies have a statutory duty to enforce state criminal laws rosenblum wrote yamhill county defended its ordinance but county circuit court judge ladd wiles ruled with the state in july and invalidated the ordinance the county appealed the decision and if the appellate court rules with the state it will apply to every county nullifying all similar ordinances on at least one issue a legal challenge to oregon s measure 114 might succeed after the u s supreme court ruled this summer that americans have a right to carry a firearm outside their home the court also ordered the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit to revisit a ruling upholding california s high capacity magazine ban the california ban as well as a similar law in washington state remains in effect while the court deliberates given the supreme court s position speculation is running high that the laws will be thrown out a federal court might get a chance to weigh in sooner on friday the oregon firearms federation sherman county sheriff brad lohrey and a marion county gun store owner filed a federal lawsuit against gov kate brown and rosenblum the lawsuit alleges measure 114 infringes on oregonians second amendment rights and asks a judge to toss the law or at a minimum issue an injunction preventing the provisions from being enacted alternatively the lawsuit asked a judge to separate the magazine ban and rule on only that portion of the law the confusion has led to stratospheric firearms sales in the state and an even bigger background check backlog than usual the oregon state police said wednesday the daily average of firearms background checks had quadrupled and several gun stores in multnomah county have temporarily halted some services anticipating gridlock come december if a person buys a firearm from an out of state dealer the firearm must be shipped to a licensed dealer in oregon who conducts the background check and transfers the firearm to the purchaser with the growing backlog several dealers stopped accepting transfers from out of state fearing the checks won t be completed by dec 8 and the transfer could then potentially violate the new state law despite the uncertainty some oregon sheriffs have taken a more measured tone lincoln county sheriff curtis landers pushed back wednesday against the idea he or his colleagues could interpret the constitution landers said in a statement that although he doesn t agree with the new law his office will enforce it i have sworn an oath to uphold the laws of this state regardless of my opinion landers wrote adding that that doesn t mean deputies will be going door to door searching for magazines however if we learn you have violated the law we may take action just like we are responsible for doing for any other crime copyright 2022 oregon public broadcasting
last updated 21 nov 2022 for the first time since records began london is no longer the most valuable stock market in europe when you put it like that the situation sounds ominous adding to the gloom swirling around uk plc in the wake of the autumn statement by bloomberg s calculations the combined value of shares on the uk stock market is around 2 405trn whereas the paris market is worth around 2 413trn it is a small lead and french stocks have been boosted by short term factors favourable currency movements the strength of luxury goods giants lvmh and hermes and the meteoric rise and fall of trussonomics but the shift feels significant especially when you factor in that bit about since records began let s deal with that first bloomberg only began keeping records in 2003 so this statement really only covers a business cycle or two that said some analysts believe this is no temporary eclipse as matthew lynn lamented in the spectator global investors fund managers and the brokers and bankers that service them go where the money is and right now there s more of it in paris than in london one reason for that is the phenomenal performance of bernard arnault s lvmh the most valuable business on the bourse which lynn describes as the apple of europe a company that keeps generating more and more profit regardless of what else is happening in the world selling luxury goods to china s wealthy elite certainly looks like a better growth prospect than oil and gas the core business of shell the most valuable company on the london stock exchange it doesn t help that many vibrant new british businesses notably fashion platform farfetch and private club soho house have chosen to list in new york not london lynn blames this on over regulation fussy governance codes pushing up the costs of a listing and comparatively high corporate tax he has a point private equity group allied minds will leave the lse at the end of november citing prohibitively big costs for its listing even so calculating the comparative expense of listings on different exchanges is as academics manuela geranio and valter lazzari have shown exceptionally complex their research suggests it may well be the added prestige of an nyse listing rather than the cost of one on the lse that attracts british businesses lynn welcomed britain s departure from the european union which he regards as bureaucratic undemocratic and intent on regulating wealth creators to death it may be no coincidence then that the one word that doesn t feature in his analysis of the lse s troubles is brexit yet when the referendum was held in 2016 the value of london s shares were 1 1bn higher than paris correlation does not necessarily signify causation but michael saunders a former policy adviser to the bank of england insists the british economy has been permanently damaged by brexit causing lower output growth and constraining business investment the outcome of the referendum and the continued failure to fully define the financial agreement between the eu and uk has some estimates suggest prompted 5 000 finance staff to move from london to paris the french government has also instituted several measures over the past six years to attract financial institutions a combination of the above factors help explain why in the first half of this year london s share of new listings in europe was around 11 that was a relatively poor performance in a flat market the middle east and africa have raised 50 more capital with new listings than europe this year given that the british and french have spent as the title of stephen clarke s bestseller put it 1 000 years annoying each other paris sudden pre eminence as a financial market is bound to hurt yet the greatest threat to the london stock exchange may come not from the other side of the channel but from the other side of the pond nyse and nasdaq are doing so many more deals and raising so much more money the financial conduct authority has felt obliged to ride to the rescue with sweeping reforms of the lse

accounting policies principles of consolidation the accompanying financial include the accounts of 808 renewable energy corporation its fifty five 55 percent owned subsidiary sla llc and its fifty one 51 percent owned subsidiary slev all intercompany balances have been eliminated during consolidation use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates include the fair value of assets and liabilities income taxes and the valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets and contingencies revenue recognition the company follows the provisions of accounting standards update asu no 2014 09 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 using the full retrospective transition method the company s adoption of asu 2014 09 did not have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in its consolidated financial statements under asu 2014 09 the company recognizes revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services 10 table of contents the company derives its revenues from the sale of gyroplane kits to the general public the company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its contracts 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied impairment of long lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets as set forth in topic 360 of the accounting standards codification the asc the company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets when events occur that indicate an impairment in value may exist an impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets if this occurs an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets other comprehensive loss the company has no material components of other comprehensive loss and accordingly net loss is equal to comprehensive loss for the period income taxes the company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the accounting bases and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities the deferred tax assets are computed using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse the company s deferred income taxes include certain future tax benefits the company records a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when it believes based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized the company has adopted asc guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes this guidance clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an income tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements and applies to all income tax positions each income tax position is assessed using a two step process a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the income tax position will be sustained based upon technical merits upon examination by the taxing authorities if the income tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria the benefit recorded in the consolidated financial statements equals the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon its ultimate settlement at september 30 2022 and december 31 2021 there were no uncertain tax positions that required accrual business combination the company accounts for acquisitions in accordance with guidance found in asc 805 business combinations the guidance requires consideration given including contingent consideration assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be valued at their fair values at the date of acquisition the guidance further provides that acquisition costs will generally be expenses as incurred and changes in deferred tax asset valuations and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 11 table of contents asc 805 requires that any excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired including identifiable intangibles and liabilities assumed be recognized as goodwill and any excess of fair value of acquired net assets including identifiable intangible assets over the acquisition consideration results in a gain from bargain purchase prior to recording a gain the acquiring entity must reassess whether assets acquired and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and perform re measurements to verify that the consideration paid assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been properly valued goodwill in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles goodwill cannot be amortized however it must be tested annually for impairment this impairment test is calculated at the reporting unit level the goodwill impairment test has two steps the first identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount goodwill is not impaired and the second step is not necessary if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount if the implied goodwill is less than the carrying amount a write down is recorded management tested goodwill at the date of acquisition for impairment to indicate if impairment occurred see note 3 fair value measurement loss per share basic net loss per common share of stock is calculated by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding including the effect of other dilutive securities the company s had no potentially dilutive securities issued as of and during the nine and twelve months ended september 30 2022 and december 31 2021 off balance sheet arrangements as part of its ongoing business the company has not participated in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes for the period through september 30 2022 the company has not been involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions subsequent events the company evaluates events and transactions after the balance sheet date but before the consolidated financial statements are issued note 3 fair value measurements the company applies the authoritative guidance applicable to all financial assets and liabilities required to be measured and reported on a fair value basis as well as to non financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non recurring basis including impairments of long lived assets the fair value of an asset or liability is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company unobservable input are inputs that reflect the company s assumptions of what market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability based on the information available in the circumstances 12 table of contents financial and non financial assets and liabilities are classified within the valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the company s policy is to recognize transfers in and out of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period in which the event or change in circumstances caused the transfer the company has consistently applied the valuation techniques discussed below in all periods presented the hierarchy is organized into three levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities or level 2 quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and model derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable or level 3 unobservable pricing inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions note 4 significant acquisition effective march 15 2021 the company acquired fifty five 55 of the membership interests of sla llc sla llc is a florida

dependent on the company s ability to achieve profitable operations should we not be able to fulfill our cash needs through the increase of revenue we will need to raise money through outside investors through convertible notes debt or similar instrument s including but not limited to the current outstanding convertible notes the company has no committed external source of funds and there

latest faa pilot production data confirms supply continues to outpace demand the air line pilots association int l alpa has released new data from the faa that reportedly demonstrates that the united states is producing a record number of certificated airline pilots this year with more pilots in the market today than there are jobs available according to the faa 9 397 new commercial airline pilot certificates have been issued in the last 12 months exceeding airline analyst forecasts and airline pilot demand in addition the u s has roughly 10 percent more flight instructors than before the pandemic which will allow for increased pilot production in the future this is good news that everyone in our industry should be celebrating said capt joe depete alpa president the decision to invest in america s aviation workforce made in the darkest days of the pandemic continues to pay off with record pilot production numbers unfortunately special interest groups in washington d c continue to spread misinformation about the pilot ecosystem in an effort to weaken air safety standards and shortchange frontline workers the truth is airlines are making money hand over fist flying fewer hours and have more pilots than before the pandemic despite the ongoing strong growth in the number of pilots available in the united states some special interest groups continue to spread misinformation blaming profit driven service cuts on a lack of available pilots their real goal is to weaken proven pilot training safety standards so they can hire less qualified aviators for lower pay and benefits airlines cut or modify service to small less profitable communities while adding additional service to markets that are more profitable it has nothing to do with pilot supply or safety regulations pilots don t make corporate business decisions about what cities to serve it s the airlines that make those choices and it s all based on profitability and their bottom line added depete pilots are trained for life to get passengers to their destinations safely and we are as frustrated as the flying public at the airlines service cuts flight delays and cancellations and fatiguing schedules rather than trying to pass the buck and blame workers airline ceos should commit to forgoing stock buybacks and own up to their service shortcomings the most recent faa data continues to support that the united states is producing more than enough certificated commercial airline pilots to meet or exceed airline hiring demand and compensate for retirements over the past decade even as new and more rigorous pilot training standards were enacted to enhance safety
these stocks should gush profits in 2023 and beyond oil stocks have taken a victory lap throughout 2022 surging commodity prices are bolstering profits at a time when many companies are getting hit with inflation and softening demand exxonmobil xom 0 83 enbridge enb 2 31 and diamondback energy fang 0 68 each not only pay a dividend but have beaten the s p 500 over the past year fortunately for investors these stocks also seem poised for another solid year in 2023 here is why each company can be added to a diversified dividend portfolio with confidence 1 the case for exxonmobil exxonmobil is one of the world s largest oil and gas companies making 386 billion in revenue over the past four quarters the energy giant participates in various parts of the industry including exploring for and extracting oil and gas refining it and selling it to the market the company s massive size and different business segments have kept it financially stable through ups and downs in the oil and gas sector the s p 500 member is a dividend aristocrat that s paid and raised its dividend for 40 consecutive years but it hasn t been easy in recent years the company is sensitive to commodity prices and volatility in recent years has hurt business exxonmobil has cut back its spending to counter that issue and the higher commodity prices you see today are helping exxonmobil print cash the company s free cash flow has been 59 billion over the past year assisting in retooling the balance sheet exxonmobil now has 30 billion in cash enough to cancel out most of its 45 billion in long term debt the good times could go on for a while longer analysts estimate that exxonmobil will grow its earnings per share eps by an average of 25 annually over the next three to five years the company s role as a leader in oil and gas gives it broad exposure to the world s continued long term energy needs investors can feel good owning the stock now that exxon s recent success has repaired its financials 2 the case for enbridge enbridge plays an essential role in moving energy resources throughout north america the canadian company is a midstream energy business its pipelines and storage facilities help transport fossil fuels from where they are extracted mainly in canada to where they re needed across canada and the u s you can think of pipeline stocks like a railroad they make money charging for the commodities that producers transport through their pipelines the company depends more on the amount of oil and gas it moves versus the market price of those commodities so enbridge has proven a stable company over the years it s technically not a dividend aristocrat because it s not an s p 500 member but enbridge functions like one it s raised its dividend for 27 years and counting investors also get a generous starting dividend yield at 6 6 today the highest of these three stocks enbridge isn t going to jump off the page with its growth as analysts are looking for just 6 annual eps growth over the next three to five years however the company has an affordable dividend that consumes 76 of its operating profits and the high starting yield makes enbridge a boring but reliable business that investors can count on 3 the case for diamondback energy diamondback energy isn t a household name among investors but this independent oil and gas company can offer a lot it s headquartered in and focuses its operations on the permian basin in texas it could be the riskiest stock of the three because it s an upstream company that solely explores for and extracts oil and gas so it s sensitive to commodity prices it also doesn t have the long dividend track record of the other two names but the company seems positioned for success making it a dividend stock worth considering today the dividend yields 1 9 far below the other two stocks in this article but there s a lot of room for growth free cash flow has surged this year totaling 3 2 billion over the past four quarters the dividend payout ratio is just 39 leaving a cushion in case the business stalls or management grows the payout diamondback energy could benefit from a potential increase in u s energy production america s strategic petroleum reserve is at its lowest since the 1980s and will probably need replenishing over the coming years meanwhile new sanctions against russian oil are going into effect soon curbing supply could boost prices if demand remains stable which could be great for producers like diamondback energy analysts seem optimistic calling for annual eps growth averaging 22 over the next three to five years giving diamondback energy the juice for more dividend growth

four russian torture sites in newly liberated kherson president vladimir putin s government in turn accused ukrainian forces of summarily killing a number or prisoners of war after a video of pow bodies surfaced also monday the world health organization said russia s missile attacks on ukraine s power grid had left millions of lives at risk as the winter descended with frigid temperatures the damage is having knock out effects on ukraine s health system who regional director for europe hans kluge told reporters a ukrainian soldier walks in front of a destroyed building of the international airport of kherson this winter will be about survival he warned saying it would be life threatening for millions of people in ukraine up to three million ukrainians could leave their homes in search of warmth and safety he said they will face unique health challenges including respiratory infections such as covid 19 pneumonia influenza and the serious risk of diphtheria and measles in an under vaccinated population he added residents of kherson were told that they can evacuate to other regions given the city s heavily damaged infrastructure and services power company yasno warned of extended blackouts you should be prepared for different options even the worst ones stock up on warm clothes blankets think about options that will help you wait out a long shutdown it said ukrainian soldier nikolai skelsarov is hugged by his mother elena after returning home to kherson following eight months on the battlefield president vladimir putin s government in turn accused ukrainian forces of summarily killing a number or prisoners of war after a video of pow bodies surfaced torture sites ukraine said it had discovered four russian torture sites in the southern city of kherson kherson was one of the earliest of major cities that russian forces captured when they invaded the country on february 24 the city was retaken earlier this month after russian forces retreated under threat from ukraine troops together with police officers and experts prosecutors conducted inspections of four premises where during the capture of the city the occupiers illegally detained people and brutally tortured them the ukrainian prosecutor general s office said in a statement russian forces had also set up pseudo law enforcement agencies at detention centres in kherson as well as in a police station it said the graves of more than twenty men who were reportedly killed by russian forces are seen outside kherson city on november 20 the remains of rubber truncheons a wooden bat and a device with which the occupiers tortured civilians with electricity were found it added russian authorities also left behind paperwork documenting the administration of the detention sites the prosecutor s office said last week ukrainian ombudsman dmytro lubinets said russian forces were responsible for horrific torture in kherson saying dozens were abused in detention and more were killed one kherson resident told afp he spent weeks in detention where he was beaten and electrocuted by russian and pro russian forces systematic abuse in washington the us ambassador at large for global criminal justice beth van schaack told reporters that there was strong evidence that russian abuses in ukraine were not random or ad hoc there is mounting evidence that russia s invasion of ukraine has been accompanied by systemic war crimes committed in every region where russian forces have been deployed she said us ambassador at large for global criminal justice beth van schaack pictured said there was strong evidence russian abuses in ukraine were not random evidence from liberated areas indicates deliberate indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks against civilian populations custodial abuses of civilians and pows forceful removal or filtration of ukrainian citizens including children to russia and execution like murders and sexual violence she told reporters when we re seeing such systemic acts including the creation of a vast filtration network it s very hard to imagine how these crimes could be committed without responsibility going all the way up the chain of command she said van schaack said that russia s nine month old assault on ukraine has sparked an unprecedented array of accountability initiatives involving numerous bodies along with the international criminal court in the hague the bodies are coordinating to develop priorities and approaches under all available jurisdictional bases she said she called it a new nuremberg moment a

sir general practice is widely seen to be malfunctioning as a past principal gp for some 40 years involved with both the royal college of gps and the british medical association i have long wondered why gps worked for the nhs from 1948 without any specific contractual agreement about their clinical responsibilities this became increasingly unsatisfactory and the result was an agreement with the government that attempted to describe what had been missing the gp contract of 2004 introduced two elements one was the ability of doctors to relinquish responsibility for patient care outside office hours and the other was the detachment of individual patients from a specific gp s responsibility or list practices could and almost all did pay a nominal sum to have the nhs take responsibility for care out of hours and responsibility for individual patient care was devolved to the practice group perhaps these changes led to the present situation where gps in many cases seem to have given up managing any form of acute medicine or continuity of care resulting in swamped a e facilities and difficulty getting gp appointments sometimes we don t know what we have till it s gone dr lewis miller belfast sir i was referred for a bone density scan in march of this year on november 19 i received a letter dated november 17 asking me to telephone for an appointment i phoned repeatedly on november 21 to be greeted with a recorded message saying there was no one available to take my call and advising i leave a message however the next recording said i was unable to leave a message as the mailbox was full i ve been given two weeks to make contact failing which it will be assumed i no longer require treatment and my referral will expire i am now hoping to do so by email though whether emails are monitored i have no idea what is going on in this country of ours nicolette stevens ashington west sussex sir it isn t surprising that nhs patients on long waiting lists for surgery are resorting to desperate measures a friend is just back from lithuania after having a hip replacement operation there she was full of praise for the entire process the trouble free organisation travel arrangements and accommodation the operation itself plus post operative physiotherapy and a week in a treatment spa naturally it wasn t free at the point of use but the entire package cost less than half what she would have paid here for the operation alone it surely supports the argument for more flexibility to be built into our system if people are prepared to pay for treatment over and above their taxes angela lawrence woodbridge suffolk
