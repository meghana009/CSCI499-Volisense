the cost of gasoline is falling so fast that it is beginning to put real money back in the pockets of drivers defying earlier projections and offering an unexpected gift for the holidays filling up is now as cheap as it was in february just before russia s invasion of ukraine touched off a global energy crisis aaa reported the average nationwide price of a gallon of regular wednesday was 3 50 and gas price tracking company gasbuddy projected it could drop below 3 by christmas and all of that relief probably helped drive robust shopping over thanksgiving weekend people are realizing that they might be back to spending 50 to fill their tank instead of 80 said emma rasiel a professor of economics at duke university it is the main signal consumers notice on inflation it is the one thing they are likely to track how much it has gone up or down because every week they need to fill up their car but rasiel cautioned cheaper gas can also give consumers the wrong idea prices of other goods and services are much less volatile and there is no indication that this moment of more affordable fuel is pushing the cost of other things down even as the plunge in prices at the pump helps fuel a national holiday shopping spree it is a reflection of the financial strain consumers and businesses are confronting worldwide prices are going down because demand for oil and gas is falling as countries brace for recession covid 19 outbreaks in china threaten major financial disruption and drivers cut back on gas guzzling as they try to save money to cover skyrocketing mortgage payments and stock market losses earlier worries that sanctions on russian oil would create a shortage in supply and send prices soaring toward the end of the year have for now at least given way to ailing economies and jittery financial markets we re heading into serious recession in europe and further economic slowdown in the u s as people struggle with high interest rates and worry about their personal wealth and savings said ben cahill an energy security analyst at the center for strategic and international studies add it all up and it creates a bleak picture for oil demand prices are reflecting that also helping keep prices low at the moment are some key united states oil refineries which returned to churning out gasoline after months of being out of commission for maintenance and repairs but just as big a factor is the current turmoil in china as its leaders signal new covid lockdowns are imminent touching off protests throughout the country the expected economic fallout has turned oil traders bearish china alone accounted for 16 percent of global oil demand last year according to the research firm capital economics which projects its purchase of oil will drop by 1 million barrels per day in december as covid infections spread the effect of such a drop on global oil markets is considerable reducing the price of brent crude by as much as 10 a barrel or more than 10 percent with covid cases soaring to record highs in china and the threat of widespread lockdowns there increasing the key question is how much demand could fall freeing up supply for the rest of the world edward gardner a commodities economist at the firm wrote in a research note while the high cost of gasoline over much of the past year was a major factor in the crushing inflation that hit the united states and other countries the current dip in fuel costs is doing little to return economic stability manufacturers that rely on large amounts of fuel need to see sustained low prices for a period of months before they adjust the costs of the products they sell analysts say drivers in some parts of the country are benefiting significantly more than in others californians are still paying an average of almost 5 for a gallon of regular this is a pretty delicately held together price decline said patrick de haan head of petroleum analysis at gasbuddy noting that any number of geopolitical or economic events could send prices rebounding there are other big factors making the price outlook murky the united states and europe are in the process of negotiating a price cap on russian oil to take effect monday the plan is to allow russian oil to continue to flow into global markets but at prices that limit profits the kremlin can use to sustain its war machine such a price cap has never before been imposed on a major oil producing nation and it threatens to trigger further instability if the cap is set very low as some european nations are advocating moscow could retaliate by cutting off its supply creating a surge in prices globally another wild card is the opec plus consortium of oil producing nations which meets next week to consider how much oil its members should continue to ship in the coming months the group could decide to cut its output to drive prices up the opec meeting could be the skunk at the picnic said andrew gross a spokesman for aaa trying to guess what they are going to do is tricky those are the kind of things that worry john catsimatidis who owns hundreds of gas stations and a refinery but not because they could affect his fuel business when the businessman talks about gas prices he is more focused on what they could ultimately mean for another business in his multibillion dollar empire the one focused on developing real estate spiraling borrowing costs have made that enterprise much more challenging a six month stretch of 3 gas he said could help ease inflation and signal that it s safe for the federal reserve to reverse its recent rate hikes if we get the price down and it stays there we could fix the problem of inflation and the fed can stop raising interest rates and putting everybody out of business catsimatidis said one thing that is clear is that there is very little leaders in washington can do to keep gas prices down they are at the mercy of global markets the biden administration is probably pressuring saudi arabia which dominates opec plus not to cut its output but the administration s lack of influence over such things was clear the last time opec plus met in october when the group snubbed washington s request that it boost output instead cutting it by 2 million barrels per day the administration last week eased sanctions on venezuela as part of a bid to get oil flowing from that country again but it will be many months before venezuelan petroleum is shipped and only marginal amounts will be available initially most drivers are paying little attention to the broader dynamics of the global oil market but even they are taking a cautious approach despite maybe splurging on holiday gifts data collected by aaa suggests they are sticking with the conservation minded driving habits embraced when gas soared past 5 a gallon lumping more errands into single car trips driving at slower speeds only partially filling their gas tanks prices may have plunged but drivers are not taking their foot off the brake that much is also clear in the outlook of consumers which often improves when gas prices drop but the university of michigan consumer sentiment index suggests this current stretch of cheaper gas is getting overshadowed by other financial challenges straining americans even as gas prices dropped the national survey shows consumer anxiety grew in november even though prices of gas have come down prices of other things are still high said joanne hsu who directs the university s surveys of consumers there is a feeling of tremendous uncertainty
6million americans have been infected by flu and 3 000 have died since october as country is stung by worst outbreak in a decade flu cases in the us have doubled from a fortnight ago estimates suggest some 18 states are now facing very high levels of flu four more than a week ago america s flu season has returned with a vengeance after years of restrictions more than six million americans have been infected with flu and nearly 3 000 have died from the disease so far since october in the worst outbreak in a decade latest figures from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc also show there have been 53 000 hospitalizations in that time a total of 18 states reported very high flu levels in the week ending november 19 four more than in the previous seven day spell new mexico texas and tennessee are the worst affected america s flu season began early this year with seasonal viruses returning with a vengeance after lockdowns face masks and other measures prevented exposure to healthy germs the wave of sickness has also sparked shortages of key drugs including the children s frontline medication amoxicillin commonly used to treat bacterial infections the above graph shows the number of positive flu tests reported to the cdc by week up to november 19 the latest week available cases are continuing to rise after the season began weeks earlier than expected a total of 18 states now have very high flu levels with three new mexico tennessee and texas facing the highest levels in the nation this was four more than the same time in the previous week the cdc publishes weekly flu estimates on the number of cases hospitalizations and deaths sparked by the disease throughout the season the latest infection numbers are 36 per cent above the 4 4million cases estimated over the previous week and more than double the 2 8million from a fortnight ago deaths have also surged from 1 300 recorded a fortnight beforehand the hospitalization rate was 11 3 admissions per 100 000 people in the week to november 19 higher than at any other point at this time of year since 2010 2011 flu cases are now 66 per cent of the total number of infections recorded throughout the whole of last year when there were 9million cases the flu season typically runs from october to may covid has accounted for 2 2million confirmed cases since october but the actual number is likely far higher with many cases missed due to lack of testing the pandemic virus was also behind 14 000 deaths over 2009 america was hit by a swine flu epidemic which triggered 60million cases 274 000 hospitalizations and 12 500 fatalities flu respiratory syncytial virus rsv and other seasonal menaces have been absent since 2020 after restrictions to control covid stopped them spreading this year covid is still circulating but has remained at about 300 000 cases a week since early october but this year they have returned with a vengeance spreading rapidly and infecting many children for the first time this graph shows hospitalizations with flu by year with the current season shown as the black line with red triangles it shows levels are higher this year than at any other time since 2010 pictured above are covid cases by week across the united states according to the cdc where did the flu go the past two years the flu s spread was massively curbed over the first two years of the covid pandemic viral interference from covid which stopped other viruses spreading combined with mitigation measures like masking and restrictions on indoor events led to little spread of the virus as a result immunity waned in many individuals because a lack of infections meant it was not re booted and the youngest children never built up immunity to seasonal menaces because they were not exposed to good germs this led many experts to warn seasonal viruses could return with a vengeance this year there were early warning signs in australia and new zealand a bell wether for outbreaks in the us who both faced record breaking flu seasons there pediatric hospitals also faced a surge of admissions like the us at present dr anthony fauci the nation s top infectious disease expert issued a warning about the rampant spread of the flu in the southern hemisphere some 14 states mostly in the south are already facing very high levels of flu despite it still being early in the season advertisement experts say flu cases are higher this year because influenza was sidelined for most of the pandemic the youngest children have also not built up defense against the virus owing to a lack of exposure to good germs warnings of a bad flu season were made months ago after australia and new zealand which are normally precursors for outbreaks in the us both faced record breaking seasons canberra had recorded 65 000 cases by may this year more than double the 30 000 from 2019 in the year before the pandemic began children s hospitals in the country also faced surging admissions in a warning to the us forcing some to divert resources away from other care but us officials failed to heed the warnings and stock up on treatments the food and drug administration fda is already reporting shortages of amoxicillin a key child antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections such as pneumonia respiratory infections and strep throat all of which become more common after a flu infection local pharmacies have also said they are running out of tamiflu augmentin which contains amoxicillin and tylenol there is also a shortage of the inhaler albuterol the biden administration did however spend more than 5billion bringing in bivalent covid vaccines the cdc recommends that all people over six months old get their annual flu vaccine the bivalent booster jab against covid is also being offered to everyone older than five years but fewer than 12 per cent of those who are eligible have come forward for the covid shot flu vaccine uptake is also lagging with 150million doses having been dished out to date 13million lower than at the same time last year advertisement to boost uptake the biden administration has launched a more than 475million drive that will last for six weeks

home reit hits back in spat with short seller landlord for the homeless brands activist s claims baseless and misleading embattled property firm home reit fought back against a notorious short seller yesterday as the battle between the pair intensified the ftse 250 firm which floated in 2020 and serves as a landlord for charities government and local authorities that house homeless people said criticism by viceroy research was baseless and misleading and it called on viceroy which is headed by activist investor fraser perring to engage with the company and stop its campaign in the media with shares down nearly 30 per cent after last week s attack home reit chairman lynne fennah said this is a business whose sole focus is on providing safe and secure accommodation to some of the most vulnerable in society whilst generating shareholder value it is with deep frustration that the board is having to spend time and resources responding to baseless and misleading allegations that did little to calm nerves in the city as home reit fell another 9 3 per cent or 5 2p to an all time low of 50 6p yesterday last week viceroy questioned the business model and its ability to collect rent it alleged a number of home reit tenants many of which are charities cannot afford rent have not been paying rent are in administration are run by bad actors or simply do not provide social housing services viceroy concluded the issues raise questions about the financial viability of home reit s portfolio and bosses were not the people who should be entrusted to look after the vulnerable the attack has forced home reit to delay its financial results which were due to be published on monday as it awaited verification from its auditor after viceroy s report the company yesterday hit back saying it has no overdue arrears on rent payments billed to the end of august and that the value of its portfolio was estimated externally and not inflated by the trust s fund manager alvarium but viceroy said home reit s response all but confirms the allegations and was a shot in the foot for the firm who is the investor viceroy is the vehicle for one of the financial world s most notorious activists fraser perring 49 began short selling in 2012 after he was struck off as a child protection officer for lincolnshire council he reportedly owns houses in london new york and oregon and set up viceroy with australians aiden lau and gabriel bernarde as well as wirecard and property group adler perring has taken aim at electric car maker tesla saying it was overvalued the short seller accused the group of creating an intentionally misdirected response to concerns about the valuation of its properties the back and forth did little to ease anxiety among investors with analysts at broker peel hunt saying the response to viceroy left some questions unanswered including those at a more fundamental strategic level they added that investors had reason to be concerned over the company s strategy the row threatens to pit alvarium an investment manager with over 18billion in assets against perring in a conflict that could engulf some of the uk s most vulnerable people the activist investor is a well known name on the continent having been one of the loudest voices to raise the alarm over german payments group wirecard which collapsed in 2020 after a accounting scandal that saw its chief executive arrested and chief operating officer go into hiding since then perring has targeted other property firms before home reit ended up in his crosshairs viceroy previously accused german leasing group grenke of accounting fraud while property firm adler was found to have suffered widespread governance and compliance failures following a probe by audit giant kpmg
petaling jaya the grinch may be rubbing its hands in glee after turkey imports from the united states were suspended because of a bird flu epidemic threatening to dampen the year end festive spirit however the veterinary services department is looking into other source countries such as turkiye and australia as potential suppliers in the future other than the current sole importer the united states according to the department the avian flu has hit the us turkey farming industry and there has been an import ban on turkey products since july 20 as of now there is no permission to import turkeys from the country concerned the united states because of the epidemic the department is in the process of revising the assessment risk of importing turkeys from the united states and identifying mitigation measures if import restrictions are lifted again it said in a statement to the star the department said that in the past some 181 metric tonnes of turkey were imported from the united states to ensure a continuous supply in the market especially during the festive season as local turkey production stood only at 11 987 birds in 2020 the general manager of a restaurant chain who declined to be named said it has been badly affected adding that its frozen turkey supply is still stuck in port klang pending customs clearance he said it is only able to sell about 30 dishes for thanksgiving and christmas this year compared with 180 in 2021 and this only because it received some stock before the import ban we thought it was going to be all fine and well we started promoting early and orders were placed as early as june and customers have also paid their deposits but now our supplier is saying that our supply is stuck in port klang i ve asked other restaurants and they too haven t received their supply he added he said he has received multiple texts from customers inquiring about their turkey orders he added that as an alternative he would be offering capon and chicken dishes however capon which is neutered cockerel is also low in stock as it is not a malaysian staple jean michel loubatieres a chef at dali by chef jean said the restaurant has resorted to getting its turkey from a local supplier however he said the price is 10 more expensive than frozen imported turkeys adding that his previous supplier did not specify why it had been unable to deliver his orders however restaurant and bistro owners association vice president jeremy lim said so far there has been no turkey shortage issue among its members he added that while turkey might be a good year end or christmas treat the bird is not a staple protein source for malaysians in my opinion the impact is not as severe as the chicken and egg shortage we can still alternate with other proteins like roast chicken roast beef or roast lamb he said according to a report by the associated press earlier this week citing the us agriculture department over 52 3 million birds in 46 states mostly chickens and turkeys on commercial farms have been slaughtered due to the avian flu outbreak this year the virus is primarily spread through the droppings or nasal discharge of wild birds as they migrate across the country which may then contaminate dust and soil however us officials said there is little risk to human health as transmission is extremely rare and infected birds are not allowed to enter the food supply even if infected birds are exposed to the food supply any virus will be killed by cooking poultry at 74 c

lordstown motors has delivered the first small batch of electric endurance pickups this week with plans to complete several dozen by the end of the year the company plans to build an initial batch of 500 trucks through the first half of 2023 but will require additional capital to assemble more the factory is now owned and operated by taiwan s foxconn which plans to produce several evs at the site in the coming years the first examples of the lordstown endurance electric pickups left the factory today after several years of delays controversy and finally a rescue by taiwan s hon hai technology group better known as foxconn the company said the pickups have achieved certification from the epa and california air resources board opening the door to commercial sales with the first of the initial batch of 500 trucks headed to customers the milestone comes just months after foxconn inked an operating agreement with lordstown to run the ohio factory formerly a general motors assembly plant providing the much needed cash to get the truck the last few steps into production while also establishing its own ev manufacturing footprint stateside related story lordstown ev truck production slowly starts the endurance will provide benefits to customers that use their vehicles for work it optimizes key attributes of traction and maneuverability with our in wheel hub motors safety with our five star crash performance and value in the segment said edward hightower lordstown ceo and president however the deliveries of the first commercial examples do not signal a wider launch lordstown plans to complete just 50 trucks this year and the rest of the first batch of 500 in the first half of 2023 what will come beyond these two batches of 50 and 450 however is subject to raising sufficient capital production of the endurance has certainly begun but it now faces competition from large established automakers that s no small asterisk and it puts the spotlight back on lordstown s finances as it seeks more capital and more buyers for the truck we will continue to build at a slow rate as we address remaining part pedigree and part availability issues we expect to increase the speed of production into november and december hightower said earlier this fall lordstown is also dealing with rising material prices having noted in recent weeks that its bill of materials cost bom is actually higher than the planned selling price of the truck earlier in november foxconn made an additional investment of up to 170 million gaining more share of the company in the process including all of its preferred stock as well as 18 3 of its common stock related story iphone maker foxconn reveals ev truck of its own this infusion of cash is expected to keep endurance production running for a few more months but lordstown says it is looking for one or two oem partners to help scale the endurance the investment will also be used to fund the design and development of a new ev along with foxconn so the truck s longer term future is far from assured especially at a time when far larger automakers continue to roll out new customer models while we have more work to do our entire team cannot wait to get the vehicle in the hands of our customers we are also extremely excited by the additional investment and expanding relationship with foxconn and the opportunities it provides beyond our first vehicle hightower said earlier this month

washington dc nov 30 2022 the federal reserve will push rates higher than previously expected and keep them there for an extended period chair jerome powell said wednesday in remarks likely intended to underscore the fed s single minded focus on combating stubborn inflation yet in a speech at the brookings institution powell also signaled that the fed may increase its key interest rate by a half point at its december meeting a smaller boost after four straight three quarter point hikes rate increases could then fall to a more traditional quarter point size at its february and march meetings based on previous fed forecasts powell said the fed is seeking to increase its benchmark rate by enough to slow the economy hiring and wage growth but not so much as to send the u s into recession it has lifted the rate six times this year to a range of 3 75 to 4 the highest in 15 years those increases have sharply boosted mortgage rates causing home sales to plunge while also raising costs for most other consumer and business loans we think that slowing down at this point is a good way to balance the risks powell said the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting which will take place dec 13 14 financial markets rallied in response to powell s suggestion that rate increases will slow the s p 500 jumped 122 points or 3 1 it had fallen before powell spoke but powell also stressed that smaller hikes shouldn t be taken as a sign the fed will let up on its inflation fight anytime soon it is likely that restoring price stability will require holding interest rates at a restrictive level for some time powell said history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy powell acknowledged there has been some good news on the inflation front with the cost of goods such as cars furniture and appliances in retreat he also said that rents and other housing costs which make up about a third of the consumer price index were likely to decline next year but the cost of services which includes dining out traveling and health care are still rising at a fast clip and will likely be much harder to rein in he said despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability powell said the fed chair singled out strong hiring and wage gains as the main driver keeping services costs high paychecks on average have jumped about 5 in the past year before inflation the fastest pace in four decades we want wages to go up strongly but they ve got to go up at a level that is consistent with 2 inflation over time powell said wage growth at about 3 5 a year would fit that criteria he said slowing the increases in paychecks will likely be difficult he said because robust wage gains are largely being driven by a labor shortage that began during the pandemic and shows no sign of ending soon fed officials had hoped to see the number of people working or looking for work rebound more strongly as the pandemic waned but that hasn t happened the lack of workers reflects a jump in early retirements the deaths of several hundred thousand working age people from covid 19 and a sharp decline in immigration and slower population growth powell said with the supply of workers limited the fed s higher interest rate policies will have to reduce businesses demand for new employees to meet the lower level of supply he added economists generally expect that will mean rising layoffs and a higher unemployment rate with the economy potentially falling into recession but powell in remarks during a question and answer session held out hope that employers could cut the near record high number of job openings they have posted rather than lay off large numbers of workers according to a government report earlier wednesday businesses have pared their job vacancies by about 1 5 million since march though there are still about 1 7 open jobs for every unemployed worker that ratio forces many companies to offer higher pay to attract and keep staff still powell said that employers could cut those openings further while engaging in only limited layoffs as the fed s rate hikes slow borrowing and spending i do continue to believe there is a path to a soft or softish landing unemployment goes up but it s not a hard landing it s not a severe recession he said last month s inflation report showed that prices rose 7 7 in october from a year earlier straining many families budgets that is down however from a 9 1 peak in june fed officials hope that by tightening credit they can slow consumer and business spending reduce hiring and wage growth and cool inflation powell said the fed s efforts have slowed demand and will have to keep it slow for an extended period ap

new york new york u s stocks were uneasy early wednesday following a release of a raft of economic data but were jolted sharply higher by remarks from federal reserve chair jerome powell in a speech before the brookings institution think tank in washington later in the day the data was somewhat mixed edward moya senior market analyst at oanda told cnbc wednesday but it does show there s a lot of resilience in this economy and it still is highlighting a labor market that is weakening but is still in relatively good shape i think that we re not going to get any answers on what policy will be like at the end of next year based on these reports the fed chair noted that while the fight against inflation was a long way from being won the fed could begin moderating rate rises as early as december powell however warned interest rates could go higher from where they are now and stay high for longer he also highlighted the tightness of the labor market in the labor market demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time thus another condition we are looking for is the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market he said jerome powell s full remarks follow the end of this article the dow jones meantime which had been down

center on fiscal and monetary policy brookings institution washington d c 30 november 2022 today i will offer a progress report on the federal open market committee s fomc efforts to restore price stability to the u s economy for the benefit of the american people the report must begin by acknowledging the reality that inflation remains far too high my colleagues and i are acutely aware that high inflation is imposing significant hardship straining budgets and shrinking what paychecks will buy this is especially painful for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation price stability is the responsibility of the federal reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy without price stability the economy does not work for anyone in particular without price stability we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all we currently estimate that 12 month personal consumption expenditures pce inflation through october ran at 6 0 percent while october inflation data received so far showed a welcome surprise to the downside these are a single month s data which followed upside surprises over the previous two months down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases it will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining by any standard inflation remains much too high for purposes of this discussion i will focus my comments on core pce inflation which omits the food and energy inflation components which have been lower recently but are quite volatile our inflation goal is for total inflation of course as food and energy prices matter a great deal for household budgets but core inflation often gives a more accurate indicator of where overall inflation is headed twelve month core pce inflation stands at 5 0 percent in our october estimate approximately where it stood last december when policy tightening was in its early stages over 2022 core inflation rose a few tenths above 5 percent and fell a few tenths below but it mainly moved sideways so when will inflation come down i could answer this question by pointing to the inflation forecasts of private sector forecasters or of fomc participants which broadly show a significant decline over the next year but forecasts have been predicting just such a decline for more than a year while inflation has moved stubbornly sideways the truth is that the path ahead for inflation remains highly uncertain for now let s put aside the forecasts and look instead to the macroeconomic conditions we think we need to see to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time for starters we need to raise interest rates to a level that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent there is considerable uncertainty about what rate will be sufficient although there is no doubt that we have made substantial progress raising our target range for the federal funds rate by 3 75 percentage points since march as our last postmeeting statement indicates we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate it seems to me likely that the ultimate level of rates will need to be somewhat higher than thought at the time of the september meeting and summary of economic projections i will return to policy at the end of my comments but for now i will simply say that we have more ground to cover we are tightening the stance of policy to slow growth in aggregate demand slowing demand growth should allow supply to catch up with demand and restore the balance that will yield stable prices over time restoring that balance is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth last year the ongoing reopening of the economy boosted real gross domestic product gdp growth to a very strong 5 7 percent this year gdp was roughly flat through the first three quarters and indicators point to modest growth this quarter which seems likely to bring the year in with very modest growth overall several factors contributed to this slowing growth including the waning effects of reopening and of pandemic fiscal support the global implications of russia s war against ukraine and our policy actions which tightened financial conditions and are affecting economic activity particularly in interest sensitive sectors such as housing we can say that demand growth has slowed and we expect that this growth will need to remain at a slower pace for a sustained period despite the tighter policy and slower growth over the past year we have not seen clear progress on slowing inflation to assess what it will take to get inflation down it is useful to break core inflation into three component categories core goods inflation housing services inflation and inflation in core services other than housing core goods inflation has moved down from very high levels over the course of 2022 while housing services inflation has risen rapidly inflation in core services ex housing has fluctuated but shown no clear trend i will discuss each of these items in turn early in the pandemic goods prices began rising rapidly as abnormally strong demand was met by pandemic hampered supply reports from businesses and many indicators suggest that supply chain issues are now easing both fuel and nonfuel import prices have fallen in recent months and indicators of prices paid by manufacturers have moved down while 12 month core goods inflation remains elevated at 4 6 percent it has fallen nearly 3 percentage points from earlier in the year it is far too early to declare goods inflation vanquished but if current trends continue goods prices should begin to exert downward pressure on overall inflation in coming months housing services inflation measures the rise in the price of all rents and the rise in the rental equivalent cost of owner occupied housing unlike goods inflation housing services inflation has continued to rise and now stands at 7 1 percent over the past 12 months housing inflation tends to lag other prices around inflation turning points however because of the slow rate at which the stock of rental leases turns over 2the market rate on new leases is a timelier indicator of where overall housing inflation will go over the next year or so measures of 12 month inflation in new leases rose to nearly 20 percent during the pandemic but have been falling sharply since about midyear as figure 3 shows however overall housing services inflation has continued to rise as existing leases turn over and jump in price to catch up with the higher level of rents for new leases this is likely to continue well into next year but as long as new lease inflation keeps falling we would expect housing services inflation to begin falling sometime next year indeed a decline in this inflation underlies most forecasts of declining inflation finally we come to core services other than housing this spending category covers a wide range of services from health care and education to haircuts and hospitality this is the largest of our three categories constituting more than half of the core pce index thus this may be the most important category for understanding the future evolution of core inflation because wages make up the largest cost in delivering these services the labor market holds the key to understanding inflation in this category in the labor market demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time thus another condition we are looking for is the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market signs of elevated labor market tightness emerged suddenly in mid 2021 the unemployment rate at the time was much higher than the 3 5 percent that had prevailed without major signs of tightness before the pandemic employment was still millions below its level on the eve of the pandemic looking back we can see that a significant and persistent labor supply shortfall opened up during the pandemic a shortfall that appears unlikely to fully close anytime soon comparing the current labor force with the congressional budget office s pre pandemic forecast of labor force growth reveals a current labor force shortfall of roughly 3 1 2 million people this shortfall reflects both lower than expected population growth and a lower labor force participation rate participation dropped sharply at the onset of the pandemic because of many factors including sickness caregiving and fear of infection many forecasters expected that participation would move back up fairly quickly as the pandemic faded and for workers in their prime working years it mostly has overall participation however remains well below pre pandemic trends some of the participation gap reflects workers who are still out of the labor force because they are sick with covid 19 or continue to suffer lingering symptoms from previous covid infections long covid but recent research by fed economists finds that the participation gap is now mostly due to excess retirements that is retirements in excess of what would have been expected from population aging alone these excess retirements might now account for more than 2 million of the 31 2 million shortfall in the labor force what explains these excess retirements health issues have surely played a role as covid has posed a particularly large threat to the lives and health of the elderly in addition many older workers lost their jobs in the early stages of the pandemic when layoffs were historically high the cost of finding new employment may have appeared particularly large for these workers given pandemic related disruptions to the work environment and health concerns 9 also gains in the stock market and rising house prices in the first two years of the pandemic contributed to an increase in wealth that likely facilitated early retirement for some people the data so far do not suggest that excess retirements are likely to unwind because of retirees returning to the labor force older workers are still retiring at higher rates and retirees do not appear to be returning to the labor force in sufficient numbers to meaningfully reduce the total number of excess retirees the second factor contributing to the labor supply shortfall is slower growth in the working age population the combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge in deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about 1 1 2 million missing workers policies to support labor supply are not the domain of the fed our tools work principally on demand without advocating any particular policy however i will say that policies to support labor force participation could over time bring benefits to the workers who join the labor force and support overall economic growth such policies would take time to implement and have their effects however for the near term a moderation of labor demand growth will be required to restore balance to the labor market currently the unemployment rate is at 3 7 percent near 50 year lows and job openings exceed available workers by about 4 million that is about 1 7 job openings for every person looking for work so far we have seen only tentative signs of moderation of labor demand with slower gdp growth this year job gains have stepped down from more than 450 000 per month over the first seven months of the year to about 290 000 per month over the past three months but this job growth remains far in excess of the pace needed to accommodate population growth over time about 100 000 per month by many estimates job openings have fallen by about 1 5 million this year but remain higher than at any time before the pandemic wage growth too shows only tentative signs of returning to balance some measures of wage growth have ticked down recently but the declines are very modest so far relative to earlier increases and still leave wage growth well above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time to be clear strong wage growth is a good thing but for wage growth to be sustainable it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation let s sum up this review of economic conditions that we think we need to see to bring inflation down to 2 percent growth in economic activity has slowed to well below its longer run trend and this needs to be sustained bottlenecks in goods production are easing and goods price inflation appears to be easing as well and this too must continue housing services inflation will probably keep rising well into next year but if inflation on new leases continues to fall we will likely see housing services inflation begin to fall later next year finally the labor market which is especially important for inflation in core services ex housing shows only tentative signs of rebalancing and wage growth remains well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability returning to monetary policy my fomc colleagues and i are strongly committed to restoring price stability after our november meeting we noted that we anticipated that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate in order to attain a policy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to move inflation down to 2 percent over time monetary policy affects the economy and inflation with uncertain lags and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt thus it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting given our progress in tightening policy the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level it is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy we will stay the course until the job is done photo credit big news network
the war in ukraine and growing tensions with china have pulled defense stocks into the limelight making the s p aerospace defense select industry index hold up better than the s p 500 spx year to date in this piece i compared two defense stocks lmt and rtx and found that lmt is likely a better buy lockheed martin nyse lmt and raytheon technologies nyse rtx are up nicely year to date even significantly outperforming their sector however no two defense stocks are the same even though they might share similarities for example both companies have significant institutional ownership with raytheon at 81 and lockheed at 76 a sign of strength for both on the other hand almost all of lockheeds sales are defense while raytheon is 65 defense and 35 commercial aviation this could make all the difference when choosing between two names lockheed martin lmt lockheed martin shares are up almost 40 year to date putting them significantly ahead of raytheon stock however from a p e standpoint lockheed is cheaper after a deeper analysis of both companies fundamentals and due to its lower p e lockheed martin looks like the better choice making a bullish view seem appropriate at this time in its 2022 review of the global aerospace and defense industry pwc reported a partial recovery of the industry in 2021 led by boeing nyse ba airbus otc eadsf and raytheon however lockheed martin remained the largest most profitable company in the industry with revenue up 3 to 67 billion and operating profits up 6 to 9 1 billion lockheed martin is almost entirely dependent on the defense industry and especially the u s government for its sales which is a double edged sword however global military spending reached a new record in 2021 and the u s boosted its defense budget by 8 for fiscal 2023 setting lockheed up for a robust year finally lockheeds trailing p e ratio of around 22 2x is lower than the american aerospace and defense industrys three year average of 27 9x it also doesnt account for the increasing military spending and growing tensions with russia and china what is the price target for lmt stock lockheed martin has a hold consensus rating based on four buys seven holds and two sells assigned over the last three months at 471 67 the average price target for lockheed martin implies downside potential of 2 8 raytheon technologies rtx in the long term things are looking up for raytheon especially as it benefits from the recovery in both defense and commercial aerospace however the companys p e ratio of 32 5x is slightly ahead of the industrys three year average and a closer analysis of its growth shows theres more than meets the eye combined these factors suggest a neutral view may be appropriate as mentioned earlier the good news for raytheon is that its benefiting from the recoveries in both commercial aerospace and defense according to pwc commercial aerospace deliveries are up with a strong backlog and passenger demand is in recovery mode the firm thinks commercial aviation could soar again by 2024 which would benefit raytheon however pwc also pointed out something critical about the companys fundamentals raytheons merger with united technologies impacted its earnings reporting making its numbers look better than they actually were raytheon reported a 13 increase in revenue for 2021 however after adjusting for the merger with united technologies that was completed in the second quarter of 2020 raytheons 2021 revenue was roughly flat the company reported 5 billion in profits for 2021 versus its loss of 11 9 billion in 2020 the mergers impact on raytheons profits was much smaller at about 600 million but its still something to consider what is the price target for rtx stock raytheon technologies has a strong buy consensus rating based on nine buys three holds and zero sell ratings given over the last three months at 104 the average price target for raytheon technologies implies upside potential of 5 35 conclusion bullish on lmt neutral on rtx the biggest risk facing both companies is the continuing supply chain difficulties which are restraining their revenues and ability to fill orders raytheon and lockheeds management both highlighted manufacturing challenges as key issues for the rest of this year and into the next although lockheed martin shares have surged much more than the rest of the industry year to date they should still have room to run overall the defense industry has had stable steady growth in recent years and global tensions suggest continued growth aerospace is still in recovery mode but looks robust in the long term making raytheon worth monitoring for the long term while potentially buying and holding lockheed martin disclosure
risk of nigerians hunger for dollar denominated assets by kingsley ukoh sir nigerians fearing the vagaries of the local currency the naira are increasingly investing in dollar dominated assets to diversify their portfolios and reduce their exposure to naira depreciation why this may be considered safe in the short run is premised on the assumption that the u s green back would maintain its stranglehold and hegemony as an international currency for long emerging realities and facts suggest that the washington s hegemony as a hyper power as former french foreign minister called her is actually on the wane and so is the dollar as dominant international currency a numbers of factors ranging from geo political issues and economic social and cultural are coalescing and generating the momentum for a multi polar global order that would feature multiple range of alternative international financial settlements that may include barter trade to trading in the respective currencies over the u s dollar therefore acquiring dollar dominated assets may not be safe in the long run the need to hedge against the sustained devaluation of the naira may have accounted for the rising investor s appetite for dollar denominated assets which actually entails purchasing foreign assets such as foreign stocks dollar mutual funds eurobonds and dollar fixed deposits nigeria s dollar funds increased by 48 between january and october 15 according to data from financial research agency coronation part of the reasons nigeria s prospective investors are flocking to foreign assets denominated in u s dollar is simply that by hedging your portfolio with dollar assets returns in local currency naira terms will increase if the naira continues to depreciate making room for the preservation of invested capital read also six types of voters in nigeria despite the rise in global oil prices by 37 8 year to date to 103 per barrel bonny light crude mostly exported from nigeria as at april nigeria s external reserves have remained relatively flat declining by 794 9 million at april 12 it has been observed that accretion to the external reserves had been poor despite federal government s eurobonds issuance of 5 25 billion comprising 4 0 billion in september 2021 and 1 25 billion in march 2022 the weakness in the external reserves has sustained pressure on the naira against the dollar and there has been no reprieve from other sources of dollar inflows as foreign investors are reluctant to invest hence the currency has reached a record low despite the economic factors putting pressure on the naira the direct impact of the u s financial authorities especially recently when the reserve bank increased interest by 0 75 triggering global currency crises has hit exceptional hard on the already nigeria s sagging currency the u s authority has pursued narrow and politically motivated policy choices whose impact has been broadly negative for the rest of the world on account of the hegemony of the u s dollar the implication for a global currency or basket of currencies not beholden to the political convenience of any faction or clique of any country is an urgent imperative and the confluence of emerging realities suggest strongly that the future of international financial settlements including foreign assets is clearly on the horizon nigeria as many other countries should not only be ready for this but should work in concert with other nations across plethora of international platforms to end the dominance of the u s green back without a voice in the u s monetary and fiscal policy it is no doubt that nigeria and the rest of the world catches cold when washington sneezes the emerging trend of multi polar world order underpinned by international law and the practice of multilateralism would be complimented by basket of international currencies and other forms of international financial settlements that is broadly driven and accepted by all stakeholders of the international system without the overwhelming hegemony of any single or clique of countries
us crude oil us dollar and risk trends talking points the market perspective crude oil bullish above 76 00 risk appetite trends swelled this past session as fed chairman jerome powell signaled a slower clip of rate hikes was ahead but how much did that translate into crude prices a sharp 12 58 million barrel drop in us crude oil inventories last week according to eia extends supply driven pressure on this critical commodity recommended by john kicklighter building confidence in trading get my guide crude oil prices have extended their climb on the week to a third consecutive session extending the rebound from a large technical level around 76 00 and pushing out the week s performance to the most bullish showing 5 6 percent since the beginning of october on the fundamental side we were offered up two contrasting foundations for support for the bulls supply data out of the us and general sentiment thanks to key fed speak the timing of the energy market s move suggests one of those features carried more weight in the performance thus far but motivations can and do switch with time and circumstance before diving into the reasoning the price action from the commodity itself carries weight on a large and scale looking at a week or monthly chart the 61 8 percent fibonacci retracement of the historical range from the highs of july 2008 to the depths of the brief negative pricing in april of 2020 lands just below 76 00 it is not clear how many traders would see this level much less give it weight but the more often it dithers around that level the more recognition it will draw chart of wti crude oil futures with net speculative futures positioning from cot weekly chart created on tradingview platform it is notable that while us crude has worked on a loose range support in just a double bottom over these past two months there is a divergence to be found in net speculative futures positioning from the cot while it wasn t a v shaped reversal in net positioning as seen above in blue there has been a gradual recovery that said from where is the motivation for this move higher coming the biggest development behind this market this past session was the general swell in sentiment seen across the range of risk assets that were open and trading through the closing hours of the us session that was in large part driven by the remarks from fed chairman jerome powell who remarked that a slowdown in rate hikes was likely as soon as december while that is not a surprise nor does it offer much tempering of recession risks it nevertheless offered the kind of relief that equity traders seemed to be looking for not to mention it pushed the dollar lower it would seem that this could have been a significant contribution to energy prices whether through a speculative appetite or through expectations for the soft ish landing that powell still hoped for in his comments the only problem is that the speculative correlation has deviated on the higher time frame ie daily and weekly but it was particularly off on the lower time frame ie 15 minutes oil us crude mixed data provided by of clients are net long of clients are net short change in longs shorts oi daily 4 2 2 weekly 20 19 4 chart of wti crude oil futures overlaid with the s p 500 and inverted dxy dollar index daily chart created on tradingview platform in the absence of speculative motivation traditional supply demand functions are always worth monitoring as it happens the eia s inventory figures updated in the new york morning session according to the agency us stocks dropped by 12 58 million barrels a dramatically greater draw than the 2 758 million expected and 3 369 million the previous week that suggests a greater demand for processors and consumers which builds upon the reports that opec is considering cutting its own output due to the lower levels of global oil prices referenced over the weekend this theme will continue to percolate in the background but it doesn t provide a tangible line of further scheduled events to keep this charge running moving forward crude oil traders would do well to keep close tabs on the general ebb and flow of speculative appetite in the financial system to get a sense in this market chart of us crude oil inventories overlaid on 5 year average daily chart created by the us energy information administration

jerome powell told an audience at the brookings institution wednesday that the central bank can afford to ease back on its tighter monetary policy at its december meeting due to wrap up dec 14 the lagged effect of higher rates already taken in 2022 plus the drawing down of the size of the fed s balance sheet through quantitative tightening mean it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate

on this week s episode of the financial planning podcast chris mcmahon walks the line between two topics that are deeply personal for most people what s in your wallet and what s in your soul chris mcmahon the ceo and founder of aquinas wealth advisors aquinas wealth advisors mcmahon the ceo and founder of aquinas wealth advisors has been helping clients with financial planning asset allocation retirement planning and estate tax management for more than 30 years but as time passed and his relationships with clients deepened he perceived a greater call for one s investments to sync up with one s beliefs while tools to help investors go green were gaining steam mcmahon said folks interested in putting their faith front and center were lacking options so in the middle of the pandemic he launched aquinas a hybrid robo advisor backed by technology that gives investors what he calls a faith and finance score to oversimplify portfolios that align with the catholic faith score well while those that don t see their scores tumble mcmahon a father of five is excited about the power of technology to do something unimaginable when he started his career more than three decades ago give advisors and investors tools to truly understand where their money is going during his conversation with fp podcast host and lead editorial producer justin l mack mcmahon talks about launching the service in a highly polarized environment what separates an a grade from an f grade in the eyes of the catholic church and why advisors need to get specific with clients who are seeking greater transparency in their portfolios listen to the new episode as well as to all future and past episodes by subscribing to the fp podcast on apple spotify or wherever you get podcasts transcript justin l mack 00 02 good morning good afternoon and good evening welcome to the financial planning podcast i m your host justin l mack wealthtech editor with financial planning and it is my pleasure to introduce this week s guest chris mcmahon president and ceo of aquinas wealth advisors chris thanks so much for joining us this week chris mcmahon 00 18 glad to be with you justin i m excited to be with you so thanks justin l mack 00 21 absolutely now chris brings to this week s episode more than 30 years of experience in financial planning asset allocation retirement planning and estate tax management before founding aquinas a faith and values based wealth management firm in 2020 he established mfa wealth a personal wealth management firm based in pittsburgh pennsylvania and in more recent accolades chris was recently awarded the 2022 catholic finance professional of the year award by the catholic finance association and on this week s show we re going to talk about two topics that are sure to perk up ears at the dinner table especially when paired together faith and finance and really what it means to embed your values into your portfolio the bottom line people want to know what companies are doing with their social investments and if they can make sure their portfolio is firmly aligned with their principles chris says aquinas has the tech to do just that and goes beyond some other esg screening tools but before we get into all that chris let s start at the beginning tell me a little bit about how aquinas wealth advisors came to be and your motivations to found that in 2020 during a really difficult year after so many decades of experience in financial services chris mcmahon 01 25 yeah it s interesting justin for years we ve been a traditional registered investment advisory firm providing financial services to professionals business owners et cetera comprehensive wealth management asset allocation education retirement planning just like you mentioned and that was fine but what i found was more and more of my clients became closer to me those relationships are deep and it s as you know one of the great benefits of our careers but what happened was people started asking me more and more questions saying boy i feel like sometimes my particular values aren t being articulated in my financial planning some of these companies i m investing in seem to be tone deaf to what i m thinking about what i m concerned about and seem to be there seemed to be alternatives for folks that wanted to embrace the environment in a very deep way or wanted to embrace more kind of contemporary or if you call them progressive concepts in the marketplaces 02 20 so what happened was justin as i got older my practice matured and my organization got larger we saw people saying we aren t really being satisfied with what is available to us to ensure that our voice my investments are in alignment with my deepest held beliefs initially we just started offering some portfolios at our existing company mfa wealth that were faith based i m a faith guy so they were faith based and we used some screening tools that were available in the marketplace unfortunately i was disappointed to hear from a few of these vendors that less than 2 of all financial advisors even use these screening tools i guess they re expensive and there are compliance issues if you re not in your own firm et cetera that was satisfactory for some time but what we realized was there was a bigger need there were people that were just kind of saying hey with all the information that s available to the marketplace we found that investors came to believe that efficiencies in the marketplace were always there 03 17 so justin people looked less to mfa wealth for performance relative to another firm or relative to the market there s a certain belief of competence from clients and those clients are saying i believe whether i m with xyz firm or abc firm if there are competent advisors offering good services i m not seeing a significant value add in terms of performance between one of those two alternatives but what i do want to have is stuff that is keeping me up at night and i think you throw into that mix justin with all the craziness on the news on the left and the right it s become kind of entertainment and everyone s being worked into a frenzy what we try to do is kind of deescalate that conversation a little bit and say hey if this is important to you we are able to do it at mfa then we said why don t we develop a tool and we developed a tool that allows people on their own to evaluate their alignment of their investments particularly with their christian and catholic values justin l mack 04 12 well what you mentioned was pretty important for a lot of folks especially around that time it s that when i m looking at my options for financial planning or financial advice and we know that in the years where you re starting this company and doing this founding the increase in requests for financial advice are through the roof we have the year to year statistics the number and the demand for financial advice financial planning and financial planners is skyrocketing and like you said for the outside investor who doesn t know the business and is maybe a first time person working with a wealth manager or someone looking to make a change the pros are the pros they re all professionals my returns are gonna be good because they re the pros so what s going to make someone stand out for you it sounds like that deeper connection and a really personal connection faith being the driving motivator is what allowed you guys to stand out any risk in doing that because it sounds like you re a faith based guy when you mix that with business is there any time where you re hesitant or worried that it might be misunderstood misconstrued or taken the wrong way chris mcmahon 05 11 yeah that s interesting i found that not to be the case because some of my dearest friends have completely different values and their portfolios are not reflective of my personal values i think there s a risk right because we re so polarized now i think it s our responsibility as advisors to bring people together to be less divisive but you re right in this world of kind of right or wrong or everyone who disagrees with me is not only wrong but i wanna scream at them right yeah i think that s where we have to de escalate de escalate the tension we live in the greatest country in the world with varying viewpoints and we could articulate those so what i found is the people that cared dramatically the people that aligned with those values and the people that had different values simply didn t care they said okay that s something i m not interested in it s very unusual for someone to say boy i disagree with those values therefore i m not gonna use your firm as a whole because i would say our parent company probably only has about 12 of its folks that are in any kind of morals based investing of any kind justin l mack 06 20 something else i want to talk about is that tech that aims to provide this service for clients because it s a difficult thing to do especially if you re say an individual investor or a client or even someone working with an advisor and you start doing your own personal research which we know a lot of people are doing now what s this company all about are they truly doing the things that they say they re doing does this fit with my alignment or what i believe in and that can be tough because it s hard to get that information or that access as an individual an investor or a client you might get so far but you might hit a wall where well i really don t know what this company s all about are they being truthful all of that so tell me how the tech that you guys have developed helps figure that out for clients make it simple a tool for advisors to help folks do exactly what they re looking to do which is have a portfolio that aligns with who they are what they believe in and what they want do with their money at the end of the day chris mcmahon 07 09 it s fascinating justin clients that said i want my portfolio to be green i don t want to have big oil in my portfolio i don t want to have guns in my portfolio i don t want to have these types of things there have been some funds that have been available to them or they say i m a faith based person i don t wanna have any pornography in my portfolio there is a fund or two out there that is available but generally if somebody said i want to have a deeper connection not only on a couple of mutual funds or etfs i own but across my entire portfolio they had to put it completely upon their advisors and say please make sure that this is an alignment with my deepest held beliefs and many of those advisors didn t even have the tools available to them to really thoroughly vet that out so it was interesting justin advisors were talking people out of it for years 07 52 they would say things like oh it s impossible to really tell with companies that have charitable foundations or companies that have multiple subsidiaries it s very difficult to really tell definitively who s in or outside of my well or who s doing what with your social activism they d also say and even if you could figure it out it would just devastate your returns so therefore let s not do it so as the advisors are talking the clients out of it they are not listening that s the rule they told me that was rule number one of investment guy school 35 years ago listen to what people say listen to what they say and people are saying to me this is important to me this is a value to me and this is assuming i can have similar returns with a and b which people now believe you can if i can layer in my morality i m gonna do it 08 40 and something i think is very interesting too justin many of my clients for years 20 or 15 years ago were saying i want to be neutral i don t wanna have anything i don t want to put any political or moral based parameters in my investment account and what happened which is fascinating is that while those people were asleep all the big money management firms state street vanguard blackrock that control almost 30 of the s p 500 have been instilling an ideology at the s p i think that s what it is 35 of the s p 500 is controlled by those companies and those ideologues which are very progressive for a person of religious values hiring practices quotas and these types of things energy policies things that might be contrary to a person of faith have taken deep hold in the boardroom of these companies just simply because these large enormous juggernauts with their etfs and funds have so while these people were asleep i think a lot of times many of these investors affluent people said oh this isn t that big a deal or they would say some of this ideology has kind of been cooked in the faculty lounges of some very liberal college it s nowhere near the boardroom or my portfolio i realized while they slept if you will they re at the gates and people are kind of jumping into action i apologize i dunno if i answered your question there justin justin l mack 10 13 oh no you definitely did and it kind of leads me to my next one about what s continuing to drive the change in how vocal folks are about what they want their money to do for them and what they want to invest in because you mentioned the neutrality that was a priority or prioritized by clients years ago that has gone away we re seeing or at least it seems that we re seeing such a huge cry for i want to know exactly what it s all about so i can make sure that i m consistent in my pocket and in my soul we re seeing that being said more and more but like you said 15 years ago keep me neutral i m just focused on my returns what s driving that change in mindset chris mcmahon 10 50 fortunately i think it s prosperity as people have become more even in spite of what s happened the last year or two the historic run ups in the stock market have been wonderful and given people an opportunity to really evaluate the first panic is am i gonna have enough am i gonna have enough to retire am i gonna send my kids to college and once people realize i m going to have enough then the question becomes am i being responsible am i being prudent am i being as people get one step closer to the last day they re saying as i get closer to that last day and this enormous wealth transfer that s gonna take place what kind of legacy am i gonna leave not only financially what kind of legacy am i creating what does it say to the people i love and the people i brought into the world or people that know me what is it gonna say about me how s this gonna reflect upon me am i doing the best with the gifts i ve been given by god frankly justin l mack 11 42 and what are you seeing among that next generation of investors the folks who are first timers and the younger generation where do you believe they stand as far as having their values aligned with their investments chris mcmahon 11 53 great question i see about 30 of the people are probably always very passionate about it and want to make sure that that s the first thing that they do we have people that call our offices and say i don t care about the return or i m willing to have a lower return that s unusual but it s probably i d say up to 30 of the folks that are out there even the younger ones and i d say there s 60 of the people who are just saying i need to start my 401 k or really i m not in a position yet to think that through that thoroughly so oftentimes i see them deferring that decision but i am encouraged when people will say to talk about the technology specifically it s really geared towards younger people the tool we develop which i think is interesting so as i was mentioning earlier people have to rely upon their advisors to say did you vet my portfolio for me 12 41 make sure it s in alignment with my deepest held beliefs and the advisors will say well yeah that s another thing as advisors we need to really be diligent because if we re representing as you said earlier justin if we re representing something that we re really not delivering on our friends the regulators rightfully would take great exception to that but what s happening the technology we develop puts the tools in the hands of especially the young people so they re able to have whether they have 20 000 here and 10 000 here they re able through this faith and finance technology the tool itself the app they re able to aggregate all their holdings wherever they are multiple accounts like any aggregation portal and once they aggregate those holdings they can run the testing and what happens is our tool will go out and grab all the various accounts aggregate them and then score them for performance relative to the comparable market index and also to alignment to these christian and catholic values and then give them not only a performance score but secondly an alignment score and then great detail around what they re supporting and then an overall score of the portfolio and most folks are hoping for a b or obviously they re hoping for an a but oftentimes justin people are horrified when they realize what they are supporting and were really never before empowered to make decisions based on that information justin l mack 14 04 absolutely and with that we are actually gonna take a quick break and enjoy a word from our sponsors but when we return we ll have a whole lot more with chris mcmahon president and ceo of aquinas wealth advisors talking about their tech that pairs faith in finance and some financial planning podcast good vibes stick around we ll be right back and welcome back to the financial planning podcast i m your host justin mack and we re diving right back into our conversation this week with chris mcmahon president and ceo of aquinas wealth advisors now chris before the break we had a chance to talk about your motivations and founding your new firm the tech that goes to the next step and beyond to pair faith and finance in a way that is pretty unique give me a quick play by play if i am an investor or an advisor who s curious and i want to check out what you guys have to offer how does it work so say the scenario of i m an investor that already has a portfolio i have no idea if it actually aligns with catholic or christian values and i wanna check out what aquinas has how s it work chris mcmahon 15 02 as i said in the old days people had no we can t really compare it to anything because people never had this ability before there are a couple screeners online if you said hey i m gonna buy xyz stock you can put xyz stock into the screening tool it ll say xyz stock meets or doesn t meet your portfolio needs but what about all the individual equities held inside the etfs all the individual equities held inside the mutual funds et cetera it gets very very difficult what this does is kind of puts it all in one place makes it kind of very seamless for the client someone who has these concerns simply goes into the tool and aggregates their portfolio they have a password and user id they wherever they held money wherever those accounts are aggregated together in an industry standard aggregation tool 15 52 and then they literally hit the button get my score and it s right in front of their eyes the little wheels start spinning in about 50 seconds this detailed report sometimes reports up to 40 pages long telling them everything that they re involved in and it s been more than once justin we ve been able to talk with folks that are deeply rooted in their religious beliefs or their moral beliefs it s not all just religious folks there s other people very very much against pornography very very much against life issues et cetera but what s fascinating is that one of the large religious institutions actually asked us to look at some of their holdings we found about 40 excuse me they found about 47 of all their assets were invested in pornography or pornography related enterprises and that s horrifying to an organization that is trying to make the world a better place and that s something i think universally most people would be horrified by that but it gives them this tool justin they have all the details they can do what they want they can do nothing if they choose to or they can use our firm they can go one step further and say yes please let s move these assets here because i can t have this happen again but that s how it works justin l mack 17 00 definitely and again is this score based a to f is it a standard school type score that folks can easily interpret understand and gain something from quickly chris mcmahon 17 09 yeah it s funny because the people the developers we use we re trying to come up with this complicated matrix and i m a pretty straightforward guy i said we re gonna give him an a b c d e or f everybody understands that right so you get a grade for your performance you get a grade for your alignment with your deepest held beliefs and you get an overall grade which is the biggest thing about faith and finance score and hopefully we re shooting for a b or better that s what we said to all of our kids when we sent em off to college get bs or better and that s what we re hoping for here and the idea is that these folks will have the information be empowered go back to existing advisors possibly and say can you clean this up for me in some way it s still difficult because sometimes the existing advisors just don t have the horsepower to make these changes or frankly sometimes justin some of the firms that they re with are violators themselves of these policies they re investing in or doing social activism with organizations that folks that are faith based might really find questionable for sure justin l mack 18 09 tell me about what s next i guess for aquinas but maybe what you see next for this kind of tech and this kind of approach because i don t know if there s any thought to expand your options for other faiths or for a wider set of beliefs or if you believe that there might be an opportunity for folks of again completely different faiths that develop something similar just what are your thoughts on what s next for you and what do you see for this kind of support chris mcmahon 18 31 i m excited about it right i m 30 goodness gracious 33 years into my career and i ve never been more excited because not only is ours a mature registered investment advisory firm that we have our parent company has done well and continues to thankfully but what i found is people are i ve seen people excited like never before empowered like never before and i think i d like to share that this tool can be modified to screen for several different things even for our friends that are hyper worried about the environment for example realistically you could certainly buy a fund that s consistent with the environment but it s very very difficult i would say nearly impossible for an individual investor to determine if all of their investments are aligned with their values of preserving the earth which i think all of us should have that value for sure 19 24 so i see the next step is one more aquinas you might know is more specifically a catholic father of the catholic church even though the catholic and the christian values are identical there s separate silos trinity wealth advisors that s rolling out will speak specifically for nondenominational christians and then i think after that i think that represents about 35 of the country i think after that the next step would be to have some folks around this kind of just general protecting the environment because you could do the same thing of course it wouldn t be a faith and finance score then it might be a green and growth score but it s the same technology applied to various moral deeply held moral beliefs justin l mack 20 04 definitely and something else about the tech that aquinas is using what determines an a to f score cause we talk kind of generally and i won t put you on the spot to give me a full breakdown of company by company but what is something that would get you an a on the score and what s something that s gonna end up with something closer to an f if there is a way just to show that dynamic at least based on the catholic faith and what you guys have available now chris mcmahon 20 27 catholic faith is easy right because the church tells you justin l mack 20 33 yeah not as much wiggle room chris mcmahon 20 34 not as much wiggle room it s pretty darn straightforward and the great thing about these screening tools it s fascinating for any of your listeners in the business i would suggest to them strongly that they spend the money and subscribe to at least one of them because they re amazing the depth of what they ll provide for you you probably wouldn t go develop a tool like ours that creates this output because it s extraordinarily complex but we use an algorithm that uses that scoring and uses those violations if you will and ranks those violations based on strength for example well you might say alcohol has destroyed many lives and shouldn t be involved in any portfolios but the reality is many many many religious organizations for thousands of years funded their entire existence based on the alcohol they produced and many people use it in a relatively healthy way 21 25 so what we found is rating those things based on severity as well so there s the detail in the reporting that clients get it s amazing because it not only says are you violated because i stayed at a hotel well the hotel on its pay per view may have had pornography so that you d say well then you can t own any hotels well that s not realistic i don t think so what we found is from our scoring system the way we developed the tool we rate these things based on severity alcohol is an example of that if a manufacturer produces alcohol or a hotel chain serves alcohol i ll give you a great example of that justin some of the major hotels i think receive receive a couple infractions but are still in what would you call the mild infraction range serving alcohol or even having pornography which is reprehensible in my opinion because it leads to human trafficking and the deterioration of our society frankly 22 18 but the normalization of it has not been a good thing in my opinion for society but still that hotel chain might only receive a ding if you will it s still scored in it shows on the report but it receives a ding however there are specifically some hospitality organizations referred to as hospitality that are large holdings in big etfs and you ll think boy i ve been in the financial services business a long time i m not familiar with this hospitality group it must be a holding company for hilton or marriott or something and you look into it and this particular group this particular group has two businesses gentlemen s clubs and the manufacturing of pornography so even though it broadly be in the hospitality sector it would score much much worse in terms of the output so it s incredible so my point is we can get very very micro on this stuff and our scoring allows for those nuances justin l mack 23 18 and then the very last thing i d love to have you touch on is just the idea of this kind of technology based on whatever your beliefs might be because again having a chance to speak to you about what aquinas is doing and i can think of all the different kinds of ways folks might want to be able to quickly view a portfolio or more easily or more transparently have a portfolio that shows them what it s all about aligns with their values even if their values are different because we mentioned polarity and how some people could take to what is being done at aquinas and saying hey we don t agree we want values that are completely skewed differently for example on my podcast i had a chance to speak with a woman who does independent financial advising for folks in the sex industry because she knows it s hard for them to get help 23 59 so two very different viewpoints that we ve had a chance to share on the show but i m sure there d be some folks who would maybe want some tech that would provide a portfolio that even allows them to support something like that so not having you get into the weeds about what you think about this or that but more so the idea that we re in a place where we can even develop technology that can do that the fact that that s even an option i mean you ve been doing this 30 years your thoughts on just the ability to even approach something like this because i don t imagine this was even a possibility when you started chris mcmahon 24 29 well yeah a couple things i think are interesting one even folks for example you mentioned there were workers in the sex industry and frankly i pray for those people but many of those people that are in those industries they may have similar values it s not necessarily the people that are different they might be in a different circumstance but they have similar values they still have religious values what have you people that are end users of this whatever their values are would in the old days they sought out an advisor that seemed to share the same values i still do martial arts and i can t tell you how many guys that are martial artists and brazilian jiu jitsu guys come to me because we do brazilian jiu jitsu together that s why they come to our firm 25 17 it s funny right so there s an assumption that if you have some shared commonality they share your values i would challenge all the listeners and advisors to say that s not enough any longer we need to get in the weeds with our advisors and say help me understand how you re aligning my guys what specific tools are you using i must tell you one story of when this religious organization came back and said my goodness 42 of our money is sponsoring pornography they were shocked because their guys are good guys and faithful guys but the guys just didn t have the tools and over time just kind of said oh we re doing it they were rounding out those corners a little bit too much so i would encourage us to no longer just rely upon a relationship or some shared commonality rather let s get specific how are you vetting this out for me how are you vetting this out for me so that i can make sure that i m delivering on the promise to these people because now people aren t just taking our words for it anymore justin they re starting to say wait a second i m gonna double check this because this is important justin l mack 26 22 definitely i think that s powerful for so many things people have access to information people are more motivated and used to doing independent research if it s about something even if it s something small favorite brand of new shampoo to something as vital as your finances people are willing to put in the work to figure out what s real and what s fake and like you said getting specific a lot of power in that and i want to thank you again for coming by and joining us on the financial planning podcast chris and i want to thank everyone for listening to the financial planning podcast

after a poor start to the week european markets have edged modestly higher today except for the ftse 100 which has moved above the 7 500 level helped by a strong performance from hsbc and a more positive vibe from chinese markets europe this outperformance has come about after chinese health authorities signalled significant progress in pushing booster rates higher and pledging to try and push up vaccination rates in older people helping to lift hsbc prudential and standard chartered hsbc shares have also been helped by the bank announcing it had agreed to sell its canadian operation to royal bank of canada for 10bn in cash this appears to be the latest example of asiaâ s largest bank looking to gravitate away towards its core markets in asia and in so doing helping to keep its shareholders onside as it looks to boost the resilience of its core operations as well as improving pay outs in recent years hsbc management have had to tread a careful line between its business in asia markets and its dealings with the chinese government and its uk operations the recent decision to cancel the dividend after pressure from uk regulators did not go down well with asia shareholders with todayâ s decision on its canadian operations perhaps an arbiter of things to come in respect of its uk operation which ping an the banks largest shareholder urging senior management to embark on some form of spin off or separation of its asia assets and the rest of the bank a rebound in oil prices is also helping the energy sector with bp and shell recovering their losses from yesterday the recent weakness in oil prices is prompting speculation that opec might cut production further in order to help support the market coming off the back of its announcement yesterday that it was acquiring c4x discovery for 402m astrazeneca this morning announced it was acquiring neogene therapeutics for 320m unlike c4x discovery neogene is a biotech company which focuses on the discovery development and manufacture of t cell receptor therapies which target cancer cells specifically easyjet shares have slipped back despite delivering an upbeat outlook for its new fiscal year in terms of overall bookings this is encouraging with the second half of the year a significant improvement on the h1 loss of â 545m narrowing its full year loss to â 178m there is still some concern compared to the likes of its peers jet2 and ryanair that it appears to be lagging behind when it comes to maximising its capacity and pushing up its load factors the airline said it expects to see q1 load factor growth of 10bps for 2023 easyjet expects to see a 25 increase to 38m seats and for h2 56m seats a 9 rise â wise shares have slipped back despite reporting a 55 rise in h1 revenues of â 397 4m total income rose 63 to â 416 1m although gross profit margin slipped back by 4 6bps to 63 1 profit before tax came in at â 51 3m total customers increase to 5 5m taking total volumes up to â 51 3bn with â 27bn of that in q2 wise kept its full year guidance of total income growth of between 55 60 unchanged us itâ s been a flat open for us markets after yesterdayâ s falls as higher yields keep investors on the back foot and as we head towards the end of the month tomorrow the continued jawboning from fed officials about the prospect for higher rates is keeping investors cautious and constraining the upside in the short term â â after yesterdayâ s big falls in china linked stocks weâ ve seen a decent rebound in the likes of alibaba jd com and tencent on the slightly more positive sentiment coming out of china â â â â fx itâ s been a quiet day for currencies with the main standout being the australian dollar which has rebounded strongly on the slightly more upbeat mood coming out of china after falling sharply yesterday the pound has shrugged off slightly weaker than expected lending data which showed october mortgage approvals fall to their lowest levels since june 2020 at 59 000 while net consumer credit slowed to an annualised 7 as consumers pared back borrowing as the new energy price cap kicked in the euro has shrugged off weaker than expected headline cpi numbers from spain and germany for november while italian ppi followed in the footsteps of german ppi last week by falling sharply in october to 33 7 down from 52 9 itâ s been notable in the past few days that central bankers on both sides of the atlantic have been at pains to convince the markets that we should prepare for more aggressive action on rates in the coming months whether it be bullard at the federal reserve or president christine lagarde at the ecb unfortunately for them the market doesnâ t appear to be listening and when you think about it why should we for most of last year these same central bankers were assuring us that inflation was transitory despite a lot of evidence in the underlying data to the contrary now they are telling us that they donâ t think that inflation has peaked and that it could go higher while they could well be right the data at the moment doesnâ t appear to support that assertion as we start to see sharp falls in headline ppi now in italy as well as germany and headline cpi also looks as if its starting rise at slower rate its therefore not surprising that having been wrong on transitory markets are reluctant to believe them now â commodities crude oil has rebounded on speculation that opec might consider another output cut in the wake of the recent weakness in oil prices the head of the iea fatih birol has urged caution in this regard saying that the global economy remains in a fragile state and that a production cut could cause more harm than good it if it kills demand even further â gold prices are shrugging off slightly higher us yields with the slightly weaker us dollar helping to reverse the losses of yesterday as it continues to trade in a range between 1 730 and 1 770 â â â â volatility price action for credit suisse stock was elevated once again during mondayâ s session after the bank warned of substantial losses its bond prices slumped and the cost of insuring against default risk rose too the underlying fell by more than 9 driving one day volatility to 101 95 against a one month reading of 67 38 oil prices are back in focus too with west texas intermediate rallying off the lows not seen since the start of the year markets are eyeing a rebalancing by opec at this weekâ s meeting which is lending some support as a result wti moved up from just over 74 a barrel to more than 78 during mondayâ s trade and has moved even higher overnight one day vol sits at 51 9 against 43 64 on the month gasoline prices also ventured higher although gains proved to be unsustainable with weaker demand continuing to take a toll here one day volatility on rbob gasoline printed 51 83 against 44 37 over the month the yen has also been active with those protests in china weighing then upbeat comments from the bank of japan boosting sentiment in the currency overall direction for the last few weeks has been rather limited but yesterdayâ s travel on euro yen from 143 to 145 and most of the way back again was

new york new york u s stocks were uneasy early wednesday following a release of a raft of economic data but were jolted sharply higher by remarks from federal reserve chair jerome powell in a speech before the brookings institution think tank in washington later in the day the data was somewhat mixed edward moya senior market analyst at oanda told cnbc wednesday but it does show there s a lot of resilience in this economy and it still is highlighting a labor market that is weakening but is still in relatively good shape i think that we re not going to get any answers on what policy will be like at the end of next year based on these reports the fed chair noted that while the fight against inflation was a long way from being won the fed could begin moderating rate rises as early as december powell however warned interest rates could go higher from where they are now and stay high for longer he also highlighted the tightness of the labor market in the labor market demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time thus another condition we are looking for is the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market he said jerome powell s full remarks follow the end of this article the dow jones meantime which had been down more than 200 points earlier reversed sharply and soared 737 24 points or 2 18 percent to close wednesday at 34 589 77 the nasdaq composite more than doubled that performance percentage wise by

center on fiscal and monetary policy brookings institution washington d c 30 november 2022 today i will offer a progress report on the federal open market committee s fomc efforts to restore price stability to the u s economy for the benefit of the american people the report must begin by acknowledging the reality that inflation remains far too high my colleagues and i are acutely aware that high inflation is imposing significant hardship straining budgets and shrinking what paychecks will buy this is especially painful for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation price stability is the responsibility of the federal reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy without price stability the economy does not work for anyone in particular without price stability we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all we currently estimate that 12 month personal consumption expenditures pce inflation through october ran at 6 0 percent while october inflation data received so far showed a welcome surprise to the downside these are a single month s data which followed upside surprises over the previous two months down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases it will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining by any standard inflation remains much too high for purposes of this discussion i will focus my comments on core pce inflation which omits the food and energy inflation components which have been lower recently but are quite volatile our inflation goal is for total inflation of course as food and energy prices matter a great deal for household budgets but core inflation often gives a more accurate indicator of where overall inflation is headed twelve month core pce inflation stands at 5 0 percent in our october estimate approximately where it stood last december when policy tightening was in its early stages over 2022 core inflation rose a few tenths above 5 percent and fell a few tenths below but it mainly moved sideways so when will inflation come down i could answer this question by pointing to the inflation forecasts of private sector forecasters or of fomc participants which broadly show a significant decline over the next year but forecasts have been predicting just such a decline for more than a year while inflation has moved stubbornly sideways the truth is that the path ahead for inflation remains highly uncertain for now let s put aside the forecasts and look instead to the macroeconomic conditions we think we need to see to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time for starters we need to raise interest rates to a level that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent there is considerable uncertainty about what rate will be sufficient although there is no doubt that we have made substantial progress raising our target range for the federal funds rate by 3 75 percentage points since march as our last postmeeting statement indicates we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate it seems to me likely that the ultimate level of rates will need to be somewhat higher than thought at the time of the september meeting and summary of economic projections i will return to policy at the end of my comments but for now i will simply say that we have more ground to cover we are tightening the stance of policy to slow growth in aggregate demand slowing demand growth should allow supply to catch up with demand and restore the balance that will yield stable prices over time restoring that balance is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth last year the ongoing reopening of the economy boosted real gross domestic product gdp growth to a very strong 5 7 percent this year gdp was roughly flat through the first three quarters and indicators point to modest growth this quarter which seems likely to bring the year in with very modest growth overall several factors contributed to this slowing growth including the waning effects of reopening and of pandemic fiscal support the global implications of russia s war against ukraine and our policy actions which tightened financial conditions and are affecting economic activity particularly in interest sensitive sectors such as housing we can say that demand growth has slowed and we expect that this growth will need to remain at a slower pace for a sustained period despite the tighter policy and slower growth over the past year we have not seen clear progress on slowing inflation to assess what it will take to get inflation down it is useful to break core inflation into three component categories core goods inflation housing services inflation and inflation in core services other than housing core goods inflation has moved down from very high levels over the course of 2022 while housing services inflation has risen rapidly inflation in core services ex housing has fluctuated but shown no clear trend i will discuss each of these items in turn early in the pandemic goods prices began rising rapidly as abnormally strong demand was met by pandemic hampered supply reports from businesses and many indicators suggest that supply chain issues are now easing both fuel and nonfuel import prices have fallen in recent months and indicators of prices paid by manufacturers have moved down while 12 month core goods inflation remains elevated at 4 6 percent it has fallen nearly 3 percentage points from earlier in the year it is far too early to declare goods inflation vanquished but if current trends continue goods prices should begin to exert downward pressure on overall inflation in coming months housing services inflation measures the rise in the price of all rents and the rise in the rental equivalent cost of owner occupied housing unlike goods inflation housing services inflation has continued to rise and now stands at 7 1 percent over the past 12 months housing inflation tends to lag other prices around inflation turning points however because of the slow rate at which the stock of rental leases turns over 2the market rate on new leases is a timelier indicator of where overall housing inflation will go over the next year or so measures of 12 month inflation in new leases rose to nearly 20 percent during the pandemic but have been falling sharply since about midyear as figure 3 shows however overall housing services inflation has continued to rise as existing leases turn over and jump in price to catch up with the higher level of rents for new leases this is likely to continue well into next year but as long as new lease inflation keeps falling we would expect housing services inflation to begin falling sometime next year indeed a decline in this inflation underlies most forecasts of declining inflation finally we come to core services other than housing this spending category covers a wide range of services from health care and education to haircuts and hospitality this is the largest of our three categories constituting more than half of the core pce index thus this may be the most important category for understanding the future evolution of core inflation because wages make up the largest cost in delivering these services the labor market holds the key to understanding inflation in this category in the labor market demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time thus another condition we are looking for is the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market signs of elevated labor market tightness emerged suddenly in mid 2021 the unemployment rate at the time was much higher than the 3 5 percent that had prevailed without major signs of tightness before the pandemic employment was still millions below its level on the eve of the pandemic looking back we can see that a significant and persistent labor supply shortfall opened up during the pandemic a shortfall that appears unlikely to fully close anytime soon comparing the current labor force with the congressional budget office s pre pandemic forecast of labor force growth reveals a current labor force shortfall of roughly 3 1 2 million people this shortfall reflects both lower than expected population growth and a lower labor force participation rate participation dropped sharply at the onset of the pandemic because of many factors including sickness caregiving and fear of infection many forecasters expected that participation would move back up fairly quickly as the pandemic faded and for workers in their prime working years it mostly has overall participation however remains well below pre pandemic trends some of the participation gap reflects workers who are still out of the labor force because they are sick with covid 19 or continue to suffer lingering symptoms from previous covid infections long covid but recent research by fed economists finds that the participation gap is now mostly due to excess retirements that is retirements in excess of what would have been expected from population aging alone these excess retirements might now account for more than 2 million of the 31 2 million shortfall in the labor force what explains these excess retirements health issues have surely played a role as covid has posed a particularly large threat to the lives and health of the elderly in addition many older workers lost their jobs in the early stages of the pandemic when layoffs were historically high the cost of finding new employment may have appeared particularly large for these workers given pandemic related disruptions to the work environment and health concerns 9 also gains in the stock market and rising house prices in the first two years of the pandemic contributed to an increase in wealth that likely facilitated early retirement for some people the data so far do not suggest that excess retirements are likely to unwind because of retirees returning to the labor force older workers are still retiring at higher rates and retirees do not appear to be returning to the labor force in sufficient numbers to meaningfully reduce the total number of excess retirees the second factor contributing to the labor supply shortfall is slower growth in the working age population the combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge in deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about 1 1 2 million missing workers policies to support labor supply are not the domain of the fed our tools work principally on demand without advocating any particular policy however i will say that policies to support labor force participation could over time bring benefits to the workers who join the labor force and support overall economic growth such policies would take time to implement and have their effects however for the near term a moderation of labor demand growth will be required to restore balance to the labor market currently the unemployment rate is at 3 7 percent near 50 year lows and job openings exceed available workers by about 4 million that is about 1 7 job openings for every person looking for work so far we have seen only tentative signs of moderation of labor demand with slower gdp growth this year job gains have stepped down from more than 450 000 per month over the first seven months of the year to about 290 000 per month over the past three months but this job growth remains far in excess of the pace needed to accommodate population growth over time about 100 000 per month by many estimates job openings have fallen by about 1 5 million this year but remain higher than at any time before the pandemic wage growth too shows only tentative signs of returning to balance some measures of wage growth have ticked down recently but the declines are very modest so far relative to earlier increases and still leave wage growth well above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time to be clear strong wage growth is a good thing but for wage growth to be sustainable it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation let s sum up this review of economic conditions that we think we need to see to bring inflation down to 2 percent growth in economic activity has slowed to well below its longer run trend and this needs to be sustained bottlenecks in goods production are easing and goods price inflation appears to be easing as well and this too must continue housing services inflation will probably keep rising well into next year but if inflation on new leases continues to fall we will likely see housing services inflation begin to fall later next year finally the labor market which is especially important for inflation in core services ex housing shows only tentative signs of rebalancing and wage growth remains well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability returning to monetary policy my fomc colleagues and i are strongly committed to restoring price stability after our november meeting we noted that we anticipated that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate in order to attain a policy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to move inflation down to 2 percent over time monetary policy affects the economy and inflation with uncertain lags and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt thus it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting given our progress in tightening policy the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level it is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy we will stay the course until the job is done photo credit big news network

for most equity strategies diversified across global markets this year s results will be painful short of a dramatic run higher between now and the end of 2022 red ink will prevail but when losses dominate it s time to start looking for bargains the longer your investment horizon the more confidence you can muster that the losses year to date imply relatively attractive return expectations but the analysis is especially tricky at the moment as several risk factors dominate the outlook including the war in ukraine elevated rising and signs that recession is near baron rothschild famously advised that the time to buy is when there s blood in the streets by that measure markets arguably offer an opportunity to go risk on at a point of maximum pessimism reviewing year to date results for the world s equity regions through a set of proxy etfs certainly paint a grim profile with the exception of shares in latin america the main slices of world stocks are deep in the red in 2022 ranging from a relatively mild 14 6 haircut for stocks in africa to a devastating 71 0 crash in eastern european markets the world benchmark based on vanguard total world stock index fund is in the hole by 16 5 so far this year the good news vt has rallied in recent weeks inspiring hope that the worst has passed no one can reliably call bottoms or tops in real time and so mere mortals are once again left to decide if we re at an opportune point to start rebalancing in favor of higher equity risk there s a case for shifting to a risk on posture if only partially on the assumption that that the losses so far in 2022 have materially boosted the long run expected return for stocks the caveat is that the trend still looks bearish using vt as a yardstick the latest rally has lifted the fund to just below its 200 day moving average encouraging but until vt moves decisively higher and holds its position the latest bounce looks like one more bear market rally the big picture question for investors is deciding if they re more comfortable being early or late for the next bull market either way you re going to suffer an opportunity cost a third option is to diversify the risk on trades through time redeploying capital in stocks at regular intervals and thereby mitigating the losses from timing errors that surely lie in wait for most investors on that basis nibbling at markets now is appealing using a set of moving averages to monitor trending conditions for all the funds listed above suggests the recent wave of selling was excessive that s no assurance that we ll avoid even lower lows but after a year of sharp losses it s reasonable to start throwing some money at equity markets bearish news will likely continue to weigh on sentiment for the near term and perhaps longer but markets are always pricing in the future that s always a messy affair and this time is no different this may be one more false dawn but at some point a genuine bottom will arrive there s nothing wrong with waiting for confirmation that the bear market has ended but for investors with a relatively high tolerance for risk the current climate looks intriguing a key factor is deciding if the federal reserve s close to pivoting on interest rate hikes on that point the crowd is looking for fresh clues in today s speech by fed chairman jerome powell expectations are high that he ll hint that policy tightening will begin to ease hope springs eternal again this is a fed made recession so eventually when he does pivot the market should move higher pretty quickly says steve grasso ceo of grasso global
in a nearly 90 minute interview at the new york times dealbook summit on wednesday disgraced ftx cofounder and former ceo sam bankman fried said he didn t try to commit fraud as his crypto empire collapsed in a matter of days earlier this month speaking with andrew ross sorkin remotely from the bahamas bankman fried known as sbf in the crypto world stated i did not knowingly commingle funds between ftx and the trading firm almadea research which he also co founded in his first reply bankman fried asserted i didn t ever try to commit fraud on anyone i was shocked andrew ross sorkin speaks with ftx founder sam bankman fried during the new york times dealbook summit in the appel room at the jazz at lincoln center on november 30 2022 in new york city photo by michael m santiago getty images at the beginning of this year bankman fried s offshore exchange and u s subsidiary carried a combined valuation of 40 billion according to data from crunchbase by the end of the first quarter bankman fried s personal wealth had risen to over 25 billion according to the bloomberg billionaire index less than seven months later the 30 year old signed his crypto empire into chapter 11 bankruptcy and resigned as ceo ftx and affiliate firms owe more than a million customers an estimated 8 billion assets it doesn t have on hand i ve had a bad month bankman fried told sorkin this has not been any fun for me but that s not what matters here what matters here is the millions of customers what matters here is the stakeholders in ftx and what matters is trying to help them out asked about his personal finances bankman fried said i think i might have one working credit card left in a tuesday interview with axios he said he no idea where his current net worth stood am i allowed to say a negative number he joked later offering he had 100 000 in my bank account last i checked i did not have the bandwidth in the past 30 days bankman fried has faced financial ruin and become the key subject of both civil and criminal investigations started by the u s justice department securities and exchange commission texas state securities board as well as bahamian authorities appearing visibly nervous at one time spilling a lacroix on his shirt bankman fried tried to insist on a lack of understanding about the interconnectedness between ftx and alameda trading including any access to customer funds alameda may have had in bankman fried s telling from ftx s earliest days he was concerned about the conflict of interest between the exchange business and alameda bankman fried s ignorance about the inner workings of his own business in his telling were presented as a deliberate choice i was worried about the conflict of interest of being too involved bankman fried said i hadn t been running alameda or thinking about its finances or making those decisions pressed about the source of profits for his combined businesses bankman fried said i think alameda made trading profits but ftx made profits as well ftx had been growing profitable business he added that i did not have the bandwidth or attention to run alameda and ftx at once by late november 6 i m very nervous ftx s whirlwind collapse started as a public spectacle on november 2 when a report from coindesk revealed leaked financials of alameda research alameda s balance sheet showed not only did the bulk of its 14 6 billion in claimed assets come from holding crypto tokens created by bankman fried enterprises but also 92 of its 8 billion in liabilities were tied up in loans clearly i was not nearly cautious enough from the extreme downside perspective bankman fried said wednesday attributing much of his company s downfall to plunging crypto prices over the course of 2022 in a convoluted and at times circular telling of how ftx ultimately collapsed bankman fried flagged november 6 as a crucial turning point by late november 6 i m very nervous that things might end quite badly bankman fried said that day changpeng zhao ceo of rival crypto exchange binance said his company planned to sell their sizable holdings in ftx s crypto token ftt due to recent revelations the following day in a since deleted tweet bankman fried said ftx has enough to cover all client holdings we don t invest client assets even in treasuries we ve been processing all withdrawals and will continue to be source wayback machine behind the scenes internal communications viewed by the new york times showed in his final days as ceo bankman fried insisted he could find a way to keep ftx running despite mounting evidence and ftx lawyers pointing to the opposite on wednesday bankman fried reiterated his view that there had been a lot of fairly strong interest in financing a bailout of ftx right until the bitter end by november 11 just five days after bankman fried said he grew nervous about problems at his company ftx had filed for bankruptcy never in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here ftx s new ceo john jay ray the same lawyer responsible for winding down enron in 2002 said in a november 17 filing ftx u s at times on wednesday bankman fried took pains to draw a distinction between ftx s u s business and its offshore exchange bankman fried said ftx u s is currently fully solvent to my knowledge but did not offer an explanation for why the company filed bankruptcy at various points bankman fried suggested ftx s u s business could open customer withdrawals today and meet their full obligations some insiders have told yahoo finance that the businesses may have been too difficult to untangle asked by sorkin whether he d considered returning to the u s bankman fried said i ve thought about it and that to knowledge he d be able to travel back to the u s in reference to hearings scheduled by lawmakers regarding the collapse of ftx bankman fried said i would not be surprised if sometime i am talking about what happened to our representatives or wherever else is most appropriate asked by sorkin whether his legal team had been advising him to give an extensive interview to the new york times bankman fried said no they are very much not the classic advice right don t say anything recede into a hole that s not who i am that s not who i want to be and i think i have a duty to talk an interview between bankman fried and george stephanopoulos is set to air on good morning america thursday morning i don t know what my far future is asked about his future on wednesday bankman fried said i don t know what my far future is when you fast forward i have no idea what i m going to be doing a long time from now he then steered the discussion back towards his desire to be helpful wherever i can in getting customer funds returned near the end of the interview sorkin asked bankman fried what he d tell customers of other exchanges who were concerned about the safety of their assets so look i don t know exactly what s going on at other exchanges bankman fried said i can tell you what i would think as a customer look for the things ftx should ve been able to supply when asked by sorkin whether bankman fried had been truthful during his interview on wednesday the disgraced founder demurred i was as truthful as i m knowledgable to be bankman fried said there are some things i wish i knew more about but yes i was when pressed if bankman fried agreed that he had lied at times during his leadership of ftx bankman fried said i don t know of times when i lied also conceding that there were times he served as a marketer for ftx s various businesses i wish i d spent more time dwelling on the downsides and less time thinking about the upsides bankman

the federal reserve bank has signaled a slower pace of interest rate hikes what happened uncertainty regarding the length and duration of the downturn have hung over the market like an anvil this year with many investors afraid to buy the dip for fear of suffering further declines add to that the federal reserve bank s relentless campaign of rising interest rates to combat persistent inflation and it s no wonder that consumers and investors alike have shifted their behavior based on the tough macroeconomic conditions however the fed changed its tone today suggesting the pace of future interest rate hikes will moderate perhaps as soon as next month with that as a backdrop popular faang stocks were squarely in rally mode wednesday afternoon netflix nflx 1 71 surged 9 2 alphabet googl 0 30 goog 0 21 jumped 5 4 honorary member microsoft msft 0 23 climbed 5 8 while apple aapl 1 92 and amazon amzn 0 16 each rallied 4 5 by the time the market closed on wednesday there was no company specific news that even came close to explaining the magnitude of these broad based gains this suggests that investors were reacting to the potential for slowing interest rate hikes and an overall improvement in the beleaguered economy so what federal reserve chair jerome powell delivered a highly anticipated speech at the brookings institution in washington d c on wednesday market participants were on the edge of their seats hoping to glean insight into how the central bank plans to continue its ongoing battle with inflation wall street heard exactly what it was hoping to hear as powell s comments suggested that the fed would begin to slow the pace and tenor of interest rate hikes beginning as early as december it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down powell said in his speech the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting while powell s missive didn t provide specific details the remarks seemed to suggest that december s expected interest rate hike could be lower than the 0 75 rate hikes that the fed has levied in each of the past four outings the increase in early november brought the federal funds rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 its highest rate since early 2008 and the sixth increase so far this year the combination of near 40 year high inflation and the unrelenting cadence of rising interest rates has threatened to push an already fragile economy into recession this prospect has weighed on the major market indexes with the s p 500 and nasdaq composite down 16 and 30 respectively from highs reached late last year powell s comments were a breath of fresh air suggesting the worst may be behind us now what when we talk about faang or faang m stocks we are talking about some of the most popular stocks among investors facebook parent meta platforms apple amazon netflix google which rebranded as alphabet microsoft the faang stocks have been among the best market performers over the past decade but their performance has been mixed during the downturn demand for apple s iphones has held up remarkably thus far but the holidays will soon test consumer resolve netflix was savaged by its first subscriber decline in more than a decade a return to growth helped the stock rebound but it s still nearly 50 off its 2021 highs declines in both e commerce and advertising spending have beaten down amazon and alphabet respectively with investors waiting in the wings to see if or when growth returns microsoft serves both business and consumer markets and each of its major segments has taken a hit powell s comments gave investors the excuse they needed to view the glass as half full today as they bought up faang m stocks which are down between 19 and 49 so far this year furthermore previously lofty valuations have become much more reasonable over the past year though still not cheap in terms of traditional valuation metrics for example microsoft still trades for nearly 8 times next year s sales while apple has a forward price to sales ratio of 5 alphabet and netflix are both trading for 4 times next year s sales while amazon the most reasonably priced of the group trades at less than 2 times forward sales putting it squarely in bargain basement territory i would argue that in better economic times investors awarded these stocks with premium valuations due to their consistent growth given their history of outperforming the broader markets and doing so by a wide measure now looks like the time to add to these market leaders or buy an initial position before they start to soar

issuers in the southeast are reigniting the prepaid energy bond market leading a wave of demand for the long term fixed rate natural gas agreements buoyed by federal stimulus and stronger than expected recent tax collections traditional municipal markets rallied in the months and years after initial covid 19 lockdown measures demand for prepaid natural gas transactions however which are structured as tax exempt bond sale agreements between a municipal utility provider and private energy supplier remained stubbornly low despite a strong hike in issuances prior to the pandemic in a report moody s investors service blamed unstable economic conditions and a budget crunch at all levels of government for the drop off prepaid transactions are now particularly appealing for municipal entities quite simply because they get to buy gas at a discount to market said dennis pidherny of fitch ratings along with a general decline in gas consumption during the early months of the covid 19 pandemic that unsteadied markets municipalities began to focus on short term budgetary needs and the credit agency recorded an 80 dip in the prepaid issuances rated from an annual average of 7 8 billion in related issuances prior to the pandemic to less than 1 4 billion in 2020 an uptick in activity in the second half of 2021 followed by a strong performance for prepaids in 2022 resulted in four times the number of deals this year than two years ago evidence of a changing equation presenting municipal utilities with renewed economic motivations to pursue long term energy arrangements once again said dennis pidherny a managing director at fitch ratings prepaid transactions are now particularly appealing for municipal entities quite simply because they get to buy gas at a discount to market pidherny said that s what hooks them into these transactions that s the motivation and the incentive and there really is no shortage of utilities that wouldn t love to buy gas at a discount energy consumers and providers have had to contend with a general increase and ever present instability in the price of natural gas for most of the year along with inflation russia s war on ukraine has had a profound effect on global energy prices as some of the world s largest consumers of crude oil uphold absolute bans on energy imports from one of its largest suppliers despite the u s tapping its strategic crude oil reserves earlier in the year in an attempt to bring prices down low production quotas from other global suppliers kept the market in a squeeze rippling down the supply chain and sending municipal utility providers both large and small in search of stable prices amid the unstable environment prepaid deals often hold certain unique features that create robust guardrails appealing to both buyers and suppliers most transactions are issued as 30 year notes with mandatory 10 year redemptions offering municipalities flexibility to address market fluctuations and readdress contracts over the mid term it s a reset after 10 years to recalculate the discount and if the offers not good enough you don t have to buy gas pidherny said that s the kind of the tenor in the bond market where you could actually generate enough savings and enough discount to make it work the bonds are issued through special purpose conduits and backed by an increasing number of large and credit healthy investment banks that ve began to seek profits in the prepaid market another feature of the transactions that help protect everybody involved pidherny said ratings on the bonds are often linked to the issuer default rating of those specific banks in november fitch upgraded seven separate series of prepaid gas bonds to a plus from a in line with an upgrade given to morgan stanley the guarantor and middleman of between buyer and supplier on the upgraded deals in october 2021 bloomberg reported an increased in prepaid issuances at the tail end of the year as more banks waded into market driven by a growing gap between tax exempt and taxable yields as banks borrow at a tax exempt rate the decision is almost an arbitrage between taxable rates and tax exempt rates which tend to move up and down over time pidherny said if you look back historically even after the 2008 financial crisis there weren t a lot of investors that were really eager to sign up so banks really couldn t sell that debt at attractive levels he said now as their credit quality has gotten better they ve been able to tap the markets at pretty attractive costs and reinvest in reasonably good returns all but one of fitch s recent upgrades was for local energy providers in the southeast pointing to a potential return of a trend that saw the region as a leader in the prepaid natural gas market in the years preceding the pandemic in 2018 the municipal energy providers across the 11 state region struck more prepaid agreements than anywhere else in the nation with the six largest issuances in georgia alabama and kentucky totaling 5 2 billion those deals also ranked among the largest on any municipal financing deals contracted that year in the region after the economic interruptions presented by the covid 19 pandemic made such transactions uneconomical the shifts seen in the energy markets today have made them appealing once more whether the volume of prepaid gas transactions will see a corresponding uptick elsewhere in the nation is not clear individual states have reacted differently to shifting economic tides propelling them from one crisis to the next pidherny said in terms of the motivation for municipalities getting into these transactions as themselves that discount is not necessarily guaranteed he said to the extent that you re not able to achieve that discount then the transactions can actually wind down
by julie steenhuysen chicago reuters swiss drugmaker roche is closing down most clinical trials of its experimental alzheimer s drug gantenerumab after it failed to slow advance of the mind robbing disease in a pair of large late stage studies the company said on wednesday roche presented full results of twin trials at an alzheimer s meeting in san francisco after announcing in november that the drug had failed in the two trials unlike eisai co otc ltd and biogen inc nasdaq s lecanemab which appears to be on track for u s regulatory approval after presenting successful trial results on tuesday roche s drug did not show a statistically significant benefit in patients with mild cognitive impairment and early alzheimer s disease both drugs are designed to remove forms of the protein beta amyloid from the brain sticky plaques believed to play a major role in the disease while eisai s infusion succeeded in slowing the advance of alzheimer s by 27 after 18 months roche s drug reduced decline by just 8 in the graduate i study and 6 in the graduate ii study compared with a placebo after two years a key difference may have been in the drug s ability to clear amyloid from the brain in a presentation on wednesday researchers said gantenerumab which is given by injection only achieved amyloid clearance in 28 of patients in the graduate i trial and 25 in graduate ii after two years half of what the company expected to see lecanemab by contrast cleared amyloid in 68 of those in the study after 18 months dr howard fillit chief science officer at the alzheimer s drug discovery nasdaq foundation said there are a number of reasons why roche s drug may have failed including differences in chemistry dosing and the way it was administered via injection versus infusion but the fact that the drug failed to remove amyloid deposits in the brain as expected clearly played a role he added the field of alzheimer s research is littered with failure and disappointment including for several drugs in the same class and previous efforts to prove gantenerumab s worth in 2014 the drug failed to show a benefit when given at a lower dose among patients with mild alzheimer s and it failed again in 2020 in a washington university school of medicine trial of patients with an inherited form of alzheimer s obviously within the class some drugs are working and some aren t fillet said a roche spokesman said in an emailed statement that the company will stop all gantenerumab studies in early alzheimer s disease including extension studies of the graduate trials and the skyline phase iii study in patients with evidence of amyloid in the brain but no signs of cognitive decline in the graduate studies the level of amyloid removal was lower than expected we expect the same lower effect in the skyline population and consider this insufficient to continue the spokesman said roche is still testing a different formulation of gantenerumab called trontinemab designed to ferry the drug across the blood brain barrier protective blood vessels that prevent chemicals in the bloodstream from entering the brain in hopes of getting more of the treatment into the brain we remain committed to alzheimer s disease and will direct our focus to new and potentially improved approaches for new treatments rachelle doody roche s global head of neurodegeneration drug development said in a statement

on world aids day 2022 viiv healthcare releases data from a survey investigating outdated attitudes towards hiv as part of the hiv in view campaign london business wire viiv healthcare the global specialist hiv company majority owned by gsk with pfizer and shionogi as shareholders today announced new data from a perceptions survey which unveils a widespread gap in public knowledge and understanding of hiv worldwide the data found that three quarters of people 74 believe that there are still negative perceptions when it comes to people living with hiv and that one in six adults agree that if a friend or colleague was living with hiv they might look at them negatively while the majority of people surveyed did report feeling comfortable with physical contact including holding hands 76 or hugging 75 only 1 in 2 people would feel comfortable dating someone living with hiv concerningly the survey also found that a quarter of adults 25 believe that it is not appropriate for employees to talk about hiv in the workplace a factor continuing to perpetuate hiv as a taboo subject 1 the survey conducted online by opinium in 2022 collected insights from 8 000 adults across eight countries including the uk france germany canada australia japan south africa and brazil it also explored perceptions around language and the role it plays in how hiv is viewed and addressed where 70 agree that the use of stigmatising language could negatively impact the mental health and prevent at risk communities from accessing hiv prevention services 80 of respondents feel that it is their responsibility to ensure the use of appropriate and non stigmatising language when it comes to hiv viiv is one of many organisations advocating for people first language to eliminate inappropriate and stigmatising terms such as people infected with hiv or catch hiv which continue to fuel negative attitudes and outdated perceptions when we talk about hiv in conversation in the media within clinical settings policies and guidelines the use of stigmatising language can marginalise people living with or affected by hiv says hiv physician dr laura waters chair of british hiv association and founder of the people first charter person first language must be the absolute norm to help challenge hiv related stigma and discrimination we ve come a long way but too many examples persist and we need a unified voice to challenge these hiv in view campaign collaborator and drag superstar charity kase says hiv has changed members of the hiv community can lead vibrant rewarding lives and deserve to live peacefully without fear of judgement it s encouraging to see that a large number of people across the world are accepting of people living with hiv and their experiences but clearly more needs to be done to address the lingering misconception from personal conversations to the words we use on dating apps stigmatising language continues to stand in the way of us living in a truly open society that is free from intolerance i hope these findings open the world s eyes to how far we ve come in the 40 years since hiv arrived on the scene but also how far there is to go it is clear that there is an urgent need to increase knowledge and awareness of hiv dismantle associated stigma and ultimately reinforce the need to raise hiv on the global health agenda says deborah waterhouse chief executive officer of viiv healthcare this world aids day inclusivity and health equity remain at the forefront of our hiv efforts and we urge every person to come together to help address inequalities fight hiv stigma and discrimination which are currently holding back our progress of ending aids worldwide these data were collected in support of the hiv in view campaign which aims to challenge negative

how much things have changed for many people living with hiv a far cry from the fear once associated with the virus the corresponding in conversation video series was developed to show honest

jerome powell told an audience at the brookings institution wednesday that the central bank can afford to ease back on its tighter monetary policy at its december meeting due to wrap up dec 14 the lagged effect of higher rates already taken in 2022 plus the drawing down of the size of the fed s balance sheet through quantitative tightening mean it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down powell said the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting said the 69 year old fed chair in response to powell s remarks the s p 500 quickly gained to about 3970 vs about 3950 before the address scott schnipper jeff cox

washington ap the federal reserve will push rates higher than previously expected and keep them there for an extended period chair jerome powell said wednesday in remarks likely intended to underscore the fed s single minded focus on combating stubborn inflation yet in a speech at the brookings institution powell also signaled that the fed may increase its key interest rate by a half point at its december meeting a smaller boost after four straight three quarter point hikes rate increases could then fall to a more traditional quarter point size at its february and march meetings based on previous fed forecasts powell said the fed is seeking to increase its benchmark rate by enough to slow the economy hiring and wage growth but not so much as to send the u s into recession it has lifted the rate six times this year to a range of 3 75 to 4 the highest in 15 years those increases have sharply boosted mortgage rates causing home sales to plunge while also raising costs for most other consumer and business loans we think that slowing down at this point is a good way to balance the risks powell said the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting which will take place dec 13 14 financial markets rallied in response to powell s suggestion that rate increases will slow the s p 500 jumped 122 points or 3 1 it had fallen before powell spoke but powell also stressed that smaller hikes shouldn t be taken as a sign the fed will let up on its inflation fight anytime soon it is likely that restoring price stability will require holding interest rates at a restrictive level for some time powell said history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy powell acknowledged there has been some good news on the inflation front with the cost of goods such as cars furniture and appliances in retreat he also said that rents and other housing costs which make up about a third of the consumer price index were likely to decline next year but the cost of services which includes dining out traveling and health care are still rising at a fast clip and will likely be much harder to rein in he said despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability powell said the fed chair singled out strong hiring and wage gains as the main driver keeping services costs high paychecks on average have jumped about 5 in the past year before inflation the fastest pace in four decades we want wages to go up strongly but they ve got to go up at a level that is consistent with 2 inflation over time powell said wage growth at about 3 5 a year would fit that criteria he said slowing the increases in paychecks will likely be difficult he said because robust wage gains are largely being driven by a labor shortage that began during the pandemic and shows no sign of ending soon fed officials had hoped to see the number of people working or looking for work rebound more strongly as the pandemic waned but that hasn t happened the lack of workers reflects a jump in early retirements the deaths of several hundred thousand working age people from covid 19 and a sharp decline in immigration and slower population growth powell said with the supply of workers limited the fed s higher interest rate policies will have to reduce businesses demand for new employees to meet the lower level of supply he added economists generally expect that will mean rising layoffs and a higher unemployment rate with the economy potentially falling into recession but powell in remarks during a question and answer session held out hope that employers could cut the near record high number of job openings they have posted rather than lay off large numbers of workers according to a government report earlier wednesday businesses have pared their job vacancies by about 1 5 million since march though there are still about 1 7 open jobs for every unemployed worker that ratio forces many companies to offer higher pay to attract and keep staff still powell said that employers could cut those openings further while engaging in only limited layoffs as the fed s rate hikes slow borrowing and spending i do continue to believe there is a path to a soft or softish landing unemployment goes up but it s not a hard landing it s not a severe recession he said last month s inflation report showed that prices rose 7 7 in october from a year earlier straining many families budgets that is down however from a 9 1 peak in june fed officials hope that by tightening credit they can slow consumer and business spending reduce hiring and wage growth and cool inflation powell said the fed s efforts have slowed demand and will have to keep it slow for an extended period
the federal reserve s jerome powell says inflation war is not over says central bank may scale back pace of interest rate hikes in december says it is a long way to go in restoring price stability washington the u s central bank could scale back the pace of its interest rate hikes as soon as december federal reserve chair jerome powell said on wednesday while warning that the fight against inflation was far from over and key questions remain unanswered including how high rates will ultimately need to rise and for how long it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting powell said in a speech to the brookings institution think tank in washington but in remarks emphasizing the work left to be done in controlling inflation powell said that issue was far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level while the fed chief did not indicate his estimated terminal rate powell said it is likely to be somewhat higher than the 4 6 indicated by policymakers in their september projections he said curing inflation will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time a comment that appeared to lean against market expectations the u s central bank could begin cutting rates next year as the economy slows we will stay the course until the job is done powell said noting that even though some data points to inflation slowing next year we have a long way to go in restoring price stability despite the tighter policy and slower growth over the past year we have not seen clear progress on slowing inflation the fed s response to the fastest outbreak of u s inflation in 40 years has been a similarly abrupt increase in interest rates with a half percentage point increase expected at its dec 13 14 meeting the central bank will have lifted its overnight policy rate from near zero as of march to the 4 25 4 50 range the swiftest change in rates since former fed chair paul volcker was battling an even worse rise in prices that has made home mortgages and other forms of credit more expensive for consumers and businesses it has not however caused any appreciable impact on the u s job market where the current 3 7 unemployment rate has led some policymakers to argue they are free to tighten rates further without much risk but it has also had no convincing impact yet on inflation a fact that has left open just how much further the fed may need to raise rates into what it refers to as restrictive territory designed to slow the economy powell said fed estimates of inflation in october showed its preferred measure still rising at about triple the central bank s 2 target long way to go powell s remarks ignited a robust rally in equity and bond markets which have taken a pounding this year on the back of the fed s aggressive rate hikes the benchmark s p 500 index shot into positive territory and was last up by about 1 5 on the day and bond yields which move in the opposite direction to their prices all tumbled the yield on the 2 year treasury note the maturity most sensitive to fed rate expectations dropped to about 4 47 from 4 52 the dollar weakened against a basket of major trading partners currencies in rate futures markets traders added to the prevailing bets that the fed would slow its pace of rate hikes at its meeting in two weeks you can t keep raising rates as quickly as they were doing it said rick meckler at cherry lane investments in new vernon new jersey that said investors always like the comfort of hearing it directly from the fed chair powell noted that while goods inflation has been easing the cost of housing is likely to continue to rise into next year while key price measures for services remain high and the labor market tight growth in economic activity has slowed to well below its longer run trend powell said but for inflation to slow this needs to be sustained bottlenecks in goods production are easing and goods price inflation appears to be easing as well and this too must continue but we will likely see housing services inflation begin to fall later next year he said citing data released earlier on wednesday that showed still about 1 7 job openings for each unemployed person he said that so far we have seen only tentative signs of moderation of labor demand despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability

bhofack2 istock via getty images having grown up in suburban chicago i ve been eating portillo s nasdaq ptlo since i was a kid as i became interested in business and investing i d always wanted to be a part owner of portillo s which has an iconic brand loyal customer base and large crowds for lunch and dinner with shares off 50 over the past year i thought now might finally be my chance to own a piece of the action despite the significant fall in the share price portillo s continues to trade at lofty multiples of ebitda and earnings further the company faces meaningful near term headwinds as inflationary forces drive up expenses and a potentially weakening consumer environment as the economy slows in addition insiders recently dumped 8 million shares less than a week after the company s investor day in november lastly while i expect that portillo s will continue to expand its restaurant base in the years to come unit economics in new markets have less attractive economics than its home chicagoland market overview founded in 1963 by dick portillo portillo s is an iconic fast food restaurant featuring italian beef sandwiches hot dogs hamburgers and salads with an average ticket of 10 per guest in 2014 private equity firm berkshire partners acquired portillo s which had 38 restaurants at the time for a reported 1 billion price tag under berkshire partners ownership the focus has been unit expansion in the past 8 years portillo s has nearly doubled its footprint to 71 locations of which 47 are in greater chicago another 17 restaurants are located in adjacent midwestern states the company came public in 2021 while the ipo was priced at 20 per share the stock soared to a price of 50 before falling to a current price of 19 30 in november berkshire partners sold a meaningful portion of its stake geographic footprint investor presentation in recent years the company has expanded beyond its core midwestern footprint to fast growing sunbelt states florida and arizona with plans for texas while these restaurants have been successful as discussed in the next section average unit sales and profitability are well below the exceptional results achieved in chicagoland lower unit volumes lower margins outside chicagoland portillo s has fantastic unit economics in its home market of chicago as shown below chicagoland restaurants generate nearly 10 million in annual revenue at a 30 restaurant level excluding corporate ebitda margins within the chicagoland market portillo s generates industry leading sale and profitability well in excess of peers like shake shack shak and chipotle cmg average unit volume and restaurant level margins investor presentation however chicagoland is a mature market for portillo s with limited opportunity for continued restaurant growth as portillo s has moved beyond its home market unit economics while good are well below levels achieved in chicagoland portillo s chicagoland restaurants generate an astounding 3 million in ebitda per location to put this in context portillo s ebitda per chicagoland location is roughly equal to mcdonald s revenue per location however restaurants outside chicago produce a fraction of this 1 1 1 2 million in ebitda per location restaurant sales and profitability per location outside of chicago are unlikely to reach the otherworldly results achieved in chicago given differing tastes in local cuisine lower brand awareness and different competitive dynamics for instance in california and arizona portillo s competes with local favorites such as in n out burger current results current results investor presentation despite having a larger store base in 2022 than 2021 portillo s has seen ebitda decline 11 year over year as inflationary pressures have increased food and labor costs while transactions declined 3 year over year notably traffic has been weak despite the company deliberately increasing prices less than competitors and seemingly below the rate of inflation which has run 6 8 for food and labor 3q22 management commentary seeking alpha transcripts valuation despite the decline in the share price portillo s trades at 18x my estimated 2023e ebitda and 31x 2023e eps for 2023 i assume that ebitda recovers to 2021 levels as the company continues to expand its store count over the medium term portillo s financial objectives are shown below financial targets investor day presentation i think a fair value for the business is somewhere in the neighborhood of 12 13x ebitda which credits portillo s for its strong brand fantastic home market unit economics and long term growth potential while being cognizant of risks to its expansion strategy and less attractive economics and the competitive nature of the fast food industry applying a 12 13x ebitda multiple to estimated 2023e ebitda gets me to a price target of 11 13 per share conclusion while i plan to visit portillo s on my next trip to chicago this is not a stock i m interested in owning at the current price as a value investor i look to buy stocks at a minimum 30 discount to my estimate of fair value as such i d be a buyer in the 9 10 range
nyc mayor adams faces backlash for move to involuntarily hospitalize homeless people toggle caption michael m santiago getty images new york city mayor eric adams is facing backlash after moving forward with a host of policy changes that crack down on the city s homeless population on tuesday adams announced officials will begin hospitalizing more homeless people by involuntarily providing care to those deemed to be in psychiatric crisis for too long there has been a gray area where policy law and accountability have not been clear and this has allowed people in need to slip through the cracks adams said this culture of uncertainty has led to untold suffering and deep frustration it cannot continue and for months adams and his administration have discussed stopping unhoused people from sheltering in subways despite pending budget cuts that will remove services the city provides to the homeless at least 470 people were reportedly arrested this year for being outstretched or taking up more than one seat on a train car in march the authorities targeted those living under the brooklyn queens expressway in williamsburg while adams reportedly attended an event promoting a wells fargo credit card people can use to pay rent adams policies drew criticism from advocates for homeless people mayor adams continues to get it wrong when it comes to his reliance on ineffective surveillance policing and involuntary transport and treatment of people with mental illness jacquelyn simone policy director for the coalition for the homeless said in a statement on tuesday homeless people are more likely to be the victims of crimes than the perpetrators but mayor adams has continually scapegoated homeless people and others with mental illness as violent eva wong the director of the mayor s office of community mental health defended the changes these new protocols and trainings will ensure that agencies and systems responsible for connecting our community members with severe mental illnesses to treatments are working in unison to get them the support they need and deserve wong said however others are unsure if the city has the infrastructure it needs for emergency medical response new york city public advocate jumaane d williams said the city needs to invest millions into its approach to the ongoing mental health crisis the number of respite care centers which the city uses to house those in crisis fell by half in the past three years according to a recent report only two drop in centers for adults dealing with a mental health crisis have been created since 2019 there were more than 60 000 homeless people including 19 310 homeless children sleeping in new york city s main municipal shelter system as of september according to the coalition for the homeless the ongoing reckoning with how we define and produce public safety has also put a spotlight on the need to holistically address this crisis as an issue of health rather than simply law enforcement williams said in a statement npr s dylan scott contributed to this story

new york new york u s stocks were uneasy early wednesday following a release of a raft of economic data but were jolted sharply higher by remarks from federal reserve chair jerome powell in a speech before the brookings institution think tank in washington later in the day the data was somewhat mixed edward moya senior market analyst at oanda told cnbc wednesday but it does show there s a lot of resilience in this economy and it still is highlighting a labor market that is weakening but is still in relatively good shape i think that we re not going to get any answers on what policy will be like at the end of next year based on these reports the fed chair noted that while the fight against inflation was a long way from being won the fed could begin moderating rate rises as early as december powell however warned interest rates could go higher from where they are now and stay high for longer he also highlighted the tightness of the labor market in the labor market demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time thus another condition we are looking for is the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market he said jerome powell s full remarks follow the end of this article the dow jones meantime which had been down

center on fiscal and monetary policy brookings institution washington d c 30 november 2022 today i will offer a progress report on the federal open market committee s fomc efforts to restore price stability to the u s economy for the benefit of the american people the report must begin by acknowledging the reality that inflation remains far too high my colleagues and i are acutely aware that high inflation is imposing significant hardship straining budgets and shrinking what paychecks will buy this is especially painful for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation price stability is the responsibility of the federal reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy without price stability the economy does not work for anyone in particular without price stability we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all we currently estimate that 12 month personal consumption expenditures pce inflation through october ran at 6 0 percent while october inflation data received so far showed a welcome surprise to the downside these are a single month s data which followed upside surprises over the previous two months down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases it will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining by any standard inflation remains much too high for purposes of this discussion i will focus my comments on core pce inflation which omits the food and energy inflation components which have been lower recently but are quite volatile our inflation goal is for total inflation of course as food and energy prices matter a great deal for household budgets but core inflation often gives a more accurate indicator of where overall inflation is headed twelve month core pce inflation stands at 5 0 percent in our october estimate approximately where it stood last december when policy tightening was in its early stages over 2022 core inflation rose a few tenths above 5 percent and fell a few tenths below but it mainly moved sideways so when will inflation come down i could answer this question by pointing to the inflation forecasts of private sector forecasters or of fomc participants which broadly show a significant decline over the next year but forecasts have been predicting just such a decline for more than a year while inflation has moved stubbornly sideways the truth is that the path ahead for inflation remains highly uncertain for now let s put aside the forecasts and look instead to the macroeconomic conditions we think we need to see to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time for starters we need to raise interest rates to a level that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent there is considerable uncertainty about what rate will be sufficient although there is no doubt that we have made substantial progress raising our target range for the federal funds rate by 3 75 percentage points since march as our last postmeeting statement indicates we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate it seems to me likely that the ultimate level of rates will need to be somewhat higher than thought at the time of the september meeting and summary of economic projections i will return to policy at the end of my comments but for now i will simply say that we have more ground to cover we are tightening the stance of policy to slow growth in aggregate demand slowing demand growth should allow supply to catch up with demand and restore the balance that will yield stable prices over time restoring that balance is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth last year the ongoing reopening of the economy boosted real gross domestic product gdp growth to a very strong 5 7 percent this year gdp was roughly flat through the first three quarters and indicators point to modest growth this quarter which seems likely to bring the year in with very modest growth overall several factors contributed to this slowing growth including the waning effects of reopening and of pandemic fiscal support the global implications of russia s war against ukraine and our policy actions which tightened financial conditions and are affecting economic activity particularly in interest sensitive sectors such as housing we can say that demand growth has slowed and we expect that this growth will need to remain at a slower pace for a sustained period despite the tighter policy and slower growth over the past year we have not seen clear progress on slowing inflation to assess what it will take to get inflation down it is useful to break core inflation into three component categories core goods inflation housing services inflation and inflation in core services other than housing core goods inflation has moved down from very high levels over the course of 2022 while housing services inflation has risen rapidly inflation in core services ex housing has fluctuated but shown no clear trend i will discuss each of these items in turn early in the pandemic goods prices began rising rapidly as abnormally strong demand was met by pandemic hampered supply reports from businesses and many indicators suggest that supply chain issues are now easing both fuel and nonfuel import prices have fallen in recent months and indicators of prices paid by manufacturers have moved down while 12 month core goods inflation remains elevated at 4 6 percent it has fallen nearly 3 percentage points from earlier in the year it is far too early to declare goods inflation vanquished but if current trends continue goods prices should begin to exert downward pressure on overall inflation in coming months housing services inflation measures the rise in the price of all rents and the rise in the rental equivalent cost of owner occupied housing unlike goods inflation housing services inflation has continued to rise and now stands at 7 1 percent over the past 12 months housing inflation tends to lag other prices around inflation turning points however because of the slow rate at which the stock of rental leases turns over 2the market rate on new leases is a timelier indicator of where overall housing inflation will go over the next year or so measures of 12 month inflation in new leases rose to nearly 20 percent during the pandemic but have been falling sharply since about midyear as figure 3 shows however overall housing services inflation has continued to rise as existing leases turn over and jump in price to catch up with the higher level of rents for new leases this is likely to continue well into next year but as long as new lease inflation keeps falling we would expect housing services inflation to begin falling sometime next year indeed a decline in this inflation underlies most forecasts of declining inflation finally we come to core services other than housing this spending category covers a wide range of services from health care and education to haircuts and hospitality this is the largest of our three categories constituting more than half of the core pce index thus this may be the most important category for understanding the future evolution of core inflation because wages make up the largest cost in delivering these services the labor market holds the key to understanding inflation in this category in the labor market demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time thus another condition we are looking for is the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market signs of elevated labor market tightness emerged suddenly in mid 2021 the unemployment rate at the time was much higher than the 3 5 percent that had prevailed without major signs of tightness before the pandemic employment was still millions below its level on the eve of the pandemic looking back we can see that a significant and persistent labor supply shortfall opened up during the pandemic a shortfall that appears unlikely to fully close anytime soon comparing the current labor force with the congressional budget office s pre pandemic forecast of labor force growth reveals a current labor force shortfall of roughly 3 1 2 million people this shortfall reflects both lower than expected population growth and a lower labor force participation rate participation dropped sharply at the onset of the pandemic because of many factors including sickness caregiving and fear of infection many forecasters expected that participation would move back up fairly quickly as the pandemic faded and for workers in their prime working years it mostly has overall participation however remains well below pre pandemic trends some of the participation gap reflects workers who are still out of the labor force because they are sick with covid 19 or continue to suffer lingering symptoms from previous covid infections long covid but recent research by fed economists finds that the participation gap is now mostly due to excess retirements that is retirements in excess of what would have been expected from population aging alone these excess retirements might now account for more than 2 million of the 31 2 million shortfall in the labor force what explains these excess retirements health issues have surely played a role as covid has posed a particularly large threat to the lives and health of the elderly in addition many older workers lost their jobs in the early stages of the pandemic when layoffs were historically high the cost of finding new employment may have appeared particularly large for these workers given pandemic related disruptions to the work environment and health concerns 9 also gains in the stock market and rising house prices in the first two years of the pandemic contributed to an increase in wealth that likely facilitated early retirement for some people the data so far do not suggest that excess retirements are likely to unwind because of retirees returning to the labor force older workers are still retiring at higher rates and retirees do not appear to be returning to the labor force in sufficient numbers to meaningfully reduce the total number of excess retirees the second factor contributing to the labor supply shortfall is slower growth in the working age population the combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge in deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about 1 1 2 million missing workers policies to support labor supply are not the domain of the fed our tools work principally on demand without advocating any particular policy however i will say that policies to support labor force participation could over time bring benefits to the workers who join the labor force and support overall economic growth such policies would take time to implement and have their effects however for the near term a moderation of labor demand growth will be required to restore balance to the labor market currently the unemployment rate is at 3 7 percent near 50 year lows and job openings exceed available workers by about 4 million that is about 1 7 job openings for every person looking for work so far we have seen only tentative signs of moderation of labor demand with slower gdp growth this year job gains have stepped down from more than 450 000 per month over the first seven months of the year to about 290 000 per month over the past three months but this job growth remains far in excess of the pace needed to accommodate population growth over time about 100 000 per month by many estimates job openings have fallen by about 1 5 million this year but remain higher than at any time before the pandemic wage growth too shows only tentative signs of returning to balance some measures of wage growth have ticked down recently but the declines are very modest so far relative to earlier increases and still leave wage growth well above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time to be clear strong wage growth is a good thing but for wage growth to be sustainable it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation let s sum up this review of economic conditions that we think we need to see to bring inflation down to 2 percent growth in economic activity has slowed to well below its longer run trend and this needs to be sustained bottlenecks in goods production are easing and goods price inflation appears to be easing as well and this too must continue housing services inflation will probably keep rising well into next year but if inflation on new leases continues to fall we will likely see housing services inflation begin to fall later next year finally the labor market which is especially important for inflation in core services ex housing shows only tentative signs of rebalancing and wage growth remains well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability returning to monetary policy my fomc colleagues and i are strongly committed to restoring price stability after our november meeting we noted that we anticipated that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate in order to attain a policy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to move inflation down to 2 percent over time monetary policy affects the economy and inflation with uncertain lags and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt thus it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting given our progress in tightening policy the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level it is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy we will stay the course until the job is done photo credit big news network

the challenger bank dave dodged a bullet the los angeles based neobank was planning to work with the cryptocurrency exchange ftx ceo jason wilk said in a january interview but ftx collapsed and filed for bankruptcy before this work began what s happened with them has clearly put under serious review our plans for crypto in general wilk said in an interview last week i think crypto has taken a big step back in the trust category over the past few weeks in hindsight the dave team was lucky several other fintechs and banks were connected to the bahamas based cryptocurrency exchange which along with several affiliates including alameda research filed for bankruptcy on nov 11 silvergate capital the la jolla california bank that provides transaction services for crypto companies holds some ftx deposits of the 11 9 billion in deposits it has from digital asset companies ftx represents less than 10 the company said in a statement as a federally regulated banking institution that is well capitalized we maintain a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity to support our customers needs ceo alan lane said in the statement silvergate also holds 20 million in deposits for blockfi a crypto lender that loaned money to and received money from ftx and filed for bankruptcy monday silvergate maintains a first priority lien and security interest in a cash collateral account that contains 10 million for the benefit of silvergate to support ach services provided to blockfi the bank stated in a press release monday silvergate s platform was purpose built to manage stress and volatility lane said in the release silvergate declined a request for an interview another company caught unawares by the ftx mess is fbh corp and its fully owned subsidiary farmington state bank which does business as moonstone bank both are based in bellevue washington moonstone announced in early february that alameda research ventures had made a passive capital investment of 11 5 million in the common stock of the bank s holding company fbh corp alameda was and remains a minority less than 10 investor the bank used the funds for operating capital to help in the transformation of farmington state bank from solely a small agriculture focused one branch community bank in eastern washington into a digital commercial bank executives at the bank said alameda has a non controlling interest in moonstone with no board membership and no involvement with management they said banks weren t alone in misjudging ftx and sam bankman fried or in failing to conduct adequate due diligence on his operation noted todd baker a senior fellow at the richman center for business law and public policy at columbia university and managing principal at broadmoor consulting he clearly had an engaging personality and a persona geared to the zeitgeist around crypto as the future of finance baker said we live in an age that worships billionaire capitalists like elon musk jeff bezos mark zuckerberg jack dorsey bill gates and even warren buffett that allows wanna be billionaires like sam bankman fried adam neuman markus braun and elizabeth holmes to take advantage of that image and avoid the scrutiny that would be applied to any normal company getting the shocking news like most everyone including major banks investment bankers and even u s government agencies praful mainker s reaction to ftx s collapse was shock and dismay the implications are far reaching said mainker chief risk and compliance officer at moonstone bank it is too early to speculate with any degree of accuracy as to what effect the collapse of ftx and its affiliates will have on the industry there has been immediate harm to ftx customers and that will affect confidence in the crypto industry or certainly the unregulated crypto industry as an avenue of private investment wilk and his colleagues at dave were also surprised by the news that ftx and sister company alameda research had reportedly made risky bets with customers money and didn t follow standard accounting practices wilk met bankman fried ftx s chief executive through investor and mentor mark cuban in 2021 wilk and some of his colleagues had visited bankman fried in the bahamas we were trying to find investors for our special purpose acquisition company wilk said alameda research invested 15 million in dave just because sam really liked the business and because of the altruistic overlap we have a charitable component of dave given our partnership with feeding america at that time bankman fried seemed to be running his company in a manner that didn t raise red flags wilk said dave and ftx never made detailed plans about how they were going to work together but wilk said he was most interested in offering crypto rewards i never saw dave as a destination to be a coinbase competitor or something along those lines wilk said so even if we had launched i didn t anticipate customer assets being at risk given it was mostly going to be a way for people to earn into the asset class for free versus having anyone trying to put up any of their money given we know our customers are largely living paycheck to paycheck in wilk s view bankman fried started ftx with good intent i had several conversations with him and he seemed incredibly smart wilk said he seemed incredibly empathetic to wanting to really democratize the world of finance i think where effective altruism potentially is problematic is where it s heads i win tails you lose because if he s going to give away all his money anyway he was going to be one of the richest men in the whole world or be worth nothing at all that mindset makes it easier to take a lot of risk and use customer assets to get access to a tremendous amount of capital very quickly he said at dave any new crypto features are on pause until the company finishes its review wilk said

inflation to begin falling sometime next year indeed a decline in this inflation underlies most forecasts of declining inflation finally we come to core services other than housing this spending category covers a wide range of services from health care and education to haircuts and hospitality this is the largest of our three categories constituting more than half of the core pce index thus this may be the most important category for understanding the future evolution of core inflation because wages make up the largest cost in delivering these services the labor market holds the key to understanding inflation in this category in the labor market demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time thus another condition we are looking for is the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market signs of elevated labor market tightness emerged suddenly in mid 2021 the unemployment rate at the time was much higher than the 3 5 percent that had prevailed without major signs of tightness before the pandemic employment was still millions below its level on the eve of the pandemic looking back we can see that a significant and persistent labor supply shortfall opened up during the pandemic a shortfall that appears unlikely to fully close anytime soon comparing the current labor force with the congressional budget office s pre pandemic forecast of labor force growth reveals a current labor force shortfall of roughly 3 1 2 million people this shortfall reflects both lower than expected population growth and a lower labor force participation rate participation dropped sharply at the onset of the pandemic because of many factors including sickness caregiving and fear of infection many forecasters expected that participation would move back up fairly quickly as the pandemic faded and for workers in their prime working years it mostly has overall participation however remains well below pre pandemic trends some of the participation gap reflects workers who are still out of the labor force because they are sick with covid 19 or continue to suffer lingering symptoms from previous covid infections long covid but recent research by fed economists finds that the participation gap is now mostly due to excess retirements that is retirements in excess of what would have been expected from population aging alone these excess retirements might now account for more than 2 million of the 31 2 million shortfall in the labor force what explains these excess retirements health issues have surely played a role as covid has posed a particularly large threat to the lives and health of the elderly in addition many older workers lost their jobs in the early stages of the pandemic when layoffs were historically high the cost of finding new employment may have appeared particularly large for these workers given pandemic related disruptions to the work environment and health concerns 9 also gains in the stock market and rising house prices in the first two years of the pandemic contributed to an increase in wealth that likely facilitated early retirement for some people the data so far do not suggest that excess retirements are likely to unwind because of retirees returning to the labor force older workers are still retiring at higher rates and retirees do not appear to be returning to the labor force in sufficient numbers to meaningfully reduce the total number of excess retirees the second factor contributing to the labor supply shortfall is slower growth in the working age population the combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge in deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about 1 1 2 million missing workers policies to support labor supply are not the domain of the fed our tools work principally on demand without advocating any particular policy however i will say that policies to support labor force participation could over time bring benefits to the workers who join the labor force and support overall economic growth such policies would take time to implement and have their effects however for the near term a moderation of labor demand growth will be required to restore balance to the labor market currently the unemployment rate is at 3 7 percent near 50 year lows and job openings exceed available workers by about 4 million that is about 1 7 job openings for every person looking for work so far we have seen only tentative signs of moderation of labor demand with slower gdp growth this year job gains have stepped down from more than 450 000 per month over the first seven months of the year to about 290 000 per month over the past three months but this job growth remains far in excess of the pace needed to accommodate population growth over time about 100 000 per month by many estimates job openings have fallen by about 1 5 million this year but remain higher than at any time before the pandemic wage growth too shows only tentative signs of returning to balance some measures of wage growth have ticked down recently but the declines are very modest so far relative to earlier increases and still leave wage growth well above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time to be clear strong wage growth is a good thing but for wage growth to be sustainable it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation let s sum up this review of economic conditions that we think we need to see to bring inflation down to 2 percent growth in economic activity has slowed to well below its longer run trend and this needs to be sustained bottlenecks in goods production are easing and goods price inflation appears to be easing as well and this too must continue housing services inflation will probably keep rising well into next year but if inflation on new leases continues to fall we will likely see housing services inflation begin to fall later next year finally the labor market which is especially important for inflation in core services ex housing shows only tentative signs of rebalancing and wage growth remains well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability returning to monetary policy my fomc colleagues and i are strongly committed to restoring price stability after our november meeting we noted that we anticipated that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate in order to attain a policy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to move inflation down to 2 percent over time monetary policy affects the economy and inflation with uncertain lags and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt thus it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting given our progress in tightening policy the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level it is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy we will stay the course until the job is done photo credit big news network

world oil bloomberg the top bosses of us oil and gas companies are speaking less and less about climate and carbon emissions a signal that the industry s public focus on esg over the past couple of years may be fading that at least is according to a bloomberg analysis of quarterly conference calls held by 172 american oil and gas companies the data shows how terms such as climate change energy transition and net zero have come up with gradually less frequency in the most recent rounds of conversations with analysts and investors in fossil fuel suppliers conference calls this quarter the use of language alluding to environmental social and governance topics or esg was down by more than 40 from the peak levels seen in 2021 mentions of the terms emissions climate change renewables and energy transition have all decreased the analysis is based on an automated search of terms related to environmental social and governance issues in transcripts of quarterly earnings calls from the publicly traded energy companies that regularly hold calls in english the transcripts include questions and comments from analysts and investors oil and gas companies went into the pandemic under fierce pressure from investors and environmentalists to come up with plans to slash greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for a low carbon future that led to a spike in discussion about esg pushing companies to commit to emission reduction targets and increased investment in cleaner energy even as they initially struggled with massive losses amid plunging demand fast forward to now and management teams are operating in a radically different environment where they re no longer on the back foot fossil fuel profits have soared this year energy stocks are the best performers in the s p 500 and shale drillers and refiners are fielding calls from the white house to boost output to help ease a global energy crunch that s helped drive inflation to the highest levels in four decades fossil fuel executives are gleeful that the world is admitting they need fossil fuels it s very much an i told you so moment for them said jim murchie ceo of the investment adviser energy income partners john b hess the chief executive officer of hess corp said on a recent call that global policymakers need to get a dose of reality that we need to invest more in oil and gas to have an affordable just and secure energy transition the president and chief operating officer of crude refiner hf sinclair corp timothy go said in a conference call with analysts earlier this month that the energy transition is really proving out to be more of a longer term evolution we see that the demand for our products is going to continue to be strong go said esg has also become more controversial recently with republican politicians pushing back on it there is this narrative now that esg is part of the nefarious woke leftist agenda and that was gaining steam ahead of the election said bloomberg intelligence analyst rob du boff so no surprise a lot of corporates were a little more mum on their esg initiatives the drop off in call time devoted to environmental topics follows some concrete steps taken by the industry according to rob thummel a senior portfolio manager at tortoise a firm that manages roughly 8 billion in energy related assets the big esg push a couple years ago had a pretty amazing impact on encouraging oil and gas companies to participate in the energy transition thummel said even as their climate related rhetoric has faded companies including exxon mobil corp have started to move into emissions reduction and clean energy technologies like carbon capture and hydrogen taking advantage of federal incentives under the inflation reduction act the energy sector is the world s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions which nations must reduce urgently to avoid the most damaging impacts of climate change the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change says slashing emissions through 2050 will require huge declines in the use of coal oil and gas and massive adoption of renewable energy sources according to the international energy agency
washington ap the federal reserve will push rates higher than previously expected and keep them there for an extended period chair jerome powell said wednesday in remarks likely intended to underscore the fed s single minded focus on combating stubborn inflation yet in a speech at the brookings institution powell also signaled that the fed may increase its key interest rate by a half point at its december meeting a smaller boost after four straight three quarter point hikes rate increases could then fall to a more traditional quarter point size at its february and march meetings based on previous fed forecasts powell said the fed is seeking to increase its benchmark rate by enough to slow the economy hiring and wage growth but not so much as to send the u s into recession it has lifted the rate six times this year to a range of 3 75 to 4 the highest in 15 years those increases have sharply boosted mortgage rates causing home sales to plunge while also raising costs for most other consumer and business loans we think that slowing down at this point is a good way to balance the risks powell said the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting which will take place dec 13 14 financial markets rallied in response to powell s suggestion that rate increases will slow the s p 500 jumped 122 points or 3 1 it had fallen before powell spoke but powell also stressed that smaller hikes shouldn t be taken as a sign the fed will let up on its inflation fight anytime soon it is likely that restoring price stability will require holding interest rates at a restrictive level for some time powell said history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy powell acknowledged there has been some good news on the inflation front with the cost of goods such as cars furniture and appliances in retreat he also said that rents and other housing costs which make up about a third of the consumer price index were likely to decline next year but the cost of services which includes dining out traveling and health care are still rising at a fast clip and will likely be much harder to rein in he said despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability powell said the fed chair singled out strong hiring and wage gains as the main driver keeping services costs high paychecks on average have jumped about 5 in the past year before inflation the fastest pace in four decades we want wages to go up strongly but they ve got to go up at a level that is consistent with 2 inflation over time powell said wage growth at about 3 5 a year would fit that criteria he said slowing the increases in paychecks will likely be difficult he said because robust wage gains are largely being driven by a labor shortage that began during the pandemic and shows no sign of ending soon fed officials had hoped to see the number of people working or looking for work rebound more strongly as the pandemic waned but that hasn t happened the lack of workers reflects a jump in early retirements the deaths of several hundred thousand working age people from covid 19 and a sharp decline in immigration and slower population growth powell said with the supply of workers limited the fed s higher interest rate policies will have to reduce businesses demand for new employees to meet the lower level of supply he added economists generally expect that will mean rising layoffs and a higher unemployment rate with the economy potentially falling into recession but powell in remarks during a question and answer session held out hope that employers could cut the near record high number of job openings they have posted rather than lay off large numbers of workers according to a government report earlier wednesday businesses have pared their job vacancies by about 1 5 million since march though there are still about 1 7 open jobs for every unemployed worker that ratio forces many companies to offer higher pay to attract and keep staff still powell said that employers could cut those openings further while engaging in only limited layoffs as the fed s rate hikes slow borrowing and spending i do continue to believe there is a path to a soft or softish landing unemployment goes up but it s not a hard landing it s not a severe recession he said last month s inflation report showed that prices rose 7 7 in october from a year earlier straining many families budgets that is down however from a 9 1 peak in june fed officials hope that by tightening credit they can slow consumer and business spending reduce hiring and wage growth and cool inflation powell said the fed s efforts have slowed demand and will have to keep it slow for an extended period copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed follow ktar923
washington the u s central bank could scale back the pace of its interest rate hikes as soon as december federal reserve chair jerome powell said on wednesday while warning that the fight against inflation was far from over and key questions remain unanswered including how high rates will ultimately need to rise and for how long it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting powell said in a speech to the brookings institution think tank in washington but in remarks emphasizing the work left to be done in controlling inflation powell said that issue was far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level while the fed chief did not indicate his estimated terminal rate powell said it is likely to be somewhat higher than the 4 6 indicated by policymakers in their september projections he said curing inflation will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time a comment that appeared to lean against market expectations the u s central bank could begin cutting rates next year as the economy slows we will stay the course until the job is done powell said noting that even though some data points to inflation slowing next year we have a long way to go in restoring price stability despite the tighter policy and slower growth over the past year we have not seen clear progress on slowing inflation the fed s response to the fastest outbreak of u s inflation in 40 years has been a similarly abrupt increase in interest rates with a half percentage point increase expected at its dec 13 14 meeting the central bank will have lifted its overnight policy rate from near zero as of march to the 4 25 4 50 range the swiftest change in rates since former fed chair paul volcker was battling an even worse rise in prices decades ago that has made home mortgages and other forms of credit more expensive for consumers and businesses it has not however caused any appreciable impact on the u s job market where the current 3 7 unemployment rate has led some policymakers to argue they are free to tighten rates further without much risk but it has also had no convincing impact yet on inflation a fact that has left open just how much further the fed may need to raise rates into what it refers to as restrictive territory designed to slow the economy powell said fed estimates of inflation in october showed its preferred measure still rising at about triple the central bank s 2 target long way to go powell s remarks ignited a robust rally in equity and bond markets which have taken a pounding this year on the back of the fed s aggressive rate hikes the benchmark s p 500 index spx shot into positive territory and was last up by about 1 5 on the day and bond yields which move in the opposite direction to their prices all tumbled the yield on the 2 year treasury note us2yt rr the maturity most sensitive to fed rate expectations dropped to about 4 47 from 4 52 the dollar dxy weakened against a basket of major trading partners currencies in rate futures markets traders added to the prevailing bets that the fed would slow its pace of rate hikes at its meeting in two weeks you can t keep raising rates as quickly as they were doing it said rick meckler at cherry lane investments in new vernon new jersey that said investors always like the comfort of hearing it directly from the fed chair powell noted that the cost of housing is likely to continue to rise into next year while key price measures for services remain high and the labor market is tight despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability he said

in an hour long session of prepared remarks and questions at the brookings institution think tank his last scheduled appearance before the central bank s next meeting in two weeks powell gave a short term message that sent markets soaring the fed was slowing down from the breakneck pace of three quarter percentage point rate hikes that have prevailed since june and would feel the way towards the peak interest rate needed to slow inflation to the fed s 2 target federal reserve chair jerome powell on wednesday said it was time to slow the pace of coming interest rate hikes while also signaling a protracted economic adjustment to a world where borrowing costs will remain high inflation comes down slowly and the united states remains chronically short of workers in an hour long session of prepared remarks and questions at the brookings institution think tank his last scheduled appearance before the central bank s next meeting in two weeks powell gave a short term message that sent markets soaring the fed was slowing down from the breakneck pace of three quarter percentage point rate hikes that have prevailed since june and would feel the way towards the peak interest rate needed to slow inflation to the fed s 2 target but he also outlined longer term shifts that may be underway in the supply of labor in particular that could presage a long period of elevated interest rates and inflation that responds only slowly to the fed s restrictive policy at the same time he rejected the idea that the central bank was so intent on calming the highest inflation in 40 years that policymakers would crash the economy in that effort insisting that a soft or softish landing remained possible with inflation easing without a dramatic rise in unemployment we wouldn t try to crash the economy and then clean up afterward powell said with policymakers hoping not to overtighten because we think that cutting rates is not something we want to do soon that s why we re slowing down and going to try to find our way to what that right level is that lowers inflation over time combined the remarks showed the fed grappling with some of the longer term trends that were amplified by the pandemic particularly the demographic drag that an aging population covid era retirements and weak immigration are having on the labor force those won t reverse soon powell said acknowledging that a tight labor market will have to be brought into balance mostly by fed actions that lower the demand for workers either through a drop in job vacancies or as some fear a rise in unemployment i think for now we have to assume that labor supply won t rebound powell said we have to do what it takes to restore balance in the labor market to get back to 2 inflation really just by slowing job growth rather than putting people out of work those sorts of structural concerns have been in the background of fed debate since the early days of the pandemic but are moving to the fore concerns about global supply chains for example were considered fleeting at first likely to pass and help fix high inflation as they did but progress has been slower than expected with china in particular now undergoing successive lockdowns that have made it a less secure source of goods and u s labor force participation still depressed powell s remarks about a coming downshift in the pace of rate increases ignited a robust rally in equity and bond markets which have taken a pounding this year on the back of the fed s aggressive rate hikes the benchmark s p 500 index shot into positive territory and closed 3 09 higher and bond yields which move in the opposite direction to their prices all tumbled the yield on the 2 year treasury note the maturity most sensitive to fed rate expectations dropped to about 4 37 from 4 52 the dollar weakened against a basket of major trading partners currencies in rate futures markets traders added to the prevailing bets that the fed would slow its pace of rate hikes at its meeting in two weeks you can t keep raising rates as quickly as they were doing it said rick meckler at cherry lane investments in new vernon new jersey that said investors always like the comfort of hearing it directly from the fed chair still and despite the coming slowdown in the pace of rate increases powell said it remained an open question how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level while the fed chief did not indicate his estimated terminal rate powell said it is likely to be somewhat higher than the 4 6 indicated by policymakers in their september projections he said curing inflation will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time a comment that leaned against market expectations the u s central bank could begin cutting rates next year as the economy slows the central bank meets again on dec 13 14 along with approving an expected half point rate increase policymakers will issue new projections for rates economic growth inflation and unemployment in coming years with the coming half percentage point increase the central bank will have lifted its overnight policy rate from near zero as of march to the 4 25 4 50 range the swiftest change in rates since former fed chair paul volcker was battling an even worse rise in prices that has not however had a convincing impact yet on inflation powell said fed estimates of inflation in october showed its preferred measure still rising at about triple the central bank s 2 target he noted that while goods inflation has been easing the cost of housing is likely to continue to rise into next year while key price measures for services remain high and the labor market tight data released earlier on wednesday showed there were still about 1 7 job openings for each unemployed person despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability powell said we will stay the course until the job is done
washington nov 30 reuters the u s army awarded a 1 2 billion contract to raytheon technologies co for six national advanced surface to air missile systems nasams for ukraine on wednesday the pentagon said the united states has approved sending ukraine a total of eight nasams to help fend off russian missile and drone attacks ukraine received its first delivery of two nasams air defense systems in november others will be delivered in future months once they are built nasams are just the latest in the diverse set of air defense capabilities we are delivering to ukraine said bill laplante under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment these six nasams systems were part of the fifth ukraine security assistance initiative usai package which was announced on aug 24 and had a total value of 2 98 billion according to an army statement usai funds allow the biden administration to procure weapons from industry rather than taking weapons from existing u s weapons stocks the contract is for the nasams batteries training and logistical support to ukraine s military and security forces funds for the two other nasams came from the third usai package announced in july last week doug bush the chief weapons buyer for the army told reporters the u s army is accelerating its weapons acquisition process to speed through a backlog of contracts needed to replenish u s stocks of weapons depleted by arms shipments to ukraine the pentagon has said the newly u s provided nasams air defense systems so far have had a 100 success rate in ukraine intercepting russian missiles in total the united states has committed more than 19 3 billion in security assistance to ukraine since the beginning of the biden administration reporting by mike stone in washington editing by mark porter nick zieminski and grant mccool
washington ap the federal reserve will push rates higher than previously expected and keep them there for an extended period chair jerome powell said wednesday in remarks likely intended to underscore the fed s single minded focus on combating stubborn inflation yet in a speech at the brookings institution powell also signaled that the fed may increase its key interest rate by a half point at its december meeting a smaller boost after four straight three quarter point hikes rate increases could then fall to a more traditional quarter point size at its february and march meetings based on previous fed forecasts powell said the fed is seeking to increase its benchmark rate by enough to slow the economy hiring and wage growth but not so much as to send the u s into recession it has lifted the rate six times this year to a range of 3 75 to 4 the highest in 15 years those increases have sharply boosted mortgage rates causing home sales to plunge while also raising costs for most other consumer and business loans we think that slowing down at this point is a good way to balance the risks powell said the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting which will take place dec 13 14 financial markets rallied in response to powell s suggestion that rate increases will slow the s p 500 jumped 122 points or 3 1 it had fallen before powell spoke but powell also stressed that smaller hikes shouldn t be taken as a sign the fed will let up on its inflation fight anytime soon it is likely that restoring price stability will require holding interest rates at a restrictive level for some time powell said history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy powell acknowledged there has been some good news on the inflation front with the cost of goods such as cars furniture and appliances in retreat he also said that rents and other housing costs which make up about a third of the consumer price index were likely to decline next year but the cost of services which includes dining out traveling and health care are still rising at a fast clip and will likely be much harder to rein in he said despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability powell said the fed chair singled out strong hiring and wage gains as the main driver keeping services costs high paychecks on average have jumped about 5 in the past year before inflation the fastest pace in four decades we want wages to go up strongly but they ve got to go up at a level that is consistent with 2 inflation over time powell said wage growth at about 3 5 a year would fit that criteria he said slowing the increases in paychecks will likely be difficult he said because robust wage gains are largely being driven by a labor shortage that began during the pandemic and shows no sign of ending soon fed officials had hoped to see the number of people working or looking for work rebound more strongly as the pandemic waned but that hasn t happened the lack of workers reflects a jump in early retirements the deaths of several hundred thousand working age people from covid 19 and a sharp decline in immigration and slower population growth powell said with the supply of workers limited the fed s higher interest rate policies will have to reduce businesses demand for new employees to meet the lower level of supply he added economists generally expect that will mean rising layoffs and a higher unemployment rate with the economy potentially falling into recession but powell in remarks during a question and answer session held out hope that employers could cut the near record high number of job openings they have posted rather than lay off large numbers of workers according to a government report earlier wednesday businesses have pared their job vacancies by about 1 5 million since march though there are still about 1 7 open jobs for every unemployed worker that ratio forces many companies to offer higher pay to attract and keep staff still powell said that employers could cut those openings further while engaging in only limited layoffs as the fed s rate hikes slow borrowing and spending i do continue to believe there is a path to a soft or softish landing unemployment goes up but it s not a hard landing it s not a severe recession he said last month s inflation report showed that prices rose 7 7 in october from a year earlier straining many families budgets that is down however from a 9 1 peak in june fed officials hope that by tightening credit they can slow consumer and business spending reduce hiring and wage growth and cool inflation powell said the fed s efforts have slowed demand and will have to keep it slow for an extended period
by the year 1987 the aids epidemic had reached grim proportions the disease had killed almost 60 000 people worldwide and more than 40 000 were hiv positive in the united states alone the majority of those ravaged by the disease were gay men despite mounting cases and deaths president ronald reagan had not said the word aids in public until september 1985 to many it seemed like the u s government had been willfully ignoring what had grown into a global health emergency in the history of the aids epidemic president reagan s legacy is one of silence aids activist michael cover said in a june 8 2004 sfgate editorial it is the silence of tens of thousands who died alone and unacknowledged stigmatized by our government under his administration aids was viewed as a gay disease and it seemed the community was on its own to fight it fight is what they did and the work of act up and many activists paved the way for breakthroughs in patients rights act up takes aim at improving health care catherine mcgann getty images american playwright and activist larry kramer poses for a portrait at the open door of his apartment in april 1993 in new york city in march 1987 aids activist larry kramer and others formed the aids coalition to unleash power act up the group was made up of people with no rights facing a disease with no cure who had been abandoned by their families their government and their society notes author and activist sarah schulman in let the record show a political history of act up new york 1987 1993 it was loosely organized as a confederacy of affinity groups each with their own special set of talents and that expertise contributed to its tremendous impact act up is often remembered for its most dramatic moments from wrapping north carolina senator jesse helms home in a giant yellow condom to disrupting mass at st patrick s cathedral to dumping the ashes of aids victims on the white house lawn while these were powerful visuals the organization s core focus was on improving patient centered care act up was one of the first groups to propose designing healthcare solutions based specifically on the population being treated they brought high quality care to the streets treating underserved people with aids finding shelter for the unhoused and protecting iv drug users through needle exchanges the group also challenged the healthcare industry decades ahead of the affordable care act they fought for changes in state insurance laws and called out exclusionary policies against gay men act up played a lead role in pushing government agencies and drug companies to accelerate testing lower costs of drugs and bring people with hiv aids into the care design process we have to break down the cult of experts in every area of this society said mark harrington of act up in the 2012 documentary united in anger a history of act up people with aids are the experts on this disease the notion of patient centered care was not new to u s healthcare but the aids crisis injected an urgency behind the principle before aids and before act up all experimental medical decisions were made by physicians dr anthony s fauci longtime director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases told the new yorker magazine in 2002 larry kramer by assuring consumer input to the fda put us on the defensive over our appropriations act up put medical treatment in the hands of patients and that is the way it ought to be this day in history 10 02 1985 rock hudson dies of aids aids activists fight for access to experimental drugs act up s members argued that patients deserved access to experimental drugs even if they were not yet fda approved and that during a national crisis access to new therapies and innovative care must be everyone s right i would rather take my chances with the side effects of an experimental drug aids activist vito russo told the ottawa herald in october 1988 the side effect of aids is death act up s treatment and data committee otherwise known as the science club studied the food and drug administration s operation inside and out schulman recounts eventually they came to understand fda processes policies and systems they analyzed experimental drugs clinical trials and emerging treatments long before they came up for approval in 1988 act up published an fda action handbook conducted a series of teach ins and distributed news like hollywood releases by giving the media advanced information reporters had information long before their stories were broadcast or printed and coverage tended to be more supportive on october 11 1988 an estimated 1 500 act up protestors disrupted the fda headquarters in rockville maryland crowds blocked access to doors walkways and roads launched smoke bombs diverted office workers and chanted protest songs including hey hey fda how many people have you killed today they issued a set of demands including shortening the drug approval process offering free access to drugs after phase 1 trials discontinuing double blind placebo trials including people from all backgrounds and with all stages of hiv infection in clinical trials and making medicaid and private insurance accountable for paying for experimental drugs one year later the parallel track which allowed the early release of drugs and treatments to terminal patients who had exhausted all other options was finally accepted by both the fda and national institutes of health soon a second antiretroviral drug became available many patients felt hope for the first time since their diagnosis once only seen on angry picket signs drugs into bodies became public healthcare practice act up had forced a shift in the way clinical trials were managed in the united states the group s pressure then focused and intensified on the pharmaceutical companies themselves the expensive debut of azt by the early 1990s there was only one approved drug azidothymidine azt and its 25 month approval process was seen as impressively fast at the time many patients could not tolerate azt or the side effects it caused yet no other viable option existed the pharmaceutical company burroughs wellcome had originally priced azt at 10 000 per year adjusted for inflation 25 730 faced with a congressional inquiry into price gouging the company lowered the price to 8 000 per year yet it remained the most expensive drug ever sold within two years burroughs wellcome stock soared 40 percent act up and 15 other groups met with burroughs who would not budge in response act up called for a nationwide boycott of all burroughs products which they labeled with aids profiteer stickers in stores by september 14 1989 more americans had died of aids related causes than in the vietnam war america had reported its 100 000th case of aids and predicted another 100 000 within one year seven act up members chained themselves to the vip balcony at the new york stock exchange calling out the company for crisis profiteering within weeks of the protest burroughs wellcome reduced the price of azt to 6 400 per year claiming that they had planned to do so all along accelerating research act up challenged every aspect of care design and delivery many nih trials for aids drugs required that patients cease all other medications including the medications that were keeping them alive as a result many trials did not advance to approval resulting in a limited selection and supply of proven aids drugs act up s members demanded change crucial studies of drugs for opportunistic infections that were proposed two or three years ago have not yet begun because of opposition from key executive committee members while tens of thousands of people with aids have died of these same infections argued richard lynn of act up in 1990 the science club focused its efforts on accelerating the pace of research they fought against lawsuits that blocked the production of lower cost generic drugs called for congressional hearings into drug pricing and protested the pharmaceutical industry s influence on elected officials by 1996 thanks to patient centered care initiatives combinations of new antiretroviral drugs had changed the prognosis for people living with hiv making it possible for people with the virus to live long relatively healthy lives the changes fought for by aids activists left a lasting impact in approaches to health care according to allan m brandt a professor of the history of medicine at harvard university when the history of the hiv epidemic is eventually written

washington ap the federal reserve will push rates higher than previously expected and keep them there for an extended period chair jerome powell said wednesday in remarks likely intended to underscore the fed s single minded focus on combating stubborn inflation yet in a speech at the brookings institution powell also signaled that the fed may increase its key interest rate by a half point at its december meeting a smaller boost after four straight three quarter point hikes rate increases could then fall to a more traditional quarter point size at its february and march meetings based on previous fed forecasts powell said the fed is seeking to increase its benchmark rate by enough to slow the economy hiring and wage growth but not so much as to send the u s into recession it has lifted the rate six times this year to a range of 3 75 to 4 the highest in 15 years those increases have sharply boosted mortgage rates causing home sales to plunge while also raising costs for most other consumer and business loans we think that slowing down at this point is a good way to balance the risks powell said the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting which will take place dec 13 14 financial markets rallied in response to powell s suggestion that rate increases will slow the s p 500 jumped 122 points or 3 1 it had fallen before powell spoke but powell also stressed that smaller hikes shouldn t be taken as a sign the fed will let up on its inflation fight anytime soon it is likely that restoring price stability will require holding interest rates at a restrictive level for some time powell said history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy powell acknowledged there has been some good news on the inflation front with the cost of goods such as cars furniture and appliances in retreat he also said that rents and other housing costs which make up about a third of the consumer price index were likely to decline next year but the cost of services which includes dining out traveling and health care are still rising at a fast clip and will likely be much harder to rein in he said despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability powell said the fed chair singled out strong hiring and wage gains as the main driver keeping services costs high paychecks on average have jumped about 5 in the past year before inflation the fastest pace in four decades we want wages to go up strongly but they ve got to go up at a level that is consistent with 2 inflation over time powell said wage growth at about 3 5 a year would fit that criteria he said slowing the increases in paychecks will likely be difficult he said because robust wage gains are largely being driven by a labor shortage that began during the pandemic and shows no sign of ending soon fed officials had hoped to see the number of people working or looking for work rebound more strongly as the pandemic waned but that hasn t happened the lack of workers reflects a jump in early retirements the deaths of several hundred thousand working age people from covid 19 and a sharp decline in immigration and slower population growth powell said with the supply of workers limited the fed s higher interest rate policies will have to reduce businesses demand for new employees to meet the lower level of supply he added economists generally expect that will mean rising layoffs and a higher unemployment rate with the economy potentially falling into recession but powell in remarks during a question and answer session held out hope that employers could cut the near record high number of job openings they have posted rather than lay off large numbers of workers according to a government report earlier wednesday businesses have pared their job vacancies by about 1 5 million since march though there are still about 1 7 open jobs for every unemployed worker that ratio forces many companies to offer higher pay to attract and keep staff still powell said that employers could cut those openings further while engaging in only limited layoffs as the fed s rate hikes slow borrowing and spending i do continue to believe there is a path to a soft or softish landing unemployment goes up but it s not a hard landing it s not a severe recession he said last month s inflation report showed that prices rose 7 7 in october from a year earlier straining many families budgets that is down however from a 9 1 peak in june fed officials hope that by tightening credit they can slow consumer and business spending reduce hiring and wage growth and cool inflation powell said the fed s efforts have slowed demand and will have to keep it slow for an extended period

washington ap the federal reserve will push rates higher than previously expected and keep them there for an extended period chair jerome powell said wednesday in remarks likely intended to underscore the fed s single minded focus on combating stubborn inflation yet in a speech at the brookings institution powell also signaled that the fed may increase its key interest rate by a half point at its december meeting a smaller boost after four straight three quarter point hikes rate increases could then fall to a more traditional quarter point size at its february and march meetings based on previous fed forecasts powell said the fed is seeking to increase its benchmark rate by enough to slow the economy hiring and wage growth but not so much as to send the u s into recession it has lifted the rate six times this year to a range of 3 75 to 4 the highest in 15 years those increases have sharply boosted mortgage rates causing home sales to plunge while also raising costs for most other consumer and business loans we think that slowing down at this point is a good way to balance the risks powell said the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting which will take place dec 13 14 financial markets rallied in response to powell s suggestion that rate increases will slow the s p 500 jumped 122 points or 3 1 it had fallen before powell spoke but powell also stressed that smaller hikes shouldn t be taken as a sign the fed will let up on its inflation fight anytime soon it is likely that restoring price stability will require holding interest rates at a restrictive level for some time powell said history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy powell acknowledged there has been some good news on the inflation front with the cost of goods such as cars furniture and appliances in retreat he also said that rents and other housing costs which make up about a third of the consumer price index were likely to decline next year but the cost of services which includes dining out traveling and health care are still rising at a fast clip and will likely be much harder to rein in he said despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability powell said the fed chair singled out strong hiring and wage gains as the main driver keeping services costs high paychecks on average have jumped about 5 in the past year before inflation the fastest pace in four decades we want wages to go up strongly but they ve got to go up at a level that is consistent with 2 inflation over time powell said wage growth at about 3 5 a year would fit that criteria he said slowing the increases in paychecks will likely be difficult he said because robust wage gains are largely being driven by a labor shortage that began during the pandemic and shows no sign of ending soon fed officials had hoped to see the number of people working or looking for work rebound more strongly as the pandemic waned but that hasn t happened the lack of workers reflects a jump in early retirements the deaths of several hundred thousand working age people from covid 19 and a sharp decline in immigration and slower population growth powell said with the supply of workers limited the fed s higher interest rate policies will have to reduce businesses demand for new employees to meet the lower level of supply he added economists generally expect that will mean rising layoffs and a higher unemployment rate with the economy potentially falling into recession but powell in remarks during a question and answer session held out hope that employers could cut the near record high number of job openings they have posted rather than lay off large numbers of workers according to a government report earlier wednesday businesses have pared their job vacancies by about 1 5 million since march though there are still about 1 7 open jobs for every unemployed worker that ratio forces many companies to offer higher pay to attract and keep staff still powell said that employers could cut those openings further while engaging in only limited layoffs as the fed s rate hikes slow borrowing and spending i do continue to believe there is a path to a soft or softish landing unemployment goes up but it s not a hard landing it s not a severe recession he said last month s inflation report showed that prices rose 7 7 in october from a year earlier straining many families budgets that is down however from a 9 1 peak in june fed officials hope that by tightening credit they can slow consumer and business spending reduce hiring and wage growth and cool inflation powell said the fed s efforts have slowed demand and will have to keep it slow for an extended period
