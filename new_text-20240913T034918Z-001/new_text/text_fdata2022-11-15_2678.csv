customers with high quality products remains a central focus for runhai and for glg the joint venture opportunity is entirely additive to the company s business plans 2022 agm voting results the company held its annual general meeting on june 17 2022 the shareholders voted in all nominated directors with favorable votes for each exceeding 99 dr luke zhang continues as chairman of the board and chief executive officer and brian palmieri continues as vice chairman of the board dr hong zhao guang opted not to run for election this year and is therefore no longer a director company outlook in recent quarters one of the most critical items that management has focused on and continues to focus on is the development and implementation of plans to stem the losses that the company has suffered in recent years and to ameliorate the company s financial position as a result of those sustained losses the company lacks the cash necessary to fully fund the business operations and its strategic product initiatives the company continues to manage its cash flows carefully to mitigate risk of insolvency as a result of these efforts management has been successful in improving the company s cash flows in recent quarters nevertheless without an infusion of cash in the months ahead the company may not be able to realize its strategic plans and could eventually cease to be a going concern to address that cash need management negotiated a cad 1 million revolving loan facility with a related party for working capital purposes in 2020 in 2020 management also realized the sale of one of its two idle assets the sale of the runhao facility resulted in significant debt reduction and better positions the company to be able to access additional lines of working capital management also continues to explore options for the sale or repurposing of its idle runyang primary processing facility in jiangsu province to further address its cash needs and balance sheet another factor that continues to contribute to the company s financial situation is the competitive price pressure in the stevia market over the last two years that has reduced mainstream reb a products such as reb a 80 and reb a 97 to the lowest price levels in years although pricing has begun to rise reflecting the increased cost of raw materials in the most recent harvest monk fruit prices have also become increasingly competitive in the marketplace to maintain margins at sustainable levels the company has focused on improving its production efficiencies continues to strive for a mix of products that is weighted more heavily on higher margin specialty products and has focused more on higher margin direct sales the company s focus on maintaining positive cash flow led the company to take decisive steps in 2021 and continued efforts in 2022 to reduce its sg a costs as well as its production costs both its north american operations and chinese operations have significantly reduced sg a costs for the last several years the company s production capacity has been far greater than its projected order levels as it had sought rapid increases in orders for reb a products the company s aim continues to be to right size its chinese operations i e to optimize its staffing and production planning to meet the company s projected production requirements while retaining the ability to accommodate growth in future order volumes and management made significant progress in this area and continues striving to optimize staffing and production plans as a result this has enabled the company to sell its goods at more competitive and or more profitable prices although the competitive price pressures remain strong the company continues to explore options to significantly improve its balance sheet and cash flows whether through restructuring of debt or other opportunities for infusions of cash to address the debt load one of these options is taking shape as the company entered into a joint venture in china through its runhai subsidiary which has the potential to significantly increase revenues and overhaul the company s balance sheet the company also continues to explore options that may be complementary to the natural sweetener market where it could leverage its production expertise and equipment towards an investment that may help grow the company s revenues and improve its financial position while the company continues to face substantial risks management remains optimistic about the future opportunities for the company having closed the idle asset sale in 2020 and having successfully implemented right sizing efforts to manage costs having entered into the joint venture and continuing to optimize production efficiencies costs and planning management is proceeding down the best available path to increased financial stability and improved profitability selected financials as noted above the complete set of financial statements and management

hippos poached for their skin and teeth sharks targeted by the fin trade and a tiny frog with translucent skin are among the hundreds of species that could get greater protection at a united nations wildlife conference opening monday the 184 nation convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora or cites meeting over the next two weeks in panama will consider tightening trade regulations on around 600 plants and animals potentially at risk of extinction nine other species are recommended for less restrictive international trade regulations cites goal is to ensure that these wild species can survive in the wild for future generations secretary general ivonne higuero told the associated press the concern is that if we don t regulate that trade too much will be used too much will be traded and enter into commerce because it s highly valuable the international wildlife trade treaty which was adopted 49 years ago in washington d c has been praised for helping stem the illegal and unsustainable trade in ivory and rhino horns as well as in whales and sea turtles but it has come under fire for its limitations including its reliance on cash strapped developing countries to combat illegal trade that s become a lucrative 10 billion a year business millions of species are not listed under cites including according to one study more than a third of the online reptile trade domestic markets are beyond the reach of the treaty and some experts have complained cites listings often come after a species is too far gone the internet is fueling the illegal trade a wildlife conservation society investigation this month found that jaguar parts trade commercially banned under cites were widely available online advertisement still conservationists said cites remains the only available tool to ensure trade in plants and animals is done sustainably governments will list species that require permits bringing some level of transparency to the trade or if trade is putting a plant or animal at risk a listing will limit or outright ban it cites is working but it s only as good as its implementation by exporting countries transit countries importing countries said susan lieberman the vice president of international policy at wcs the treaty is excellent it s the only tool we have in the midst of a biodiversity crisis she continued we don t need to weaken it we need to strengthen cites and maybe even cover more species we also need to ensure whether through multilateral donors foundations whatever that there s more resources going to help countries who are challenged implementing cites fans of hippos found in more than three dozen african countries and regulars in nature documentaries are counting on the convention to ban commercial trade ten african countries have proposed banning trade in hippos hunted for their ivory teeth and more recently for their skin used in belts handbags and clothing the united states and france were the biggest importers of nearly 78 000 hippo parts between 2009 and 2018 according to the cites trade database with a majority coming from tanzania another 79 000 pounds 36 000 kilograms of hippo ivory went to hong kong and china for hunting trophies figurines and knife handles the concern is that hippos already suffering due to climate driven droughts and development cannot survive extensive poaching advertisement it s great when countries do things domestically try to take matters into their own hands to protect their own populations said tanya sanerib the international legal director at the center for biological diversity which in march joined with the humane society international in requesting that the u s fish and wildlife service list the hippos under the endangers species act but unless we have that sort of international collaboration which is what cites is designed to foster you have mixed signals being sent about what really is happening and whether a product is legal or illegal sanerib said so getting this commercial trade ban would be significant in terms of sending that signal loud and clear that ivory is off the table the proposal to ban the hippo trade is opposed by the european union some african countries and several conservation groups who argue many countries have healthy hippo populations and that trade isn t a factor in their decline sharks too are poised for increased protection global shark populations are declining with annual deaths due to fisheries reaching about 100 million the sharks are sought mostly for their fins which are used in shark fin soup a popular delicacy in china and elsewhere in asia conservation groups argue proposals at cites to list about 90 species including the family of requiem sharks would significantly limit the trade if approved the proposals would increase the portion of shark species in the fin trade covered by cites from around 25 to about 90 according to the wcs advertisement what is driving down shark populations is overfishing they have been slyly labeled bycatch when in reality they are targeted said philip chou senior director of global policy for the conservation group oceana there is a huge active trade and money to be made from the trade of shark meat and there has always been for their fins opposition is likely to come from japan and other east asian countries the hub of the global fin trade they argue the trade should be regulated by fisheries bodies turtles snakes glass frogs and lizards increasingly targeted by the pet and collector trade would get increased protection as would several timber species including african mahogany that have been decimated by illegal logging the united states association of reptile keepers which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians said in a statement that addressing reductions in wild populations by limiting captive breeding and legal trade is counterproductive there also are controversial proposals to ease the ban on the elephant ivory trade zimbabwe which has threatened to leave cites has pushed to allow sale of its ivory stocks and elephant skin and to use the money to manage its growing elephant population but conservation groups and the u s oppose easing the ivory ban enacted in 1989 most countries have domestic bans on elephant ivory markets and the fact that there are existing stockpiles out there of ivory is very troubling said the u s department of the interior s matthew strickler who will head the american delegation at cites you certainly don t want to see that product get on the market and kind of rekindle demand for more ivory which we all know leads to more and more poaching advertisement secretary general higuero said there is no appetite for opening the market for ivory sales but that the debate at cites could spark a larger conversation on how to help poor countries fund conservation efforts many of these countries she said are struggling to manage their elephant populations amid worsening drought and expanding ranges that are increasing elephant human conflict we all benefit from the existence of these animals she said therefore it s a global responsibility to ensure that these developing countries can meet their conservation costs associated press writer patrick whittle contributed from portland maine associated

continue to be responsible for maintaining appropriate processes and controls around financial reporting however given the significantly reduced risk profile of the company following the 2degrees sale and nuevatel transaction we have reduced the cost structure of our corporate function with a significant portion of the workforce ceasing employment with the company in september 2022 and the company retaining only a limited number of resources to ensure compliance with ongoing regulatory and audit requirements the company has also negotiated with service providers to ensure a significant reduction in costs going forward it is also the company s expectation that following the escrow release in may 2023 the company will endeavor to further adjust its cost structure commensurate with the

nanobiotix nasdaq nbtx today announced completion of the dose escalation part of a phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating potential first in class radioenhancer nbtxr3 for patients with locally advanced la or borderline resectable br pancreatic cancer pc the phase 1 study study 2019 1001 is being conducted by the university of texas md anderson cancer center md anderson the tolerable safety profile establishment of recommended phase 2 dose and early signals of efficacy we have observed in the dose escalation part for locally advanced patients of our phase 1 study give us confidence to now include borderline resectable patients in the expansion part said leonard a farber md chief clinical and medical affairs officer at nanobiotix in the borderline resectable pancreatic cancer population a positive correlation has been observed between achieving resectability through local and systemic control with preoperative therapy and potentially improving survival outcomes inclusion of the borderline resectable stage in the study will also expand the eligible patient population to include a larger proportion of pancreatic cancer patients allowing for the robust evaluation of nbtxr3 s potential to have a significant impact in this recalcitrant disease study 2019 1001 is being conducted as part of the ongoing strategic collaboration between nanobiotix and md anderson the complete dose escalation part of the study recruited 11 patients and all patients had unresectable disease at study entry a single intratumoral injection of nbtxr3 followed by 15 fractions of rt showed to be feasible and well tolerated and the recommended phase 2 dose of nbtxr3 was established at 42 of gross tumor volume notably one patient on study 2019 1001 had a partial response 9 months after rt and has had durable local control for over two years one other patient experienced local control that allowed unresectable disease to become resectable negative margin surgery r0 surgery was achieved for this patient and pathological complete response was observed the dose expansion part of the study will include more robust evaluation of patients with borderline resectable disease at study entry about study 2019 1001pancreatic cancer pc is a rare deadly disease given that surgery with r0 resection i e macroscopically complete tumor removal with negative microscopic surgical margins remains the only hope for long term survival clinical trials have investigated various neoadjuvant strategies wherein patients receive anti cancer drugs or radiation prior to surgery to increase the surgery eligible population while also increasing the r0 resection rate md anderson study 2019 1001 is an open label single arm prospective phase i study consisting of two parts i dose escalation to determine the recommended phase 2 dose rp2d and ii expansion at rp2d the patient population will include adults age 18 years with borderline resectable br or locally advanced la pc that are radiographically non metastatic at screening and that have not previously received radiation therapy or surgery for pancreatic cancer the complete dose escalation part recruited 11 patients with unresectable lapc and the rp2d was established at 42 of gross tumor volume twelve additional patients with either lapc or brpc will be enrolled for the rp2d expansion the objectives of the study are the determination of dose limiting toxicity dlt the maximum tolerated dose mtd and the rp2d about nbtxr3nbtxr3 is a novel potentially first in class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy the product candidate s physical mechanism of action moa is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long term anti cancer memory given the physical moa nanobiotix believes that nbtxr3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors nbtxr3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma hnscc as the primary development pathway the company sponsored phase i dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy and a phase iii global registrational study was launched in 2021 in february 2020 the united states food and drug administration granted regulatory fast track designation for the investigation of nbtxr3 activated by radiation therapy with or without cetuximab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced hnscc who are not eligible for platinum based chemotherapy the same population being evaluated in the phase iii study nanobiotix has also prioritized an immuno oncology development program beginning with a company sponsored phase i clinical study evaluating nbtxr3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent metastatic hnscc or lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti pd 1 therapy given the company s focus areas and balanced against the scalable potential of nbtxr3 nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways pursuant to this strategy in 2019

grappling with its own challenges see twitter many of the companies making public statements have cited at least one of two primary causes first they hired a lot of employees during the pandemic when people were extremely online now the internet boom has faded offline life has picked up and those new employees seem too expensive second broader economic wobbles have made brands more reluctant to spend on digital ads a source of revenue for many tech companies high interest rates have put an end to the cheap money era of venture capital here are some of the companies that have announced the biggest job cuts amazon a reported 10 000 jobs amazon said wednesday that layoffs had begun though it did not state the number of employees affected the online retail and cloud computing behemoth plans to lay off some 10 000 employees in corporate and technology jobs the new york times was the first to report on monday after a deep set of reviews we recently decided to consolidate some teams and programs one of the consequences of these decisions is that some roles will no longer be required wrote dave limp amazon s senior vice president of devices and services in a memo shared on the company s website as of this fall amazon employed more than 1 5 million full and part time workers around the world many in warehouses the 10 000 expected layoffs would comprise about 3 of amazon s corporate employees according to the times and a significantly smaller share of its overall workforce the cuts reportedly will focus on amazon s devices division including alexa the company s virtual assistant technology as well as its retail and human resources divisions earlier this month the company announced a hiring freeze on corporate jobs we re facing an unusual macro economic environment and want to balance our hiring and investments with being thoughtful about this economy wrote beth galetti amazon s senior vice president of people experience and technology meta 11 000 jobs facebook and instagram s parent company meta laid off 11 000 people last week about 13 of its staff ceo mark zuckerberg attributed the cuts to overhiring during the pandemic in a letter to staff posted to the corporate website he cited a decline in e commerce the wider economic downturn increased competition and a decline in ad sales the primary way the company makes money i got this wrong and i take responsibility for that he wrote the layoffs come as the company has invested billions in the so called metaverse pitched as a virtual reality future in which people will work mingle exercise and go

several months has saddled the company with 13 billion of new debt his short tenure at the top of twitter has been marked by hasty changes quickly halted including his plan for a revamped twitter blue verification service which charged 8 a month to get a blue checkmark on one s account accounts impersonating celebrities major corporations and musk himself proliferated immediately spurring twitter

compliance officer resigned last week stripe about 1 000 jobs payment processing platform stripe announced on november 3 that it was cutting 14 of its workforce stripe ceo patrick collison wrote in an

rates and order activity said benjamin urban chief executive officer we remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet increasing our engagement with our construction partners and improving quality and order delivery times bradley little chief financial officer added from a financial standpoint our highest priority is stabilizing and strengthening our balance sheet including our cash position while our cash usage remained elevated during the quarter primarily due to reorganization costs we are seeing meaningful reductions in our monthly cash usage our unrestricted cash position at the end of october was 6 7 million virtually in line with september largely benefiting from improved operating results and favorable working capital conversion we are also actively pursuing several non dilutive strategic cash initiatives intended to deliver meaningful cash proceeds to the company by mid first quarter 2023 further we launched a private placement of common shares having gross proceeds of approximately 3 0 million supported by our two largest shareholders directors and executive officers designed to be minimally dilutive and provide additional liquidity as we work to complete these

million by 5 and 37 over the second quarter of 2022 and the third quarter of 2021 respectively the improvement over the prior year was predominantly driven by increased demand for our products which commenced in the first quarter of 2022 particularly in the workplace sector as pandemic related health restrictions eased and employees return to the office the sequential quarter improvement was driven by commercial discipline from price increases announced earlier in the year third quarter 2022 gross profit and gross profit margin was 7 0 million or 15 0 of revenue an increase of 4 6 million or 186 from 2 5 million or 7 2 of revenue for third quarter 2021 the 780 bps increase in gross profit margin was a result of improved labor efficiency and the benefit of higher revenues on our improved fixed cost structure materials transportation and other variable costs as a percentage of revenue were consistent with the prior year as the price increases announced earlier in the year contemplated the rising material and other input costs third quarter gross profit included approximately 2 0 million in non cash expense associated with the write down of inventory and accelerated amortization associated with discontinued product lines gross profit for the third quarter benefited by approximately 0 6 million from the impact of the weakening canadian dollar on u s dollar

percent of revenue in the quarter ended september 30 2022 and 2 3 million or 6 8 as a percent of revenue for the third quarter 2021 sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were 6 1 million a 1 4 million decrease from 7 5 million in the prior year s third quarter the decrease was largely related to lower salary and benefit expenses due to planned headcount reductions as part of our cost reduction initiatives general and administrative expenses for the quarter were 6 5 million a decrease of 1 0 million from 7 5 million in the prior year s third quarter the change is due to reductions in salaries and benefits from planned headcount reductions as part of cost reduction initiatives as well as reduced professional fees during the quarter operations support expenses for the quarter were 2 3 million a decrease of 0 1 million from 2 4 million in the prior year s third quarter the decrease was due to reduced travel costs in the quarter technology and development expenses for the

temporary suspension of operations at the rock hill facility net loss for the quarter was 6 7 million compared to 15 4 million for prior year s third quarter the lower net loss is primarily the result

non gaap financial measures our condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap these gaap financial statements include non cash charges and other charges and benefits that we believe are unusual or infrequent in nature or that we believe may make comparisons to our prior or future performance difficult as a result we also provide financial information in this news release that is not prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with gaap management uses these non gaap financial measures in its review and evaluation of the financial performance of the company we believe that these non gaap financial measures also provide additional insight to investors and securities analysts as supplemental information to our gaap results and as a basis to compare our financial performance period over period and to compare our financial performance with that of other companies we believe that these non gaap financial measures facilitate comparisons of our core operating results from period to period and to other companies by removing the effects of our capital structure net interest income on cash deposits interest expense on outstanding debt and debt facilities or foreign exchange movements asset base depreciation and amortization the impact of under utilized capacity on gross profit tax consequences reorganization expense and stock based compensation we remove the impact of all foreign exchange from adjusted ebitda foreign exchange gains and losses can vary significantly period to period due to the impact of changes in the u s and canadian dollar exchange rates on foreign currency denominated monetary items on the balance sheet and are not reflective of the underlying operations of the company we remove the impact of under utilized capacity from gross profit and fixed production overheads are allocated to inventory on the basis of normal capacity of the production facilities in periods where production levels are abnormally low unallocated overheads are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred in addition management bases certain forward looking estimates and budgets on non gaap financial measures primarily adjusted ebitda government subsidies depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense reorganization expenses and foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment expenses are excluded from our non gaap financial measures because management considers them to be outside of the company s core operating results even though some of those receipts and expenses may recur and because management believes that each of these items can distort the trends associated with the company s ongoing performance we believe that excluding these receipts and expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of the business operations enhances consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not or future periods that may not include such items and facilitates comparison with the results of other companies in our industry the following non gaap financial measures are presented in this news release and a description of the calculation for each measure is included adjusted gross profit gross profit before deductions for costs of under utilized capacity depreciation and amortization adjusted gross profit margin adjusted gross profit divided by revenue ebitda net income before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda ebitda adjusted to remove foreign exchange gains or losses impairment expenses reorganization expenses stock based compensation expense government subsidies and any other non core gains or losses adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda divided by revenue you should carefully evaluate these non gaap financial measures the adjustments included in them and the reasons we consider them appropriate for analysis supplemental to our gaap information each of these non gaap financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool due to exclusion of some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable gaap financial measures you should not consider any of these non gaap financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap you should also be aware that we may recognize income or incur expenses in the future that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in these non gaap financial measures because these non gaap financial measures may be defined differently by other companies in our industry our definitions of these non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing their utility the following table presents a reconciliation for the three and nine months ended september 30 2022 and

updated november 16 2022 at 1 31 pm et for more than two decades the u s tech industry has been a reliable source of booming stocks and cushy high paid jobs in the span of weeks the sheen has faded and the ax has fallen more than 35 000 tech workers across 72 companies have been laid off this month adding to a total of 120 000 tech jobs lost this year according to layoffs fyi which tracks job cuts in the tech industry it s safe to say a reckoning is underway even as each company is grappling with its own challenges see twitter many of the companies making public statements have cited at least one of two primary causes first they hired a lot of employees during the pandemic when people were extremely online now the internet boom has faded offline life has picked up and those new employees seem too expensive second broader economic wobbles have made brands more reluctant to spend on digital ads a source of revenue for many tech companies high interest rates have put an end to the cheap money era of venture capital here are some of the companies that have announced the biggest job cuts amazon a reported 10 000 jobs amazon said wednesday that layoffs had begun though it did not state the number of employees affected the online retail and cloud computing behemoth plans to lay off some 10 000 employees in corporate and technology jobs the new york times was the first to report on monday after a deep set of reviews we recently decided to consolidate some teams and programs one of the consequences of these decisions is that some roles will no longer be required wrote dave limp amazon s senior vice president of devices and services in a memo shared on the company s website as of this fall amazon employed more than 1 5 million full and part time workers around the world many in warehouses the 10 000 expected layoffs would comprise about 3 of amazon s corporate employees according to the times and a significantly smaller share of its overall workforce the cuts reportedly will focus on amazon s devices division including alexa the company s virtual assistant technology as well as its retail and human resources divisions earlier this month the company announced a hiring freeze on corporate jobs we re facing an unusual macro economic environment and want to balance our hiring and investments with being thoughtful about this economy wrote beth galetti amazon s senior vice president of people experience and technology meta 11 000 jobs facebook and instagram s parent company meta laid off 11 000 people last week about 13 of its staff ceo mark zuckerberg attributed the cuts to overhiring during the pandemic in a letter to staffposted to the corporate website he cited a decline in e commerce the wider economic downturn increased competition and a decline in ad sales the primary way the company makes money i got this wrong and i take responsibility for that he wrote the layoffs come as the company has invested billions in the so called metaverse pitched as a virtual reality future in which people will work mingle exercise and go to concerts but it s an unproven bet on the future and not all everyone is convinced it should be the social media company s focus eric risberg ap ap meta ceo mark zuckerberg made big investments in the metaverse which he showed off during a virtual event last year last week zuckerberg announced the company was laying off 13 of its staff zuckerberg said the workforce cuts would affect the whole organization with recruiting staff disproportionately affected due to fewer hires anticipated in the coming year a hiring freeze through the first quarter of 2023 will continue twitter about 3 700 jobs billionaire tesla and spacex ceo elon musk bought the social media platform at the end of october and wasted no time slashing its workforce he immediately ousted the company s leadership including its ceo cfo and top lawyer mass layoffs were announced on november 4 with about 50 of the staff cut regarding twitter s reduction in force unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over 4m day musk tweeted co founder and former ceo jack dorsey tweetedthat he accepted blame for hiring too many workers in recent years i own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation i grew the company size too quickly i apologize for that he wrote musk s 44 billion purchase of twitter which he tried to get out of for several months has saddled the company with 13 billion of new debt his short tenure at the top of twitter has been marked by hasty changes quickly halted including his plan for a revamped twitter blue verification service which charged 8 a month to get a blue checkmark on one s account accounts impersonating celebrities major corporations and musk himself proliferated immediately spurring twitter to halt twitter blue signupstwice within a week key executives who were not fired including twitter s head of content moderation and safety on the platform and the company s chief privacy officer and compliance officer resigned last week stripe about 1 000 jobs payment processing platform stripeannounced on november 3 that it was cutting 14 of its workforce stripe ceo patrick collison wrote in an email to employees that the pandemic pushed the world toward e commerce spurring the company s growth the ceo said he and his brother and co founder john collison had made two very consequential mistakes being too optimistic about the internet economy s near term growth and growing stripe s operating costs too quickly we are facing stubborn inflation energy shocks higher interest rates reduced investment budgets and sparser startup funding any parts of the developed world appear to be headed for recession we think that 2022

adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda to be earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization other income net stock based compensation and expenses merger and acquisition costs restructuring transition and acquisitions expense net goodwill impairment and certain other items adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies we use adjusted ebitda as a financial metric to measure the financial performance of the business because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of its fundamental business activities for this reason we believe adjusted ebitda will also be useful to others including its stockholders as a valuable financial metric we present adjusted ebitda because we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful supplement to net income loss from continuing operations as an indicator of operating performance we also believe that adjusted ebitda is a financial measure that is useful both to management and investors when evaluating our performance and comparing our performance with that of our competitors we also use adjusted ebitda for planning purposes and to evaluate our financial performance because adjusted ebitda excludes certain incremental expenses or non cash items such as stock based compensation charges that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance we believe adjusted ebitda is a performance measure and not a liquidity measure and therefore a reconciliation between net loss from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda has been provided in the financial results adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to income from operations or net loss from continuing operations as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of cash flows in each case as determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity in addition adjusted ebitda does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows we do not intend the presentation of these non gaap measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap these non gaap measures should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap following is the reconciliation of our consolidated net loss to adjusted ebitda for the

results while our financial results were impacted by the ongoing inflationary environment which has been especially challenging for highly regulated companies like kingstone this quarter marked an important milestone in our company s transformation journey as we successfully completed our kingstone 2 0 plan it is a testament to the dedication of our team that after three years of hard work and significant investments we are now well positioned to provide a product to better select better underwrite and price and better manage our risks on an efficient single platform in our new select business early signs are already exceeding our expectations as claim frequencies are almost 20 lower than what we experienced for new business in our legacy product for the same period last year while our net earnings and book value declined primarily due to the continuing impact of inflation our adjusted book value per share 1 for the quarter was 5 15 we recognize that our transformation is not yet reflected in our financial results however these early indications that our strategy is working make us optimistic that the changes we have invested in will put us back on the path to profitability and drive enhanced value for our stockholders meryl golden kingstone s chief operating officer continued in the midst of a challenging macro environment we remained focused on operating with financial discipline reducing expenses across the business by 2 4 points in the quarter and almost 4 points on a year to date basis we are pleased that our cost cutting measures are taking hold and are actively working to drive further expense reduction including through the retirement of our legacy systems business update with the assistance of outside financial advisors management has been and continues to explore a number of financing and other options to refinance certain senior unsecured notes that will become due on december 30 2022 subject to regulatory requirements kingstone can also receive dividends or loans from its insurance subsidiary kingstone insurance company that could be utilized to repay a portion of the notes in order to preserve capital to potentially help fund this refinancing and the resulting debt service requirements the kingstone board of directors has determined to suspend the company s quarterly common stock dividend effective immediately any refinancing will result in borrowing costs at a higher interest rate than for the maturing notes the company anticipates cash savings of 1 7 million on an annual basis from the dividend suspension the board of directors will continue to evaluate the company s dividend policy on a regular basis including based on any contractual restrictions imposed in connection with any debt refinancing mr goldstein continued while we are continuing to work diligently to fully realize the benefits of our transformation and return the company to profitability the upcoming refinancing and our desire to maintain financial flexibility has led the board of directors to conclude that suspension of the quarterly dividend is prudent at this time we are taking every action to best position kingstone for the future and will continue to evaluate all options available to us in this regard as previously announced on may 6 2022 the company received a preliminary non binding indication of interest from griffin highline capital llc griffin highline with regard to an acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of the company on august 5 2022 kingstone received a final non binding indication of interest from griffin highline and agreed to extend the previously executed exclusivity agreement to further pursue the proposal that period of exclusivity has expired at this time discussions with griffin highline are focused on a potential strategic transaction rather than an outright acquisition of all outstanding equity of kingstone while no assurances can be given that a transaction of any kind will be consummated with griffin highline or any third party the kingstone board of directors is committed to acting in the best interests of the company and all stockholders see forward looking

income loss the loss during the three month period ended september 30 2022 was 4 0 million as compared to 10 6 million in the prior year period the decrease in net loss in the latest three month

year period earnings loss per share eps kingstone reported a loss of 0 38 per diluted share for the three months ended september 30 2022 compared to 1 01 per diluted share for the three months ended

year period the increase is primarily attributable to a 5 3 million increase in premiums from our personal lines business and a 0 5 million increase in livery physical damage net written premiums 1 decreased 7 9 million or 19 2 to 33 7 million during the three month period ended september 30 2022 from 41 6 million in the prior year period the decrease was attributable to the inception of the 30 personal lines quota share on december 30 2021 offset by growth in direct written premiums net premiums earned for the quarter ended september 30 2022 decreased 20 2 to 29 4 million compared to 36 8 million for the quarter ended september 30 2021 the decrease was attributable to the inception of the 30 personal lines quota share treaty on december 30 2021 net loss ratio for the quarter ended september 30 2022 the company s net loss ratio was 75 0 compared to 97 1 in the prior year period the net loss ratio decrease from the prior year period was primarily due to a lower impact of catastrophe losses there were only two minor wind events classified as catastrophes during the three months ended september 30 2022 the catastrophe losses contributed 1 1 points to the loss ratio this compares to a 33 1 point impact from catastrophe events from the prior year period which had more significant named storms including ida prior year development added 1 5 points to the current quarter s loss ratio compared to 0 points in the prior year quarter driven by the volatility of liability claim settlements from the discontinued commercial liability line the underlying loss ratio loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophe and prior year development was 72 4 for the quarter an increase of 8 4 points from the 64 0 in prior quarter period the higher 2022 loss ratio was primarily due to a general increase in property claims severity which is likely a result of recent climbing inflation net underwriting expense ratio for the quarter ended september 30 2022 the net underwriting expense ratio was 36 9 as compared to 39 3 in the prior year period a decrease of 2 4 percentage points the decrease in the quarter was attributable to the inception of the 30 personal lines quota share

value per share to evaluate the results to exclude the impact of interest rate changes on our fixed income portfolio net combined ratio excluding effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development is a non gaap ratio which is computed as the difference between gaap net combined ratio and the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development on the net combined ratio we believe that these ratios are useful to investors and they are used by management to reveal the trends in our business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year loss development catastrophe losses cause our loss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio and net combined ratio prior year loss development can cause our loss ratio to vary significantly between periods and separating this information allows us to better compare the results for the current accident period over time

least one of two primary causes first they hired a lot of employees during the pandemic when people were extremely online now the internet boom has faded offline life has picked up and those new employees seem too expensive second broader economic wobbles have made brands more reluctant to spend on digital ads a source of revenue for many tech companies high interest rates have put an end to the cheap money era of venture capital here are some of the companies that have announced the biggest job cuts amazon a reported 10 000 jobs amazon said wednesday that layoffs had begun though it did not state the number of employees affected the online retail and cloud computing behemoth plans to lay off some 10 000 employees in corporate and technology jobs the new york times was the first to

and a decline in ad sales the primary way the company makes money i got this wrong and i take responsibility for that he wrote the layoffs come as the company has invested billions in the so called metaverse pitched as a virtual reality future in which people will work mingle exercise and go to concerts but it s an unproven bet on the future and not all everyone is convinced it should be the social media company s focus eric risberg ap ap meta ceo mark zuckerberg made big investments in the metaverse which he showed off during a virtual event last year last week zuckerberg announced the

hiring too many workers in recent years i own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation i grew the company size too quickly i apologize for that he wrote musk s 44 billion purchase of twitter which he tried to get out of for several months has saddled the company with 13 billion of new debt his short tenure at the top of twitter has been marked by hasty changes quickly halted including his plan for a revamped twitter blue verification service which charged 8 a month to get a blue checkmark on one s account accounts impersonating celebrities major corporations and musk himself proliferated immediately spurring twitter to halt twitter blue signupstwice within a week key executives who were not fired including twitter s head of content moderation and safety on the

two events highlight global cooperation this month the need for this exceeds the conspicuous lack of it in today s world multiple shocks have impacted the world economy the unprecedented ones being the covid 19 pandemic the russia ukraine war catapulting geopolitics above geoeconomics and weather extremities frayed relations between the united states of america and china have aggravated the problems the combined fallout on global supplies and prices especially food and energy has slowed recoveries with some big economies expected to slide into recession policy challenges to tackle inflation facilitate urgent climate actions and recover global growth provide the backdrop to the 27th annual conference of parties on climate change issues that commenced last week as well as the g20 leaders summit a group of twenty advanced and emerging economies formed to coordinate policies for global economic stability and sustainable growth amongst other objectives the problems are universal and testing but require mutual collaboration can this happen standalone actions cannot address climate change which recognises no geography or jurisdiction global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions affects all albeit unequally realising the shared objective of limiting global temperature to 1 5 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels is a joint responsibility climate negotiations are fractious ranging from rules and regulations to financing investments technology and so on they ve been tortuously slow riven by a rift amongst the rich countries responsible for global warming through their greenhouse gas emissions for over a century and the developing ones which bear the brunt of climate related vulnerabilities and bear grudges against injustices in the decarbonisation efforts that could slow their growth rates the demand is that the richer countries pay to cover the costs of climate damages and for low carbon transition a moral obligation the pledge of climate financing of 100 billion annually to ensure a just transition to a clean energy future remains unfulfilled so far the figure is peanuts compared to an estimated 1 trillion required for climate actions each year advertisement however there are some positive markers of climate cooperation the inclusion of climate loss and damage compensation in cop27 s official agenda for the first time funds for some highly vulnerable countries by a few rich nations towards adaptation financing a carbon offset plan the energy transition accelerator a us government initiative with the bezos earth fund and the rockefeller foundation to enable developing countries to meet their energy transition goals through private capital are some examples the prospect of these extending to satisfactory aid for developing countries or any meaningful green initiatives is still uncertain stretched public finances and astronomical debt levels in the advanced world are key restraints financial positions of the poorer countries are far more precarious many are reeling under weather severities which have added to the pandemic distress including hunger and increased poverty most face depressed growth and narrowed funding opportunities or access there are positive ironies too the cumulative impetus of different shocks has been unintendedly motivational for climate cooperation the once ina century pandemic underscored the reality of climate change shook past apathies and elicited net zero emission pledges by many countries most notably by the two largest emitters the us and china second russia s weaponisation of gas supplies created forceful incentives for structural change in energy markets and policies according to the international energy agency despite an increased use of fossil fuels to bridge shortfalls it has accelerated transitions to renewable energies and cleaner technologies the economist november 5 2022 third geopolitical and extreme weather shocks further underlined climate change threats to food security as deficits arose due to heatwaves and weather and war induced disruptions to foodgrain trade and transportation earlier the pandemic had reinforced securing essential foods and nearshoring production of medical and other necessities a meeting of the american and chinese presidents on the sidelines of the g20 meeting this week is a positive development in this light both countries are critical to advancing climate cooperation this applies as much to other global challenges at the g20 which is more impeded by geopolitics than any other group a platform for multilateral cooperation conceived such that leaders of member countries could meet unconstrained by the formal structures that exist at other multilateral forums the body played an important role back in 2009 the joint coordinated policy responses helped avert a recession and restored the functioning of financial markets but the world and its environment in 2022 do not empower the g20 to make a difference of comparable scale or magnitude heightened us china tensions have additionally weighed down its functioning the g20 has economic heft constituting almost 80 of the world s gdp and three quarters of its trade besides significant financial and investment flows therefore how its members especially the big ones like the us and china respond and perform would make a substantial difference to the world economy this is why the leaders meeting of these two countries at the first g20 summit since the outbreak of the war represents some ice melting if not a breakthrough coordinated collective efforts for mitigating inflation ensuring food security for vulnerable populations and combating the global economic slowdown are sorely needed in these difficult times individual and differential responses to problems such as inflation when the causes are common for example energy prices war related sanctions and blockages to trade end up aggravating the problems rather than resolving them similarly an optimal restoration of world trade would facilitate lower costs stimulate growth and investments but it seems doubtable economic and trade fragmentation with concepts such as friend shoring production and reshaping supply chains governed by security friendship and shared values instead of efficiency considerations serve to undermine the g20 s capacity or capability for agreements on vital issues still the platform provides a valuable informal space and an opportunity to lessen tensions and heighten political reconciliations even a semblance of this would help inch closer to addressing critical and common global challenges climate mitigation overlapping with cop27 is one of these while the other imminent issues require multilateral economic cooperation for which the g20 is an important forum however meaningful breakthrough or progress in the current settings remains an open question renu kohli is a macroeconomist
updated november 16 2022 at 1 31 pm et for more than two decades the u s tech industry has been a reliable source of booming stocks and cushy high paid jobs in the span of weeks the sheen has faded and the ax has fallen more than 35 000 tech workers across 72 companies have been laid off this month adding to a total of 120 000 tech jobs lost this year according to layoffs fyi which tracks job cuts in the tech industry it s safe to say a reckoning is underway even as each company is grappling with its own challenges see twitter many of the companies making public statements have cited at least one of two primary causes first they hired a lot of employees during the pandemic when people were extremely online now the internet boom has faded offline life has picked up and those new employees seem too expensive second broader economic wobbles have made brands more reluctant to spend on digital ads a source of revenue for many tech companies high interest rates have put an end to the cheap money era of venture capital here are some of the companies that have announced the biggest job cuts amazon a reported 10 000 jobs amazon said wednesday that layoffs had begun though it did not state the number of employees affected the online retail and cloud computing behemoth plans to lay off some 10 000 employees in corporate and technology jobs the new york times was the first to report on monday after a deep set of reviews we recently decided to consolidate some teams and programs one of the consequences of these decisions is that some roles will no longer be required wrote dave limp amazon s senior vice president of devices and services in a memo shared on the company s website as of this fall amazon employed more than 1 5 million full and part time workers around the world many in warehouses the 10 000 expected layoffs would comprise about 3 of amazon s corporate employees according to the times and a significantly smaller share of its overall workforce the cuts reportedly will focus on amazon s devices division including alexa the company s virtual assistant technology as well as its retail and human resources divisions earlier this month the company announced a hiring freeze on corporate jobs we re facing an unusual macro economic environment and want to balance our hiring and investments with being thoughtful about this economy wrote beth galetti amazon s senior vice president of people experience and technology meta 11 000 jobs facebook and instagram s parent company meta laid off 11 000 people last week about 13 of its staff ceo mark zuckerberg attributed the cuts to overhiring during the pandemic in a letter to staffposted to the corporate website he cited a decline in e commerce the wider economic downturn increased competition and a decline in ad sales the primary way the company makes money i got this wrong and i take responsibility for that he wrote the layoffs come as the company has invested billions in the so called metaverse pitched as a virtual reality future in which people will work mingle exercise and go to concerts but it s an unproven bet on the future and not all everyone is convinced it should be the social media company s focus eric risberg ap ap meta ceo mark zuckerberg made big investments in the metaverse which he showed off during a virtual event last year last week zuckerberg announced the company was laying off 13 of its staff zuckerberg said the workforce cuts would affect the whole organization with recruiting staff disproportionately affected due to fewer hires anticipated in the coming year a hiring freeze through the first quarter of 2023 will continue twitter about 3 700 jobs billionaire tesla and spacex ceo elon musk bought the social media platform at the end of october and wasted no time slashing its workforce he immediately ousted the company s leadership including its ceo cfo and top lawyer mass layoffs were announced on november 4 with about 50 of the staff cut regarding twitter s reduction in force unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over 4m day musk tweeted co founder and former ceo jack dorsey tweetedthat he accepted blame for hiring too many workers in recent years i own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation i grew the company size too quickly i apologize for that he wrote musk s 44 billion purchase of twitter which he tried to get out of for several months has saddled the company with 13 billion of new debt his short tenure at the top of twitter has been marked by hasty changes quickly halted including his plan for a revamped twitter blue verification service which charged 8 a month to get a blue checkmark on one s account accounts impersonating celebrities major corporations and musk himself proliferated immediately spurring twitter to halt twitter blue signupstwice within a week key executives who were not fired including twitter s head of content moderation and safety on the platform and the company s chief privacy officer and compliance officer resigned last week stripe about 1 000 jobs payment processing platform stripeannounced on november 3 that it was cutting 14 of its workforce stripe ceo patrick collison wrote in an email to employees that the pandemic pushed the world toward e commerce spurring the company s growth the ceo said he and his brother and co founder john collison had made two very consequential mistakes being too optimistic about the internet economy s near term growth and growing stripe s operating costs too quickly we are facing stubborn inflation energy shocks higher interest rates reduced investment budgets and sparser startup funding any parts of the developed world appear to be headed for recession we think that 2022

chairman brown ranking member toomey and other members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the federal reserve s supervisory and regulatory activities earlier this year i was honored to be sworn in as the board s vice chair for supervision in this role my priority is to make the banking system safer and fairer that requires active and careful analysis of risks the banking system is constantly evolving so regulation and supervision must also adjust to respond to new and emerging risks i am also committed to making the financial system fairer which is fundamental to financial oversight households and businesses need access to safe and reliable banking services as they make their financial decisions while safety and fairness may seem distinct they are interwoven financial instability disproportionately harms those who are economically vulnerable so making the financial system safer is making it fairer and unfair practices can make the financial system riskier as we saw in the global financial crisis i look forward to pursuing both of these goals during my time as vice chair for supervision accompanying my testimony today is the federal reserve s supervision and regulation report detailing the current state of the banking system from our supervisory and regulatory perspective my testimony will offer you an overview of the banking system s current conditions and highlight efforts to monitor and mitigate vulnerabilities i will also provide updates on a number of priority issues that the federal reserve is seeking to address current conditions reforms following the global financial crisis have helped the united states maintain a resilient financial system for consumers businesses and communities capital and liquidity positions remain above regulatory requirements the federal reserve s supervisory stress test conducted earlier this year showed that large banks had sufficient capital to maintain their lending to support the economy through the stressful conditions simulated by the stress test but as i mentioned we must ensure we are keeping pace many issues at the forefront of banking regulation today were not prominent five or ten years ago and some of them scarcely even existed for instance few anticipated a global pandemic even economists who used epidemiological approaches to model financial contagion further the recent events in crypto markets while mostly occurring outside the banking sector have highlighted the risks to investors and consumers associated with new and novel asset classes and activities when not accompanied by strong guardrails in addition despite the data depicting a generally healthy u s banking system the domestic economic outlook has weakened amid tighter financial conditions and increased uncertainty a weaker economy could put stress on households and businesses and thus on the banking system as a whole uncertainty has led to increased financial market volatility and may also reveal pockets of excess leverage and liquidity risk in the non bank financial sector which risks spillovers to the banking system and the real economy we saw a host of such risks with the disruptions in the united kingdom s gilt markets the federal reserve will be heightening its focus on liquidity credit and interest rate risks as supervised institutions manage the changing financial conditions in the wake of the pandemic the global recovery is uneven inflation is far too high and geopolitical events pose downside risks to the u s and other economies around the world russia s war of aggression is devastating for the people of ukraine and is also disrupting commodities energy and food markets and pushing up inflation around the world and these factors along with china s economic slowing associated with its inward turn pandemic shutdowns and contraction in its real estate sector are weighing on global economic growth we remain attentive to these and other developments and are closely supervising our regulated institutions to assess potential risks and implications for the stability of the u s and global financial systems supervisory and regulatory priorities capital review turning to a number of our priorities at the federal reserve i am taking a holistic look at the fed s capital framework to assess whether it is functioning as intended and supports a resilient financial system robust capital and liquidity requirements make it more likely that banks are able to absorb losses and continue their vital role supporting households and businesses this is especially important for the largest and most complex banks which pose the greatest risk to u s financial stability we are taking a look at the g sib surcharge the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio stress testing the countercyclical capital buffer and other measures within this context i am committed to working with my colleagues at the other federal bank regulatory agencies in implementing enhanced regulatory capital requirements known as the basel iii endgame standards 1 when considering improvements to the regulatory capital framework i will be guided by a few key principles the capital framework should be forward looking should be tiered so that the highest standards apply to the riskiest firms and should support a safer and fairer financial system we will look at design choices that help to further these goals resolution in recent years merger activity and organic growth have increased the size of large banks which could complicate efforts by regulators to resolve those firms upon failure without disruption to customers and counterparties the board recently invited comment on an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to enhance regulators ability to resolve large banks in an orderly way should they fail we look forward to the comments we will receive merger review the federal reserve is also evaluating our approach to reviewing banks proposed acquisitions mergers are often a feature of vibrant sectors but the advantages that firms seek to gain through mergers must be weighed against the risks that mergers can pose to competition consumers and financial stability a merged institution may be able to provide a wider range of products and services at lower prices but if there is concentration mergers could also reduce competition and access to financial services through higher prices or a reduced range of services in addition mergers of larger more complex firms may pose risks to financial stability we are also required to evaluate whether a merger would meet the convenience and needs of the community the federal reserve along with the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic is reviewing the issues to see if any adjustments to our approach would be appropriate crypto activity another priority is monitoring the risk of crypto asset related activities over the last several years we have seen crypto asset activity grow rapidly and experience periods of significant stress some financial innovations offer opportunities but as we have recently seen many innovations also carry risks which can include liquidity runs the rapid collapse of asset values misuse of customer funds fraud theft manipulation and money laundering these risks if not well controlled can harm retail investors and cut against the goals of a safe and fair financial system most of this activity is occurring outside of the ambit of banking regulation but recent events remind us of the potential for systemic risk if interlinkages develop between the crypto system that exists today and the traditional financial system crypto asset related activity requires effective oversight that includes safeguards to ensure that crypto companies are subject to similar regulatory safeguards as other financial services providers i would note with some humility that striking the right balance between creating an environment that supports innovation and managing related risks to businesses households and the stability of the financial system is no easy task we do not want to stifle innovation but when regulation is lax or behind the curve it can facilitate risk taking and a race to the bottom that puts consumers businesses and the economy in danger and discredits new products and services with consumers and investors i believe everyone has a stake in getting the regulatory balance right we are working closely with the occ and the fdic to assess the risks and opportunities posed by a range of crypto asset related activities and to clarify which activities are legally permissible and can be conducted by banks in a manner that is consistent with safety and soundness consumer protection and overall stability of the financial system before leaving the topic of crypto assets i would like to touch on stablecoins stablecoins which like other instruments that purport to be available on demand at par value can be subject to destabilizing runs and require strong federal prudential oversight to mitigate their potential for economic harm that is especially the case for stablecoins that aim to function as private money legislative action on crypto assets in general and stablecoins in particular would help promote responsible innovation and protect the financial system climate related financial risks we are also working to understand financial risks related to climate change at the federal reserve our mandate in this area is important but narrow and we are focused on our supervisory responsibilities and our role in promoting a safe and stable financial system to that end the federal reserve recently announced a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise designed to enhance the ability of supervisors and firms to measure and manage climate related financial risks scenario analysis in which the resilience of financial institutions is assessed under different hypothetical climate scenarios is an emerging tool to assess climate related financial risks the pilot climate scenario analysis exercise which is distinct and separate from bank stress tests will be exploratory in nature and not have capital consequences it is also our intention to work with the occ and the fdic to provide guidance to large banks on how we expect them to identify measure monitor and manage the financial risks of climate change operational resilience the last priority i will mention is operational resilience financial institutions face significant challenges from a wide range of disruptive events these include technology based failures cyber incidents pandemics and natural disasters such events combined with banks growing reliance on third party service providers expose them to a range of operational risks which are often difficult to anticipate when they manifest these risks can affect the safety and soundness of affected banks and pose risks to u s financial stability by limiting market functioning or undermining trust in the system we at the federal reserve will continue to work in this area to help ensure that banks understand and manage these complex and evolving challenges and that consumers remain protected additionally we are committed to working closely with other domestic agencies and international authorities to coordinate on supervisory approaches to operational resilience conclusion as the banking system continues to evolve we must ensure that supervision and regulation keeps up with those changes and are appropriate for the underlying risks over the coming months and years it will be crucial to examine new risks to the banking system and whether and how the real economy including consumer needs and access to financial services may change as vulnerabilities appear a strong banking system will help households and businesses weather those challenges as vice chair for supervision i will continue to work to promote a safe and fair banking system thank you and i look forward to your questions 1

dollars unless otherwise stated turquoise hill s interim ceo steve thibeault stated during the third quarter turquoise hill management remained focused on maintaining a safe and efficient operation at the oyu tolgoi mine and on advancing the oyu tolgoi underground project i am pleased that thanks to the commitment of our people we were able to deliver good results on both fronts safety has always been and will remain our top priority so it is gratifying to report that our oyu tolgoi team turned in a very solid health and safety performance achieving an all injury frequency rate of 0 19 for 200 000 hours worked for the first three quarters of the year from a production perspective we increased our gold production guidance for the year and are on track to meet our revised copper production guidance during the quarter we made excellent progress on the underground project as we fired the 7th drawbell and started commissioning the second truck chute by early november subsequent to the quarter end we had fired another four drawbells all ahead of schedule given progress to date and considering natural caving conditions we continue to expect to achieve sustainable production from panel 0 in the first quarter of 2023 which is earlier than originally anticipated we believe that our third quarter has put us in a good position to end the year with a robust operation and with the project poised to reach a major milestone in the first quarter of 2023 regarding the transaction with rio tinto and its impact on the future of the company if our minority shareholders approve the transaction we will proceed with the orderly wind up and delisting of the company and will ensure that our employees are treated fairly and respectfully throughout that process if the transaction does not proceed we will continue to manage the company on a standalone basis our immediate priority will be to address our liquidity requirements by implementing all elements of the binding funding heads

operating cash costs 5 of 228 0 million in q3 22 increased 1 7 from 224 1 million in q3 21 which is largely due to inflationary pressures on prices for critical supplies including fuel power and explosives partially offset by higher deferred stripping due to the planned transition of mining from phase 4b to phase 5a and lower royalty costs due to lower revenue of 228 0 million in q3 22 increased 1 7 from 224 1 million in q3 21 which is largely due to inflationary pressures on prices for critical supplies including fuel power and explosives partially offset by higher deferred stripping due to the planned transition of mining from phase 4b to phase 5a and lower royalty costs due to lower revenue expenditures on property plant and equipment 6 in q3 22 were 267 6 million

primarily due to 271 0 million lower revenue 44 0 million higher cost of sales and 3 9 million higher other operating cash costs these higher costs were largely due to inflationary pressures on prices for critical supplies including fuel power and explosives net cash used in operating activities was 33 6 million versus net cash generated from operating activities of 382 0 million in q3 21 in addition to the factors discussed above this change was also impacted by 26 1 million higher interest paid in q3 22 due to a timing difference on payment of certain completion support fees to rio

for 2022 oyu tolgoi is expected to produce 110 to 150 thousand tonnes of copper and 165 to 185 thousand ounces of gold in concentrates in 2022 from processing ore from the open pit underground and stockpiles gold production guidance has been revised upward from a previous forecast range of 150 to 170 thousand ounces the higher gold guidance reflects more reliable grade performance from mining of phase 5 during q3 22 with related higher recoveries this builds on the higher gold production from completion of phase 4b in h1 22 total operating cash costs8 for 2022 are now expected to be in the range of 855 million to 910 million compared to previous guidance of 850 million to 925 million which is largely due to deferral of non critical activities to contain inflationary pressures for key inputs including fuel and ammonium nitrate capital expenditures on surface operations9 for 2022 are expected to remain within the previously disclosed guidance range of 140 million to 170 million capital expenditures on the underground project9 are now expected to be lower at 1 0 billion to 1 1 billion for 2022 compared to original guidance of 1 1 billion to 1 3 billion resulting from improvements to construction productivity and the slower ramp up and onboarding of on site construction resources throughout 2022 capital expenditures on the underground project9 are expected to be comprised of 600 million to 700 million of underground development capital expenditures9 and 400 million to 500 million of underground sustaining capital expenditures9 capital expenditures on surface operations9 is mainly comprised of deferred stripping equipment purchases tailings storage facility construction and maintenance componentisation capital expenditures on the underground project9 is inclusive of vat and capitalised management services payments but excludes capitalised interest 2022 c1 cash costs are expected to be in the range of positive 1 55 to positive 2 05 per pound of copper produced10 which compares to previous guidance of positive 1 95 to positive 2 35 per pound of copper produced 2022 is higher than 2021 due to lower gold production in 2022 the reduction in c1 cash costs from previous guidance is due to improved grade performance for gold and cost optimisations helping to offset the inflationary pressures noted above unit cost guidance assumes the midpoint of the expected 2022 copper and gold production ranges and a gold commodity price assumption of 1 808 per ounce estimates of future production expenditures on property plant and equipment total operating cash costs and c1 cash costs per pound of copper produced presented in this press release are based on mine plans that reflect the expected method by which the company will mine reserves at oyu tolgoi actual gold and copper production and associated costs may vary from these estimates due to a number of operational and non operational risk factors see the section forward looking statements and

investments in ot llc on behalf of erdenes until sustainable production is achieved as at september 30 2022 turquoise hill had 0 2 billion of available liquidity in the form of cash and cash equivalents which under current projections would be sufficient to meet the company s requirements including funding of underground capital expenditures into december 2022 thereafter the company plans to rely on the various sources of funding available under the amended hoa to provide it with sufficient liquidity and resources to meet its minimum obligations for a period of at least 12 months from the balance sheet date of september 30 2022 the risks inherent in delivery of the amended hoa funding plan some of which are outside of the company s control result in the existence of a material uncertainty that casts a significant doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern the amended hoa amends restates and supersedes the previous versions of this agreement between the company and rio tinto it is the fourth iteration of this agreement the previous versions are as follows with each amending restating and superseding its respective predecessor version amended and restated heads of agreement dated may 18 2022 amended and restated heads of agreement dated january 24 2022 heads of agreement entered into on april 9 2021 and the non binding memorandum of understanding dated september 9 2020 the key elements of the amended hoa include a commitment by rio tinto to make available to turquoise hill by way of one or more secured advances the early advance up to 650 million which shall be made to the extent there are no funds available to the company and its subsidiaries after allowing for the need for cash reserves for working capital purposes of 200 million in the aggregate if it is anticipated that the funding shortfall if any for march 2023 will exceed the remaining funds available under the early advance the company and rio tinto will in good faith discuss increasing the early advance by the lesser of such shortfall and 100 million a commitment by rio tinto to provide additional bridge financing to the company on the same terms as the early advance in the event that the company is required to provide additional funding for oyu tolgoi in respect of the december 2022 scheduled principal repayment of 362 million under the oyu tolgoi project finance facility the early advance shall be repaid from the proceeds of the initial equity offering as defined below a commitment by the company to conduct one or more equity offerings for aggregate proceeds of no less than the greater of 650 million and the amount then drawn and outstanding under the early advance the initial equity offering by an extended deadline to be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the amended hoa as a result of the indefinite postponement of the special meeting as hereinafter defined from its originally scheduled date of november 1 2022 the maturity date of the early advance may be extended up to but no later than may 31 2023 a commitment by rio tinto to participate pro rata in the initial equity offering subject to certain preconditions in consideration for payment of a 0 5 commitment fee rio tinto committing to provide additional short term secured advances directly to the company up to a maximum of 300 million the rt advance which would be available in an event where there are no funds available to the company after allowing for the need for cash reserves for working capital purposes of 200 million in the aggregate and taking account of any remaining availability under the early advance a commitment by rio tinto to provide a co lending facility co lending facility with the aggregate amount drawn under the rt advance and the co lending facility not to exceed 750 million to be made available once sustainable production has been achieved and rio tinto in its role as manager of oyu tolgoi with the assistance of the treasury group of rio tinto is tasked with leading the process of rescheduling of principal repayments of existing debt re profiling to potentially reduce the base case incremental funding requirement by up to approximately 1 7 billion and seeking to raise up to 500 million of additional senior supplemental debt ssd and use all reasonable commercial efforts to complete the re profiling by no later than december 31 2022 further the amended hoa provides that if necessary turquoise hill would be required to raise up to a total of 1 5 billion less the amount raised in the initial equity offering via equity in a form of its choosing the requirement of rio tinto to advance funds under the co lending facility is subject to a number of conditions precedent set out in the amended hoa including among others that certain undertakings provided by the company in favour of the oyu tolgoi project finance lenders be amended to cover the co lending facility that terms of the oyu tolgoi project finance agreements with respect to a sponsor senior loan not be amended in any material respect the absence of new material claims and proceedings against turquoise hill or rio tinto that could adversely impact the funding elements of the amended hoa the absence of a material adverse change and of a suspensive event as defined under the oyu tolgoi project finance agreements and operations at oyu tolgoi not having been suspended for certain defined periods of time and all relevant third party approvals and consents having been obtained the requirement of rio tinto to advance funds under the rt advance is also subject to a number of conditions precedent set out in the amended hoa substantially similar to those applicable to the co lending facility the foregoing list of conditions does not purport to be exhaustive and investors should refer to a copy of the amended hoa as filed on the sedar and edgar profiles of the company in light of the financing debt restrictions in resolution 103 until sustainable production is achieved ot llc s estimated funding requirements are expected to be addressed by cash on hand at ot llc the re profiling or the commitment by rio tinto to provide additional bridge financing to the company on the same terms as the early advance in the event that the company is required to provide additional funding for oyu tolgoi in respect of the december 2022 scheduled principal repayment of 362 million under the oyu tolgoi project finance facility the early advance and the rt advance with these funds being provided to ot llc via the ot llc board of directors approved pre paid copper concentrate sale arrangement between turquoise hill and ot llc at september 30 2022 the company estimates its base case incremental funding range to be 3 7 billion to 4 0 billion an increase of 0 1 billion to 0 4 billion from its june 30 2022 estimate of 3 6 billion significant contributors to this increase include updated commodity pricing and other market based assumptions including libor and inflation and a draft operating plan for 2023 received from ot llc assuming a fully successful re profiling raising of ssd and implementation of the other elements of the amended hoa the company based on updated liquidity forecasts currently estimates it could need to raise incremental equity proceeds of approximately 0 5 billion to 0 8 billion june 30 2022 0 4b which would be in addition to an initial equity offering estimated to be at least 650 million to fully address its estimated incremental funding requirement within the timing framework of the amended hoa the amended hoa sets a target date for the re profiling of no later than december 31 2022 and an outside date for the ssd and co lending facility to the earlier of the three months following the lifting of the debt restrictions under resolution 103 and december 31 2023 any changes in key assumptions may impact the incremental funding requirement and as a result the actual amount of incremental equity required may be greater or less than the estimated range of 0 5 billion to 0 8 billion referred to above the issuance of any incremental equity in addition to the initial equity offering as well as the estimated timing of its issuance would take into account the expected timing and completion of all other funding elements of the amended hoa which would be needed to provide the company with sufficient liquidity and resources to meet its minimum obligations for at least twelve months from the balance sheet date of september 30 2022 the risks inherent in delivery of the amended hoa funding plan some of which are outside of the company s control result in the existence of a material uncertainty that casts a significant doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern in the event there is a residual funding requirement after implementing the elements of the amended hoa the company would consider all funding options available to it at that time successful implementation of the amended hoa is subject to achieving alignment with relevant stakeholders in addition to rio tinto including existing lenders any potential new lenders and the government of mongolia market conditions and other factors non fulfilment of any of the conditions precedent identified in the amended hoa would also adversely affect the ability of the company and ot llc to obtain additional funding or re profile existing debt as contemplated within the timeframe set out in the amended hoa the company is in discussions with rio tinto and other relevant stakeholders regarding implementation of the amended hoa as well as its residual funding requirements substantial progress has been made on reaching agreement on the commercial terms and conditions of the re profiling with the commercial terms and conditions now substantially agreed certain existing commercial bank lenders under the ot project financing have indicated that they are unable or unwilling to participate in the re profiling consequently rio tinto and the company are pursuing several potential solutions including but not limited to engaging existing lenders that are currently participating in the re profiling with a view to increasing their current participation levels and engaging with new potential commercial bank lenders who could replace any banks that ultimately decide to exit if rio tinto and turquoise hill are not successful in their efforts to secure the re profiling on or before december 15 2022 the company would be required in order to address its near term liquidity needs to draw on the 362 million bridge financing that rio tinto has committed to provide to the company under the amended hoa in order to fund the principal repayment of that same amount under the oyu tolgoi project finance facility due on december 15 2022 if the re profiling and ssd funding contemplated by the amended hoa are not wholly successful or the principal repayment of 362 million under the ot project financing is required to be made on december 15 2022 turquoise hill could require additional equity financing which would be in addition to the combined estimated equity funding requirement range of approximately 1 15 billion to 1 45 billion turquoise hill s liquidity outlook will continue to be impacted either positively or negatively by various factors many of which are outside the company s control including successful implementation of the amended hoa changes in commodity prices and other market based assumptions including libor and inflation surface operations performance as well as the successful implementation or otherwise of ongoing optimisation efforts any further changes to underground mine cost and schedule in addition to

what a week it was first the mid term elections failed to produce the red wave that most pollsters and pundits predicted as i write this the democrats have maintained control of the senate while it s still unclear which party will have control of the house and second the crypto industry may have experienced its very own lehman brothers moment ftx until recently the world s second largest crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy as its embattled founder sam bankman fried stepped down as ceo following a liquidity crunch that exposed the firm s improper use of customer assets ftx s shocking demise comes within months of the collapse of terra s luna coin which triggered the bankruptcies of crypto firms celsius network voyager digital and three arrows capital the question on many investors minds is how far and for how long will the contagion spread biggest mid term upset in decades it s common knowledge that mid term results have not always been kind to the incumbent president president barack obama s agenda was famously sidelined by a tea party shellacking in 2010 and republicans lost control of congress midway through president donald trump s term it s also a given that past performance does not guarantee future results as former secretary of the treasury larry summers tweeted last wednesday the last democratic president to have such a favorable mid term outcome as joe biden did was john f kennedy in 1962 it looks like you have to go back to jfk to find a democratic president whose first midterm election went as well as potus joebiden did last night lawrence h summers lhsummers november 9 2022 to be clear the gop may end up winning back a very narrow majority in the house once every vote is counted but the victory if we can call it that is a pyrrhic victory in many contests across the u s voters rejected the most extreme forms of trumpism putting the former president s 2024 ambitions into question wall street loves washington gridlock the big winner of the election was wall street as i ve pointed out before legislative gridlock has historically been constructive for stocks since sweeping policy changes become unlikely and there s less risk to individual sectors newly installed twitter boss elon musk was criticized before the election for recommending that people vote for a republican congress writing that shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties like him or not the billionaire entrepreneur is right since 1950 the has delivered the highest average returns when the white house was held by a democrat and the congress by republicans according to lpl research returns have also been higher than average when congress was split regardless of which party occupied the oval office if 2022 ended today it would be the worst year for stocks since 2008 but looking ahead conditions appear brighter if history is any indication the s p 500 was positive 12 months after all 19 mid term elections between 1946 and 2018 with an average return of over 18 money supply growth has slowed to a trickle of course investors have other concerns besides politics namely inflation stocks rallied 5 5 last thursday after the showed that annual inflation cooled for the fourth straight month in october falling to 7 7 although inflation remains stubbornly high the lower reading gave the market hope that the federal reserve may take its foot off the brake a little i happen to think this will not be the case we still have a way to go before inflation returns to a normal 2 but the trend is headed in the right direction driving much of the inflation of the past two years has been runaway money printing by global central banks in an effort to pump liquidity into a pandemic impacted economy the good news is that the rate of this money printing has slowed dramatically to a trickle since the frenetic days of 2020 and 2021 at a 1 7 annual growth rate currently m2 money supply is well below its 10 year average of around 5 crypto industry needs reasonable regulation returning to the issue of ftx i think it s important for people to understand that sam bankman fried or sbf was until recently seen as a smart trustworthy wunderkind fortune magazine called him the next warren buffett last year sbf said that ftx could one day buy goldman sachs nyse and the chicago mercantile exchange cme but as it did with theranos elizabeth holmes who just last week asked to be sentenced with an 18 month at home confinement life has come at sbf fast the 30 year old entrepreneur s net worth evaporated from an estimated 16 billion to less than 1 billion all within an unprecedented 24 hour period ftx and sbf s unethical decisions will inevitably contribute to many people s lack of trust in and provide fuel to its biggest

glory 1 of mazdutide innovent r d code ibi362 a glucagon like peptide 1 receptor glp 1r and glucagon receptor gcgr dual agonist in chinese adults with overweight or obesity this randomized double blinded placebo controlled phase 3 clinical study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mazdutide in chinese adults with overweight or obesity glory 1 nct05607680 mazdutide is the first glp r gcgr dual agonist to enter a phase 3 pivotal study for the treatment of obesity the study plans to enroll 600 subjects in a 1 1 1 ratio to receive either mazdutide 4mg mazdutide 6mg or placebo for 48 weeks the primary endpoints include the percentage change in body weight from baseline to week 32 and the proportion of subjects with 5 or more body weight loss from baseline at week 32 in a randomized double blind placebo controlled phase 2 clinical study of mazdutide in chinese adults with overweight or obesity clinicaltrials gov nct04904913 mazdutide titrated to 6mg achieved mean body weight loss of 11 57 at week 24 meanwhile mazdutide markedly reduced waist circumference blood pressure lipids blood uric acid transaminase and liver fat bringing multiple metabolic benefits to the

safety of mazdutide in chinese adults with overweight or obesity professor linong ji the principal investigator of the study peking university people s hospital stated obesity is associated with a variety of chronic non communicable diseases and is listed as one of the important risk factors that impose health burden to the human society the number and growth rate of obesity in china rank first place in the world thus effective and safe body weight loss drugs are urgently needed the results of the phase 2 study showed that mazdutide a glp 1r gcgr dual agonist demonstrated robust body weight loss efficacy and comprehensive metabolic improvement in chinese adults with overweight or obesity underlying its best in class potential of note the target population in this phase 3 study of mazdutide is different from those in pivotal studies of approved drugs of the same class the latter were mainly western caucasian populations with higher bmi our planned phase 3 clinical studies of mazdutide will provide large scale clinical evidence which will be more representative of the chinese population to shed light on clinical practice i am looking forward to more exciting results of mazdutide in the phase 3 clinical study and hope mazdutide will become an innovative and potentially best in class anti obesity drug who obesity and overweight key facts accessed jan 18 2018 dr lei qian vice president of clinical development at innovent stated the results of the phase 2 study of mazdutide in chinese adults with overweight or obesity fully demonstrate the clinical value of glp 1r

even better the insight investment pension model showed that funded status improved by 4 8 percentage points to 105 2 in october from 100 4 in september according to sweta vaidya head of solution design north america at insight investment equity returns were strong and liability gains were also significant both of which caused funded status to improve year to date funded status has improved by

update for october pension funds enjoyed their best month of the year in october driven by higher stock prices and higher interest rates funded status improved by 4 8 to 105 2 from 100 4 assets

estimates the health of a typical u s corporate defined benefit pension plan estimated that the average funding ratio has increased to 100 7 during october from 95 6 a month earlier this was primarily

to 5 71 for october the highest rate since march 2010 from 5 36 in september this increase helped to offset october s flat investment returns of 0 21 which lowered the milliman 100 pfi asset value by

corvette z06 coupe make chevrolet segment coupe it was only a matter of time before somebody put the all new 2023 chevrolet corvette z06 on a chassis dyno to see how many of the claimed 670 horses actually make it to the wheels we now finally have an answer to the question thanks to the speed demon youtube channel the car you see here is an actual customer car which means it s as representative of the real thing as we re going to find but wait there s more the drivetrain loss is well under the usual 15 to 20 which means chevrolet either underclaimed or the z06 over delivers either way it s a win for the customer the first run chucked out 597 horsepower at 8 380 rpm and 422 lb ft at 6 360 rpm the second run produced 600 hp at 8 490 rpm and 424 lb ft at 6 360 rpm on the third run the vette hit 610 hp at precisely 8 400 rpm and 420 lb ft at 6 200 rpm that s a powertrain loss of just 9 at more or less sea level dallas is not high enough above sea level to rob the engine of any performance if you skip forward to roughly 8 20 you ll also hear the shop owner make a shocking revelation the shop in question phenom autos specializes in lamborghini huracans and audi r8s when asked how much lambo s famous v10 engine normally puts down on the dyno we learn that it s roughly 500 horses the lowest the huracan went was 571 hp in the rear wheel drive lp580 2 and the highest so far has been 631 in the sto and tecnica and there s more good news for the american enthusiast the z06 has been called america s 458 and it s not hard to see why it follows the same magical recipe as the 458 italia and phenom autos has historical data a stock 458 produced 420 hp and 318 lb ft of torque on this particular dyno in short we have an american built flat plane crank v8 that outperforms an italian built flat plane v8 and v10 by a considerable margin if you don t love this car you must have some sort of personal grudge it s clear the z06 is a highly efficient car the only vehicle with a more impressive dyno run was the bmw m4 csl bmw s lightweight limited run special posted 605 hp and 531 lb ft of torque but the germans only claim 543 hp and 479 lb ft of torque on the flip side claimed figures can often get you into trouble as we recently saw with the hennessey venom 1200 that only produced 1 000 hp during a dyno run even at current market adjusted prices the z06 is the supercar performance bargain of the year

hiring too many workers in recent years i own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation i grew the company size too quickly i apologize for that he wrote musk s 44 billion purchase of

that we saw some evidence of inflation starting to come down but i just cannot stress this is one data point we re going to need to see a continued run of this kind of behaviour and inflation slowly starting to come down before we really start thinking about taking our foot off the brakes here i had noted that the fed would need more than just one lower inflation report to alter its planned trajectory fed governor christopher waller happened to be speaking in sydney yesterday the world was listening as was the local market with the asx200 opening up 38 points and then falling back for the rest of the session the aussie ten year yield jumped back 11 points to 2 76 only the resource sectors managed to hold their initial gains with materials closing up 3 4 and energy 0 9 while every other sector retreated there were 1 2 falls for all sectors which benefitted greatly on friday from lower yields related to the lower us cpi the resource sectors responded to price surges across the commodity spectrum driven by a precipitous fall in the us dollar that ended last night and signs china is easing restrictions despite pretending otherwise the nsw floods have not gone unnoticed by rights insurers should benefit from higher rates but yesterday they fell helping financials down 1 0 while ag company elders eld reported solid earnings but warned of the winter crop being flood impacted the ceo also announced he will be retiring which contributed to the stock s 22 9 plunge yeah thanks for the gold watch hence consumer staples fell 1 6 to leave every sector in the red by the close other than resources guess what every index top five winner was a miner elders topped the losers while perpetual ppt dropped 5 8 as it heads back to court to sort out the complex menage a trois of a corporate battle wall street took heed of waller s statement but there was other conflicting fedspeak to absorb last night indeed there are no less than ten fed officials getting their 15 minutes of fame this week in the meantime wall street has taken a breather after last week s big surge accelerating losses to the close technically speaking i think it will probably be appropriate soon to choose a slower pace of increases we ve done a lot so said fed vice chair lael brainard last night following on from waller s assessment but we can consider a this is not the first time she s said exactly that b she s only talking about the pace not the end rate which she has said could be 5 and c we can debate till we re blue in the face all the way to mid december but wall street was expecting a drop to a 50 point rate going into the cpi print and still does coming out of it even powell has previously hinted the pace can come down if not the terminal rate target yet there are ten fedheads set to put in their two bobs worth this week so no doubt there ll be much discussion that said wall street closed lower last night and us bond yields higher in the wake of waller s remarks no huge surprise after last week s surge from the technical perspective the s p500 is running into a wall at the 4000 level it crossed 4000 on friday night before falling back and tried again last night before ultimately failing on that basis selling accelerated into the close it appears something beyond just endless fed rhetoric will be required to push wall street forward into a true santa rally news last night is that amazon plans to lay off 10 000 corporate and technology employees merry christmas typically at this time amazon employs around 50 000 seasonal drones to work in the distribution centres so maybe the corporate types have one temporary option it s the biggest lay off in amazon s history albeit represents only 1 of its global workforce and 3 of corporate but it follows meta s lay off of 13 of its workforce and musk firing half of all twitter staff the tech sector lay off and hiring freeze announcements keep coming and i m guessing these guys all have fairly similar skills wall street is never quite sure whether lay offs are bad news implying recession or good news the fed wants to see higher unemployment commodities spot metals minerals energy futures

big cities reporting record infections on monday opec also cut its global demand forecast again and the us dollar finally bounced by 0 4 all adds up to a sizeable retreat in oil prices last night following last week s gains and mixed moves in metals it has upset the us that quad partner india has continued to purchase oil from russia to fuel its economic growth but last night treasury secretary janet yellen said india can continue buying as much russian oil as it wants including at prices above a g7 imposed price cap mechanism if it steers clear of western insurance finance and maritime services bound by the cap on december 5 the g7 will impose a price cap on russian oil exports and new sanctions will prohibit any insuring financing or transporting russian oil yellen could have told india you can buy all you want but good luck trying to get it no one really knows how this will all play out and how it will impact on oil demand supply and pricing the aussie is off 0 1 at

in recent quarters one of the most critical items that management has focused on and continues to focus on is the development and implementation of plans to stem the losses that the company has suffered in recent years and to ameliorate the company s financial position as a result of those sustained losses the company lacks the cash necessary to fully fund the business operations and its strategic product initiatives the company continues to manage its cash flows carefully to mitigate risk of insolvency as a result of these efforts management has been successful in improving the company s cash flows in recent quarters nevertheless without an infusion of cash in the months ahead the company may not be able to realize its strategic plans and could eventually cease to be a going concern to address that cash need management negotiated a cad 1 million revolving loan facility with a related party for working capital purposes in 2020 in 2020 management also realized the sale of one of its two idle assets the sale of the runhao facility resulted in significant debt reduction and better positions the company to be able to access additional lines of working capital management also continues to explore options for the sale or repurposing of its idle runyang primary processing facility in jiangsu province to further address its cash needs and balance sheet another factor that continues to contribute to the company s financial situation is the competitive price pressure in the stevia market over the last two years that has reduced mainstream reb a products such as reb a 80 and reb a 97 to the lowest price levels in years although pricing has begun to rise reflecting the increased cost of raw materials in the most recent harvest monk fruit prices have also become increasingly competitive in the marketplace to maintain margins at sustainable levels the company has focused on improving its production efficiencies continues to strive for a mix of products that is weighted more heavily on higher margin specialty products and has focused more on higher margin direct sales the company s focus on maintaining positive cash flow led the company to take decisive steps in 2021 and continued efforts in 2022 to reduce its sg a costs as well as its production costs both its north american operations and chinese operations have significantly reduced sg a costs for the last several years the company s production capacity has been far greater than its projected order levels as it had sought rapid increases in orders for reb a products the company s aim continues to be to right size its chinese operations i e to optimize its staffing and production planning to meet the company s projected production requirements while retaining the ability to accommodate growth in future order volumes and management made significant progress in this area and continues striving to optimize staffing and production plans as a result this has enabled the company to sell its goods at more competitive and or more profitable prices although the competitive price pressures remain strong the company continues to explore options to significantly improve its balance sheet and cash flows whether through restructuring of debt or other opportunities for infusions of cash to address the debt load one of these options is taking shape as the company entered into a joint venture in china through its runhai subsidiary which has the potential to significantly increase revenues and overhaul the company s balance sheet the company also continues to explore options that may be complementary to the natural sweetener market where it could leverage its production expertise and equipment towards an investment that may help grow the company s revenues and improve its financial position while the company continues to face substantial risks management remains optimistic about the future opportunities for the company having closed the idle asset sale in 2020 and having successfully implemented right sizing efforts to manage costs having entered into the joint venture and continuing to optimize production efficiencies costs and planning management is proceeding down the best available path to increased financial stability and improved profitability selected financials as noted above the complete set of financial statements and management

year sales increased by 13 or 0 3 million for the period ending september 30 2022 compared to the prior period this 13 increase in sales is attributable to an increase in international stevia sales

photo credit ground picture shutterstock understanding the complexities of the u s tax code can be a challenge for any taxpayer to navigate alone but major shifts at the federal level in recent years have made the tax landscape even more uncertain under the trump administration and a republican congress the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 made major changes to the u s tax code the package reduced tax rates for many businesses and individuals and changed a number of deductions and exemptions but many of the provisions in the law are scheduled to expire over the next few years potentially reversing the cuts for many u s households this year with democrats in control of congress and the white house president joe biden signed into law the inflation reduction act the highlights of the package included more than 700 billion in funding for clean energy and health care projects but the bill also proposed raising revenue through a 15 corporate minimum tax and new investments in the irs to collect taxes under the existing code the white house estimates that increased spending on the irs will produce savings of 124 billion over ten years the inflation reduction act s 80 billion of new investment for the irs will end a long period of stagnant spending for the agency annual spending on the irs has fallen by 8 in inflation adjusted dollars over the last 10 years and had been mostly flat for the two decades prior over this period the irs has seen a significant decline in employment in 1992 the irs had a total of 116 673 full time equivalents but by 2021 the ranks of employees had fallen to 78 661 one of the primary areas of added investment under the inflation reduction act for the irs is enforcement funding for tax enforcement over the next decade is slated to grow by nearly 70 from 66 billion to 112 billion much of this additional funding will be used to increase the headcount of irs agents amid the changing tax code and new efforts to step up enforcement accountants and auditors may be in greater demand in the near future businesses high earners and even many regular households may require professional assistance to avoid or address audits and penalties the bureau of labor statistics cites the complex tax and regulatory environment as a factor likely to drive continued demand in the field which is expected to grow by 6 over the next decade high demand in this environment will also be good for accountants earnings the median accountant in the u s earns 77 250 per year but compensation can vary widely by location areas that have many big businesses or high

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and costs associated with the dissolution of the company it is currently the company s expectation that it may be required to continue to comply with public company reporting obligations through the six year indemnification period following the closing of the 2degrees sale during the period in which the company continues to report publicly we will continue to be responsible for maintaining appropriate processes and controls around financial reporting however given the significantly reduced risk profile of the company following the 2degrees sale and nuevatel transaction we have reduced the cost structure of our corporate function with a significant portion of the workforce ceasing employment with the company in september 2022 and the company retaining only a limited number of resources to ensure compliance with ongoing regulatory and audit requirements the company has also negotiated with service providers to ensure a significant reduction in costs going forward it is also the company s expectation that following the escrow release in may 2023 the company will endeavor to further adjust its cost structure commensurate with the risk profile of the company supplementary information condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income condensed consolidated balance sheets condensed consolidated
