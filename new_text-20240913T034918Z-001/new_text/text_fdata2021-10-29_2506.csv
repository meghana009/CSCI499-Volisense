amazon q3 aws growth reaccelerates revenue hits 16 1b there s a general level of recovery across a lot of our customer base amazon chief financial officer brian olsavsky says referring to amazon web services revenue growth rebound amazon web services saw 39 percent growth in its third quarter cloud computing revenue as parent company amazon com missed wall street estimates for top line growth and earnings and gave a disappointing holiday shopping season forecast aws is seeing a general level of recovery across a lot of its customer base according to amazon chief financial officer brian olsavsky aws revenue increased to 16 1 billion for the three month period ended sept 30 up from 11 6 billion in the same period last year under its fastest growth rate since the first quarter of 2019 when revenue jumped 44 percent id unit 1659132512259 type sponsored post the industry s dominant cloud computing provider now has an annualized revenue run rate of 64 44 billion that s up from 59 2 billion based on its second quarter results and 46 4 billion based on its third quarter results in 2020 aws has seen a reacceleration of revenue growth as customers have expanded their commitment to the cloud and selected aws as the cloud partner olsavsky told financial analysts during an earnings call today we feel really good about the acceleration and growth we know there was some suppression last year but the growth last year was still in the 28 percent to 33 percent range through most of the year while many customers accelerated their journeys to the cloud during the pandemic others curtailed their spending olsavsky noted some companies were booming disney zoom netflix he said others that were more travel related were suppressed in their demand the third quarter was the first reporting period with new leadership atop aws and amazon com adam selipsky the former tableau leader and amazon veteran who returned to the company officially became ceo of aws on july 5 five days after the start of the quarter former aws ceo andy jassy also replaced jeff bezos as the ceo of amazon com that day neither of the ceos were on the call aws revenue growth was driven by a broad base of services including machine learning ml according to olsavsky we ve been investing in this area for several years offering an extensive set of machine learning services including ones that can be applied to common business problems like amazon connect for contact center intelligence or amazon kendra for intelligent enterprise search he said we recently launched solutions specific to industries including industrial machine learning services as well as amazon healthlake to help healthcare and life sciences customers seamlessly transform their data across disparate sources to understand and extract meaningful medical information amazon sagemaker continues to help customers scale their use of ml to core workloads making it one of the fastest growing services in aws history with tens of thousands of active external customers using it every month olsalvsky said aws also continues to see strong interest and rapid adoption of its custom silicon and aws designed graviton2 processors which deliver customers up to 40 percent better price performance than current x86 processors according to aws overall amazon com results and outlook amazon com s overall revenue grew to 110 8 billion in the third quarter up 15 2 percent from its 96 14 billion generated in the same period of 2020 but missing analysts consensus revenue estimate of 111 8 billion according to zacks investment research jassy said the coronavirus pandemic that drove shoppers to amazon com for personal protective equipment food and other items came at a cost as the company ramped up its investments to meet demand just one example is that we ve nearly doubled the size of our fulfillment network since the pandemic began jassy said amazon s net income dropped to 3 2 billion or 6 12 in earnings per share eps down from 6 33 billion or 12 37 eps in last year s third quarter analysts had expected eps of 8 71 olsavsky cited numerous challenges that amazon has faced since last february including billions of dollars in additional costs to keep employees safe and support testing and other covid related costs amazon also has increased its global headcount by 628 000 employees in the past 18 months and is recruiting for more including more than 150 000 in the united states to support fourth quarter seasonal demand the demand for labor has recently coincided with the shortage of available workers particularly in the united states which began in q2 but it really started to impact our operations and cost structure in q3 olsavsky said this led to wage increases and sign on incentives as companies compete for workers as well as inconsistent staffing levels in our operations disruption to the global supply chains and inflation in the cost of materials such as steel and services such as trucking also have raised the cost of operations for amazon com it estimates the cost of labor labor related productivity losses and cost inflation added approximately 2 billion in operating costs in the third quarter particularly in august and september amazon guidance for the fourth quarter the all important holiday shopping season for retailers anticipates those costs will approach 4 billion amazon expects fourth quarter revenue of 130 billion to 140 billion which would represent growth of 4 percent to 12 percent from the same three months of 2020 operating income is expected to be between 0 and 3 billion compared with 6 9 billion in last year s fourth quarter the news depressed amazon s stock after closing at 3 446 57 today up 54 08 or 1 59 percent it fell in after hours trading the per share price had dropped to 3 308 50 by 7 15 p m est down 138 07 or 4 01 percent
by james pethokoukis at the start of 2021 wall street was expecting an exceptionally boomy year including the third quarter the results of which were released today even as recently as this summer expectations were running high with a consensus real gdp forecast of around 7 percent annualized instead the economy grew at just 2 0 percent last quarter disappointing even the much reduced consensus forecast of 2 8 percent growth there doesn t seem to be much debate about what happened this explanation from jpmorgan economist michael feroli is typical bold by me this was a little below expectations and a significant step down from the 6 5 pace registered in the first half some slowing from the stimulus boosted growth of earlier in the year seemed inevitable but that slowing was exacerbated by supply chain issues as well as a modest headwind from the delta variant the supply chain woes were evident in the motor vehicle sector which subtracted 1 4 points from the headline gdp number and more generally in the 5 7 growth in gdp prices which meant every dollar spent translated into less real output the lingering pandemic headwind was apparent in real service spending which although it expanded at a 7 9 pace still hasn t even reached the pre pandemic level from 4q19 if you re looking for a silver lining to this report it might be more educational than economic so much of the public policy debate both during the pandemic and before has been about the lack of demand in the economy but what about the economy s supply side right now we are seeing what happens when demand outstrips an economy s productive capacity high inflation shortages and slower business activity all the more reason to think hard about the economy s potential productive capacity over the long run even after these supply chain disruptions work themselves out this from economist jason furman at the peterson institute for international economics should be seen as warning to policymakers as they consider various tax regulatory and investment ideas in addition the pandemic itself may have lowered potential output business investment fell during the pandemic and remains low to the extent that this investment is permanently lost the economy will have less productive capital permanently reducing output the cumulative reduction in business fixed investment over the course of the pandemic totals about 3 percent of the capital stock which would be expected to reduce the level of output per hour by about 1 percent in addition dramatically reduced immigration and some labor force scarring have further lowered potential output some factors could go the other way including the possibility of increased productivity and the possibility that output was below potential just prior to the pandemic again i hope all these advances we re seeing lately in biology energy and space translate into higher productivity growth but washington should assume the worst and pursue better policy that deeply considers innovation impacts has a big role to play going forward in the area of taxation for instance i urge you to check out my recent podcast chat with aei scholar kyle pomerleau

sure how they feelabout this others are waiting eagerly for a chance to protect their children from covid 19 but federal agencies can t be rushed here s what has to happen before the pfizer biontech shots can start going into kids arms loading currently pfizer is the furthest along in this process but moderna has shared some promising results from its vaccine trial with this age group and johnson johnson is expected to begin vaccine trials for young kids in the future as well here are more details on what the regulatory process entails and how it is going for the pfizer vaccine step 1 drugmakers complete the clinical trial pfizer and biontech have completed a three phase clinical trial in children 5 to 11 years old the companies submitted all of the data from that trial and an application for emergency use authorization to the food and drug administration on oct 7 the main study included 2 250 kids and found that the lower dose version of the vaccine was 90 7 effective in preventing symptomatic covid 19 it was given as a series of two shots 21 days apart and the dose was 10 micrograms a third of the dose given to adults and teenagers no serious side effects such as heart inflammation were reported although with only a few thousand children included in the research that sort of rare problem wouldn t necessarily be detected step 2 independent scientists review the data this week on oct 26 a panel of outside scientists considered pfizer s safety and efficacy data along with an analysis from fda scientists on the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different pandemic scenarios after some lively discussion the group overwhelmingly voted yes that the benefits of the pfizer vaccine outweigh the risks for use in this age group step 3 fda officials weigh in next the fda the agency itself considered the advisers vote on pfizer s smaller dose shot for kids on friday fda officials decided to extend the emergency use authorization for pfizer s covid 19 vaccine to younger kids acting commissioner dr janet woodcock assured parents in a statement that the agency had rigorously evaluated the data and this vaccine meets our high standards step 4 more

disease control and prevention you can think of it like this when it comes to vaccines the fda is in charge of the what and the cdc is in charge of the who the cdc s advisory group met tuesday and voted to recommend the vaccine for all children in the 5 11 age group dr amanda cohn served until recently as the executive secretary for the cdc s vaccine advisory group and she s a voting member of the fda s vaccine advisory group explained the difference between the two federal advisory groups that weigh in on these kinds of decisions the fda decides whether a vaccine or other product is safe and effective she explained at the fda advisory meeting this week the cdc s group then considers and votes on who would benefit from the vaccine and who should get vaccinated their deliberations include factors such as equity feasibility and the potential impact of recommendations on a population she said when they vote the cdc s advisers could follow the fda s lead in their recommendations or they could make more focused or nuanced recommendations cohn said for instance they could have recommended it for a certain subgroup like children with underlying conditions or those who haven t had a prior coronavirus infection step 5 cdc director makes final recommendation even then a vote from the cdc s advisers isn t an official recommendation that comes from the cdc s director dr rochelle walensky on tuesday night she greenlit the advisers recommendation if she had chosen to she could have changed the recommendation from what the committee voted on as she did with boosters but she followed their lead and recommended them to all kids aged 5 11 only after the cdc director issues an official recommendation can shots get distributed to pediatricians and pharmacies around the country step 6 the shots get distributed to providers and pharmacies experts have been reassuring the public that the rollout of this new lower dose vaccine won t be a repeat of the disarray of the

stupid and insane some billionaires vent over tax plan file in this march 14 2019 file photo tesla ceo elon musk speaks before unveiling the model y at the company s design studio in hawthorne calif tesla says it will relocate its headquarters from palo alto calif to austin texas though the electric car maker will keep expanding its manufacturing capacity in the golden state musk gave no timeline for the move late thursday oct 7 2021 when he addressed the company s shareholders at tesla s annual meeting ap photo jae c hong file elon musk isn t happy with a personal fortune that is flirting with 300 billion the tesla ceo the richest person on earth has been attacking a democratic proposal to tax the assets of billionaires like him the idea behind the democratic plan is to use revenue from a billionaires tax to help pay for a domestic policy package being negotiated in congress that would among other things help combat climate change provide universal prekindergarten and expand health care programs the proposal wasn t included in president joe biden s framework for the domestic policy package released thursday though that deal among congressional democrats isn t final musk who recently blew past amazon founder jeff bezos as the world no 1 in wealth thanks to tesla s soaring share price would be liable for perhaps a one time 50 billion tax hit under the democratic proposal forget it he says my plan the spacex founder tweeted thursday about his fortune is to use the money to get humanity to mars and preserve the light of consciousness he may well get his wish with the proposal removed from the white house framework earlier this week musk argued the fundamental problem is that government spends too much money and he warned that the billionaire tax proposal could lead over time to tax hikes for more americans eventually he tweeted monday they run out of other people s money and then they come for you the democratic proposal unveiled wednesday by sen ron wyden would tax the gains of people with either 1 billion or more in assets or three consecutive years of income of 100 million or more at the capital gains tax rate of 20 and the 3 8 net investment income tax rate it would apply to fewer than an estimated 800 people who would have to pay tax on the value of tradable items like stocks even if they don t sell them under current law such assets are subject to tax only when they re sold supporters have said the tax could raise 200 billion over 10 years that could help fund biden s legislative priorities republicans are unified in opposition to the proposal and some have suggested it would be challenged in court the democrats proposal came against the backdrop of growing concerns about vast economic inequality with the wealth of many american multi billionaires having accelerated during the covid 19 pandemic thanks to increased stock and home equity even more than before the virus struck john catsimatidis the billionaire grocery chain and real estate magnate who owns gristedes condemned the proposal as something you would expect putin to do referring to president vladimir putin of russia the billionaire tax plan catsimatidis told the associated press is a little bit insane the american people have reached the point where they re saying enough is enough said catsimatidis who lost a bid for the republican nomination for new york city mayor in 2013 stop spending the money stupidly they come up with budgets that are stupid budgets and they want to make everybody else suffer for it do we need infrastructure catsimatidis added sure we need infrastructure do we need bridges to nowhere no we don t need those you re talking about the people that create the jobs he said of billionaires we can get up and go somewhere else leon cooperman the outspoken billionaire investor who has long denounced sen elizabeth warren s own proposal for a wealth tax has added his voice to the exasperation coming from some of the uber wealthy in an interview with the daily beast cooperman said of the tax i doubt it s legal and it s stupid what made america great he said was the people who started with nothing like me making a lot of money and giving it back a relentless attack on wealthy people makes no sense not every billionaire shares such outrage a spokesperson for george soros the investor and liberal philanthropist told the ap that soros is supportive of the proposed billionaires tax and while warren buffett has yet to comment publicly on the proposal the billionaire head of berkshire hathaway has long called for higher taxes on the ultra wealthy like himself bob lord a tax lawyer and associate fellow at the progressive think tank institute for policy studies said that even if this particular proposal doesn t pass it does reflect how concerns about financial inequality are gathering momentum propublica reported in june that some of the richest americans have paid no income tax or nearly none in some years including musk who the report said paid zero income taxes in 2018 critics argue that musk s criticism of the billionaire tax proposal overlooks the fact that tesla s rise has been aided by government incentives and loans lord noted for example that the run up in tesla stock monday after a major order of teslas from hertz increased musk s wealth by roughly 37 billion more than what the irs collects in estate and gift tax revenue from the entire country in one year wyden s proposal lord suggested might need to close some loopholes but i think they ve done a pretty good job with it he said there are folks out there who are saying the billionaires will just put their money into non publicly traded assets but it s not going to be that easy it s a pretty well crafted bill such tax changes could also shift how billionaire philanthropists make donations brian mittendorf a professor of accounting at ohio state university said he believes that in the short term the billionaire proposal would lead some of the uber wealthy to rush philanthropic contributions into so called donor advised funds such funds would allow them to receive tax deductions up front without distributing any of the money donors can t get the money back from these funds if in fact this were to pass mittendorf said it creates huge incentives to donate some of these assets that have gone up in value before the tax

andy beck our chief financial officer and with that eric please go ahead eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer thank you greg and good morning we appreciate everyone joining us on the call today our third quarter results were highlighted by sales growth and earnings improvement against the backdrop of a very challenging supply chain environment we continue to experience significant component shortages that are impacting our production volumes these supply chain disruptions have intensified in recent weeks and we have reduced our fourth quarter revenue and earnings to reflect our revised production plans in addition material and freight cost inflation is increasing requiring additional pricing to offset its impact the encouraging news is that despite the global supply chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures farmer economics are very very healthy and global end market demand remains strong i would like to strongly recognize and appreciate the entire global agco team for their tireless and dedicated work to mitigate these challenging conditions serve our customers and maximize our full year results which will feature strong margin and earnings improvement let s start on slide three where you can see that net sales grew 9 compared to the third quarter of 2020 adjusted operating income increased nearly 13 while margins improved about 30 basis points our investments in smart farming precision ag and digital solutions are paying off as we are seeing excellent demand for technology rich vent tractors our precision planting solutions and replacement parts agco s precision ag sales are up over 33 so far this year with strong growth for both our precision planting business as well as our fuse suite of products our healthy balance sheet supports our technology related investments as well as cash returns to our shareholders slide four details industry unit retail sales by region for the first nine months of 2021 the financial health of our farmer customers remains strong global crop production in 2021 looks to be very good and agriculture commodity prices continue to support favorable farm income resulting in increased demand for machinery these improved conditions are expected to generate industry growth across all the major equipment markets in 2021 in north america industry retail tractor sales increased about 17 in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 with industry retail sales of large ag equipment growing by approximately 28 raw crop farmers are taking advantage of improved commodity prices and projected healthy income levels to upgrade their equipment industry retail sales in western europe also increased in the first nine months of 2021 versus supply constrained levels a year ago with growth across all major markets higher wheat dairy and livestock prices combined with healthy levels of crop production are generating positive farmer economics and farmer sentiment in the region in south america industry sales increased strongly during the first nine months of 2021 driven by improved demand in brazil as well as recovery in the smaller export markets healthy crop production as well as favorable exchange rates are supporting positive economic conditions for farmers who continue to replace an aged fleet agco s 2021 factory production hours are shown on slide five as i mentioned agco continues to face unprecedented supply chain and logistics challenges as well as material and freight cost inflation supply chain constraints have intensified in the recent weeks limiting our ability to increase our production to match the strong end market demand the scarcity of parts has impacted the company s ability to produce and ship units and contributed to labor inefficiencies as well as higher than anticipated raw material and work in process inventory levels while we expect to reduce our inventories before the end of the year from our current situation the volatile supply chain environment is requiring us to carry more inventory total company production was up approximately 14 for the third quarter versus a very high rate of production in the third quarter of 2020 the largest increases were seen in our north and south american factories overall we are projecting a 20 to 25 increase in full year 2021 production compared to last year you ll remember that production ramped up significantly in the back half of 2020 so our growth in the second half of 2021 will not be as large as what we ve experienced in the first half of this year turning our attention to agco s order board as of the end of september our order board for tractors and combines was significantly higher in north america europe and south america compared to a year ago i will now hand over the call to andy beck who will provide you more information about our third quarter results andrew h beck senior vice president chief financial officer thanks eric and good morning to everyone i ll start on slide six which looks at agco s regional net sales performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 agco s net sales were up about 8 compared to an extremely strong third quarter of 2020 excluding the positive impacts of currency translation robust end market demand particularly in south america as well as favorable pricing drove the increase the europe middle east segment reported an increase in net sales of approximately 3 excluding the impact of currency translation compared to the high level of sales in the third quarter of the prior year which benefited from the catch up of deliveries of equipment following the factory shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020 largest increases occurred in italy turkey and the u k which offset lower sales in germany and france net sales in north america increased approximately 9 excluding favorable impact of currency translation compared to the levels experienced in the third quarter of 2020 increased sales of precision planting products and mid size tractors produced most of the increase agco s third quarter net sales in south america grew 37 compared to the third quarter of 2020 excluding currency impacts sales were up strongly across all of the south american markets high horsepower and midsized tractors and grain and protein equipment showed the most increases net sales in our asia pacific africa segment decreased about 2 compared to the level of sales in the third quarter of 2020 on a constant currency basis lower sales in china and australia were nearly offset by improved sales in africa consolidated replacement part sales were approximately 443 million for the third quarter of 2020 and compared to 391 million for the third quarter of 2020 on slide seven we examine agco s sales and margin performance agco s adjusted operating margins improved approximately 30 basis points in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 margins were supported primarily by higher levels of net sales and production our third quarter pricing increase price increase of approximately 6 was able to offset the significant material and freight cost inflation that eric discussed for the remainder of the year we expect material cost inflation to accelerate and for net pricing to be approximately breakeven the europe middle east segment reported an increase of approximately 5 million in operating income compared to the third quarter of 2020 resulting primarily from higher net sales and production partially offset by higher engineering expenses north america operating income decreased approximately 23 million as increased pressure from material inflation resulted in lower gross margins particularly in the steel intensive grain storage business a weaker sales mix also contributed to the lower operating income operating margins in our south america region reached 11 6 in the third quarter and operating income improved nearly 28 million from the same period in 2020 significant increases in end market demand and a healthy sales mix supported the growth in our asia pacific segment operating margins expanded to 11 9 in the third quarter reflecting an improved sales mix slide eight details grain and protein sales by region and product sales increased by about 20 in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020 globally grain equipment sales increased approximately 24 with our south america and european regions showing the largest increases protein production sales grew approximately 16 in 2021 with the strongest growth in the asia pacific africa and south american regions grain equipment demand has been stronger supported by improved grain prices and profitability of farms however demand has been muted by significant price increases by manufacturers to cover surging steel costs the protein production equipment market remains challenged due to labor issues and higher input costs such as grain protein prices are improved so profitability is recovering we re expecting a recovery in the grain and protein sales in 2021 for the full year following weak sales in 2020 which were heavily impacted by the pandemic slide nine addresses agco s free cash flow for the first nine months of 2020 and 21 which represented cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures additional working capital requirements this year related to higher inventory levels resulted in lower free cash flow for the first nine months of 2021 versus the same period last year we expect our year end raw material and work in process inventory to remain elevated to help us manage through the difficult supply chain environment we have adjusted our full year free cash flow forecast to reflect an additional 200 million of working capital requirements due to increased inventory levels agco s capital allocation priorities include investments in our precision ag offerings and digital capabilities as well as opportunistically adding bolt on acquisitions we will continue to return cash to shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend payments share repurchases and annual variable special dividends in the third quarter we repurchased approximately 75 million in shares future returns of cash to shareholders will be based on cash flow generation our investment needs which includes capital expenditures and acquisition opportunities as well as our market outlook other details for the quarter included losses on sales and receivables associated with our receivable financing facilities which are included in other expense net were approximately 7 4 million for the quarter compared to 6 1 million in the same period last year turning to our full year forecast our 2021 outlook for the three major regional markets is captured on slide 10 we maintain our market forecast for all regions as we believe production constraints will limit further retail demand upside in north america higher commodity prices and improved farmer sentiment is expected to result in increased 2021 sales replacement demand for aged fleets of larger equipment is expected to drive most of the increase demand for smaller equipment is expected to be more stable after several years of increasing demand we project north american industry unit tractor sales to be up approximately 20 in 2021 compared to 2020 european union farm economics have remained supportive in 2021 higher commodity prices are expected to support healthy demand from the arable farming segment milk prices remain above the 10 year average and economics were positive are also positive for dairy producers western europe industry demand is expected to remain strong and grow approximately 10 in 2021 elevated commodity prices and favorable exchange rates are expected to support additional growth in south america during 2021 as farmers continue to replace aged equipment in total industry demand in south america is expected to improve about 15 from 2020 levels slide 11 highlights the assumptions underlying our 2021 outlook our priorities continue to be maintaining a safe working environment for our employees and providing proactive support to our customers and our dealers in addition to focusing on meeting the robust end market demand we also make significant investments in development of new solutions to support our farmer first strategy agco s results are expected to be heavily influenced by supply chain performance for the balance of the year our outlook is based on current estimates of component deliveries agco s results will be impacted if the actual supply chain delivery performance differs from these estimates our sales plan includes price increases of approximately 5 5 aimed at offsetting higher material cost inflation during 2021 at current exchange rates we expect currency translation to positively impact sales by approximately 2 engineering expenses are expected to increase by 50 million to 60 million on a constant currency basis compared to 2020 the increase is targeted at investments in smart farming and precision ag products as well as to continue our rollout of our platform designs operating margins are expected to be up 150 basis points from 2020 levels driven by higher sales and production favorable pricing net of material costs and productivity actions partially offset by increased investments in smart products and our digital initiatives we are targeting an effective tax rate ranging from 27 to 29 for 2021 slide 12 lists our view of selected 2021 financial goals the ability of our company s supply chain to deliver parts and components on schedule is currently difficult to predict the following outlook is based on agco s current estimates of component deliveries our results will be impacted if the actual supply chain delivery performance differs from these estimates we are projecting sales to be in the 10 9 billion to 11 1 billion range with 2021 earnings per share targeted in a range of 8 75 to 9 a share we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 300 million and free cash flow to be in the 200 million to 300 million range with that i ll turn the call back over to greg greg peterson vice president of investor relations thanks andy shelby why don t you get us started questions and answers operator your first question is from joel tiss of bmo joel tiss bmo analyst wow i never get to be first i just wondered it seems like the supply chain issues or the deliveries from your suppliers have been kind of more week to week you have a good week and get a lot of stuff and the next week maybe won t be so good and it seems like you feel a little more strongly with your change guidance that it s going to get lumpier or it s going to get a little bit less reliable can you give us a little bit of insight into what you guys are seeing what s changed thank you eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer that s a good read on it first of all thanks for the question it s at the heart of today s topic it s really that s really the situation a quarter or two ago we expected that by this time the supply chain would be healthier than we are seeing it actually to be and so it s over that time the overall supply chain has gotten very lean essentially hand to mouth so any disruption now is causing problems and we have seen an increased rate of issues over the last few weeks where a lot of them are semiconductor chip related but not only those things there s still issues with tires plastics freight and other things it s the same issue hearing this is not unique to our company it s not unique to our industry it s hitting all industries it s the same thing we re hearing inside the company as you re reading in all the news journals outside the company so yes it is more severe than we would have predicted a while ago it s fairly broad based and that s why we took the actions we did in terms of guidance joel tiss bmo analyst okay and if i m allowed a quick follow up i just wanted to ask andy with only two months left in the year how come we have such a wide range on the tax rate and then i ll go away thank you andrew h beck senior vice president chief financial officer well the tax rate really is driven by profitability and so given the range of profitability that we re talking about we re sticking with that wide of a range so i think we ll be able to get within that but that s typically why we give such a wide range operator your next question is from stephen volkmann of jefferies stephen volkmann jefferies analyst great hi guys i m curious i guess sort of in the third quarter do you have equipment that s sort of parked and waiting for parts but pretty much ready to go that can ship as we move forward eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer yes we have actually thousands of machines that have been built and waiting for 1 two components and then ready to invoice to farmers the big picture here we have a tremendous order bank we have six to nine months of orders on average in some cases much more than that in some cases we re sold out for next year we have very strong market demand we have strong pricing power in the marketplace to handle the inflation situation that we have been under and we forecast to be under it s really about the supply chain bottlenecks that we re dealing with and we feel they re particularly acute rate now and we anticipate that those will ease over time it s just an unpredictable environment we re in at the moment stephen volkmann jefferies analyst okay great and that was a perfect setup actually eric because with so much backlog into 2022 what should we be thinking about in terms of the price impact in 22 you probably have pretty good visibility there eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer yes steve we re still obviously making estimates of what we think pricing will require next year first of all to cover the inflationary costs and the carryover of the inflation that we re experiencing right now along with the what the market demand is going to be what pricing can we achieve this year we as you see in our comments that we re expecting pricing to be about 5 5 i would see pricing next year to be at least in that range as well operator your next question is from courtney yakavonis of morgan stanley courtney yakavonis morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys just wondering if you can just comment a little bit on how the supply chain issues are comparing globally you re calling these out i mean you beat most of our margin assumptions for the rest of the world aside from north america so is this a north america isolated issue or is that just more reflective of gsi what we re seeing in margins there just any comment on how it s impacting your production globally eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think there s actually a couple of questions embedded in your question so i m going to peel those apart a little bit one is supply chain disruptions in terms of material flow is not a north america topic it s hitting us in all regions perhaps more most acutely in europe but it s a challenge all over especially because we have a global supply base so a supplier may be located in one region but supporting factories in multiple regions so disruption in terms of flow is global then the second point in your question was about gsi the second issue is component pricing and because gsi uses so much steel that s why andy called it out as they are getting hit by the inflationary impact of steel which is up between 15 and 150 depending on where it is and that s why margins are challenged within gsi this year courtney yakavonis morgan stanley analyst okay great that s helpful and then maybe just on south america you guys got double digit margins there this quarter can you help us just think about what s the right longer term margin for that end market since i think we had historically thought of it as a mid to high single digit margin performer andrew h beck senior vice president chief financial officer sure yes we obviously had a very strong third quarter result we had margins up because of a stronger mix our grain and protein business as we called out had a really strong quarter with good margins so there was a number of positive things that went on in the quarter we also still haven t really seen the biggest wave of the cost increases hit our results yet that s coming and we expect that to be part of what happens in the fourth quarter where that high inflationary cost will hit the south america results a little more so for the full year we re looking at our margins in south america to be between in about the mid 7s percent and so i think that s a good target for us for the future what we ve said before is that we don t see south america needing to we think it should be within the corporate average of our margin so we would expect to drive margin improvement going forward like we expect in the rest of our business operator your next question is from kristen owen of oppenheimer kristen owen oppenheimer analyst great thank you good morning i wanted to follow up on the gsi commentary there s obviously some strong seasonality to that business in the third quarter but can you just parse out or put a finer point on the profitability impact on the quarter and talk about just where the backlog stands in that business today eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer yes our you re right the gsi business is typically strongest in the second and third quarters of the year so we re we had sales increases as we talked about sales were up nine or so percent in the third quarter up close to 20 for the year to date we would expect the sale to be up probably 15 to 20 for the full year our margins are going to be either in line or slightly below last year all because of what eric discussed in terms of the surging steel prices and we ve had some of those orders that we fulfilled this year were locked in and we couldn t raise the price and so we have somewhat of a mismatch between the timing of these cost increases hitting us and the pricing and so we think the third quarter is kind of the worst that we ll have on that and they ll start to be better in the fourth quarter and as we move into 2022 kristen owen oppenheimer analyst great thank you for that and as my follow up if i could just summarize the change in guidance is really about change in timing of deliveries not demand destruction you talked about the favorable farm income backdrop but we ve certainly seen some of the impacts of higher input costs on farm sentiment so can you help us square the circle there and talk to us about what you re hearing from your dealers and any potential for mix shift or precision application uptake thank you eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer okay there s a couple of questions embedded in there too so let me address them separately the first one was about demand absolutely i want to underline we have extremely strong farmer sentiment leading to extremely strong demand which has provided a huge order bank the highest in the company s history so this is the demand is absolutely strong in addition to that demand we ve got strong pricing power we have had and we expect for it to continue the demand in the marketplace is strong and is able to they understand the situation we anticipate that s going to continue forward we watch our order rate and it has not slowed down a bit yet so that s explaining the demand side the guidance is all about our ability in the short term to build all the orders and we re building them as fast as we can but that s the situation then you also asked about precision ag laying on top of the general strong market is a real success story around agco s precision ag business the general business is up 24 but inside of that is a precision ag business that s up 33 our smart planter rows are up 42 our ideal combines are up 80 and we ve been you ve seen us announce the acquisition of a couple of precision ag companies one in the protein segment and one in the harvesting business this is an area we continue to invest in and we re seeing successes from those investments in the eyes of our farmers they like the technology they see a real profit benefit to their operation so i hope i touched on all the answer to your question operator your next question is from larry de maria of william blair larry de maria william blair analyst okay thanks good morning everybody i guess you noted there s price increases coming and you hope to have i think a similar level next year but you already have half the year booked and you re sold out for some stuff as you noted so all else being equal can we still expect pretty decent margin expansion next year or is backlog not priced for today s material costs and we have to have further actions on the backlog to catch up maybe in the second half thank you eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer yes larry that s a very natural questions and let me explain how we re thinking about it first of all we have two different kinds of orders one is a retail order that s got a farmer name on it and the other kind of order is a dealer stock order that they would buy a machine to put it on their lot to be sold later on we are treating those two different orders differently the dealer stock orders or a wholesale order we are not price protecting and we are taking them in but not confirming them meaning we have some flexibility on timing and on pricing conditions in some situations we may also apply surcharges on things like freight and other things to the order bank those are some of the elements but they re in addition to just the general order bank as we monitor we constantly monitor the pricing in the order bank compared to the expected inflation in the order bank and we feel that we re staying ahead of cost with the pricing that s in the order bank that we have today while retaining some of the flexibility to the tools i ve talked about and maybe last comment in south america where the inflation rate is the highest costs are moving faster there we only open up orders about one quarter at a time so we re now ordering opening up quarter one to receive orders and then we ll fill up that order slot so that we don t get too far out in front of the headlights in the most volatile market larry de maria william blair analyst okay thanks very much and if i could ask a follow up you called out market share gains which you can do every quarter but are there any specific areas where a material full year improvements i mean ideal it s up 80 but whether that s material to the overall industry market share is unclear and does the deer strike have any impact on how you re thinking about going after customers and i ll leave it there thanks eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think where we re gaining market share is likely more in north america right now especially in large ag and then let me see what was the second greg peterson vice president of investor relations precision planting eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer and precision planting is certainly growing our precision ag business in north america is where we re having our largest success and then there s a second half of his question andrew h beck senior vice president chief financial officer deer strike thank you yes i ll leave that to for them to comment on i ll just say a couple of brief discussion is that at this point it s only been a strike for a few days the last one i think that they had was back in 1986 that one lasted 163 days but that was in a very different market condition if it lasts a short amount of time then i don t think there ll be a material impact if it lasts a long time then there certainly would be but i ll leave that to them to comment on operator your next question is from nicole deblase of deutsche bank nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst maybe first just starting off with what you re seeing from a pricing perspective relative to costs i think you guys mentioned that you were still price cost positive in the third quarter if you could confirm that and is the expectation that in 4q you ll be price positive and if you think about the carryforward of both inflation and pricing into 2022 is that also the case andrew h beck senior vice president chief financial officer yes so in terms of this third quarter we were slightly positive and in the fourth quarter i think will be it will be fairly neutral what that does is result in a little bit of a margin deterioration when it s that tight so we typically want to see a wider range there but right now what s happening is because of some of these orders that we price protected and locked in we can t get the same amount of pricing as what we re seeing in terms of cost increases so that is affecting our margins here in the third and fourth quarter a little bit but overall in terms of dollar coverage pricing over cost will be fairly neutral in the fourth quarter and as eric mentioned we ve got some levers that we can pull going forward into next year to get more pricing even within the current order board there is a big carryover of pricing and cost and we would expect we ve got a lot of work to do to finalize our plans for next year but our intention is to make sure that that pricing is covering all the costs nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst okay got it thanks andy and then you respond to courtney s question on the outlook for south america margins for the year can you also give us a sense of what you re thinking within the context of the full year guidance for north america and for europe eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer yes so nicole for north america we re looking at margins in the 6 to 7 range for the full year so that implies a nice i m sorry closer to we re looking at 10 roughly for north america which implies a nice step up in the fourth quarter closer to 7 or 8 and for europe we re looking somewhere between 11 5 and 12 for the full year which takes into account some headwinds in the fourth quarter because of higher engineering expense and some of that material inflation that andy talked about our asia pacific margins look to be in the kind of low to mid 10s for the full year which is about 150 basis points of improvement and that also implies some cost headwinds in the fourth quarter operator your next question is from jamie cook of credit suisse colton zimmer credit suisse analyst hi good morning this is colton zimmer on for jamie thank you for taking our question we were wondering if you could just give an update on some of the strategic initiatives you laid out at the analyst day so where is market share for the fence product line how has that kind of trended relative to your expectations and then also if you could just comment on the order book for some of the higher margin products that you outlined at the analyst day thank you eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer we re really pleased with how the strategy is being implemented we all the initiatives that we talked about at the analyst day are on track we highlighted some of our growth businesses those are all growing nicely we re continuing the trend we had from 2020 where north america large ag event growth service parts and precision planting are all growth engines and we intend to continue to invest to make them grow sustainably and then we ve got some improvement businesses south america massey ferguson and you re seeing the results there 3 four years ago we were losing money in south america and now the questions about today are are we going to be above 10 certainly all our business our target for all of our business is to be above 10 in the midterm so we re very happy with how the strategy is coming together and we feel like both growth businesses and improvement businesses are on track colton zimmer credit suisse analyst alright thank you operator your next question is from ross gilardi of bank of america ross gilardi bank of america analyst good morning guys andrew h beck senior vice president chief financial officer good morning ross ross gilardi bank of america analyst i think your new guide implies that margins are down year on year in the fourth quarter and just how many quarters of year on year margin compression did you anticipate the way it stands now does it feel like your margins will be down in the first half of 22 andrew h beck senior vice president chief financial officer well we ve got a little margin as you point out plan for q4 we don t have any real guidance yet to give you on 2022 i think it s going to be an assessment based on how strong the demand is and eric s already kind of covered that and then what our supply chain capabilities are and so we re still working through that again our long term ambition is to grow margins grow these strong margin products and that will be a goal for next year as well ross gilardi bank of america analyst andy do you think you need to see real improvement in supply chain to have margins up in the first half of next year or is it really more of like just a timing issue with incremental pricing and so forth andrew h beck senior vice president chief financial officer yes yes it s there s a growth opportunity if we can get the supply chain ramped up because we do have such a strong order board and then the other factor as you mentioned is whereas how much of this cost wave that s coming how does that match up with the pricing that we can implement and so those are the key things that we ll be looking at to try to be able to answer your question i can t really answer it today but our intention obviously again is get that pricing in get it robust enough to cover these costs and to get margin improvement operator your next question is from jerry revich of goldman sachs ashok sivamohan goldman sachs analyst hi this is ashok sivamohan on for jerry revich i understand you re not providing guidance on year over year margin trends but i m wondering if you have any thoughts on the margin cadence versus normal seasonality do you think we can expect normal seasonality next year in terms of the quarterly margin cadence andrew h beck senior vice president chief financial officer well i think there s nothing unusual to happen here in 2021 like 20 where we had these product big long disruptions in the production that caused 20 to be kind of an unusual year 21 is more normal seasonality but again there are these supply chain constraints and so that will be kind of the part that we really continue to need to factor in and to understand what is our production going to be what how much product are we able to ship each quarter and so we ll be we re looking at that right now obviously focus near term on what we can achieve this quarter but we re also working on plans to try to improve the situation going forward as well ashok sivamohan goldman sachs analyst okay and you mentioned the thousands of machines waiting on one or two components i m wondering if you re able to quantify the margin impact based on these manufacturing inefficiencies andrew h beck senior vice president chief financial officer well we re i really can t i mean there have been inefficiencies in our production because again as you just pointed out you run the equipment down the line and then you have to go touch it again and put new components on and so that takes an extra amount of cost and labor to be able to achieve that and we re seeing that and we expect some of that in the we ve seen it in the third quarter and we expect to have some of that in the fourth quarter as well so we re certainly not running as efficiently as normally we would and this environment is causing us to be much more inefficient than normal it s not the highlight of the quarter or anything like that it s not causing huge amounts of additional costs but it is adding up eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer and everybody in our industry is facing the same thing we ve been in the situation ever since covid hit everybody has been challenged with that and we ll be in it for a while yet until the supply chain smooths out operator your next question is from adam uhlman of cleveland research adam uhlman cleveland research analyst hey guys good morning i wanted to ask about demand trends in europe we ve seen fertilizer costs spike over there and frankly here in north america as well i m wondering how you re thinking about that and how that might impact equipment demand at all eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer yes so fertilizer is tied to energy and energy prices especially in europe energy prices have gone up everywhere but in europe most acutely and so that s why you re hearing a lot of talk especially from our european farmers about that challenge but even in north america people are farmers are to some extent hoarding or pulling ahead seed and fertilizer purchases because of their concern of both pricing and availability so that may cool things off a little bit which in the end may be a good thing it could make this demand cycle less spiky and spread it out over a longer time frame but it s so unpredictable at this stage it s hard to give you an exact shape of what s going to happen we think that it s a real pressure on farmers and it may slightly cool their demand and spread it out over a longer period adam uhlman cleveland research analyst okay got you and then just a clarification i think it was mentioned that retail sales were lower in germany and france this quarter i assume it s these delayed shipments but maybe something else is going on there could you share what you re seeing in the industry stats eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer sure keep in mind you have to first go back and remember what last year was like in the third quarter so we had those production shutdowns in the second quarter and then we were up in the third and we actually had our normal shutdown periods in the third quarter we were producing last year so for that reason it was kind of a catch up period so the market was delivering a lot of product last year this year we re kind of on a normal shutdown period we do have the supply chain issues and so that did affect the overall market so in france and the u k both markets france was up slightly for the industry germany was down and so that affects us because those are two different markets for us but i think it was more timing of shipments more than overall kind of inherent demand operator your final question is from chad dillard of bernstein chad dillard bernstein analyst hi good morning guys i actually just wanted to follow up on production shutdowns and just wanted to understand whether in the fourth quarter in your guidance if any are baked in outside of the typical holiday shutdowns if so how much and maybe if you can just talk about what if any impacts there is from an absorption perspective eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer yes so we re really not cutting production too much because of these supply disruptions as we mentioned we want to still utilize as much of the production capabilities we have so we re going to run equipment down the line if possible and wait for those final components so there s probably some assembly hours we ve taken out but a lot of the fabrication and other aspects are still planned to be done in the fourth quarter so that s one of the reasons why our inventory is up in the fourth quarter from what we said before so there is some impact to our production levels but not a significant amount it s just more timing of when we can get the units shipped chad dillard bernstein analyst got it okay and then maybe if you can give us some early thoughts on just how you re thinking about the farm economics equipment demand based on what you re hearing from dealers in north america and south america for 22 eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer yes i mean so farmer sentiment is still very strong when you take a look at commodity prices they aren t at their peak level that they were at spring but when you look at them relative to the last several years they re still extremely strong in all cases and that s projected to stay strong for quite some time the carryover inventories are in a position where it s somewhat predictable what those commodity prices will be so farmers and then you combine that with the fact that we re still exiting a period of pent up demand where the farmers had restricted the amount they bought for the last several years and so they re wanting to refresh their fleet as soon as they were able to afford it and they re able to afford it right now so you ve got that situation combined with the fact that dealer inventories are lower now than they were for the last several years and in some cases lower than we ve ever had them so you ve got a farmer interest and demand situation you ve got a thin pipeline between us and the farmers and then a commodity grain situation that makes it somewhat sustainable having said all that we re in an unpredictable uncertain time period in terms of what happens week to week month to month how it all plays out exactly is hard to predict because of the supply situation so that s the main summary of where we stand right now operator there are no other questions in queue i d like to turn it back to greg peterson for any closing remarks eric p hansotia chairman president and chief executive officer i ll go ahead and just wrap up and then turn it over to greg i appreciate all of the questions today we are very happy with the three quarters of performance for the year we you saw we ve turned in a strong quarter three and we re sitting on top of a very strong order bank strong pricing power we re arm and arm with our dealers managing through this situation with our farmers to keep farmers farming and we have a strong market in front of us with very lean inventories in the pipeline in the marketplace we re managing through the supply chain this is a situation not specific to agco not specific to the ag industry it s hitting all sectors what you re what we re hearing inside the company is the same thing you re reading about across all the industrials and because of that it s getting a lot of attention from governments from private industry and so on to solve these problems solve these bottlenecks and get more capacity flowing more efficiently that s why we have confidence and expectation that this will get solved and we will be able to get the product to our customers demanding to them the challenge is just predicting with the amount of uncertainty exactly how that will play out and so that s why we ve signaled our guidance for the quarter but big picture we ve got a very strong situation for the company overall thanks for your investments in the past and your questions for today i ll turn it over to greg greg peterson vice president of investor relations thanks thank you eric and we appreciate you all s participation today and encourage you to follow up with us later if you have remaining questions thank you operator duration 52 minutes call participants greg peterson vice

life insurance is a staple for american households with approximately 54 of adults in the us holding life insurance policies life insurance is a contract between you and the contractor that guarantees your family s financial security should you die unexpectedly it s important to put a lot of thought into the life insurance policy you choose that s because this insurance policy is what will determine your loved ones future after you pass on the first step in choosing the right life insurance policy is knowing the different types of life insurance available today s post is a comprehensive guide on what types of life insurance policies exist for your consideration this should help you make a more informed decision the next time you re looking for life insurance let s jump straight into it what are the different categories of life insurance before delving into the types of life insurance policies let s first look at the categories of this insurance policy all types of life insurance break down into four major categories and they are term life insurance this is the most common and popular kind of life insurance it also has the simplest terms compared to other policies a term life insurance policy pays your beneficiaries a fixed amount of money should you die however a term life insurance policy only covers you for a specific period if you die after this period your beneficiaries don t get a cent that s right no death equals no compensation even if you paid a bundle in premium costs with term life insurance you re essentially paying the insurance company to protect your beneficiaries in case of your untimely death life insurance terms can be 10 15 20 30 years or sometimes more you ll pay the insurance company a premium for the specific term and your family receives a death benefit should you die within that period permanent life insurance permanent life insurance is the other category of life insurance policies unlike term life insurance you ll have to pay premiums for the rest of your life the insurer will enforce the policy until your death or until you stop paying your premiums permanent life insurance is more expensive than term life insurance your premium amount doesn t change for the entire policy s term your beneficiaries also get a fixed death benefit should you pass on also permanent life insurance policies have a cash value this means that part of your premium acts as a tax deferred investment and accrues with interest into a bulk payment that your beneficiaries receive when people die level term insurance policies like term life insurance policies a level term policy covers your beneficiaries for a specific time however the premiums and benefit amount are the same with level term insurance policies even if you pass away this is ideal for long term agreements because while the premium remains the same the coverage increases it s worth noting that premium rates with term life insurance policies increase as they age however level term insurance policies have higher premiums than term insurance policies do the math and find out which one works for you yearly renewable term policies these life insurance policies don t have specific term limits however you have to renew the policy every year this makes it an affordable option but things might get more expensive further along the line what are the types of life insurance with that out of the way let s now look at the types of life insurance available for your consideration the different types of lie insurance include universal life insurance just like a permanent life insurance policy universal life insurance policies have a cash value however universal life insurance policies are a tad more flexible than permanent policies with their flexible premium payments it means you can use part of the cash value you ve accrued to lower your premium amount in fact if you ve accumulated a substantial cash value you might be able to do away with the premium payments entirely however there s a trade off for paying a lower or no premium at all it means you have to sacrifice your cash value which means your beneficiaries don t get as much in benefits as they should your universal life insurance may act as a long term investment strategy depending on how you look at it part of your premium covers your policy while the other acts like your savings this makes total sense but this may not be the most feasible long term investment option that s because your insurer might hit you with hefty management charges that reduce your cash value plus with the annual renewal term most of your premium charges will go towards paying for the policy and not your savings with that in mind it s worth noting that universal life policies break down into three types guaranteed universal life insurance this type of life insurance has fixed premium payments there s also no cash value with this type of policy you have to choose a specific age which you want the insurer to guarantee the death benefit indexed universal life insurance this policy has a cash value but the insurer attaches it to an index on the stock market the cash value can make gains depending on the index s performance the policy will outline how much your cash value can increase using a particular formula variable universal life insurance with variable universal life insurance the cash value is linked with particular investment accounts they can be stocks bonds or mutual funds you can adjust the premiums but there s no guarantee of a death benefit variable life insurance variable life insurance is different from variable universal life insurance unlike the latter variable life insurance has fixed premiums but is still tied to investment typically a mutual fund depending on market conditions you can make some significant cash but you can also lose a lot of money this type of life insurance seems like a good investment option but it has its downsides for instance you can only invest your cash value in the investment option the insurer offers this limits you from exploring other more promising options this policy is also a tad riskier than the other alternatives that s because they re too many variables in your cash value investment that may go either way you could make a killing or lose it all types of underwritten life insurance policies underwriting in insurance describes the process an insurer uses to determine how much risk they re willing to accept and how much they ll charge with underwritten insurance policies the insurers will underwrite the amount you ll pay for the policy here are the common types of underwritten life insurance policies fully underwritten life insurance this is among the most affordable life insurance options for healthy individuals part of applying for this policy requires a comprehensive medical exam it also entails a deep look at your family s health history hobbies and travel activities the state of your health and your family s health history will determine how much the insurer will charge you for the policy the greater your risk of passing on the more you ll pay the insurance company simplified issue life insurance this type of life insurance doesn t require a medical exam during the application process however your insurer might ask you a couple of questions regarding your health how you answer these questions determines whether the insurer will approve you for the coverage the application process is much simpler than a fully underwritten life insurance policy for instance instant approval life insurance utilizes big data algorithms and artificial intelligence to approve and decline applications it also lets you how much your insurance policy costs in a snap simplified issue life insurance is a popular choice for most individuals however it s worth noting that the policy attracts a higher premium than other policies plus its coverage is a tad limited compared to other types of life insurance guaranteed issue life insurance as the name connotes this life insurance is guaranteed by insurers this means that you don t have to worry about any medical examinations health questions and the like as long as you re within the age range you qualify for coverage this is an excellent option for most because there s almost zero chance of rejection however there are a few downsides to the policy one of them is that the policy is slightly more expensive than other policies also the coverage is a bit low compared to the premium amount you pay lastly your beneficiaries will only get partial death benefits if you die within the first few years of coverage other types of life insurance apart from the above there are other types of life insurance policies you can choose from these policies include final expense insurance final expense or burial expense insurance is one of the most affordable life insurance options it s a type of mini life insurance policy that s super easy to qualify for the term final expense insurance may be a marketing gimmick considering it s the same as any other whole life insurance policy the only difference between this policy and other life insurance policies is the premium and benefit amounts the death benefits should ideally cover funeral expenses but the beneficiaries can use the money for anything the policy is great for covering minor expenses but not long term financial security for your beneficiaries joint life insurance joint life or first to die insurance is a type of life insurance for couples the policy covers both you and your spouse for the price of a single policy the insurer pays the surviving couple a death benefit if the other couple dies hence the first to die tag joint life insurance makes a lot of sense for most couples because it gives the surviving couple much needed security however there s a tiny problem with this life insurance policy it doesn t take into account the income disparity in a couple that s right joint life insurance adopts a one size fits all approach for couples salaries that means you ll have to pay a bundle in premium costs even if one of you earns a minimum wage remember the purpose of life insurance is to replace the salary of one spouse should they die when you do the math you may find that taking separate life policies makes a lot more financial sense however this depends on your unique situation survivorship life insurance just like joint life insurance survivorship or second to die life insurance is a policy that covers couples however unlike joint life insurance the insurance company only pays out death benefits after both spouses pass away it s much more convenient and affordable than having separate insurance policies for each spouse survivorship has a cash value that you can use as a form of investment it s also customizable with riders to fit your situation is life insurance worth it there s always the question of whether getting life insurance is a good idea the answer is a resounding yes life insurance is a great way to ensure the financial security of your loved ones if you die unexpectedly however whether life insurance is worth it depends on your particular situation if you don t have anybody under your wing there s no need for life insurance the same also goes for individuals with children who are fully grown and can take care of themselves that said your life insurance policy is only worth it if you pick the right policy getting the right insurance will determine whether your death benefits will secure your beneficiaries future pick the right policy for your loved ones now that you know all the different types of insurance policies it s up to you to pick the right one for your needs weigh all the pros and cons of each policy and pick one that works for you your loved ones future depends on your choice be sure to check out the other posts on the site for more informative reads
updated october 29 2021 at 6 10 pm et updated nov 2 8 10 p m et children as young as 5 will be able to get vaccinated against covid 19 in the u s within the next several days while some parents aren t sure how they feelabout this others are waiting eagerly for a chance to protect their children from covid 19 but federal agencies can t be rushed here s what has to happen before the pfizer biontech shots can start going into kids arms loading currently pfizer is the furthest along in this process but moderna has shared some promising results from its vaccine trial with this age group and johnson johnson is expected to begin vaccine trials for young kids in the future as well here are more details on what the regulatory process entails and how it is going for the pfizer vaccine step 1 drugmakers complete the clinical trial pfizer and biontech have completed a three phase clinical trial in children 5 to 11 years old the companies submitted all of the data from that trial and an application for emergency use authorization to the food and drug administration on oct 7 the main study included 2 250 kids and found that the lower dose version of the vaccine was 90 7 effective in preventing symptomatic covid 19 it was given as a series of two shots 21 days apart and the dose was 10 micrograms a third of the dose given to adults and teenagers no serious side effects such as heart inflammation were reported although with only a few thousand children included in the research that sort of rare problem wouldn t necessarily be detected step 2 independent scientists review the data this week on oct 26 a panel of outside scientists considered pfizer s safety and efficacy data along with an analysis from fda scientists on the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different pandemic scenarios after some lively discussion the group overwhelmingly voted yes that the benefits of the pfizer vaccine outweigh the risks for use in this age group step 3 fda officials weigh in next the fda the agency itself considered the advisers vote on pfizer s smaller dose shot for kids on friday fda officials decided to extend the emergency use authorization for pfizer s covid 19 vaccine to younger kids acting commissioner dr janet woodcock assured parents in a statement that the agency had rigorously evaluated the data and this vaccine meets our high standards step 4 more independent scientists debate and vote but wait there s more yet another federal health agency and its advisers had to weigh in before the shots can become available this time it s the centers for disease control and prevention you can think of it like this when it comes to vaccines the fda is in charge of the what and the cdc is in charge of the who the cdc s advisory group met tuesday and voted to recommend the vaccine for all children in the 5 11 age group dr amanda cohn served until recently as the executive secretary for the cdc s vaccine advisory group and she s a voting member of the fda s vaccine advisory group explained the difference between the two federal advisory groups that weigh in on these kinds of decisions the fda decides whether a vaccine or other product is safe and effective she explained at the fda advisory meeting this week the cdc s group then considers and votes on who would benefit from the vaccine and who should get vaccinated their deliberations include factors such as equity feasibility and the potential impact of recommendations on a population she said when they vote the cdc s advisers could follow the fda s lead in their recommendations or they could make more focused or nuanced recommendations cohn said for instance they could have recommended it for a certain subgroup like children with underlying conditions or those who haven t had a prior coronavirus infection step 5 cdc director makes final recommendation even then a vote from the cdc s advisers isn t an official recommendation that comes from the cdc s director dr rochelle walensky on tuesday night she greenlit the advisers recommendation if she had chosen to she could have changed the recommendation from what the committee voted on as she did with boosters but she followed their lead and recommended them to all kids aged 5 11 only after the cdc director issues an official recommendation can shots get distributed to pediatricians and pharmacies around the country step 6 the shots get distributed to providers and pharmacies experts have been reassuring the public that the rollout of this new lower dose vaccine won t be a repeat of the disarray of the original covid 19 vaccine rollout last winter we will be ready immediately following fda and cdc s decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly easily and conveniently jeffrey zients the white house s covid 19 response coordinator said at a news conference wednesday the immunization managers planning the rollout in each state feel much more ready this time says claire hannan executive director of the association of immunization managers we have plenty of vaccine and i think that we re very well prepared she says still she warns that parents shouldn t expect that they ll be able to get their kid vaccinated the instant the regulatory hurdles are cleared there will be challenges getting the vaccine to the right providers to meet the demand experts suggest looking out for guidance from your child s pediatrician and school parents will also be able to find pharmacies with pediatric covid 19 shots in stock at vaccines gov a cdc website launched in

three long standing long term financial tenets those being to maximize free cash flow maximize return on invested capital and return excess free cash to our shareholders before we move on i want to thank core s management team and employees for their hard work during the unprecedented challenges of the past 18 months i also want to thank them for their dedication loyalty and adaptability in meeting all of our customers needs and for the personal sacrifices that many have endured as we navigate the moment and prepare for a more active market i ll now turn it over to chris for the detailed financial review chris hill chief financial officer thanks larry before we review the financial performance for the quarter the guidance we gave on our last call in past calls specifically excluded the impact of any fx gains or losses and assumed an effective tax rate of 20 so accordingly our discussion today excludes any foreign exchange gain or loss for the current and prior periods additionally the financial results for the third quarter of 2021 include a charge of 6 5 million for non cash stock compensation expenses associated with the future vesting of performance shares for certain employees who have reached their eligible retirement age although these performance shares share awards continue to be subject to future vesting schedules and company financial performance metrics for recognition of the expenses required by us gaap for employees when they attain their eligible retirement age now let s review the income statement revenue from continuing operations was 118 million in the third quarter comparable to 118 7 million in the prior quarter and up 12 year over year geographically the us market continued to grow this was offset by a sequential decrease in international revenue year over year international revenue for the quarter is up 9 and the us is up almost 20 as larry mentioned earlier there continue to be challenges with supply chains and workflow disruptions associated with the pandemic have also continued to have an impact on the progression of projects in our international operations and on international shipment of products the third quarter results were also adversely impacted by the severe weather events in the gulf of mexico of this revenue service revenue which is more international was 84 8 million for the quarter down slightly from 86 3 million last quarter the decrease in service revenue was primarily associated with the ongoing disruptions and delays caused by the pandemic in many regions outside the us but was also adversely impacted by the storms in the gulf this quarter product sales which are more equally tied to the us and international activity were 33 2 million for the quarter up 2 sequentially coming off very strong growth in the second quarter our perforating and energetic products remain in high demand however the growth in the sales to the us market in the third quarter was partially offset by a decrease in international sales the second quarter included some large international orders which can vary from quarter to quarter it is also worth mentioning that challenges with supply chains for materials continue and did impede some growth opportunities during the quarter for both the us and international markets longer lead times in short supply for certain raw materials limited the growth in our manufacturing and production capabilities during the quarter moving on to the cost of services ex items for the quarter was 79 of service revenue and fairly consistent to the prior quarter as discussed during our second quarter earnings call the cost of services are expected to increase as we restore some temporary cost reduction measures previously put in place during the pandemic as we progress further into the recovery with operational activity in our laboratory utilization improving and when employee costs are fully restored our incremental margins on services will improve and trend toward historical norms cost of sales ex items in the second quarter was just below 78 of revenue and has improved from 82 last quarter and for the last five consecutive quarters as product sales continue to grow manufacturing efficiencies and absorption of fixed costs will also continue to improve g a ex items for the quarter was 8 6 a point six million compared to last quarter of 9 7 million year to date g a is 26 million compared to 31 million for the same period last year as we progressed through 2021 the timing and extent to which we have restored and continue to restore employee compensation levels could also impact our g a expense for the next few quarters g a ex items for the full year of 2021 is expected to be between 35 million to 37 million which is about a decrease of 10 from last year depreciation and amortization for the quarter at 4 5 million was slightly lower compared to 4 8 million last quarter ebit ex items for the quarter was 13 million comparable to last quarter and representing an ebit margin of over 11 our operating income for the quarter on a gaap basis was 6 6 million which was impacted by the accelerated accounting recognition of the non cash stock compensation expense interest expense was 2 7 million comparable to last quarter but down from 3 1 million in q3 of 2020 as we continue to reduce long term debt income tax expense ex items in using a 20 effective tax rate was approximately 2 1 million for the quarter on a gaap basis income tax expense was 3 million for the third quarter as mentioned earlier the third quarter includes 6 5 million of non cash stock compensation expense that was recognized for accounting purposes and is not deductible for tax purposes the recognition of this expense in the quarter also increased the effective tax rate for the third quarter the effective tax rate will continue to be somewhat sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings across the globe and the impact of items discrete each quarter however for the fourth quarter of 2021 we continue to project a company s effective tax rate to be approximately 20 income from continuing operations ex items for the quarter was 8 3 million down slightly from 8 5 million last quarter gaap income from continuing operations was 1 million for the third quarter and includes the 6 5 million of stock compensation expense mentioned earlier earnings per diluted share from continuing operations ex items was 0 18 for the quarter comparable to the last quarter gaap earnings per diluted share from continuing ops was 0 2 for the quarter moving on to the balance sheet receivables were 95 3 million and increased approximately 2 million from prior quarter our dsos sales for the third quarter were 68 days up from 64 days last quarter inventory ended the quarter at 44 1 million up a little over 5 million from 38 9 million last quarter inventory turns for the quarter were 2 5 compared to 2 7 in the last quarter as previously highlighted last quarter the company continues to experience longer lead times in the supply chain and increasing cost of raw materials and supplies and in some instances short supply the majority of the increase in inventory this quarter is associated with carrying larger quantities of raw materials in an effort to help mitigate the challenges in the supply chain additionally some larger international product sales anticipated to ship this quarter were delayed at some of the challenges with international shipments continued on the liability side our long term debt was 190 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021 and considering cash of 19 million net debt was reduced to 171 million or a decrease of 5 4 million from june 30 our leverage ratio was 2 1 as of september 30 which is down from 2 18 last quarter and continues to improve as we work to delever the company at september 30 75 million of 10 year private placement notes which were issued back in 2011 matured and we re retired these notes were settled using a combination of 20 million from cash on hand and 55 million drawing from our credit facility our debt is now comprised of 135 million in senior notes and 55 million outstanding on our credit facility our credit facility remains fully available with over 159 million in borrowing capacity looking at cash flow for the third quarter of 2021 cash flow from operating activities with 11 9 million and after paying for 3 1 million of capex for the quarter our free cash flow was 8 8 million which is up from 6 6 million in the second quarter excess free cash was primarily used to reduce long term debt and 2 6 million in repurchasing shares associated with our long term share based incentive programs capex for 2021 will continue to be aligned with activity levels and growth opportunities the company continues to anticipate activity levels will build for the rest of the year and beyond and we would also expect our capital expenditures to modestly increase but remain in line with historical levels while in a period of growth for the full 2021 year we expect capital expenditures to be in a range of 12 million to 14 million core will continue with strict capital discipline an asset light business model with capital expenditures primarily targeted at growth opportunities and initiatives this also marks another quarter where core lab generated positive free cash and we are projecting free cash to grow as we look ahead to the remainder of this year and beyond we believe evaluating a company s ability to generate free cash flow and free cash flow yield are important metrics for shareholders when comparing a company s financial road results particularly for those shareholders who utilize discounted cash flow models to assess valuations i will now turn it over to gwen for an update on our guidance and outlook gwen schreffler senior vice president and head of investor relations thank you chris the global crude oil market continues to tighten as demand for crude oil approaches the pre covid level resulting in noticeable increases in the crude oil commodity prices current crude oil commodity prices should also support a higher level and more accelerated pace of investment and international offshore crude oil development projects for 2022 and beyond these crude oil market fundamentals are reflected in the gradual increase in the international rig count with more oil field equipment coming under contract as the cycle strengthens in iocs nocs and independence expand their investments in maintenance of existing fields and development of new fields or field extension we anticipate operators to increase capital spending by 15 to 20 for north america and double digits for international in 2022 core is well positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity given our global presence and proprietary technologies with core lab having more than 70 of its revenues exposed to international activity both business segments remain active on international projects as additional field developments emerge wells need to be drilled and reservoir rock and fluid sampled before reservoir description more fully participate in the cycle as disruptions from the pandemic abate the expansion of international development provides growth opportunities for both segments into 2022 and beyond with a particular focus on the south atlantic margin latin america and the middle east as chris mentioned international revenue was up 9 year over year for the third quarter for the fourth quarter of 2021 core expects continued growth in year over year international revenue additionally growth in us activity is projected to moderately progress as 2021 comes to a close core projects fourth quarter revenue to range from 121 million to 124 million and operating income of 13 million to 15 5 million yielding operating margins of approximately 12 as previously discussed in core s prior earnings call financial performance and incremental margins will be temporarily impacted as some cost reduction measures announced in 2020 continue to be rolled back once these costs are fully restored core expects its historical incremental margin performance to return as client activity expands eps is for the fourth quarter of 2021 is expected to be approximately 0 18 to 0 22 in summary core remains committed to its strategic plan of expanding market penetration by introducing new technologies and targeting new market opportunities core remains focused on generating free cash flow and reducing net debt while maximizing return on invested capital as part of core s 2021 strategic focus the company will continue to invest in targeted client driven technologies that aim to both solve problems and capitalize on core s growth opportunities the company remains well positioned to meet the needs of its clients as the energy industry cycle unfolds the company s fourth quarter 2021 guidance is based on projections for underlying operation and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange fourth quarter 2021 guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20 now i will return it back over to larry larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer thanks gwen first i d like to thank our global team of employees for providing innovative solutions integrity and superior service to our clients the team s collective dedication to servicing our clients has been very visible during the current challenges and is the foundation of core lab success turning first a reservoir description for the third quarter revenue came in at 79 million up slightly sequentially operating income ex items was 8 6 million up 14 sequentially and operating margins ex items improved to 11 these segment improvements occurred despite disruptions caused by gulf coast storms and the global pandemic by the nature of the business reservoir descriptions performance historically has lagged directional changes in client activity as industry activity recovers reservoir description will respond more slowly than say oilfield service companies with direct exposure to well construction and other early cycle clients spending as we look ahead we see the growing international rig count as a harbinger of an improving landscape for reservoir description a trend that we project will play out throughout 2022 and beyond now to some operational highlights during the third quarter of 2021 core s advanced technology center in the united kingdom launched an analytical program to provide both core and fluid analysis on a client for a client operating in the north sea conventional core was recovered from sandstone strata in the targeted reservoir interval once the cores reached the rig floor upon recovery from the subsurface they were stabilized using proprietary core lab techniques that ensured that the natural rock fabric and pour fluids were retained during handling and transportation upon arrival at the laboratory the course was scanned using core s proprietary non invasive testing and reservoir optimization technologies branded as nitro nitro includes proprietary dual energy computed tomography and high resolution spectral gamma logging the results quickly provided core s clients with little lodging information as well as a wide range of critical petrophysical parameters for pay delineation nitro deliverables are normally available within a week of receiving the core these initial analyses are being utilized in conjunction with core s recently expanded machine learning artificial intelligence algorithms to refine and accelerate sample selection for the traditional time honored physical measurements program single phase subsurface reservoir fluid samples from the same north sea well were also brought to the advanced technology center for testing the analysis included detailed determination of contamination levels from the drilling mud compositional profiling of the hydrocarbons speciation of sulfur compounds and measurement of physical properties including density viscosity gas oil ratio and bubble point quick turnaround on the resulting rock and fluid analytical data sets allowed core s clients to make timely decisions supporting two upcoming sidetrack appraisal wells in other international areas core s laboratory in rio de janeiro is now offering an expanded range of testing capabilities including many of course proprietary and patented technologies that are in high demand throughout core s global client base these proprietary offerings include core s dual energy ct rock evaluation technologies and core s automated digital imaging system which robotically captures high resolution images of the core material the ct data sets and photographic images are being delivered to the clients via core s proprietary web enabled data management system known as rapid these technologies and the rapid data management system were utilized in the third quarter on brazilian projects including a fully integrated study of brazil s northeastern offshore basin this multiclient study incorporates stratigraphy geochemistry reservoir geology and seal rock analysis across several offshore depot centers with the rapid data management system multidisciplinary teams located around the globe are efficiently accessing data and collaborating on analytical results moving now to production enhancement or core lab strengths in both energetic systems and completion diagnostics help clients optimize their well completions revenue for production enhancement came in at 39 2 million down 3 sequentially that was driven by lower international sales compared to the second quarter plus some supply chain hurdles and the suspension of rig operations tied to weather events in the gulf of mexico operating income ex items was 5 million up 29 sequentially operating margins were 30 for the third quarter of 2021 up over 320 basis points sequentially now for some operational highlights oriented perforating technology is gaining widespread acceptance among us land operators as the preferred method to optimize frac stimulation testing shows that well performance is highly correlated to perforating gun alignment accuracy moreover downhole images have shown suboptimal results from perforating systems that require manual alignment of guns in the gun string during the third quarter core s production enhancement team was engaged by a permian basin operator to deploy core s innovative patent pending oriented go gun this next generation design provides a plug and play system that removes inaccuracy is associated with the manual alignment of the guns as is required with other gun system offerings in addition the oriented go gun eliminates the need for orientation sub assemblies greatly lowering assembly time the innovative oriented go gun design results in the highest degree of alignment accuracy among externally oriented gun system offerings both from gun to gun and from stage to stage as a result of superior gun alignment and expedited string assemblies the operator adopted the system for all the wells in their multiwell drilling pad also in the third quarter of 2021 core s completion diagnostic services were called upon by a permian basin and client to assess a new approach to cementing operations for their horizontal unconventional wells it s often difficult to maintain stage containment when non uniform cement placement has occurred resulting in channels behind pipe frac fluid can move along these channels and migrate between targeted intervals as a consequence channels behind pipes can result in some targeted intervals being under stimulated the client wanted to evaluate if casing rotation while cementing would eliminate channels behind the pipe core utilizes proprietary spectra stem tracers and spectra scan logging technologies to compare the degree of frac fluid containment in a horizontal well in which casing rotation was employed during the cementing operation that well was then compared to adjacent wells in which no casing rotation had been deployed core s completion diagnostics engineers were able to confirm more uniform cement placement and better containment of frac fluid when pipe rotation was employed in comparing oil production between the rotated pipe well and the wells in which no pipe rotation had been performed the client observed an increase of 800 barrels of oil per thousand feet of treated well in just the first 80 days of production from the rotated pipe well with these favorable results the operator elected to implement pipe rotation in subsequent cementing operations core s completion diagnostic technologies are an invaluable tool for assisting operators in their assessment of innovations and completion techniques that concludes our operational review we appreciate your participation and debbie will now open the call for questions questions answers operator the first question comes from ian macpherson with piper sandler please go ahead gwen schreffler senior vice president and head of investor relations good morning ian ian macpherson piper sandler analyst good morning everyone larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer good morning ian macpherson piper sandler analyst larry when you when we think about the upstream spending growth rates that you re contemplating for next year which are in the fold of what others are saying if not a little bit more conservative we know that surface pricing needs to increase pretty substantially to recover the inflation that you re experiencing and so when you think about total spend minus ofs pricing it doesn t seem to leave enough dollars left in the piggy bank for the requisite activity increase that we need to balance oil markets next year so curious on your thoughts on how this unfolds with pricing recovery for core lab and how do you think those spending growth rates that you talk about should translate toward your revenue opportunity next year in this inflationary context larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer yeah ok good question ian so first maybe frame where we think we re kind of what we re seeing today with our client conversations about our outlook coming going into next year for 2022 so we d say us activity is likely to grow 15 to 20 still some conversations going on with both our domestic and international clients but we think that s that s a reasonable growth rate that s going to occur in the us and then on the international side from what we see today where we re comfortable saying that it s going to grow double digits and so i think we ll dial that in i think one of the things that certainly i think a need across the industry for improvement in pricing i think that ll come i think one of the unique situations with core lab is we ve got a lot of operational leverage in our organization in that with the automation that we ve put into the system we can generate a substantial amount more revenue without having to grow our headcount proportionally so while i do think prices will firm up as demand and activity levels pick up i think the way we ve structured the company coming out of this call a period of upheaval has us well positioned to see incremental margins start to trend back toward our traditional levels that won t happen overnight and won t happen in one or two quarters but we ll see that start to rise back into the call at 50 for reservoir description and call it 20 to 30 or a little bit more on the product side ian macpherson piper sandler analyst that s really helpful thanks larry now that you have the world is obviously your margins need need need some time to normalize but just from total health of the market and demand growth respect to things normalize you ve gotten your balance sheet on more solid footing than last year how are you thinking about the opportunities strategically for the company with respect to m a or other strategic opportunities for core lab in a market that s now positioned for growth rather than contraction larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer sure i d say first of all our attention is always drawn toward our internal pipeline for technology development it is a foundation for where we go we ve got a number of very intriguing technologies some including nuclear physics sort of revolutionary approach to how we ll address core analysis in the future and then on our product side a number of innovations both on diagnostics and energetic systems so first our attention goes to growth opportunities we have and investment opportunities we have there we re always looking and always listening to opportunities on the m a side i can say that we go through a rather rigorous evaluation of the technical and financial consequences of m a as we look at things we as you mentioned we now have called the balance sheet flexibility to act on those things the one thing i would say in terms of m a as we look over the landscape of opportunities that are out there if core lab acts on an m a opportunity it ll be something that you look at and go well that makes sense that sticks close to core lab s wheelhouse of things we know what you won t see us do is get adventurous into things that have you scratching your head is why is core lab think they know anything about that ian macpherson piper sandler analyst great answer hey thanks larry i ll pass it over larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer ok sure i think we ve got a pretty full earnings release agenda this morning with other companies going so since there are no more questions we ll wrap up here in summary core s operational leadership continues to position the company for improving client activity levels in both the us and international markets in 2022 and beyond we have never been better operationally or technologically positioned to help our global client base optimize their reservoirs and to address their evolving needs we remain uniquely focused and are the most technologically advanced client focused reservoir optimization company in the oilfield service sector the company will remain focused on generating free cash and returns on invested capital in addition to our quarterly dividends we ll bring value to our shareholders the growth opportunities are driven by both the introduction of problem solving technologies and new park market penetration in the near term core will continue to use free cash to strengthen its balance sheet so in closing we thank and appreciate all of our shareholders and the analysts that cover core lab the executive management team and the board of core laboratories gives special thanks to our worldwide employees that have made these results possible we re proud to be associated with their continuing achievements so thanks for spending time with us and we look forward to our next update goodbye for now operator duration 40 minutes call participants larry bruno chairman and chief executive officer gwen schreffler senior vice president and head of investor relations chris hill chief

ard earnings call for the period ending september 30 2021 ardagh group sa ard q3 2021 earnings call 11 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator welcome to the ardagh group third quarter 2021 bondholder conference call at this time i d like to turn the conference over to mr paul coulson chairman and ceo of ardagh group please go ahead 10 stocks we like better than arena resources inc when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and arena resources inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of october 20 2021 paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer welcome everybody and thank you for joining us today for ardagh s third quarter bondholder call which follows the release earlier today of our results for the quarter we hope you remain safe and well on the call today i m joined by shaun murphy our coo and john sheehan who has succeeded david matthews as our cfo following david s decision to step down after the recent delisting of ardagh group s a our remarks today will include certain forward looking statements these reflect circumstances at the time they are made and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied due to a wide range of factors our third quarter financial report can be found on our website at ardaghgroup com as you know earlier today ardagh metal packaging amp for short posted its third quarter earnings in which it reported growth in adjusted ebitda of 17 to 176 million ltm adjusted ebitda to september 30 increased to 637 million and amp raised its full year 2021 adjusted ebitda outlook to at least 660 million the amp call can be accessed at www ardaghmetalpackaging com and i should say that we will not be providing any additional information regarding amp or its performance on this call so i could move to the results for the quarter revenues for the group increased by 8 to 1 9 billion an increase of 6 on a constant currency basis revenue growth was principally attributable to the pass through of higher metal and other input costs in amp third quarter adjusted ebitda for our reportable segments grew by 2 to 338 million compared with 330 million in the same period last year at constant exchange rates adjusted ebitda for these reports were in line with the prior year with strong growth in amp largely offset by a reduction in packaging so moving to our second report performance i ll just briefly recap on our and as you heard on the call earlier today it performed well in the quarter strong earnings growth despite softness in our market and the pressures of a highly inflationary cost environment and supply chains revenue of 1 04 billion increased by 15 on a reported basis 15 at constant exchange rates principally due to the past aluminum and other costs ebit through the quarter increased by 17 to 176 million a 15 increase at constant currency rates driven by a strong advance in the americas on an ltm basis amp s adjusted ebitda has now increased by 17 or 90 million year to date to 637 million with further growth coming over the last quarter and this is means it will should finish the year 21 ahead of the target set out in the business plan which we published in february of this year when we announced the business combination with gores now under this business plan amp will significantly increase its manufacturing capacity so as to achieve our objective of more than doubling ebitda to over 1 1 billion by 2024 we expect the beverage can to continue to gain share and amp as a pure play beverage can manufacturer with a strong platform in each of the markets where it operates is very well placed to benefit the contract structures characterized by multiyear agreements with cost pass through provisions provides significant resilience in an inflationary cost environment albeit subject to some occasional timing lags execution of the amp business plan has been strong to date and it remains firmly on track to achieve its 2024 objectives despite well publicized delays and cost pressures in parts of the global supply chains under the amp plan free cash flow conversion will also be strong providing a very strong and highly visible growth platform which is both value creating and free cash flow accretive for our shareholders if i turn now to glass packaging total shipments in the third quarter were 3 lower than the third quarter of 2020 with broadly similar reductions in europe and north america revenues were unchanged on a reported basis and fell 1 at constant currency compared to the same period last year adjusted ebitda of 162 million was 11 lower than the prior year constant exchange rates reflecting lower shipments and increased costs in both regions looking at our glass packaging businesses our glass shipments in europe were 3 lower than the same period last year you will recall that the third quarter of 2020 benefited from the widespread reopening of hospitality after initial and often severe lockdowns in many of our markets and shipments then increased by 6 this was a challenging comp and to put it in context shipments for the third quarter of 21 are some 3 above 2019 levels by end market food and beer volumes were lower a function of weather impacted harvest and the resumption of out of home hospitality respectively by contrast strong international demand and the reopening of on premise consumption underpin growth in the spirits and nonalcoholic beverage categories revenue for the quarter in glass europe fell 6 compared to the same period last year of which almost half was attributable to our engineering equipment business adjusted ebitda for the quarter of 104 million was 10 lower than the same period last year due to the impact of sharply higher energy and other costs partly offset by a strong operating performance and a contribution from our growth investment program in glass north america revenue of 444 million increased by 3 compared with the same period last year shipments were 4 lower than the prior year with growth in spirits more than offset by lower shipments in other categories as out of home dining and hospitality resumed adjusted ebitda of 58 million was a reduction of 13 on the same period in 2020 and reflected lower shipments and increased costs including out of pattern freight costs against a relatively stable demand backdrop we continue to address operational challenges and resulting in efficiency in our glass north america business and we continue to address these issues to drive improved profitability there third quarter also saw us progress our growth investment program groupwide investment to date in 21 is in excess of 500 million including some of these financed assets with an increase to cover over 800 million expected by year end 700 million of this 800 million is in amp and the balances in our glass business as outlined earlier amp s growth investment projects remain materially on track despite the challenges of global supply chains and the projects will deliver significant capacity growth in 2022 glass europe has also been successfully pursuing targeted opportunities aimed at premium and faster growing segments of the market while efficiency and operational enhancement remains a priority in glass north america earlier today amp set out its intention to build new multiline beverage can production facilities in the u k and in the southwestern united states with planned production start ups in 2023 and 2024 respectively these projects as with all our existing growth projects will be strongly value enhancing and highly free cash flow accretive if i turn then to the amp transaction which was the combination was completed on the fourth of august and trading in amp started on the new york stock exchange on the 5th of august in september we launched an exchange offer of shares in amp in return for the outstanding class a common shares of ardagh group and following 85 acceptances under the exchange offer the free float of amp increased to 25 from it sits today the listing of amp as a pure play fast growing can producer is an important strategic move for the group and ardagh remains a committed long term majority owner of amp as it executes its multiyear growth plan as well as being focused on performance and growth of our business ardagh is committed to executing a leading sustainability strategy concentrating on environmental and ecological barriers to a greener planet but also focusing on the social agenda we are passionate about sustainability in all its aspects and we believe it represents a long term tailwind for our business when we invest in new facilities for example we ve set an ambition that each of those facilities will be class leading in terms of sustainability we continue to work with our customers suppliers communities and industry bodies to promote collection and recycling we ve developed 10 year plans across our business to ensure that we achieve our ambitious 2030 targets for co2 voc waste and water these are now being actioned including focusing on increased renewable electricity usage starting in north america and then lightweighting energy efficiency and other initiatives our community connections are vital to our success and our previously announced 10 year 50 million investment in stem education in the u s has captured the imagination of our people and their neighbors and is progressing very well and we will shortly issue our 2021 sustainability report setting out our 2030 sustainability targets through the quarter we ve continued to engage actively with our customers and supply chain to drive progress on the environmental and sustainability agenda if i now turn to our liquidity and capital structure net leverage at the end of the quarter was 4 2 times despite our having made growth investments in excess of 430 million and despite seasonal working capital in the year to date investment in seasonal working capital this reflected strong ebitda growth and the funds inflow from the amp spac transaction cash and available liquidity at the end of september last amounted to over 4 3 billion including 3 55 billion in cash as previewed on our second quarter call we called the remaining 800 million 6 notes due in 25 in august and following the calling of these notes we have no further callable debt we continue to evaluate the cash needs of ardagh group and our strong and liquid balance sheet positions the group well to take advantage of any value creating growth opportunities that arise for our business in late september we declared a dividend of 1 25 per ardagh group s a share or a cost of 295 million which was paid in mid october 272 million of this dividend was paid to our finance s a and half of this sum has now held an escrow for the benefit of the toggle noteholders at holdco as previously indicated we have allocated up to 1 4 billion for general corporate purposes including the potential return of capital to shareholders and related holdco debt repayment this allocation of which the recent 295 million dividend forms part remains unchanged and if i turn to the full year outlook demand for our metal and glass packaging products remains relatively strong across our markets our business growth investment program has advanced well during the quarter and in the year to date and is materially on track in the past quarter we ve seen a broad based and sharp increase in inflationary cost pressures for many good services including energy raw materials and logistics our business model and contract structures provide a high degree of resilience in the face of such input cost volatility and this will be a focus entering 2022 and in the light of the cost pressure seen in the quarter and the uncertain duration of some recent cost increases we now project full year ebitda for 21 to be in the range of 1 25 billion to 1 27 billion so i having made these opening remarks we will now be pleased to take any questions which you may have questions and answers operator thank you and we ll take our first question from roger spitz with bank of america please go ahead roger spitz bank of america analyst hi thank you very much first off can we just go through some of the 2021 guidance numbers firstly i mean starting with ebitda i don t know if you gave a q4 consolidated ebitda guidance or have a consolidated 2021 ebitda last quarter it was 12 90 i think or 1 28 to 1 3 paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer yes john will you handle the guidance please john sheehan chief financial officer yes sure roger that s correct what we said today was that in light of the recent cost pressures and the uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of those that the guidance now is at consolidated at 12 50 to 12 70 for the year and working down through some of the other items no major change working capital probably an outflow with higher input costs maybe about 70 million capex we ve outlined before around about 380 million for the year leases about 100 million growth investments again consolidated to be about 800 million and then tax about 75 million roger spitz bank of america analyst okay got it other than the ebitda it looks like the growth capex went down from 900 million from last quarter given to 800 million this quarter so you took off 800 million and then john sheehan chief financial officer yes i think that s really just a there was a bit of rounding previously and we ve done some more leasing in parts and then obviously just prudently managing the cash outflow as we said in the remarks the projects are very largely and very friendly on track roger spitz bank of america analyst got it and the other question is as you already announced pushing up money cash but were you prepared to talk about how much further cash you might push up to ard finance paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well we haven t roger given any made any decisions on that at all we did give guidance going back since the start since earlier way earlier this year which we repeated again today that for general corporate purposes and possible return of capital to shareholders could be as much as 1 400 of which 300 has already been paid i don t see it being as much as the balance of that but there will i think be some upflow funds yes is the answer to that but we haven t made any decisions on that because we ve just recently as you know completed the exchange offering and the delisting of ardagh group s a so no decision as of yet roger spitz bank of america analyst got it thank you very much paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer but as you know roger any money that does upflow half of that goes to pay to reduce the holdco debt as has happened with the dividend that s been paid so far okay thanks roger spitz bank of america analyst got it and that s at 104 right paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer yes yes that s a 104 yes roger spitz bank of america analyst yes thank you paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator we ll now take our next question from richard kus with jefferies richard kus jefferies analyst hi thanks for taking my question so the first one just looking at your contract structures you talk about the cost inflation obviously going into 2022 with gas being a big portion of your cost base i know in the u s you guys seem to be relatively well protected just in terms of how the contracts work but can you maybe talk about your pass through mechanisms in europe how you expect that to work heading into next year and how exposed you may be paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer john john sheehan chief financial officer yes richard it s as we said it s a very inflationary environment and correctly say that in the u s the past dues are very quick and very clean in europe we re about our business split s fairly evenly between multiyear contract and at annual contract the multiyear contracts most of them will have good energy clauses and then the others it s a question of it s an annual discussion but clearly the inflation is evident to everybody and that will inform the direction in which we need to go for the new year richard kus jefferies analyst got it and how hedged are you on your gas needs for next year in europe right now john sheehan chief financial officer in terms of energy we re we aim to be about 80 going into the new year and we d expect to be at or around that level as we head into 2022 richard kus jefferies analyst okay and then i guess my second question in terms of rp capacity that you have at the opco where does that stand right now paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer 2 1 billion richard 2 1 billion richard kus jefferies analyst okay great thank you very much paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the billionaire tax proposal which appears to be scrubbed from president biden s domestic plan would leave tesla ceo elon musk with nearly 250 billion with a personal fortune that is flirting with 300 billion the tesla ceo the richest person on earth has been attacking a democratic proposal to tax the assets of billionaires like him the idea behind the democratic plan is to use revenue from a billionaires tax to help pay for a domestic policy package being negotiated in congress that would among other things help combat climate change provide universal prekindergarten and expand health care programs the proposal wasn t included in president joe biden s framework for the domestic policy package released thursday though that deal among congressional democrats isn t final musk who recently blew past amazon founder jeff bezos as the world no 1 in wealth thanks to tesla s soaring share price would be liable for perhaps a one time 50 billion tax hit under the democratic proposal that would leave him close to 250 billion remaining forget it he says my plan the spacex founder tweeted thursday about his fortune is to use the money to get humanity to mars and preserve the light of consciousness he may well get his wish with the proposal removed from the white house framework earlier this week musk argued the fundamental problem is that government spends too much money and he warned that the billionaire tax proposal could lead over time to tax hikes for more americans eventually he tweeted monday they run out of other people s money and then they come for you the democratic proposal unveiled wednesday by sen ron wyden would tax the gains of people with either 1 billion or more in assets or three consecutive years of income of 100 million or more at the capital gains tax rate of 20 and the 3 8 net investment income tax rate it would apply to fewer than an estimated 800 people who would have to pay tax on the value of tradable items like stocks even if they don t sell them under current law such assets are subject to tax only when they re sold supporters have said the tax could raise 200 billion over 10 years that could help fund biden s legislative priorities republicans are unified in opposition to the proposal and some have suggested it would be challenged in court the democrats proposal came against the backdrop of growing concerns about vast economic inequality with the wealth of many american multi billionaires having accelerated during the covid 19 pandemic thanks to increased stock and home equity even more than before the virus struck john catsimatidis the billionaire grocery chain and real estate magnate who owns gristedes condemned the proposal as something you would expect putin to do referring to president vladimir putin of russia the billionaire tax plan catsimatidis told the associated press is a little bit insane the american people have reached the point where they re saying enough is enough said catsimatidis who lost a bid for the republican nomination for new york city mayor in 2013 stop spending the money stupidly they come up with budgets that are stupid budgets and they want to make everybody else suffer for it do we need infrastructure catsimatidis added sure we need infrastructure do we need bridges to nowhere no we don t need those you re talking about the people that create the jobs he said of billionaires we can get up and go somewhere else leon cooperman the outspoken billionaire investor who has long denounced sen elizabeth warren s own proposal for a wealth tax has added his voice to the exasperation coming from some of the uber wealthy in an interview with the daily beast cooperman said of the tax i doubt it s legal and it s stupid what made america great he said was the people who started with nothing like me making a lot of money and giving it back a relentless attack on wealthy people makes no sense not every billionaire shares such outrage a spokesperson for george soros the investor and liberal philanthropist told the ap that soros is supportive of the proposed billionaires tax and while warren buffett has yet to comment publicly on the proposal the billionaire head of berkshire hathaway has long called for higher taxes on the ultra wealthy like himself bob lord a tax lawyer and associate fellow at the progressive think tank institute for policy studies said that even if this particular proposal doesn t pass it does reflect how concerns about financial inequality are gathering momentum propublica reported in june that some of the richest americans have paid no income tax or nearly none in some years including musk who the report said paid zero income taxes in 2018 critics argue that musk s criticism of the billionaire tax proposal overlooks the fact that tesla s rise has been aided by government incentives and loans lord noted for example that the run up in tesla stock monday after a major order of teslas from hertz increased musk s wealth by roughly 37 billion more than what the irs collects in estate and gift tax revenue from the entire country in one year wyden s proposal lord suggested might need to close some loopholes but i think they ve done a pretty good job with it he said there are folks out there who are saying the billionaires will just put their money into non publicly traded assets but it s not going to be that easy it s a pretty well crafted bill such tax changes could also shift how billionaire philanthropists make donations brian mittendorf a professor of accounting at ohio state university said he believes that in the short term the billionaire proposal would lead some of the uber wealthy to rush philanthropic contributions into so called donor advised funds such funds would allow them to receive tax deductions up front without distributing any of the money donors can t get the money back from these funds if in fact this were to pass mittendorf said it creates huge incentives to donate some of these assets that have gone up in value before the tax hits ___

velocity of new starts over the last several months and the caliber of that talent underscores our ability to attract the best and the brightest talent to our team turning to our engagements in more detail our momentum continued into the third quarter as we won new assignments while reengaging projects on the reactive side of the business as we highlighted last quarter our litigation work has been in a mode of recovery hovering near 2019 levels as the throughput of litigation in our united states courts continues to accelerate we will be positioned to capture the stickiness and inertia around the backlog of trials making their way through the system globally delays in international arbitrations have the potential to recover with eased covid restrictions facilitating more in person meetings exponent is well positioned to capture these growth tailwinds while also leveraging expansion into new end markets such as pharmaceutical and software litigation and increasing our brand recognition in the international arbitration arena within our proactive business we are seeing a strong increase in user studies spanning across various end markets particularly as it relates to artificial intelligence and machine learning for wearables and other devices this increase is driven by rising demand as well as the accessibility of human participants and the ability to conduct on site work as covid restrictions eased over the year overall our proactive engagements remained robust and diverse fulfilling complex customer requirements related to user experience as well as product optimization and performance while leveraging data analytics to further mitigate risk for our clients our traction across our multidisciplinary offering continues to demonstrate the strength of our long term strategy and our commitment to providing customers with the tools and analysis needed to drive optimal decision making utilization in the third quarter saw improvement year over year supported by strong demand for human participant studies increased litigation work and lower headcount which drove improved profitability however as we have said over the last few quarters we do expect utilization to normalize somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2021 as human participant studies moderate headcount grows and we see typical seasonality recruiting a world class team remains a top priority for us and we have accelerated our efforts during the second and third quarters of 2021 while the market for engineering and scientific talent remains competitive and voluntary turnover has increased relative to last year we are seeing exceptional candidates and adding depth and experience to our already world class team turning to our segments exponent s engineering and other scientific segment represented 83 of our net revenues in the third quarter increasing 20 year over year our growth was driven by strong demand for exponent s services across a broad range of industries and use cases in addition to the steady increase in litigation support and human participant studies for the consumer products segment our work around wearable technologies and asset integrity and risk management for utilities was a core driver of growth over the period on the automotive side we continue to see strong reactive based demand for our unrivaled and state of the art testing and analysis capabilities for advanced driver assistance systems on the proactive side of automotive we continue to engage clients in implementing safety frameworks in the automated connected electric and shared vehicles space while also gaining traction on battery work for electric vehicles and energy storage systems exponent s environmental and health segment represented 17 of the company s net revenues in the third quarter net revenues in this segment were largely flat compared to the prior year period the pharmaceutical industry remains a significant opportunity for exponent as we leverage our multidisciplinary approach and data landscape across the full product life cycle from pharmaco epidemiology and real world evidence to health economics and outcomes research and market access as mentioned last quarter our focused efforts in the pharmaceutical industry continue to materialize with an emphasis on recruitment and business development initiatives supporting new client engagements overall we are very encouraged by the influx of new engagements and key hires across the business we are already seeing our accelerated recruitment efforts materialize with a strong pipeline of high quality talent positioning exponent for a record year of hiring to close out the year as we move through the remainder of fiscal year 2021 we remain confident that our strong reputation multidisciplinary capabilities industry leading expertise and market driven durability will propel exponent forward toward sustained growth and increased scale i ll now turn the call over to rich to provide more detail on our third quarter 2021 results as well as discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2021 richard l schlenker executive vice president chief financial officer and corporate secretary thank you catherine and good afternoon everyone let me start by saying all comparisons will be on a year over year basis unless otherwise noted for the third quarter of 2021 total revenues increased 18 to 116 4 million and revenues before reimbursements or net revenues as i will refer to them from here on increased 16 to 108 5 million as compared to the third quarter of 2020 net income for the third quarter increased to 24 6 million or 0 46 per diluted share as compared to 18 1 million or 0 34 per diluted share in the prior year period ebitda for the quarter increased 31 to 34 million producing a margin of 31 4 of net revenues which is an increase of 355 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2020 billable hours in the third quarter were 348 000 an increase of 13 year over year utilization in the third quarter was 76 up from 66 in the same quarter of 2020 utilization in the quarter remained above expectations driven by lower ftes or full time equivalent and strong demand for our human participant and machine learning studies as well as litigation support technical full time equivalent employees in the third quarter were 883 down 2 as compared to the same period one year ago the realized rate increase was approximately 3 for the third quarter compensation expense after adjusting for gains and losses in deferred compensation increased 9 included in total compensation expense is a loss in deferred compensation of 300 000 as compared to a gain of 3 2 million in the third quarter of 2020 as a reminder gains and losses in deferred compensation are offset to miscellaneous income and have no impact on the bottom line stock based compensation expense in the third quarter was 4 4 million as compared to 3 7 million a year ago other operating expenses were up 2 to 8 million driven primarily by increased activities at our offices as our employees gradually return included in other operating expenses is depreciation expense of 1 6 million for the quarter g a expenses were up 48 to 4 2 million for the third quarter the increase in g a expense was primarily due to higher marketing and recruiting activities interest income decreased 300 000 to 13 000 for the third quarter lower interest income is the result of a steep decline in interest rates miscellaneous income net of deferred compensation loss was approximately 300 000 included inclusive of tax benefit from share based awards exponent s consolidated tax rate was 24 1 for the third quarter as compared to 26 6 in the prior year period moving to our cash flows during the third quarter we generated 24 9 million in cash from operations and capital expenditures were 1 2 million in the third quarter we distributed 10 4 million to shareholders through dividend payments at quarter end the company had 255 million in cash and short term investments turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 we now expect fourth quarter 2021 revenues before reimbursements to grow in the mid single digits and ebitda margin to decrease 175 to 225 basis points as compared to the same period in 2020 for the full year 2021 we expect revenues before reimbursement to grow in the mid teens and ebitda margin to increase 290 to 310 basis points as compared to 2020 we expect utilization in the fourth quarter to be 67 to 69 as compared to 66 in the same quarter last year as a result we expect a full year utilization of 74 to 75 as compared to 67 in 2020 as a reminder utilization is lower in the fourth quarter due to more holidays and vacations in particular we expect more vacations in the fourth quarter as compared to last year even in the fourth quarter we expect full time equivalent employees to reach approximately 910 to 920 which is a sequential growth of 3 to 4 from the third quarter of 2021 this will place us slightly ahead of where we were in the fourth quarter of last year as we progressed through progress through 2021 we have accelerated our recruiting efforts while the job market remains highly competitive which has resulted in increased voluntary turnover over prior year we continue to demonstrate our ability to attract high quality talent we have had a significant number of new starts over the last several months which will temper utilization slightly in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter we do expect year over year realized rate increase of 2 5 to 3 as a result the full year realized rate increase is expected to be 4 to 4 5 we expect stock based compensation to be 3 8 million to 4 2 million in the quarter and 19 million to 19 4 million for the full year we expect operating expenses for the fourth quarter to be 8 4 million to 8 7 million and for the full year we expect other operating expenses to be 32 2 million to 32 5 million as we gradually return to the offices we believe our office environment provides long term value as it supports collaboration for our interdisciplinary teams and staff development which results in a higher value for our clients and retention of our employees we anticipate associated expenses to be at historic levels as we enter 2022 g a expenses will also gradually scale as recruiting business development and travel activities increase for the fourth quarter of 2021 we expect g a expenses to be 4 5 million to 4 8 million for the full year 2021 we expect g a expenses to be 15 2 million to 15 5 million for the quarter we expect interest income to be approximately 10 000 and 60 000 for the full year in addition we anticipate miscellaneous income being approximately 500 000 for the quarter and 2 1 million for the full year for the fourth quarter of 2021 we expect our tax rate to be approximately 27 as compared to 18 6 in the same quarter last year as a result we expect the full year 2021 tax rate to be 19 as compared to 14 8 in 2020 capex for the full year 2021 is expected to be 8 million to 9 million we are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter with significant margin improvement year over year and we are confident in our ability to continue to grow i will now turn the call back to catherine for closing remarks catherine ford corrigan president and chief executive officer thank you rich for over 50 years exponent has partnered with thousands of clients to address their most complex challenges as society continues to raise expectations for safety health sustainability and reliability and our clients needs evolve and increase in complexity exponent remains uniquely qualified to deliver groundbreaking solutions for the challenges of today and to help unravel the complexities of innovations for tomorrow we are confident that the increased level of new engagements across our broad based portfolio as well as new hires across the business will support consistent profitable growth and will ultimately drive long term value for our shareholders operator we are now ready for questions questions and answers operator we ll take our first question from tobey sommer of truist securities tobey sommer truist securities analyst thank you i was hoping you could give us some more color about the sort of record headcount in hiring additions that you ve made and expect to continue to make this year and then maybe if you could frame that in the context of what you think you could achieve on an ongoing basis as we look to model future periods thanks catherine ford corrigan president and chief executive officer yes thanks tobey so we ve certainly accelerated our efforts around recruiting just in the last few months and we re particularly encouraged by how we ve been able to continue to attract the best in the brightest talent in the organization there is no doubt that we re seeing a competitive marketplace for that talent as we always have but we feel very good about what we ve been able to do in terms of bringing them on board and getting them into the flow of engagements quickly so that they can be contributing and having an impact relatively quickly in their tenure so we ve got our foot on the pedal there we intend to keep our foot on the pedal there with a goal really as we come back into sort of a more normalized type of situation to be growing headcount annually and with sort of a goal of 4 to 7 range that really has not changed in terms of what we re looking to do in a steady state over the long term what we re dealing with now is still some transients that are in the system we ve demonstrated our ability to ramp up and really surge in order to meet client demand so that s been great but over the long term we need these folks that are coming on board to be able to make their investments in professional development and business developments and all of those things that require their time so as we get back on a more long term normalized basis we do expect that the utilization will moderate a bit as we increase the headcount and sort of balance those things out operator thank you we ll take our next question from andrew nicholas with william blair andrew nicholas william blair company llc analyst thank you and good afternoon the first question i wanted to ask was just on the proactive and reactive businesses as kind of a component of mix here it sounds like proactive has been gaining momentum for some time post pandemic so i was wondering if you can kind of help us think about the growth rates for those two pieces both immediately found in the pandemic and maybe how it s progressed over the course of the past couple of quarters catherine ford corrigan president and chief executive officer yes thanks and things are a little bit different depending on which side of the business you re looking at when we look at reactive and particularly litigation we are continuing along what i would call a fairly steady gradual path in terms of the pace of the engagements right it s there s an increasing rate of activity that s going on through the domestic court system there were still some impacts related to restrictions there were still some challenges that we re seeing in the courts in terms of in person engagement bringing juries in and that sort of thing but it s getting there we re continuing to see this sort of steady increase as we look forward we certainly see activities in the reactive space for growth although as i look forward i really do believe that the proactive side will grow faster if i think about the drivers on the proactive side there are lots of drivers around the regulatory frameworks that things like chemical regulatory work that continue to grow through the pandemic and we expect it to continue to grow as we kind of get away from the pandemic think about the design related and reliability related consulting that we re doing for the consumer products industry that s something that s been a very strong driver lately and if you look at the kinds of innovation that are happening things like virtual reality augmented reality consumer electronics these are all important drivers we re doing a lot of work around machine learning data curation and data collection studies that s being driven by that sort of innovation landscape climate change is driving work for the utilities industry and around infrastructure in general assessing the vulnerability of our infrastructure we re seeing work there our work in batteries and energy storage if you just think about the demand sort of tipping point that we re getting to around electric vehicles general motors has announced additional expenditures over the last month ford is building a couple of extra battery plants i think even lamborghini is announcing they re going to electrify their fleet right so there are lots of drivers for this proactive sort of safety driven and complexity driven work on that proactive side so the reactive will grow as well we mentioned pharmaceutical litigation software litigation international disputes is an area where we continue to build our brand so we ve got good drivers on really on both sides of the house andrew nicholas william blair company llc analyst that s really helpful actually catherine you made note of the second question i was going to ask which is around software litigation i don t know if that s a new name for a practice that or a new reference to a practice that you ve had for some time but i don t believe that s something that you called out in prior calls can you talk a little bit about that opportunity it certainly makes sense as the world gets eaten by software was just wondering what that opportunity looks like how new that is and maybe what the ramp schedule looks like for a practice like that particularly given i would imagine sourcing talent and adding new people to be able to service that is is incredibly tough in this environment catherine ford corrigan president and chief executive officer yes yes thanks and so this is work that we have been doing but are seeing some stronger growth drivers so some of it is in the intellectual property type of space other software litigation is around embedded systems in particular we ve had a lot of expertise in embedded systems within our electrical engineering and computer science practice for many years think about the systems that are driving control systems for automotive electronics that s a big area or control systems around advanced manufacturing these types of areas can lead to either ip litigation they can lead to sort of product quality related litigation it could lead to the types of litigation where oems are trying to recover from their suppliers it sort of comes in a lot of different forms but it s something we ve been seeing more of it is that as well as pharmaceutical litigation are areas where we we re getting more traction and so that along with the with all of the other areas of litigation like product liability like human health related litigation like environmental litigation we see the ability to continue increasing sort of across this broad portfolio as we go forward andrew nicholas william blair company llc analyst perfect thanks so much for the color catherine ford corrigan president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator thank you we ll take our next question from sam england with berenberg sam england berenberg capital markets analyst hi guys thanks for taking the questions and the first one i had could you talk a bit about which end markets have bounced back more strongly over the last couple of quarters and then which end markets are still below pre pandemic levels and where there is sort of a recovery opportunity over the next few quarters catherine ford corrigan president and chief executive officer yes thanks sam one area that i mentioned that i would highlight in this context is our proactive work around consumer products and consumer electronics being a significant part of that this is a lot of the motivation for the human participant work for the machine learning data type of studies that we ve been doing for our user experience capability where we re doing research really understanding the sort of cognitive effects of the use of technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality that end market is quite strong the utility sector is another one where we re really bringing our subject matter expertise in engineering and marrying that with our sophisticated data analytics capabilities in a very unique way not only can we sort of run the algorithm and crunch the numbers to utilize sort of that artificial intelligence but we also have the engineering expertise to lay over that and we re finding that to be very valuable as we re assessing asset integrity as we re looking at climate vulnerability and resilience in the utility sector and so those are some of the stronger ones some of the ones where we re seeing maybe a little more slowness if i go back over to the reactive side the litigation markets are sort of recovering at different paces one of them that s maybe slower than the others is around transportation and product liability this is one that got hit particularly hard back in 2020 and part of the reason for that i believe is because of its dependence not only on the court system but also on our ability to travel to do site inspections to do vehicle inspections to bring people on site to do vehicle testing there s a lot of that type of work in that arena and so not to mention the impact that the pandemic had on the client base in that area being very dramatic and so it s taking some time but we re absolutely sort of on that path but that for example has been slower than if you look at sort of the health and environmental related litigation which was stronger through 2020 it wasn t impacted as much so a little bit of variability there that we re still looking to kind of bring that transportation work back in litigation but part of what s doing that right now is the work in advanced driver assistance systems that is a in terms of the prospects for recovery that is a particular litigation area where we are being sought out for a really unique set of expertise that we ve got both around how these systems have been deployed and also how to test them in real sort of limit type of environments so we are seeing a lot of encouraging trends in that particular sector sam england berenberg capital markets analyst okay great thanks and then the next one i had you touched in your remarks on the higher staff attrition you ve seen just firstly how much of that do you think is just driven by the fact that you had lower attrition sort of in 2020 and then what are you doing as a business to try and improve staff retention in light of this busy global market catherine ford corrigan president and chief executive officer yes yes thanks sam i think there is definitely a piece of this that is sort of pent up from 2020 i don t think it explains everything but i do think it explains some you re in an environment in 2020 where folks are maybe less certain about wanting to sort of change course whereas as we started coming out in 2021 they see sort of more opportunity for that as a company one of the things that is so incredibly important to the retention of our consultants is our emphasis on professional development when we hire folks in especially the junior staff which is a big percentage of our hiring we want to put them on a path that is going to help them to publish help them to become famous help them to find a niche be engaged with clients and ultimately become a lead consultant someday so our efforts around retention are very much focused on those types of programs they re focused on mentoring they re focused on sponsorship they re focused on ensuring that we are creating opportunities for those staff to have client engagement directly and really be able to see the impact of the work that they re doing these are things that we always do that s been part of our growth paradigm as a company for many years but we re placing particular emphasis on that sort of development path for our team as well as some of the simple things when we re in a virtual environment ensuring that we re checking in on our team ensuring that we re focused on their mental health and well being because they re very busy our utilization is sort of hitting records here right and so there are those aspects as well where we re really looking to our leadership our directors our managers all the way down to our supervisors to really find ways to foster engagement with the staff directly sam england berenberg capital markets analyst okay great thanks i ll leave it there catherine ford corrigan president and chief executive officer thanks sam operator thank you we ll take our next question from tobey sommer of truist securities tobey sommer truist securities analyst thanks sorry about my technical difficulty could you talk about what you would expect realized pricing to be in inflation broadly and wage inflation kind of up and down the labor market picks up and persists for a period of time how would your realized pricing react richard l schlenker executive vice president chief financial officer and corporate secretary yes thanks for the question tobey look we at exponent have seen our pricing increases on a year over year basis sort of range in that 2 to 3 5 level over couple of decades here as we ve moved through different economic cycles and in particular the demand environment for high end engineering and scientific talent probably the most important thing that goes on in our sector is what is that demand for that those engineers and scientists what are our clients who tend also hire engineers and scientists realizing in the employment market that the price for talent is going up it will increase and do that so i think right now we re in a strong demand environment and as such and we may get some inflation here and things but i m expecting us to be in the upper part of that range in the rate that we realize as we go into 2022 tobey sommer truist securities analyst thanks in i apologize if i missed something but could you expand on your utility work on the resiliency in i m kind of interested not just in the current work but whether or not other utilities in other geographies are building out projects as well catherine ford corrigan president and chief executive officer thanks tobey yes so we are seeing sort of expansion of the work that we re doing in the utility sector of course the western utilities have a big driver around wanting to prevent wildfire that has been an important driver for the work that we ve done around risk related to electrical assets over the last certainly over the last several years and so that has been a strong area of growth but there are what s wonderful about what we re doing is that the methodology and algorithms that we have developed to apply diverse data sources and engineering to look at the probability of failure you can do this not only for wind knocking down transmission lines you can apply this same paradigm to vegetation risks you can apply the same paradigm to bird strike risks you can apply this paradigm to flooding risks this sort of bayesian updating concept that s used statistically and this overall framework and so what s exciting to me about this is that we have an opportunity to really broaden beyond and are already broadening beyond that s simply the peril of wins and electrical transmission lines into a broader set of assets that include gas infrastructure that includes water related infrastructure etc so there s a nice set of opportunities i think for us as we build out our capabilities that marry these data analytics with that subject matter expertise tobey sommer truist securities analyst thank you for that answer last question for me of the multiple appropriations bills being juggled in congress currently from regular way budget eventually the soft and hard infrastructure packages is there anything that we should watch for in terms of potential inclusion in those bills as being relevant for growth in your marketplace understanding that you re typically working with commercial clients but these government initiatives can be some biggest influence trends in the commercial markets too richard l schlenker executive vice president chief financial officer and corporate secretary yes tobey i think you re right there in the sense of trends we historically we have not seen a sort of immediate impact of come from a one year budget but i will bring your attention to some areas that we ve been talking about here first of all the funds that are going in it sounds like around climate change and energy and all that are focusing along incentivizing electric vehicles which obviously exponent has a lot of expertise around and incentivizing the increased driving more demand about that that would be very continues to be positive for us and any encouragement that would be good the other area is alternative energy as you move into i think currently the at least what s out there is a lot around wind in technology we do a lot around the technologies and reliability of those wind systems both turbines as well as blades and other things that come into your traditional engineering but more volume and energy into that would be positive focus around really the understanding in the healthcare area around real world data and real world data evidence and the drive in that direction to have the accountability for the value being delivered there that s very much centered to what we are trying to build in our go to market for the pharmaceuticals industry and such so those are a couple that i at least have tobey sommer truist securities analyst thank you very much i appreciate that operator duration 41 minutes call participants joni konstantelos

vol 45 no 44 friday october 29 2021 sen burr under investigation again for pandemic stock sales print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required washington ap north carolina sen richard burr and his brother in law are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission for potential insider trading a case that stems from their abrupt sales of financial holdings during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic according to recent federal court filings burr a republican is among several lawmakers from both parties who faced outrage over their aggressive trading in early 2020 before the economic threat from the virus was widely known that fueled accusations that the members of congress were acting on inside information gained through their official duties to benefit financially which is illegal under a law known as the stock act burr was previously investigated by the trump administration s justice department for offloading 1 6 million from his portfolio in january and february 2020 the department cleared him of wrongdoing almost a year later on jan 19 donald trump s last full day in office but the sec continued to investigate burr according to court documents filed in the southern district of new york that were first made public last week the agency enforces federal securities law attorneys for burr as well as for gerald fauth who is the brother of burr s wife did not immediately respond to requests for comment burr has previously denied any wrongdoing the filings stem from a case brought by the sec to force fauth to comply with a subpoena the agency argued that his close relationship with burr and a phone call between the two followed by calls to fauth s brokers made his testimony critical whether fauth was himself tipped with inside information from senator burr and whether fauth knew senator burr was violating his duties under the stock act by conveying that information are matters fauth is uniquely positioned to speak to the sec said in a filing to bolster their case sec attorneys released a timeline of phone calls from feb 13 2020 the day burr sold off the vast majority of his portfolio it was roughly one week before the stock market went into a tailspin at the time burr had material nonpublic information concerning covid 19 and its potential impact on the u s and global economies some of which he learned through his position as chairman of the senate intelligence committee and from former staffers directing the government s coronavirus response the sec alleges in the court filing that day after burr instructed his own broker to sell he spoke with fauth in a call that lasted 50 seconds one minute later the court document states fauth called one of his brokers two minutes later he called another broker and gave instructions to sell shares in his wife s account later that day burr who was staying at the fauths home in suburban washington logged into his online brokerage account from an ip address registered to fauth s wife court records state burr has drawn perhaps the most scrutiny of all members of congress for his trades in the early days of the pandemic he was captured in a recording privately warning a group of influential constituents in early 2020 to prepare for economic devastation burr denied trading on private information but stepped aside from his position as chairman of the senate intelligence committee after the fbi obtained a search warrant to seize a cellphone burr is not seeking reelection next year he was elected to the senate in 2004 after a 10 year run in the house the stock act the statute which burr and fauth are being investigated under was passed with bipartisan support in 2012 following a congressional stock trading scandal it was cheered by government ethics groups and watchdogs as a long overdue step but in the nearly decade since no one has been convicted under the law meanwhile congressional stock trading has continued apace legal experts say such insider trading cases are exceptionally difficult to prosecute because they require definitively proving whether someone acted on nonpublic information that hinges on demonstrating intent a high burden that s part of why sec investigators are trying to get a court order to force fauth to testify a year and a half after they first issued a subpoena fauth a government official who serves as chairman of the national mediation board has repeatedly cited his health as a reason for not complying his attorneys have said it is a valid reason but he has continued to tend to his duties for the mediation board participating in calls and meetings he was recently nominated for another three year term and appeared last month with the agency s attorney to be interviewed by republican senate staffers before his confirmation hearing for the post when he appeared for that interview fauth does not appear to have followed his physician s advice that he avoid stressful situations the sec wrote in the court filing ___ associated press writer eric tucker

sales by mark woodruff top 10 risk scenarios impacting upon global growth and inflation the post pandemic recovery is expected to continue with global gdp expanding by 4 1 in 2022 down from the 5 4 rate estimated for 2021 however the economist is tracking ten scenarios that would see growth fall short of its forecasts given recent media airtime at least five of the risks will surprise no one they are a decoupling of the global economy due to increased fallout in us china relations conflict between china and taiwan forcing the us to intervene faster than expected monetary tightening leading to a us stockmarket crash a property crash in china leading to a sharp economic slowdown and the emergence of new covid variants there may also be currency and or debt crises in emerging markets stemming from either the above mentioned monetary tightening or a rise in commodity prices this commodity risk is partially linked to a separate risk pertaining to climate change induced droughts and or famine social unrest was already a pre pandemic feature for the middle east africa and latin america and some countries within these regions underwent tough lockdowns and deep recessions it s thought increasing unrest could lead to a government collapse panicked investors and destabilising capital outflows mind you the economist also believes this same risk holds true for traditionally stable western states and long standing authoritarian regimes under another scenario worsening relations between the eu and china could result in operational disruption for affected chinese companies and leave eu companies operating in china vulnerable to retaliation when probability and impact are weighed for the ten risks investors should be least worried about an inter state cyberwar crippling state infrastructure in major economies the equal top ranked risks were the above mentioned potential for worsening us china relations a chinese property crash and the monetary policy induced us stock market crash is the de rated packaging sector an opportunity the recent market de rating of the australian packaging sector has overshot fundamentals and underestimates the rate of organic earnings growth the industry can deliver in the wake of covid 19 believes jarden the industry stands to gain especially if increased at home consumption patterns developed during lockdowns can stick over the mid term the pandemic was a hiatus for the decade long structural shift to out of home cafes and restaurants food beverage consumption from at home grocery and specialty stores this of particular relevance for both amcor amc and pact group pgt which derive 68 and 48 of revenue from food beverage and the analysts believe consensus forecasts are yet to reflect any potential for higher revenue growth rates the broker initiates coverage of the sector with an overweight stance and favours amcor ahead of orora ora and pact and believes there s adequate risk reward upside for investors at this early stage of the post covid recovery amcor and orora may benefit the most from expansions in return on invested capital roic based on current consensus estimates note the analysts additional upside may spring from the latent potential from prior m a s and divestments which are yet to fully deliver earnings upside moreover it should be remembered that contract structures allow the majority of any input cost increases to be passed on to customers this along with low though stable earnings growth prompts jarden to suggest australian packaging companies should be allocated to the defensive part of an investor s investment portfolio the swing toward private debt markets in the ongoing search for yield it seems investors have turned toward private debt markets which are expected to double by 2025 returns can be up to three or four times what retail investors might get on conservative fixed income positions non bank lending has been at the forefront

commercial broker stamford capital smsfs and super funds are turning more and more to private debt markets and a lot of private real estate deals are being funded this way according to matt mckenna at kpmg s debt advisory services should merchants add a surcharge to bnpl sales is a merchant willing to risk the loss of potential sales by adding a surcharge to bnpl sales citi searches for an answer in the wake of the final report from the reserve bank of australia on payments regulation which now calls for the removal of no surcharge clauses according to the broker the amount of lost sales will likely be determined by the proportion of retailers deciding to add a surcharge if adding a surcharge becomes the norm then this reduces the potential impact to a retailer moreover the level of competitive intensity and consumer engagement are more likely to determine long term bnpl merchant take rates also surcharging in an online context is quite rare amazon aside which in the analyst s view reflects the risk of lost sales cart abandonment citi analysis indicates that if over 7 5 of a retailer s bnpl s sales were to disappear due to surcharging then that retailer is unlikely to add a surcharge it s felt zip co z1p is less exposed given its average merchant fee of 2 5 to 3 0 in australia is more in line with the paypal offering the broker is currently research restricted on

updated nov 2 8 10 p m et children as young as 5 will be able to get vaccinated against covid 19 in the u s within the next several days loading while some parents aren t sure how they feel about this others are waiting eagerly for a chance to protect their children from covid 19 but federal agencies can t be rushed here s what has to happen before the pfizer biontech shots can start going into kids arms currently pfizer is the furthest along in this process but moderna has shared some promising results from its vaccine trial with this age group and johnson johnson is expected to begin vaccine trials for young kids in the future as well here are more details on what the regulatory process entails and how it is going for the pfizer vaccine step 1 drugmakers complete the clinical trial pfizer and biontech have completed a three phase clinical trial in children 5 to 11 years old the companies submitted all of the data from that trial and an application for emergency use authorization to the food and drug administration on oct 7 the main study included 2 250 kids and found that the lower dose version of the vaccine was 90 7 effective in preventing symptomatic covid 19 it was given as a series of two shots 21 days apart and the dose was 10 micrograms a third of the dose given to adults and teenagers no serious side effects such as heart inflammation were reported although with only a few thousand children included in the research that sort of rare problem wouldn t necessarily be detected step 2 independent scientists review the data this week on oct 26 a panel of outside scientists considered pfizer s safety and efficacy data along with an analysis from fda scientists on the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different pandemic scenarios after some lively discussion the group overwhelmingly voted yes that the benefits of the pfizer vaccine outweigh the risks for use in this age group step 3 fda officials weigh in next the fda the agency itself considered the advisers vote on pfizer s smaller dose shot for kids on friday fda officials decided to extend the emergency use authorization for pfizer s covid 19 vaccine to younger kids acting commissioner dr janet woodcock assured parents in a statement that the agency had rigorously evaluated the data and this vaccine meets our high standards step 4 more independent scientists debate and vote but wait there s more yet another federal health agency and its advisers had to weigh in before the shots can become available this time it s the centers for disease control and prevention you can think of it like this when it comes to vaccines the fda is in charge of the what and the cdc is in charge of the who the cdc s advisory group met tuesday and voted to recommend the vaccine for all children in the 5 11 age group dr amanda cohn served until recently as the executive secretary for the cdc s vaccine advisory group and she s a voting member of the fda s vaccine advisory group explained the difference between the two federal advisory groups that weigh in on these kinds of decisions the fda decides whether a vaccine or other product is safe and effective she explained at the fda advisory meeting this week the cdc s group then considers and votes on who would benefit from the vaccine and who should get vaccinated their deliberations include factors such as equity feasibility and the potential impact of recommendations on a population she said when they vote the cdc s advisers could follow the fda s lead in their recommendations or they could make more focused or nuanced recommendations cohn said for instance they could have recommended it for a certain subgroup like children with underlying conditions or those who haven t had a prior coronavirus infection step 5 cdc director makes final recommendation even then a vote from the cdc s advisers isn t an official recommendation that comes from the cdc s director dr rochelle walensky on tuesday night she greenlit the advisers recommendation if she had chosen to she could have changed the recommendation from what the committee voted on as she did with boosters but she followed their lead and recommended them to all kids aged 5 11 only after the cdc director issues an official recommendation can shots get distributed to pediatricians and pharmacies around the country step 6 the shots get distributed to providers and pharmacies experts have been reassuring the public that the rollout of this new lower dose vaccine won t be a repeat of the disarray of the original covid 19 vaccine rollout last winter we will be ready immediately following fda and cdc s decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly easily and conveniently jeffrey zients the white house s covid 19 response coordinator said at a news conference wednesday the immunization managers planning the rollout in each state feel much more ready this time says claire hannan executive director of the association of immunization managers we have plenty of vaccine and i think that we re very well prepared she says still she warns that parents shouldn t expect that they ll be able to get their kid vaccinated the instant the regulatory hurdles are cleared there will be challenges getting the vaccine to the right providers to meet the demand experts suggest looking out for guidance from your child s pediatrician and school parents will also be able to find pharmacies with pediatric covid 19 shots in stock at vaccines gov a cdc website launched in february to help people who want covid 19

discuss sales and financial matters in more detail we delivered another strong quarter of financial results including operating revenues of 164 million resulting in 6 4 year over year growth adjusted ebitda of 86 million resulting in growth of 5 2 year over year and ffo per share of 1 39 or 4 5 year over year growth we also reported strong operating performance including cash rent mark to market year to date of 2 9 churn year to date of 4 6 in line with our expectations and 5 year over year mrr per cabinet equivalent growth driven by strong power and interconnection revenue growth today we will discuss leasing results of 8 9 million comprised of third quarter leasing of 7 2 million in annualized gaap rent and a 1 7 million scale lease at sv7 signed on october 7 the demand continues to be positive for deployments and agile interconnection in our network and cloud enabled data center campuses in major metropolitan edge markets and we believe supply and demand are generally in balance as steve will mention sales cycles are a bit longer due to other distractions for certain scale customers but our sales funnel continues to be at a high level relative to our history turning to our property development we executed pre leases for some of la3 phase two during the third quarter and we completed construction of phase two in october la3 phase one is now 93 leased less than 12 months after placing the project into service reflecting the strength of our position in the los angeles market and continued solid sales activity ny2 phase 4a a four megawatt computer room also remains on track for a q1 2022 delivery and we continue to make good progress on the remaining pre construction activities to bring sv9 to a shovel ready state completing demolition of the existing building and working with silicon valley power to finalize power procurement by the end of the year we are fortunate to have very strong customer ecosystems on our uniquely positioned network and cloud enabled campuses which drive diverse demand with good margins and attractive returns reflecting the value customers can achieve in our environment our very capable team continues to add to our campuses

interoperability among customers with that i will turn the call over to steve steven smith chief revenue officer thanks paul and hello everyone i ll review our sales results and then talk about some notable wins to begin we had new and expansion sales of 8 9 million of annualized gaap rent comprised of 7 2 million signed during the third quarter and a 1 7 million large scale lease at sv7 signed on october 7 we believe including the 1 7 million lease signed in early october for purposes of our discussion today is instructive given the size and that this customer lease is backfilling a portion of the churn at sv7 which we have previously disclosed the leasing metrics discussed in the rest of my prepared remarks are inclusive of the 1 7 million lease signed on october 7 keep in mind our reported new and expansion sales results only include the rental revenue component of the new leases the 8 9 million of gaap rent for new and expansion sales reflected 62 000 net rentable square feet at an average annualized gaap rate of 143 per net rentable square foot which was lower than the trailing 12 month average due to lower than average densities for certain scale deployments our results also included 28 new logos or 1 9 million in annualized gaap rent our best quarter for new logos in terms of annualized gaap rent since the third quarter of 2019 i will review a few specific new logo use cases in a moment the 8 9 million of gaap rent also includes the number of leases that signed at sv7 which represents approximately 2 9 million of annualized gaap rent turning to pricing new and expansion pricing on a kilowatt basis this quarter was above the trailing 12 month average by mid single digits reflecting the mix of both size and location of leases signed from a geographic perspective our strongest markets for signed leases for los angeles silicon valley and northern virginia which combined represented 88 of our annualized gaap rent signed looking at organic growth existing customers continue to provide strong demand which is an essential part of our strategy existing customer expansions accounted for 78 of annualized gaap rents signed as more businesses adopt digital solutions to meet today s evolving marketplace noteworthy expansion from existing customers included a scale deployment from a global online gaming platform expanding this footprint into our los angeles campus a multimarket expansion by a network service provider in los angeles new york and northern virginia and a large scale deployment from a subscription based digital content streaming company in the bay area turning to new customer wins the 1 9 million of annualized gaap rent represents approximately 22 of our sales as i mentioned it was our best quarter for new logo sales since the third quarter of 2019 successfully attracting high quality new customers that value the interoperability of our portfolio ecosystem deepens coresite s competitive moat and helps drive future growth enterprises contributed to 55 of new logo annualized gaap rent signed during the quarter which included a leading data management and storage systems company in the bay area an email and social networking and marketing firm in northern virginia a cybersecurity company providing prevention and detection solutions signing to scale deployment in the bay area and a well known domain registrar and web hosting company joining our robust los angeles customer community lastly total data center occupancy decreased slightly this quarter primarily due to the previously forecasted single tenant lease expiration at sv7 which was also included in our third quarter churn with the majority of this customer s lease expiration now behind us we have a clear path toward our targeted occupancy goal in the high 80s range as we finish out the year we are encouraged by our solid execution of our core business however we have noticed slower processing and response times for certain customers seemingly distracted by other issues such as supply chains and staffing of which we are all aware we have specifically revised practices to improve the process and timing of assisting certain scale customers and keeping leasing on track as demand for high performance edge use cases in strategic metropolitan markets continues to grow our diligence and discipline in attracting and winning deployment that value or add value to our ecosystem remains the primary focus we are driven to provide continued profitable growth by attracting high quality new logos and delivering incremental value to our customers and shareholders through higher value lease up across our portfolio with that i will turn the call over to jeff jeff finnin chief financial officer thanks steve today i will review our third quarter and year to date results discuss our balance sheet liquidity and leverage and then touch on our 2021 capital expenditures guidance looking at our financial results for the quarter operating revenues were 163 9 million an increase of 6 4 year over year lease renewals of 18 7 million of annualized gaap rent were completed during the quarter resulting in cash rent mark to market of 2 and gaap mark to market of 5 7 we also reported churn of 2 5 for the quarter which was in line with our expectations and includes 160 basis points of churn related to the single tenant lease at sv7 commencement of new and expansion leases of 7 1 million of annualized gaap rent our revenue backlog consists of 9 9 million of annualized gaap rent or 17 2 million on a cash basis for leases signed but not yet commenced inclusive of the 1 7 million scale lease signed at sv7 on october 7 we expect approximately 60 of the gaap backlog to commence in the fourth quarter of 2021 and substantially all of the remaining gaap backlog to commence during the first quarter of 2022 adjusted ebitda was 85 7 million for the quarter an increase of 5 2 year over year net income was 0 50 per diluted share for the quarter consistent year over year and third quarter ffo per share was 1 39 an increase of 0 06 or 4 5 year over year turning to our financial results year to date total operating revenues were 483 6 million reflecting year over year growth of 7 adjusted ebitda of 259 1 million increasing 7 2 year over year and representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 53 6 and ffo per share as adjusted of 4 20 increased 5 8 year over year each of the above items are in line with our goal to achieve mid to high single digit growth levels moving to our balance sheet our debt to annualized adjusted ebitda increased to 5 2 times as of september 30 as expected inclusive of the current gaap backlog mentioned earlier our leverage ratio was 5 1 times we ended the quarter with approximately 235 4 million of liquidity providing us the ability to fully fund the remainder of our 2021 business plan looking at our 2021 capital expenditures guidance we have spent about 103 million year to date compared to the midpoint of our guidance at 205 million in total capital expenditures for 2021 we are continuing to work through the remaining preconstruction activities at sv9 and we anticipate breaking ground sometime in 2022 but timing is ultimately dependent on overall absorption in the bay area as a result we now expect to invest approximately 140 million to 150 million in total capital expenditures in 2021 which is reflected in our updated capital expenditure guidance refer to page 21 of our supplemental for our full 2021 guidance as it relates to 2022 we will provide detailed annual guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call in early february in closing with the majority of the sv7 single tenant lease expiration now behind us we have more visibility into increasing our occupancies which will achieve even greater flow through of revenue growth to margins leading to margin expansion and value creation for shareholders with that operator we would now like to open the call for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of jon atkin with rbc capital markets jon atkin rbc capital markets analyst thank you so i had a couple of questions the pricing on new leases signed it looks like it was at a multiyear low and that doesn t include obviously the impact of what you did in october which was a resigning a second generation space so given that dynamic around backfill at sv7 and then what you posted on pricing during 3q anything to kind of expect going forward around pricing steven smith chief revenue officer jon it s steve yes i think overall as far as pricing is concerned on a square footage basis it was down a bit this quarter primarily just due to lower than average densities so we have fluctuations in density based off the sales mix every quarter but collectively pricing remains strong and i think you see that as if you look at it on a per kilowatt basis that reflects that jon atkin rbc capital markets analyst and would that include tech and generation space as well or could that drag down some of the recent trends that you ve seen on a kind of per kw basis steven smith chief revenue officer i think that holds true overall jon atkin rbc capital markets analyst and then go ahead paul szurek president and chief executive officer jon and jon this jon sorry would just point you back to steve s comments in his prepared remarks about power pricing being actually higher than prior on a per kilowatt basis than our pricing on a per kilowatt basis being higher than prior quarters jon atkin rbc capital markets analyst got it and then i wondered if there was any trends that you re seeing in the federal vertical whether it s government agencies or sis doing work for federal agencies and i think if you ve had some success with that in the past anything around general demand that you are seeing and that you potentially benefit from steven smith chief revenue officer yes we are seeing more pipeline growth there which is encouraging to see and we have had some success there in the past i would like to see more and i think there s a good opportunity to improve our results there so it s good to see the pipeline improve there and we think that s a good opportunity jon atkin rbc capital markets analyst and then lastly on the new logo generation what are you seeing around cross connect s take up rates within how do you relogos and some of the use cases that you mentioned steven smith chief revenue officer sure well as i mentioned this is one of our best quarters as far as overall revenue is concerned and that s a big focus of my team and our marketing messaging and so forth is to ensure that enterprises and new logos see the value in coresite and the uniqueness it brings to helping them navigate the hybrid multi cloud environment that s out there we feel like we ve got a very unique value proposition and the amount of networks and native on ramps to those cloud providers that very few other providers have and our messaging and our sales objectives are really to ensure that we attract and win more new logos as they become the basis for the overall growth of the company which you saw in our typical results jon atkin rbc capital markets analyst and then lastly i wondered if you could give us a view on m a and to what extent you feel like it might make sense at some point to become part of a larger platform whether that s you acquire in somebody or the other way around paul szurek president and chief executive officer as we ve said many many times in the past we have looked at many acquisitions and we they have to fit from the or potential acquisitions they have to fit from the standpoint of strategy pricing value creation and our particular model and we don t expect any change in that kind of surveillance as to the rest of your question as we ve also said frequently our policy is not to comment on any sort of speculation around that type of activity jon atkin rbc capital markets analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of frank louthan with raymond james frank louthan raymond james analyst great thank you are you seeing any impact from inflation on the current leasing negotiations how do you think that will work and then can you give us a little bit more detail on some of the contractual obligations you ve got with some of your facilities in terms of suppliers or the length of those terms and how well protected you are now steven smith chief revenue officer yes i think from a leasing perspective i can give you that side of it frank it s definitely an interesting world out there for sure i don t think it s necessarily impacted the leasing dynamic per se it does increase our the importance of working closely with our vendors and how we coordinate not just the colocation aspect but there s a lot of different moving parts to get customers deployed whether it s servers cage material and whatever it might be to actually deploy that so we ve implemented additional measures with all of our teams to ensure that we re ahead of that we re planning for any changes in pricing or supply chain and that kind of thing and navigating that as closely as possible jeff finnin chief financial officer frank maybe i can just give you some additional color on the some of those additional obligations i would look at it from really two perspectives one being the development side which we ve substantially locked in all the development we re doing today just given when we started those projects so we don t see any inflationary pressures on what we ve got under development today most of that was ordered well before we started development there but on the operating perspective we do look at and go out to contractually lock in some of those operating costs usually out in periods of two to three years and we generally roll those depending upon the type of service some of those are up and we re in midst of bidding for some of that tier over the next couple of years and then some have a couple of years before they roll off my hats off to our vendors they ve stayed with their contractual obligations on those obligations even though we know they re getting some pressures and we ll just have to monitor and see how this next round of contractual obligations go with what we ve got out in the market today we ll know those results probably over the next two to four months frank louthan raymond james analyst all right great thank you and maybe i missed this but did you guys discuss what your exposure is on power and what power costs and whether you re hedged on that jeff finnin chief financial officer yes frank no we didn t touch on that yet just to give you some idea when you look at our power utilization across our portfolio we have about 30 of our power use that occurs inside our deregulated markets i point you to that because that s the area that near term where we probably see the most impact when you look at and factor in ultimately what s in those deregulated markets how much of that is really subject to cost increases it s really our breakered power model which certain mostly our retail customers pay us a fixed price and that s probably where we ve got the most exposure when you go through the amounts there we ve got about if you assume about a 10 increase in power cost in those markets it would have an impact of about 0 02 per share assuming you don t pass any of those costs on to our customers we do look at that on an annual basis and assess how much of that we re going to pass on to our customers we do have that right inside our contractual rights and licenses with our customers frank louthan raymond james analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of sami badri with credit suisse sami badri credit suisse analyst hi thank you very much for taking the questions around this time of every year jeff and paul you ve historically given us some kind of color on what the capex trajectory looks like in the following year could you give us an idea on what that looks like just because your capex guidance is moving around now and i have a follow up jeff finnin chief financial officer yes you bet sami i think you probably saw the notes and heard the commentary on the prepared remarks around the timing around sv9 and its impact on our 2021 capex as you think about 2022 we ll obviously give detailed guidance in early february here s how i would think about it when you look at us over the past few years we historically have had somewhere around 200 million of capex in those years when we re building out inside existing core shell so without including any type of ground up development and so i would think about 2022 in the range of 200 million and then it could be elevated when and if we start development that ground up development at sv9 and as we said in our prepared remarks that s going to be dependent on overall market absorption and as paul alluded to finalizing our agreements with silicon valley power but that s the way i think about it 200 million and then probably elevated from there as and when we start development on sv9 sami badri credit suisse analyst got it thank you now i do have a follow up i will just look it up online so you could just give it to the next analyst thank you jeff finnin chief financial officer no problem sami get back in the queue when you can operator our next question comes from the line of erik rasmussen with stifel erik rasmussen analyst stifel yes thank you for taking the questions just circling back on the comment you made about customers with slower response times in response to the supply chains just trying to is this just for scale or is this enterprise or is this all customers that you re talking about and is this sort of the big the main reason why we haven t seen much scale business beyond sort of this early q4 deal that you booked at sv7 steven smith chief revenue officer yes i would say it becomes more magnified with the size of the deal just because the amount of the moving parts that are going on there right so it definitely becomes more complicated but i would say overall as far as the scale pipeline is concerned in our overall pipeline we have confidence in where it sits today and the opportunities that it presents for us going forward some of these larger deals do take more time and have more components as i mentioned and if you think about the deal that we announced in this earnings call that had a lot of moving parts to it that we had to work very closely with the customer in order to get it across the line but i think the important factor to stay focused on is our main goal which is maintaining and achieving mid to high single digit ffo growth which is not just driven from top line revenue but more by pricing interconnection and power margins that we remain focused on so that s the main thing i think to say focused around erik rasmussen analyst stifel great and maybe just follow up on that and this speaks to sort of the lack of scale deals we ve seen but you had the 40 million leasing guidepost for the year i think year to date you re around 24 million based on where we sit today how realistic is it as you sort of look to close the gap on this or timing of this in these large scale deals are so lumpy that maybe it s just we think sort of slide into next year and maybe there s a better setup for even next year steven smith chief revenue officer well we re absolutely striving to hit it and as i mentioned we re opportunistically encouraged by our funnel and i think that has an opportunity to get us there at the same time those are large deals that swing that number pretty significantly i mean if you look at our core business we performed very well in that regard which does drive the majority of our ffo growth so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we re trying to remain disciplined and diligent around how we ensure we re driving returns for our shareholders at the same time not sacrificing top line growth to do that so it s a balance and we ve got good opportunity to achieve both and we strive to do that erik rasmussen analyst stifel great thanks operator our next question comes from the line of richard choe with jpmorgan richard choe jpmorgan analyst hi i just wanted to follow up on the new logos and the signings you said they are lower density but will that change over time as those customers mature and how what can you remind us what the kind of normal process you see with signing new customers and how they take more space and power over time steven smith chief revenue officer yes i think as far as new logos are concerned i don t think we re saying that the new logos in themselves were lower density i think overall the bookings were of lower density i m not sure if we have the exact numbers on the density of the new logos at this point where we can get to that but overall i would say collectively densities continue to increase slightly as customers become more efficient and hardware becomes more efficient so i think collectively you just got to look at the trend line one of the benefits of how we re structured and engineering our data centers is to really manage that overall collective density across the portfolio so you ll have some deployments that are lower dense some that are higher dense but our design allows us to accommodate that to ultimately meet the desired impact jeff finnin chief financial officer richard the only thing i d add on the second part of your question typically when customers deploy and their subsequent growth inside our portfolio i would tell you that for our retail customers once they deploy they will probably get to a stabilized power draw and cross connect utilization call it within 12 months assuming they don t take additional space and power from us on the scale of customers it takes them a little bit longer i would point you probably somewhere between 12 to 24 months as they ramp up and deploy their gear and so much of what you see from some of those scale customers over that period of time is increases in the power consumption and utilization and then they re continuing to connect on the interconnection side to those parties that they need to exchange and do business with again that for the larger ones takes about a 12 to 24 month time frame before we see them start to stabilize richard choe jpmorgan analyst great and the same store mrr per cabinet increased 5 year over year and that s accelerating can you give us a sense of what s going on there and can it continue to grow at this rate jeff finnin chief financial officer yes richard i mean that is a reflection on very consistent with what i was stating on customers getting deployed and what you re really seeing drive i think paul commented on that is really increases in our power revenue and increases in interconnection revenue those are really the two components driving that at least in the third quarter at 5 on average we generally see that mrr per cab e grow somewhere in the low to mid single digit growth rates and i think that s where in large part we expect it to be on a go forward basis and it just depends on how quickly we see that based on customer installs and overall utilization of their space and deployments richard choe jpmorgan analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of david guarino with green street advisors david guarino green street advisors analyst okay thanks maybe for paul a number of your public and private payers have seen really good success outside the u s so i was wondering if you could just remind us for the reasons like coresite wouldn t want to bring with a pretty strong reputation and strong knowledge base outside the u s paul szurek president and chief executive officer well i wouldn t rule it out forever but we ve had plenty of good things to focus on here and quite honestly just building a better model and stronger campus ecosystems and perfecting the playbook that we can take elsewhere i think a lot of what you ve seen and i haven t i don t have a detailed view into it as you probably do but much of that has been hyperscale and as you know that s just not our bread and butter but we do believe that down the road maybe there s an opportunity to expand to additional markets domestically or maybe abroad with the mousetrap that we re building especially the improved connectivity products that we ve been implementing over the last two years to make connective interconnection more scalable more flexible more dynamic more diverse and more automated for customers and therefore avoid the need for them to have extensive network engineering expertise within their own with their own systems within their own companies and pairing that up with these very dense customer ecosystems with that are dense with cloud on ramps networks and diverse enterprises so it s a good playbook it s a good program and we ve gotten a lot better at it over the last few years david guarino green street advisors analyst okay that s good to hear the company is open minded looking at outside the u s and maybe just one unrelated follow up i wanted to ask about the stabilized yield targets you guys are still holding to that 12 to 16 even with the lower asking rents per square foot this quarter so are these still realistic return hurdles or do you think there might be some downside risk to the midpoint in the near future paul szurek president and chief executive officer so let me take a stab at that and then jeff can jump in if he needs to but it s important not to focus on a single variable like price per square foot because as steve explained that will move around quarter to quarter based upon the density and locations of our sales mix each quarter on a per kilowatt basis we re still seeing the same and even slightly stronger pricing and meanwhile we continue to see good margin increments from these deployments and use cases that drive additional margin from power from interconnection and even from a lesser amount of other services so between all of that we haven t felt the need to change our guidance on what our return on invested capital will be and i know some of your peers track that and they see how we continue to do relative to the rest of the industry but i want you to remember that it s roic achievement is a derivative of the main focus which is providing value to customers and the best way to provide value to customers is to create these campus ecosystems in the right markets where companies need to interoperate and where the most important data use cases for the future are likely to take place and that makes them more magnetic more sticky and more sustainable in terms of growth relative to other ways to deploy capital jeff finnin chief financial officer david the only thing i d add to what paul said is i d just point you to our most recent experience with our most recent stabilized investment which is sv8 at some point during earlier this year that asset hit stabilization which as you know we define in excess of 93 occupancy the returns we saw at that point in time were just shy of that minimum so somewhere in that mid 11 percentile and also as i was explaining earlier it s still going to take another period of several quarters here before some of those customers stabilize their ultimate architecture and therefore deployments where they ll draw some additional power and cross connects we anticipate getting above that threshold on that asset here in the near future but that gives us the most recent data set so i think it s still hitting our underwriting now we have two others that we ve invested in obviously la3 which is in currently is up and then probably the most recent one before that is va3 and we ll see how we do on those two but we re optimistic we hit those thresholds time will tell whether or not that needs to be modified down the road but based on the recent history we re still comfortable with those thresholds david guarino green street advisors analyst thanks for the color jeff that s really helpful i mean given you guys don t have property level disclosure anymore it s harder for marci to figure that out but to the extent you can provide some anecdotes like that that s really helpful jeff finnin chief financial officer always happy to help david operator our next question comes from the line of jordan sadler with keybanc capital markets jordan sadler analyst keybanc capital markets thanks i wanted to come back to the capex reduction for this year i think what you said was that essentially due to the slower leasing pace presumably at sv7 essentially you re slow walking the development of sv9 so just a function of market conditions there and sort of execution there is that summarize that correctly paul szurek president and chief executive officer no jordan the development schedule on sv9 and i m glad you asked the question because i do want to clarify that is driven by more by the timing of permitting and especially now the last important pole in the tent is securing power from silicon valley power which we expect to achieve by the end of this year we ve done a significant amount of preconstruction work already including demolition of the existing building all the off site work for connectivity and utilities all of the design and everything and we have some decision points that we have going forward as to the other things we can do to shorten the put once we aggressively go vertical but now we don t need the capacity immediately but we ve got about seven to eight megawatts available in silicon valley and we ve been absorbing about five to six megawatts per year so that probably gives you some indication of what our decision trees look like but we re not going to do anything obviously of significant magnitude until we finish the power procurement process jordan sadler analyst keybanc capital markets but even and what s the timeline to finish that paul paul szurek president and chief executive officer the power procurement process jordan sadler analyst keybanc capital markets yes paul szurek president and chief executive officer as i i think i said earlier i apologize if i wasn t clear we expect that to be done by the end of this year and understand it s a process where you have to get agreement with the power company which we have in principle and then it has to go to city council for approval and then we can execute contracts forward jordan sadler analyst keybanc capital markets and so all that is planned or construction or essentially you would rather wait until some of seven to eight megawatts are more fully leased paul szurek president and chief executive officer jordan i think jordan sadler analyst keybanc capital markets how much do you want to have in place paul szurek president and chief executive officer i mean honestly it s it really depends on what the funnel looks like what preconstruction leasing negotiations look like i can t give you a definitive formula right now that s based solely on absorption jordan sadler analyst keybanc capital markets okay and so but the short answer is you won t necessarily start construction right away in 2022 if all goes according to plan with svp paul szurek president and chief executive officer not necessarily but that could but it s also possible that we do jordan sadler analyst keybanc capital markets okay and then on the power exposure jeff the that was helpful a couple of pennies exposure but could you maybe i know it s 30 of power uses in deregulated markets what is sort of what percent is hedged in your deregulated markets jeff finnin chief financial officer yes no great question jordan i should have included that in there our policy generally is to try and hedge about 50 of that power use in those markets to give us some idea of balance and we usually go out two to three years jordan sadler analyst keybanc capital markets and then what s the policy on passing through power increases how does that happen mechanically in your contracts jeff finnin chief financial officer so really look at it from two components one certain of our customers about 45 of our portfoliowide revenue is on a metered basis so those are just pure pass through irrespective of what s happening right so those customers just pay those costs the other 55 that s more on a breakered model some of which is in our deregulated obviously some of it is in our regulated markets generally we have the ability to pass through those costs to those customers from a practical perspective we ve looked at it on an annual basis because you just haven t seen power rates increase that significantly that quickly to where we d have to do it more regular than that if you start to see power price increases spike significantly in a short amount of time it would probably necessitate us looking at that a little bit more timely than on an annual basis but generally we look at that late in the year like as we re talking today and then put the process in place to address that early so that it s in place for early the next fiscal year jordan sadler analyst keybanc capital markets okay thanks for the color jeff finnin chief financial officer you bet operator our next question comes from the line of colby synesael with cowen colby synesael cowen analyst great maybe just a follow up on those last questions how much have you seen your power costs go up in those deregulated markets maybe year to date as you had mentioned i guess for every 10 increase it would be a 0 02 impact and then secondly the stock is down today i presume it s mostly associated with the leasing number really when you frame it against the 40 million number that you had initially stated in terms of the guidance for this year i know you ve kind of taken that down a little bit or softened up a little bit but i think that there is still an expectation that we d see stronger demand whether it was in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter in part based on what you said and also taking into consideration that i think it s also perceived that silicon valley is a strong market and it shouldn t and not to be little the ability and how hard it is to get it i mean it shouldn t be that hard to get that done just given what was perceived to be strong demand are you being just too picky in terms of the pricing you re looking for is there something else there and i guess to that point i mean are you expecting the fourth quarter to be your strongest leasing quarter excluding the 1 7 million deal you just did thank you jeff finnin chief financial officer colby i ll start and address your first question and then i ll pass it over to steve in terms of what we ve seen so far in 2021 for power rate increases in those deregulated markets it hasn t been all that significant i d say depending on the market somewhere around 3 to 6 what we are seeing going forward in 2022 obviously it s a lot of anticipation and that s where we re continuing to watch closely you re starting to see future is somewhere around 5 to 10 depending on the market it remains to be seen if that ultimately materializes but it is something we re watching and as i said earlier we generally try to hedge roughly 50 of that exposure two to three years out but that gives you some perspective of what we re seeing to date steve steven smith chief revenue officer yes yes as far as the 40 million is concerned colby we are striving to hit that as i mentioned earlier and the pipeline is encouraging there s some good opportunities for us in there and i think if you look at our core sales year to date they re strong in our core business and to your point what is not there as of yet anyway is really hyperscale i mean that is really the difference in where you ve seen some of those elevated results in prior years versus where we are this year which are really binary in whether or not they happen to get to your question around fourth quarter i probably can t comment necessarily around fourth quarter results obviously but we do have a strong pipeline we re encouraged with where things are headed and we re striving every day to hit that 40 million colby synesael cowen analyst i mean presumably if you re still you re not talking down the 40 million which unless i m misunderstanding you re not i mean almost by definition the fourth quarter should be the strongest quarter relative to the previous three is that am i misunderstanding steven smith chief revenue officer well i think the math is right that if we were to meet 40 million that would be the strongest quarter whether or not we can get there as i mentioned it s there s a lot of larger deals that can and could happen but they are binary and whether or not they do happen and whether or not they meet the parameters as i mentioned earlier it s not just chasing top line bookings that we re after and maybe you could call it being too picky but if you look at the returns on invested capital that paul talked about earlier and how we re driving the ecosystem it s really about striking that balance between top line bookings and overall profitability which includes not just rate which typically can go down on those hyperscale deals but also interconnection and power margin which typically is less on a per square foot and per kilowatt basis as you get bigger opportunities so it s a matter of managing pace with volume and pricing and all those kind of things and so we re trying to do the best we can to thread that needle colby synesael cowen analyst the one real quick follow up on that are those deals that you haven t logged since yet have you seen any of them going to competitors or is it more a function of they just haven t signed with anyone yet steven smith chief revenue officer in some cases both a lot of the pipeline frankly as i mentioned earlier is just taking longer it s a complex world out there as you look around there s a lot of impacts in a lot of different industries and the complexity around this just takes longer and we ll see where they play out i mean it s a competitive landscape as well so we ve lost opportunities there s no question about it if we were winning every opportunity then i would say we re probably being too aggressive on pricing but we look to balance that every day and try to make sure that we re driving the most value to our shareholders and i m giving you an ultimate outcome colby synesael cowen analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brendan lynch with barclays brendan lynch barclays analyst great thanks for taking my question first just a follow up on sv7 it looks like you guys had some retail and small scale demand in the third quarter prior to the large scale lease in october do you have a preferred mix going forward i know there was some back and forth on how you re looking to fill that capacity and in terms of the large scale lease are you reserving any additional space so that they can expand if they choose to do so steven smith chief revenue officer yes i guess as far as overall sv7 is concerned we did see some good leasing i think i mentioned we had 2 9 million of leasing at sv7 so that continues to be a good opportunity for us and as we repurpose the single tenant space to multi tenant we ve seen good lease up there as well so as you look at that and the diversity that it provides as far as hedging any large churn event we like the idea of that and balancing that with how fast we lease that up as i mentioned just talking with colby trying to balance the pricing versus the size of the opportunity versus the pipeline and making sure that we get maximum utilization out of every floor and every data center is what it s all about so that s just kind of an overall approach i guess as it relates to reserving space for customers in some cases there s contractual obligations but very few that we have out there and typically it s a first come first serve and we re looking to maximize the density in every floor brendan lynch barclays analyst great and just a follow up you clearly have some tech advantages and a lot of cloud on ramps so i wonder how the value proposition of those cloud on ramps is evolving with customers ability to bring the cloud directly into the cabinet or even on prem with the likes of an aws outpost or a similar product just having that availability right in the cabinet how does that change the value of the on ramp itself steven smith chief revenue officer awesome question and i d love to get more of those because we feel like that is a great value for why customers would want to deploy in our data center you mentioned outpost outpost is essentially a private cloud managed service that you can put into a data center that can be connected to aws or other high speed on ramps and how they interoperate together is where you get the real value out of those type of appliances but having it in a data center that is removed from those native on ramps makes it less rich than it otherwise would be and the performance is somewhat diminished so the perfect design around having an outpost architecture is to have a customer deployment that is also inclusive of an outpost or a vmc on dell type of environment that is then interconnected with an aws direct connect or a microsoft expressroute or maybe both where they can operate interactively and at very low latency to provide just the most seamless and high performance solution available it s where you start removing those things and separating them via ip networks and other remote type of interconnection that you start diminishing that performance so in order to get the best possible outcome out of those appliances you really need to be in a data center like ours brendan lynch barclays analyst great thanks for the color operator our next question comes from the line of michael rollins with citi michael rollins citi analyst thanks first question was if i think back you used to provide a chart and it would share your inventory in each major market your absorption and extrapolate the years or months of inventory that you had on hand and i was just curious if you could provide an update overall in the portfolio where you see that relationship and maybe for some of the major markets where that relationship is and where there could be some risks of bottlenecks or constraints and then just separately i want to go back to a question that you discussed it at a high level before and that s segmenting retail versus scale performance and just curious internally are you just spending more time thinking through what that retail revenue growth rate is versus the scale growth rate and the total portfolio grew about 6 year over year what would be the differential in terms of how much better was retail versus slower for scale thank you jeff finnin chief financial officer michael let me start off with your question on the inventory and then i ll hand it off to steve around the retail versus scale i ll come back to your last question so when you look at the portfolio today from an aggregate basis i think we ve got 32 megawatts of capacity that is built and ready for moving we ve got another 10 megawatts that s under construction that those two components one in l a and one in new york if you look at our overall gross absorption i m going to give you some high level numbers this isn t don t take these as black and white every year but high level we lease somewhere around 25 megawatts per year on a gross basis with churn your net absorption is going to be somewhere around 18 to 21 18 to 22 megawatts per year that gives you some idea from a portfolio perspective when you look at the call it 42 megawatts where is it today and the relevance to that is obviously it s going to be in our top five markets so you got about seven to eight megawatts in both the bay area and in chicago that we have for lease up to date you ve got another four or five megawatts some of which is in los angeles and then the other market of new york am i accurate there or steven smith chief revenue officer virginia jeff finnin chief financial officer virginia i m sorry new york and then virginia so call it four to five megawatts there and then you ve got about three megawatts in new york so you look at the top five markets that gives you an idea of where that capacity is and that capacity is important as paul alluded to when he was addressing the question around the bay area and overall what is that annual absorption and as we keep talking about hitting these high 80 percentile occupancy that s key from our perspective to ensure you ve got the available capacity to meet market needs and ensuring you don t have too much capacity that we ve invested capital and that s just not earning us a good return and won t be for some period of time so that s the balance we re trying to strike but hopefully that gives you a little bit more color around the inventory steven smith chief revenue officer yes related to i m sorry go ahead okay right mike as it relates to retail and scale i think it s important to look at those as it relates to especially as you move up the size to hyperscale and large scale because as i mentioned we typically get better pricing we get more interconnection per square foot and it also gives us more diversity across our base collectively as you look at our performance over time retail has remained very consistent and we continue to get more results out of kind of the scale environment and while size is important and we need to manage that it s also important to look at the customers that are actually deploying behind that and looking at really kind of that mid to large enterprise that is really kind of rolling out of their legacy data centers refreshing their it infrastructure adopting a hybrid multi cloud environment and those are the customers that we re looking to target and the ones that we re actually winning so those deployments that can be very large customers that may come in in a retail environment but then grow to a scale or even large scale environment over time as they complete that migration over time so we look at the overall mix because it does drive profitability in the short term but we also look at the growth opportunity long term and where that is likely to show up and that s where we re targeted paul szurek president and chief executive officer and mike just to remind you that 70 to 80 of our leasing is this organic growth of these primarily retail and smaller scale customers that continue to grow michael rollins citi analyst and if i could just follow up with one other question there was a comment that was made i think it was a couple of times on this call and there is a connection between the exiting of the single tenant lease in sv7 and visibility into increasing occupancy given you knew the inventory was coming up can you just help frame like what was important about connecting those two things together about improving the visibility for future leasing or is it just now that they re gone you re closer to adding tenants back into and just kind of curious steven smith chief revenue officer yes i think well if nothing else hopefully it provides clarity and visibility for these calls because i know we ve got a lot of discussion around churn and what s churning and is at sv7 churning so hopefully that s behind us which i think is where a lot of those comments came from we ve been working actively to profitably lease up that floor over time and i think as we sit here today we re about 20 through that lease up so and a good pipeline that s behind it so we ll continue to do that jeff finnin chief financial officer and then let me just again i think what you re alluding to is what we said earlier in the call about five to six megawatts of absorption for us in santa clara silicon valley over recent years the sv7 space is just part of our available leasable capacity because of the tenant that s now gone it received a lot of attention but the five to six megawatts per year of absorption in ways that strengthen our ecosystem is probably the right way to look at that market and our capacity in that market michael rollins citi analyst thanks i appreciate the help with that thank you jeff finnin chief financial officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from the line of nick del deo with moffettnathanson michael srour moffettnathanson analyst this is michael srour on for nick thank you for taking my questions there s been some optimism regarding the prospects for higher pricing from hyperscale focused vendors maybe just talking their books are you seeing anything to suggest that and if so might it open up new scale opportunities in northern virginia and how would you characterize the gap between market and what you re looking for as it relates to scale pricing in that market paul szurek president and chief executive officer i think there s been firming of pricing over the last couple of years it hasn t declined like it did three four years ago maybe it s come up a little bit but not discernibly and thank you for this question because i guess we haven t really made it clear there s quite a big leap between the pricing and the ecosystem value and all these incremental revenues that we get from the deployments that we re focused on compared to what is available with the undifferentiated hyperscale in these markets and it s not just about getting the right returns it s about building the right ecosystems and frankly future proofing your ecosystems and your leasing significantly relative to churn and other events i mean in our past history our unpleasant churn related to undifferentiated hyperscale type activities so yes maybe it takes a couple of quarters or less sometimes but sometimes around that time to get to the right levels but meanwhile you re making up for it with better margins and incremental revenue and building a much more valuable campus ecosystem for the long term does that make sense michael srour moffettnathanson analyst yes yes that definitely makes sense one follow up unrelated if i may you increased your tenant improvement and recurring capex forecast can you talk about the reasons there jeff finnin chief financial officer yes michael two things on the tis a majority of our tenant improvement costs really come from the building out the customer deployments as we re getting those customers deployed and ready and set up for their gear so that s just a factor of the volume of infrastructure needed for those customer deployments nothing unusual there to be honest it s just some of those take a little bit higher cost upfront depending on complexity and the power needs as it relates to the recurring capex really two things going on we have as you know we were building out this chiller plant in boston earlier this year some of those dollars ultimately came in the final parts of it came into q3 and so some of that s impacting those numbers and then secondly we accelerated some recurring capex from future periods into the third quarter as we were looking around trying to take care of a few areas that needed to be addressed and so that s really what elevated that a little bit this year as you think about q4 and more importantly even 2022 we would expect our recurring capex to come back down to those levels that we ve seen historically which over the past 10 to 20 years has been 2 to 4 of revenue and that s what we expect to see this year was unusual just given the investment we made with very good returns on that boston chiller facility steven smith chief revenue officer and the office lease facility jeff finnin chief financial officer the office build out that we did in the bay area michael srour moffettnathanson analyst got it great thank you jeff finnin chief financial officer you bet operator our final question this morning comes from the line of dave rodgers with baird dave rodgers baird analyst yes good morning out there thanks for taking the time jeff just a couple of questions for you i wanted to cover a couple of things you said earlier to make sure i didn t miss them i think you said you had about 235 million of availability and i think you said something about 40 million of capex probably in the fourth quarter and 200 million next year for development and outlays is that what you did say i don t want to put words in your mouth jeff finnin chief financial officer no problem you re right we ve got about 235 million of liquidity and if you look at the midpoint of the capex guidance we gave for this year it d be about an incremental 40 million for 2021 and high level what we gave for 2022 as you think about us obviously excluding sv9 a regular year for us building out inside existing core sells around 200 million dave rodgers baird analyst so i guess i just wanted to follow that thought up with the idea if you re going to kind of tap into that the remaining availability as you look out over the next say 15 months or so at your current leasing pace you re probably adding another 80 million of availability i guess the question there is with the 300 million development like sv9 sitting out there using up most of the remaining availability and getting really thin on what s left what is your view on how thin on availability you re willing to go and leverage specifically and when you look to kind of raise some equity either through asset sales joint venture or straight up equity to kind of privy some cushion ahead of sv9 jeff finnin chief financial officer yes well i think high level from a leverage perspective dave we re comfortable in those low ranges that we with those ranges we ve been talking about this year where we expect to be somewhere between 5 2 and 5 4 by the end of the year if you think about us 5 5 times leverage i think we re comfortable taking it to that level so that gives you some perspective from a leverage from a liquidity perspective i would tell you that any time we embark on a development we want to make sure we ve got complete liquidity to ensure that that development is built out in its entirety and so we re not going to embark on development until we ve got that liquidity to see it fully through so as a result of that we would anticipate needing some additional liquidity before we go vertical on sv9 and that s something we re thinking about and looking at options to ensure we solve for that prior to the time that will be needed dave rodgers baird analyst okay thanks jeff jeff finnin chief financial officer you bet operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session i ll turn the floor back to mr szurek for any final comments paul szurek president and chief executive officer thank you excellent questions as usual before we wrap up i d like to thank all my coresite colleagues i ve mentioned earlier in the call that they ve been working very hard the last few years to build a better

the billionaire tax proposal which appears to be scrubbed from president biden s domestic plan would leave tesla ceo elon musk with nearly 250 billion example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video with a personal fortune that is flirting with 300 billion the tesla ceo the richest person on earth has been attacking a democratic proposal to tax the assets of billionaires like him the idea behind the democratic plan is to use revenue from a billionaires tax to help pay for a domestic policy package being negotiated in congress that would among other things help combat climate change provide universal prekindergarten and expand health care programs the proposal wasn t included in president joe biden s framework for the domestic policy package released thursday though that deal among congressional democrats isn t final musk who recently blew past amazon founder jeff bezos as the world no 1 in wealth thanks to tesla s soaring share price would be liable for perhaps a one time 50 billion tax hit under the democratic proposal that would leave him close to 250 billion remaining forget it he says my plan the spacex founder tweeted thursday about his fortune is to use the money to get humanity to mars and preserve the light of consciousness he may well get his wish with the proposal removed from the white house framework earlier this week musk argued the fundamental problem is that government spends too much money and he warned that the billionaire tax proposal could lead over time to tax hikes for more americans eventually he tweeted monday they run out of other people s money and then they come for you the democratic proposal unveiled wednesday by sen ron wyden would tax the gains of people with either 1 billion or more in assets or three consecutive years of income of 100 million or more at the capital gains tax rate of 20 and the 3 8 net investment income tax rate it would apply to fewer than an estimated 800 people who would have to pay tax on the value of tradable items like stocks even if they don t sell them under current law such assets are subject to tax only when they re sold supporters have said the tax could raise 200 billion over 10 years that could help fund biden s legislative priorities republicans are unified in opposition to the proposal and some have suggested it would be challenged in court the democrats proposal came against the backdrop of growing concerns about vast economic inequality with the wealth of many american multi billionaires having accelerated during the covid 19 pandemic thanks to increased stock and home equity even more than before the virus struck john catsimatidis the billionaire grocery chain and real estate magnate who owns gristedes condemned the proposal as something you would expect putin to do referring to president vladimir putin of russia the billionaire tax plan catsimatidis told the associated press is a little bit insane the american people have reached the point where they re saying enough is enough said catsimatidis who lost a bid for the republican nomination for new york city mayor in 2013 stop spending the money stupidly they come up with budgets that are stupid budgets and they want to make everybody else suffer for it do we need infrastructure catsimatidis added sure we need infrastructure do we need bridges to nowhere no we don t need those you re talking about the people that create the jobs he said of billionaires we can get up and go somewhere else leon cooperman the outspoken billionaire investor who has long denounced sen elizabeth warren s own proposal for a wealth tax has added his voice to the exasperation coming from some of the uber wealthy in an interview with the daily beast cooperman said of the tax i doubt it s legal and it s stupid what made america great he said was the people who started with nothing like me making a lot of money and giving it back a relentless attack on wealthy people makes no sense not every billionaire shares such outrage a spokesperson for george soros the investor and liberal philanthropist told the ap that soros is supportive of the proposed billionaires tax and while warren buffett has yet to comment publicly on the proposal the billionaire head of berkshire hathaway has long called for higher taxes on the ultra wealthy like himself bob lord a tax lawyer and associate fellow at the progressive think tank institute for policy studies said that even if this particular proposal doesn t pass it does reflect how concerns about financial inequality are gathering momentum propublica reported in june that some of the richest americans have paid no income tax or nearly none in some years including musk who the report said paid zero income taxes in 2018 critics argue that musk s criticism of the billionaire tax proposal overlooks the fact that tesla s rise has been aided by government incentives and loans lord noted for example that the run up in tesla stock monday after a major order of teslas from hertz increased musk s wealth by roughly 37 billion more than what the irs collects in estate and gift tax revenue from the entire country in one year wyden s proposal lord suggested might need to close some loopholes but i think they ve done a pretty good job with it he said there are folks out there who are saying the billionaires will just put their money into non publicly traded assets but it s not going to be that easy it s a pretty well crafted bill such tax changes could also shift how billionaire philanthropists make donations brian mittendorf a professor of accounting at ohio state university said he believes that in the short term the billionaire proposal would lead some of the uber wealthy to rush philanthropic contributions into so called donor advised funds such funds would allow them to receive tax deductions up front without distributing any of the money donors can t get the money back from these funds if in fact this were to pass mittendorf said it creates huge incentives to donate some of these assets that have gone up in value before the tax hits ___

circumstances after the date of this conference call i would now like to turn the call over to joe margolis chief executive officer joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director thanks jeff and thank you everyone for joining today s call well we had an exciting quarter i m not sure how else to describe it among other accomplishments we celebrated the addition of store 2000 to our portfolio we were recognized by inside self storage as the best third party management company in the industry and we achieved some of the strongest operating results in our company s history same store occupancy once again reached a new all time high during the quarter at over 97 with vacates continuing at lower than historic levels our strong occupancy resulted in exceptional pricing power achieved rates to new customers in the quarter were 43 higher than 2020 levels and 41 greater than 2019 levels in addition to the benefit from new customer rates we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as state of emergency rate restrictions continued to be lifted throughout the country other income improved significantly year over year primarily due to increased late fees contributing 30 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter we had modestly higher discounts due to higher street rates but their impact was offset by lower bad debt these drivers produced same store revenue growth of 18 4 a 480 basis point acceleration from q2 and same store noi growth of 27 8 an acceleration of 760 basis points in addition our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same store pool resulting in ffo growth of 41 2 turning to external growth the acquisition market remains very active but expensive in our view our investment team has never been busier and we have found the most success acquiring lease up properties and or acquiring stores with the joint venture partner while most of our transactions have been in relatively small bites the total is adding up allowing us to increase our investment guidance to 700 million for the year also our approach has resulted in better than market average yields but we are much more focused on ffo per share accretion than total acquisition volume and we plan to continue to be selective in the current environment we continue to look at all material transactions in the market and we have plenty of capital to invest when we find opportunities that create long term value for our shareholders we had an incredibly strong quarter on the third party management front adding 96 stores our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties it is worth mentioning that oftentimes we are the buyer of these properties and they are simply moving from one ownership category to another in the quarter we purchased 11 of our managed stores in the reit or in a joint venture for a total of 30 stores purchased from our third party platform through september fundamentals have remained even stronger than our already positive outlook allowing us to raise our annual ffo guidance by 0 28 at the midpoint while we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation it has been less than our initial estimate of 300 basis points from this summer s peak our revised guidance now assumes a 200 basis point moderation which would result in 2021 year end occupancy generally similar to that of 2020 we expect continued strong growth in the fourth quarter to cap off what has been an incredible year for extra space storage i would now like to turn the time over to scott p scott stubbs executive vice president chief financial officer thanks joe and hello everyone as joe mentioned we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same store revenue growth driven by all time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers core ffo for the quarter was 1 85 per share a year over year increase of 41 2 property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees as a result of our strong ffo growth our board of directors raised our third quarter dividend an additional 25 after already raising it 11 earlier this year a total increase of 38 9 over the third quarter 2020 dividend we delivered a reduction in same store expenses in the quarter including a 3 savings in payroll 42 savings in marketing and a 4 decrease in property taxes due to some successful appeals despite the payroll savings we ve enjoyed this year like most companies we ve felt material wage pressure across all markets including our corporate office some of the payroll reduction has been the result of higher turnover and longer time to fill and longer time required to fill vacant positions we will experience continued payroll pressure in 2022 as we have raised wages to retain and recruit the best team in the storage industry this will also impact our g a expense in the second quarter we completed our inaugural investment grade public bond offering and we completed a successful second offering in the third quarter issuing another 600 million 10 year bond at a rate of 2 35 we also refiled our atm in the quarter and we have 800 million in availability our access to capital has never been stronger and between net operating income and disposition proceeds our leverage continues to be reduced our quarter end net debt to ebitda was 4 5 times giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities while maintaining our credit ratings last night we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions we raised our same store revenue range to 12 5 to 13 5 same store expense growth was reduced to negative 1 to 0 resulting in same store noi growth range of 18 to 19 5 these improvements in our same store expectations are due to better than expected rates higher occupancy and lower payroll and marketing expense we raised our full year core ffo range to be 6 75 to 6 85 per share due to stronger lease up performance we dropped our anticipated dilution from value add acquisitions and c of o stores from 0 12 to 0 11 even after adding a number of additional lease up properties to our acquisition pipeline we are excited by our strong performance year to date and the success of our team driving our growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio as we often say it s a great time to be in storage with that let s turn it over to joanna to start our q a questions and answers operator your first question is from juan sanabria of bmo capital markets your line is open juan carlos sanabria bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning given the strength in the that you ve had year to date and exceeding expectations just curious if you could speak to the earn in as we start to think about 22 if you assume kind of occupancy holds steady versus what you ve achieved year to date and or how you guys think about that joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director so it s always important to remember and we ve talked about this before that occupancy is just one metric so we if occupancy does better then what we ve assumed for our guidance i assume we d also have good rate pressure rate power and we would be set up to have a strong 2022 juan carlos sanabria bmo capital markets analyst but is there any way to estimate given the results you ve had to date and how much of the portfolio has had the rate increases and given average length of stay what s kind of locked in to start the year next year given the results to date joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director so i mean we ll certainly make all of those estimates and come up with guidance for 2022 and talk about that early in the first quarter next year juan carlos sanabria bmo capital markets analyst okay and then just a more strategic big picture question you guys talked about the acquisitions environment being very heavy at this point and prefer to do kind of singles or doubles and working with joint venture partners but given the scale you re now 2 000 stores any interest in pursuing development on balance sheet and building out the capabilities in house joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director so yes to the first part of that question we re not adverse sic to pursuing development on balance sheet we have a very small number of developments underway that we re committed to we believe for us and i know other companies executed it different way which makes sense for them the best way for us to do development is with joint venture partners where we can be the partner with the best local or regional developer who brings their particular local skills something that we don t have across the country and the other advantage that gives us is through structure we can allocate the specific risks of development entitlement risk cost risk delay risk completion risk fairly between the development partner and ours so we don t take all of those risks when those are frankly more in the development partner s control so we believe development is a great way to make money in any real estate business we believe if it s structured right you can control the risk and we believe it s very important to make sure you re in the right time in the market cycle to be heavy in the development business juan carlos sanabria bmo capital markets analyst thanks joe joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director thank you operator your next question is from michael goldsmith of ubs your line is open michael if you re on unmute please unmute your line is open michael goldsmith ubs investment bank analyst good morning thanks a lot for taking my question same store revenue growth for the year is now expected to be 12 5 13 5 that implies something in the fourth quarter that s above what you saw in the first half of the year but maybe slower than the third quarter so the comparison from last year in the fourth quarter is maybe 400 basis points more difficult so how much of the implied slowdown in same store revenue growth is a reflection of starting to lap more difficult comparisons compared to underlying trends and how much more how much of an impact should this more difficult comparison have going forward p scott stubbs executive vice president chief financial officer yes so fourth you hit it right on the head in that the fourth quarter is a much more difficult comp if you look at where looking back to 2020 i mean second quarter we had negative rates third quarter we moved to low to mid single digit achieved rate growth in the third quarter we had close to double digit rate growth and in the fourth quarter we really started moving rates significantly so much more difficult comp in the fourth quarter in addition some of the occupancy goes away the occupancy benefit we re expecting occupancy at the end of the year to be flat but to still have a positive occupancy benefit but not as strong in the as what we had in the second and third quarter but most of it is from rate and the comp michael goldsmith ubs investment bank analyst got it and how much of your portfolio now is up near these kind of new market rates or said another way like how much upside is left from passing along ecris and marking your existing customer portfolio up to these market rates joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director okay so i think we ve made up most of the room there s still some states where we re limited and as rates go up the gap continues but i would say most of it s in the rearview mirror michael goldsmith ubs investment bank analyst got it and if we could just touch on costs for a second the costs were well contained in the quarter same store expenses were down 4 though the decline was driven primarily by lower marketing like as we look forward are there any expense items that could pressure the business you mentioned payroll insurance was up big can you kind of walk through kind of where you see expense pressure and kind of to the extent that you can talk about the magnitude of that that would be extremely helpful p scott stubbs executive vice president chief financial officer yes let me maybe start with property taxes i mean we had a negative quarterly comp and that s not going to continue property taxes we would expect to grow in the 5 to 6 range as we continue to see pressure and i think that s partly with lower cap rates higher valuations we would expect municipalities to continue to assess we would expect that to continue into next year we obviously we re not ready to give guidance on property taxes but that will continue the second one i would point to is marketing we wouldn t expect it to be down 40 again this year we would expect next year to maybe be a little bit more normal and it s a lever we will use as we see opportunities to grow our revenues by using marketing the third one i would point to just because of the size of the expense is payroll so this year we ve had a negative payroll comp and it s been by us being proactive partly so we ve done things to decrease hours to optimize our payroll but we ve also had some what i would call a negative benefit and what i mean by that is we ve seen our payroll go down because we ve had higher turnover and we ve had a longer time to fill so not necessarily a good thing we ve had lower payroll as a result of that we continue to see pressure on wages so that s at the stores that s in our corporate office and we would expect that to be we would expect that to continue into next year i think every company in america is experiencing that the other thing i would point to on the expense side is it s a good thing to be in storage and what i mean by that is we re in a high margin business so payroll for instance even if we see significant payroll pressure you re still sub 6 as a percentage of revenues and so if you re an inflationary market we do have the ability to push our rates as their month to month leases michael goldsmith ubs investment bank analyst very helpful thank you very much p scott stubbs executive vice president chief financial officer thanks michael operator your next question is from todd thomas of keybanc capital your line is open todd michael thomas keybanc capital markets inc analyst hi thanks just first question following up on rates in place versus street joe you said your efforts in the quarter on rate increases helped bring in place customer rents closer to street what s the spread look like today and can you remind us what that spread between in place and street rates looked like sort of back in 2019 maybe before the pandemic or maybe on average over sort of the 10 year period perhaps heading into the pandemic joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director sure so it s seasonal as you know and it s our spread is the highest in the summer i think it was the high teens when we had our last call it s closer to flat to slightly positive 1 now and if you look historically we would be negative now todd michael thomas keybanc capital markets inc analyst okay and right so you ve historically you ve increased in place customer rents above street rates and so where did that sort of peak in the prior cycle joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director todd would you just repeat that please you re saying todd michael thomas keybanc capital markets inc analyst so you ve increased in place customer rents above street historically right which resulted in the negative spread that you ve historically had what was that spread like in sort of where did that spread peak in the prior cycle i guess i m trying to understand how much room you might have on the in place customer rent increase program to take contractual rents higher even if asking rents are sort of flattish from here on a seasonally adjusted basis joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director yes so i think the other factor you may not be picking up is street rates can go down so it s not only increasing existing customers that causes the gap it s street rates are the highest in the summer and they have a seasonal decline and that causes some of the gap scott do you know off the top of your head the percentage that he s looking for in prior years p scott stubbs executive vice president chief financial officer don t know that it s a number we ve ever given todd we ve always referred to in place versus street we ve talked about how they re they go in a cycle where you peak in the summer in terms of that gap it s typically high single digits in the summer that gap and then it goes maybe high single digits in the winter so you peak in july you bottom out in february this year we peaked 19 as joe mentioned we re typically starting to go negative now we have a our street rates are as strong as they ve ever been todd michael thomas keybanc capital markets inc analyst okay all right and then just with regards to the in place customer rent increases that you re passing through can you talk about the magnitude or rate growth that you re pushing through to customers and whether you ve changed the frequency of those rent increases that eligible customers are receiving i think it historically has been sort of month five and then maybe every nine months thereafter or something to that extent is that still the schedule or has that changed at all joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director yes so we re at very unusual times right we had significantly discounted rates during the height of covid and brought in people at some really low rates and then we had government restrictions that prevented us from moving those folks to where we thought they should be and the third factor is we had really impressive street rate growth so that caused us to have some customers that had very very large gaps between where they were and what street rate was and we ve been trying to move those customers more toward street rate and as i said in the earlier question we ve done a lot of that most of that is in the rearview mirror but that s kind of led us to have experience numbers that are very different than our historical practice because we re not in normal times todd michael thomas keybanc capital markets inc analyst ok alright thank you joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director thanks todd operator thank you your next question is from caitlin burrows of goldman sachs your line is open caitlin burrows goldman sachs group inc analyst hi good morning team i guess first with rent per square foot continuing to rise how price sensitive are you finding customers and do you have an idea what portion of move outs today are due to price and how that compares versus history just wondering if it s gone up at all as rates have also increased joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director yes very very very modestly we track move outs of customers who did and did not receive rate increase notices and as you could tell by our occupancy the customers are not very price sensitive and those are who are we re able to backfill very very quickly caitlin burrows goldman sachs group inc analyst got it okay and then on the cash flow growth side it s obviously been very strong which has reduced your leverage and you guys mentioned earlier that it s now 4 5 times so what s your view on being able to kind of redeploy capital in an attractive way of course to get leverage above 5 times is that something that you want to do joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director yes i would love to be able to invest more and increase our leverage back toward our targeted rate or targeted range but not at the expense of doing deals that we don t think are good long term deals for our investors so we re going to remain disciplined we look at everything out there our investment teams as i said are really busy we have a lot of exciting things we re playing with but we re not going to invest just to get our leverage up we re only going to invest when we think the risk reward is attractive to us caitlin burrows goldman sachs group inc analyst ok i guess thats a thats a good position to the end thanks joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director thank you operator your next question is from smedes rose of citi your line is open smedes rose citigroup inc analyst hi thanks i just wanted to ask you a little bit about the acquisition volumes and obviously they ve come up a lot as we ve from what your expectations were coming into the year and we ve seen that across the industry in general and i mean besides favorable pricing for sellers what do you think are a few things that are kind of driving more folks to come to market is there any sort of theme that you re seeing when you talk to the sellers joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director well clearly the first and most important is what you mentioned is very favorable pricing very low cap rates that brings people out of the wood work want to sell i think there s also some concern that the tax regime is going to change and that maybe it s better to pay your taxes now than in the future smedes rose citigroup inc analyst okay so just those i mean ok nothing else in particular i was just wondering if you felt like independents are losing their the competitive advantages of these larger portfolios that they get bigger and bigger is maybe impacting them but you think it s probably more sort of tax and pricing that s driving that joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director i do smedes smedes rose citigroup inc analyst okay and i wanted to ask you as well just in terms of given that fundamentals are so strong has it changed at all the sort of level of inbound inquiries into bringing you on as a third party manager i mean are other folks that are not part of these larger systems doing sort of similarly as well and are maybe not as inclined to come to you for management or how are there any changes there i guess joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director yes i mean smedes you hit it right on the head if you look at the consolidation in the industry four or five years ago versus now it s up almost 50 maybe from the low 20s to the low 30s percent of stores in the country are owned or managed by the big public companies and we ve seen that significantly and i mean we brought on 96 stores in our third party management platform in the third quarter 196 through the year there s been a lot of sales of which we ve bought a bunch but we re still over 100 net growth in our third party management platform and that s a mix of the single one off owner who wants professional management or are more quasi institutional partners who we have good relations with and keep growing their portfolio so it s the growth in that business across all types of owners has been really really strong and i expect it to continue to be so smedes rose citigroup inc analyst okay and then just final question from us you mentioned your guidance underwrites about 200 basis points of occupancy declines through the fall i think or the winter have you started to see that moderation in october so far to date joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director so today we re sitting at 96 7 occupancy so we ve had pretty modest vacates or decline in occupancy since june 30 but or september 30 so that s where we are today smedes rose citigroup inc analyst ok thank you guys operator your next question is from samir khanal of evercore your line is open samir upadhyay khanal evercore isi institutional equities analyst hey good afternoon so when i look at your occupancy for some of the major gateway markets it has not been impacted at the end of september with sort of the return to work factor in place so i m just wondering as how you re thinking about that dynamic of return to office and the impact it can have in your portfolio in some of the major markets whether it s new york or boston or even kind of the l a area maybe in 4q and into next year joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director so i think it s a little early to really call that i mean all the first thing i think it s important for everyone to remember is all our markets are doing phenomenally well if you look at our bottom five markets for revenue growth they re all above 13 so there s no market that s really struggling but our bottom markets do include new york boston l a and san francisco and there s a lot of variables i think between the stronger markets and the weaker markets a couple of things that we think are consistent is markets that had state of emergencies in place longer and are just coming out are performing less well than other markets samir upadhyay khanal evercore isi institutional equities analyst okay and then i guess my second question is i guess joe given the given where you are from an occupancy standpoint i mean it s sort of that 96 97 how are you thinking about your strategy in terms of pricing let s say going into the next six months right or how are you managing the business differently given the level of occupancy today versus sort of pre covid here joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director yes so we don t really look six months out our models are pricing units in stores every day and we ll react on a daily basis to not only what s going on but what is projected to go on so clearly in an environment where we re 96 7 we re going to reduce marketing expenses and we re going to keep the gas pressed on rates samir upadhyay khanal evercore isi institutional equities analyst ok thanks joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director sure operator your next question is from ki bin kim of truist your line is open ki bin kim truist securities inc analyst thanks congrats on a great quarter so when you look at where your rates are versus your micro submarket your versus your competitors where are you today versus your competitors and has that changed a whole lot over the past year or so p scott stubbs executive vice president chief financial officer i think everybody has higher rates today we re on the higher end when we look at them compared to 2019 as joe mentioned our rates are up 40 our achieved rates in the third quarter were 40 above where they were in 2019 so i think everybody is pushing rates we are pushing rates as our occupancy stays strong and as demand stays strong ki bin kim truist securities inc analyst got it and going back to the topic about submarket performance i know you mentioned some locations that had to say kind of the governmental orders that restricted rent growth having a different impact on these markets but how much of the performance difference between submarket is being driven by simply kind of population migration and do those markets that saw an influx in population do they just have a longer tail than the new yorks or san franciscos joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director yes it s really hard for us to divide performance to disaggregate performance between population movement and stay at home orders and new effective new supply it s really hard to figure out how much each of those variables and many many other variables contribute to the performance of different markets ki bin kim truist securities inc analyst okay got it and if i could squeeze in a quick third one you re talking about the payroll increases that we should expect going forward like what kind of magnitude were you thinking joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director so i would say greater than inflation i don t want to give you a specific number because that s the rate scott will then ask for ki bin kim truist securities inc analyst ok thank you joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director i wanna give you a specific number cause thats the operator your next question is from elvis rodriguez of bank of america your line is open elvis rodriguez bofa securities analyst hi and thankyou for taking the questions congratulations on the quarter what s your update on the supply outlook in your markets through 2022 now that we re an extra quarter from your last update joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director so our projections for 2021 from our last update is actually slightly higher i think the last quarter we said 3 year rolling 19 to 21 was about 70 of our same store pool is going to be affected or our stores and that s up to about 73 so a little bit of an increase 2022 we see a larger decline 3 year rolling 20 21 and 22 we think about 64 5 of our stores are going to be affected and we ll continue to gather that data and get better but we do see moderation in 2022 my concern is given the great great performance of the sector the amount of capital that wants exposure to storage low interest rate that we are going to get ourselves back into a development cycle and the line will start to go in the other direction maybe in 2023 and beyond now that s not all bad right development creates bridge loan and management and acquisition and development participation opportunities for us but it s also a challenge for the stores that have new supply coming in their trade area and we ll manage through that just like we managed through the last cycle elvis rodriguez bofa securities analyst great and then just a follow up question on the bond deals so you got better pricing in longer term this time around but your leverage is also lower quarter over quarter how are you thinking about funding your business going forward you didn t issue any equity in the quarter so just curious on how you think about using those levers specifically since you started using the bond market this year p scott stubbs executive vice president chief financial officer yes we re kind of in a unique market where we have a lot of good options you have cheap debt you have a stock price that s holding up and we ve always said we d use equity if we have a place to put it in the near term so far this year we haven t had a great place to put equity and we ve been delevering as our noi has grown and as we had some sales into joint ventures or outright sales so i think equity is always an option but i think we ll look to the debt markets first elvis rodriguez bofa securities analyst thank you p scott stubbs executive vice president chief financial officer thanks elvis operator your next question is from spenser allaway of green street your line is open spenser bowes allaway green street advisors llc analyst thank you in terms of the occupancy losses that you re assuming for the full year can you just talk about which consumer segments you expect could drive this for instance i know that college students have recently contributed to occupancy move so i m just curious if you have a view on what might cause some of the deterioration moving forward joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director so clearly as was mentioned earlier if return to work picks up people come back to the major cities that could cause some loss in occupancy i don t think that everyone who established a home office or an extra room is going to automatically reverse that so i think it will be gradual other than that i think it s kind of your normal churn of storage right most of our customers are somewhere in the moving process and when at some point after they re done moving they don t need storage anymore they eventually get around tempting their stuff up so other than kind of return to office or return to the big city i don t think there ll be anything unusual spenser bowes allaway green street advisors llc analyst and spenser the other thing i would maybe add is we have a 200 basis point assumption in there that s based somewhat of historical trends we re kind of in an odd year this year it seems like everything that s happened in the past hasn t necessarily happened this year so it s a number it s our assumption i think that we ll see how it plays out okay thank you and then just given residential space is the closest substitute to storage from a consumer standpoint do you think that rising residential prices have contributed to your pricing power just curious if this is something that you guys pay attention to or have absorbed over the years joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director so i think the theory is sound right if it gets more expensive to rent the larger apartment people may rent a smaller apartment and use storage it makes sense and we see anecdotal evidence of it we don t have a whole lot of data where we can correlate rising real estate pricing and demand for storage and i think we need more time and more data before we be real specific about that spenser bowes allaway green street advisors llc analyst thank you joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director sure operator your next question is from mike mueller of jpmorgan your line is open michael william mueller jpmorgan chase co analyst yes hi thanks curious what s the pace of lease up that you re seeing in your c of o properties and when you re underwriting new transactions today for those types of deals what sort of yields are you underwriting to p scott stubbs executive vice president chief financial officer so the pace of lease up is faster i mean one of the things we pointed to in my comments was that we have less dilution this year than we originally forecasted that s largely to do with the pace of lease up it also has to do with rates being higher we continue to look at c of os i think that those vary wildly by market and by how far out they are yes some of the recent things that we ve approved this year have been 7 5 range but i think that we are also looking at where we are in a cycle and trying to make sure that we risk adjust for that too michael william mueller jpmorgan chase co analyst got it so back to the pace so if we re thinking about underwriting to a stabilization is it around a 4 year time frame you re thinking about and you re seeing p scott stubbs executive vice president chief financial officer we haven t changed our assumptions in terms of lease up so even though we benefited from shorter lease ups we recognize that that can change it can also change depending on new supply in the market we try to look at what s coming in the specific market we re looking at but the markets are dynamic and so we assume historical norms in terms of lease up of those properties michael william mueller jpmorgan chase co analyst got it ok that was it thank you unidentified speaker thank you operator your next question is from rob simone of hedgeye risk management your line is open robert matthew simone hedgeye risk management llc analyst hey guys thanks for taking the question i hope all is well i had a question about the management platform to the degree you re able to answer it so you guys are over 800 i guess like close to 830 strictly third party managed stores now and close to 1 100 in total i guess what is the long term target if there is one and what s kind of the path to get there and the reason why i asked that if i look at your property management fees as a percentage of your g a it s starting to trend back up over a longer time frame toward like the 70 range meaning you re getting closer to effectively paying for your corporate layer with fees and i guess from like a structural premium standpoint you know you guys have already had one i m curious like how you guys think about like getting to that number or eclipsing it i think it s like 63 million on 100 million now and kind of how could that gap narrow over time joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director yes so good question thank you so we don t target a number of stores we re not trying to get to 1 000 or 2 000 or whatever number you want to think of what s important for us is we maintain our profitability right we can get a lot more stores if we reduced our fees but we want to maintain our profitability and we also want to have the right stores right a store with an owner that plans to hold for 10 years is of much more value to us than a store where it s a developer and they re going to build it and flip it a store in a 40 market is much more valuable to us than a store in a 9 market so we re really focused on the economics and the relationships that this business brings to us as opposed to the outright number of stores and if keeping within that discipline of maintaining our margins we can grow the management fee revenue that it covers our g a or more than covers our g a we re going to grow it as big as we can robert matthew simone hedgeye risk management llc analyst so it s kind of like a lifetime value of the customer concept as opposed to just straight growing the top line i think that s what you re saying joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director that s it robert matthew simone hedgeye risk management llc analyst got it okay yes that makes sense i don t know is there time to ask one more i don t want to take so much of your guys time joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director sure robert matthew simone hedgeye risk management llc analyst okay sure yes so i guess as it relates to an earlier question so with i mean your rental rates are flying off the page here right it s obvious to everybody i guess how do you guys internally think about your customers like propensity or wherewithal to pay i mean i know it s spread over thousands of leases or tens of thousands of leases even but do you guys look at like how income to rent ratios change or i m just curious how you guys think about that like in terms of what s like the upside and longer customers wherewithal to like continue paying higher rates joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director yes so a couple of things one is we have over 1 2 million customers so we re highly highly granular on this topic secondly when storage gets more expensive and our tenants complain they can t afford our store managers are really good about talking to them about do you really need a 10 x 10 or can we get you into a 10 x five or maybe a unit that s upstairs further away so we can have other tools to solve their problems third is if it does get more expensive and they move out that s not a problem for us today we have plenty of demand to backfill their space and then lastly most of our customers don t think they re staying very long now they end up staying about 50 longer than they think they re staying but most of them that added cost they believe is temporary and they can swallow hard it s only those real long long term tenants that you have that more of that problem robert matthew simone hedgeye risk management llc analyst got it thanks joe appreciate it thanks for taking the question joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director sure unidentified speaker thanks rob operator your next question is from kevin stein of stifel your line is open kevin stein stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst hey good morning guys so revenue accelerated in the same store quite a bit since 2q and i was just wondering if there s any maybe like new demand drivers or if it s just the existing demand drivers that are increasing or if it s just more of your confidence in being able to increase rental rates more p scott stubbs executive vice president chief financial officer so i would tell you it s steady demand combined with low vacates so people are staying longer today the people that have rented with us have been sticky so i think we did see an increase in demand last year we saw if we look ask our customers why they said they were out of space if you ask them today that s moved back more toward i m moving so those are kind of the reasons they give for moving or for storing with us and vacates throughout this entire period have been very very low so we have less units that need to be rented each month because people are staying longer and vacating less today kevin stein stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst okay do you have a sense of so i guess like i m not sure what s your average length of stay but for the industry it s maybe like now 15 16 months so i guess that imply like roughly 7 of customers will be moving out on average do you know like how many do you give a number on how many what percentage of your portfolio turns over in a month p scott stubbs executive vice president chief financial officer we haven t and that s going to vary by property type so what i mean by that is a new property is going to have a much shorter length of stay than a property that s 30 years old you have more and more long term customers of that a much lower churn what we have seen is churn has gone down through covid so that if you re referring to 7 it s lower than that and it continues to go lower as the vacates are lower kevin stein stifel nicolaus company incorporated analyst ok thanks operator your next question is from ronald kamdem of morgan stanley your line is open ronald kamdem morgan stanley analyst hey just a quick question on just e rentals can you just remind us what percentage is coming through that channel and maybe have you seen anything different from that customer relative to the rest of the portfolio thanks joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director so we re at about 25 today we were i think 20 or 21 at our last call so we ve seen a slight increase in customers use of that channel customers report very high satisfaction rates with it so that s good for us and there s really not a very meaningful difference in the customer that i could describe to you ronald kamdem morgan stanley analyst great thats all my question thank you unidentified speaker thanks ron operator your next question is from michael goldsmith of ubs your line is open michael goldsmith ubs investment bank analyst hey one more for me you re going to get 100 million back of your preferred investment from jcap maybe as early as next week how do you go about replacing the investment s 12 return and what do you plan on doing with these funds joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director yes so we are going to continue doing what we ve been doing which we ll continue to look for our bridge loan opportunities we ll continue to invest both on a wholly owned and joint venture basis and when unique opportunities come up like that preferred investment we ll consider those as well michael goldsmith ubs investment bank analyst ok great thank you guys joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director sure operator speakers i am showing no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back to mr joe margolis chief executive officer joseph daniel margolis chief executive officer director great thank you everyone for participating today we appreciate your interest in extra space storage we re really happy to report the results that we ve been able to report this quarter and the only reason we can do it is because of the hard work of all the folks at extra space starting with the folks in the store who deal with the customers every day but also all the people in the call center and here in the corporate office i m extraordinarily proud of them and their dedication and hard work so thank you i hope you and all your families are well take care operator duration 50 minutes call participants jeffrey norman vice president of investor relations corporate communications joseph daniel margolis chief executive

quarter net income of 53 million or 0 74 per share the third quarter was very busy as our bankers deepened relationships in our existing markets resulting in substantial growth in both our core loan and deposit portfolios fee income rose across the board and expenses were well controlled our operational teams worked tirelessly to ensure an efficient and successful close of the bank of commerce

we may make forward looking statements during today s call for further information on forward looking comments please refer to either our earnings release our website or our sec filings at this time i ll turn the call over to aaron aaron j deer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you clint good morning everyone during the third quarter columbia generated net income of 53 million or 0 74 per share driven by solid fundamentals adjusted for 2 2 million of acquisition related costs pre tax pre provision income of 70 8 million was our second best quarter on record trailing only the second quarter of 2020 when we recorded a large gain on our visa b shares deposit inflows remained exceptional with balances up 608 million during the quarter to 16 billion at september 30 representing an annualized growth rate of 16 over the past 12 months deposits grew by 2 4 billion or 17 our cost of deposits in the third quarter remained at a historic low of just four basis points total loans net of ppp increased by 183 million or 8 annualized to 9 2 billion at september 30 remaining ppp loans totaled 337 million at period end and the remaining net deferred fees still to be realized was 8 million as of september 30 we originated 366 million of new loans during the quarter this new production was brought on at an average tax adjusted coupon rate of 3 59 which compares to the overall portfolio rate excluding ppp of 3 83 our investment securities portfolio was 6 9 billion as of september 30 which was a linked quarter increase of 692 million driven by 971 million of purchases purchases had an average weighted yield of 1 48 and a duration of 5 5 years the portfolio s expected yield is 1 78 with a duration of 4 9 years the net interest margin rose one basis point linked quarter to 3 17 and net interest income rose by 7 1 million overall loan income rose on a linked quarter basis benefiting from the accelerated amortization of ppp loan fees partly offset by lower interest income from declining ppp balances excluding the impact of ppp the net interest margin declined 15 basis points to 3 reflecting continued asset yield pressures and increased balance sheet liquidity but as interest rates in the operating environment improves we expect our margin to rebound as existing and variable as existing variable and floating rate loans reprice higher and cash flows from the securities portfolio are redeployed into higher yielding loans noninterest income rose 1 2 million on a linked quarter basis to 24 million part of the increase was from a 750 000 gain on the sale of hsa accounts with the remainder of the increase largely due to higher loan revenue though all business lines posted solid results noninterest expense of 90 million included merger related costs of 2 2 million for the merchants bank of commerce transaction excluding acquisition costs noninterest expense of 87 8 million increased 4 2 million on a linked quarter basis much of this increase stemmed from a smaller fas 91 benefit on the compensation line as the previous quarter had elevated loan originations due to ppp activity meanwhile the september quarter also had some outsized facilities maintenance and technology costs lastly the provision for income taxes decreased 1 1 million on a linked quarter basis to 13 5 million representing a 20 3 effective rate we continue to expect our 2021 tax rate to be in the range of 19 to 21 though the higher end of that range is looking more likely and with that i ll turn the call over to chris chris merrywell executive vice president chief operating officer thank you aaron and good morning everyone our peers have been busy generating strong loan production of 366 million in the third quarter with nearly 1 billion produced in the past six months outside of ppp at the same time we have actively replenished our pipelines which remain to our satisfaction deposits have continued to rise at an annual rate that has stabilized in the 16 to 17 range and fee income is up across the board we are winning new business by taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace because of who we are simply said we have followed a different process we believe that people want community and personal contact in their banking relationships and we have delivered on that on a multifaceted level quarterly loan production was predominantly c i and cre focused new business was centered in real estate leasing construction and healthcare sectors across our markets line utilization which has been low throughout the pandemic rose slightly to 44 9 with commitments rising by 141 million to 5 1 billion and exceeding 5 billion for the first time in our history the quarterly production mix was 58 fixed 40 floating and 2 variable the overall portfolio is now 4 ppp 52 non ppp fixed 33 floating and 11 variable the composition of the loan portfolio remained relatively unchanged as aaron mentioned deposits grew by 608 million during the quarter and by 2 4 billion over the past 12 months the quarterly inflows have trended toward demand accounts over the last year and as a result the split has changed from 51 noninterest bearing and 49 interest bearing to an even split of 50 50 between the two as of september 30 fee income continues to be a bright spot card fees are up during the quarter from increased transactional volumes loan fees are up in alignment with loan production and cb financial and columbia trust company continued their breakout year with yet another record quarter residential mortgage activity remained strong in the third quarter with approximately 65 related to refinancing and 35 related to purchases as part of our ongoing branch rationalization process we consolidated three branches in september and october we have announced another to occur in january of 22 and in light of our announcement of the umpqua partnership we are now evaluating our retail delivery strategy across the combined footprint now i will turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance andy mcdonald executive vice president and chief credit officer thanks chris this quarter s allowance for credit losses remains at 143 million resulting in no new provisioning for the quarter all of our credit metrics improved which offset any additional provision requirements from loan growth and a weakening economic forecast the ihs markit economic forecast we use assumes a full year gdp growth of 5 7 and for 2021 and 4 5 for 2022 the current forecast is less favorable than the forecast used for last quarter when the full year gdp was forecasted at 6 7 for 2021 we ended the quarter with an allowance relative to period end loans of 1 5 and adjusting for ppp loans the allowance to period end loans increases to 1 55 npas for the quarter remained stable at 13 basis points past due loans for the quarter were eight basis points compared to 17 basis points last quarter and net charge offs were minimal and only amounted to about 200 000 or one basis point annualized problem loans which we define as loans watch or worse declined from 804 million last quarter to 724 million as of september 30 we are continuing to see credit quality improve across the whole portfolio including the covid sensitive segments when you compare it to a year ago when problem loans were about 1 1 billion you can see the healing within the portfolio now while consumers are shopping again they may not like the wait time for their products or the sticker prices of those products businesses are dealing with supply chain problems as well as labor shortages all of this is causing increased inflationary pressures so we remain watchful of the impact these forces may have nevertheless we remain confident in the resiliency and strength of the overall portfolio clint clint stein president chief executive officer thanks andy we expect to finish the year strong as our bankers maintain an external client centric focus with the objective of growing our existing loan and deposit portfolios we have a deep bench of talented team members who in the coming months will complete the integration of bank of commerce holdings while working toward finalizing the combination with umpqua our current and future prospects are very bright and it is a privilege to lead such a talented team this concludes our prepared comments as a reminder andy chris and aaron are with me to answer your questions and now norma we ll open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you and our first question comes from david feaster from raymond james your line is open david feaster raymond james analyst hey good morning boys clint stein president chief executive officer hey david david feaster raymond james analyst i just wanted to start out on growth it s growth was again stronger than expected production is holding up well payoffs and paydowns are still a headwind but just wanted to get some of your thoughts on the drivers how much of this the strength do you think is just from a general improvement in the economic backdrop versus the new hires you ve made in the client ppp client acquisition and just whether you think this high single digit pace of growth is sustainable clint stein president chief executive officer well i ll start david this is clint and then i ll quickly turn it over to chris this is something that i think is a result of a very intentional approach that we took in the middle of the second quarter of last year and that was a mindset of continuing to operate in a business as usual or and is near normal of a capacity as possible in spite of the pandemic and the disruptions created from that and i think that our thought at the time was that this should give us momentum as society started to reemerge toward more of a normal operating environment and i think if you look back at our growth and our production over the past four quarters you ll see that that momentum has continued to build and that s why i think sprinkled throughout our prepared remarks you probably noted a lot of optimism and so i ll step back now and let chris add some additional context chris merrywell executive vice president chief operating officer yes david i believe it hits on all of the things that were embedded in your question there but as clint said about our process i think a lot of the credit goes to our teams and how they approach being open being in front of clients being there when they had questions they could still come in and make a deposit and they still have bankers that were actively involved in reaching out and talking to them that s helped with our existing clients and our retention but more importantly what we saw is relationships from other institutions that followed a much different process that are moving and voting with their feet if you will because of what we did and that we were open when clients don t have access to branches or to bankers they begin to look for other options and i think we ve been the beneficiary of that and so again i would say a lot of the credit and the congratulations goes to our teams for being open in a safe manner and continuing to prospect david feaster raymond james analyst okay that s helpful and then maybe just could you give us an update on the bank of commerce deal i know that s gotten somewhat overshadowed a bit but this is your first foray into california just an update on how the integration has gone how is production trending over there and just as you ve gotten any deeper into that transaction now that they re part of the bank just any updates on your thoughts on that deal clint stein president chief executive officer sure it maybe externally has been overshadowed by the announcement of our combination with umpqua but certainly internally it hasn t i ll make my second trip to the bank of commerce footprint next week my second trip this month and hence my prepared comments about over the past several months getting to know our team members that joined us from boch and i m excited i m as excited or more excited about what they bring to the combined organization as i was the day that we announced it back in june and i think that with all of the things that we had envisioned our entry into california it was just that it was an entry and our strategy has always been to have a much much larger presence throughout california and the combination with umpqua accelerates that dramatically and i think that it also accelerates opportunities that we solve with the bank of commerce combination or acquisition and that s having the size and scale where clients don t outgrow their bankers being able to continue to grow with those businesses being able to bring some of the business back on the balance sheet being able to pursue relationships that maybe they had in at prior institutions that were too large for the balance sheet at bank of commerce as well as additional career opportunities and development opportunities that being part of a larger organization will provide to all of the folks that joined us from bank of commerce david feaster raymond james analyst okay that makes sense great and then i just wanted to touch a bit on your asset sensitivity and kind of how you guys are thinking about managing liquidity at this point i guess what s the strategy going forward and i know you guys have been active and innovative in the past managing your sensitivity just with the rate collar that you guys have done just curious if there s any thoughts on swaps or other derivatives at this point just in light of the potential steepening of the curve aaron j deer executive vice president and chief financial officer david no i guess derivative strategy are being considered at the moment but we feel very good about our positioning in terms of our asset sensitivity i put in some additional detail or some new detail i guess i should say in our investor deck that helps you kind of better understand how the portfolio will behave but i think it s also worth noting that the how we think about that and how we model that internally and what we share is pretty conservative one thing to think about is when you look at the say the asset sensitivity table that we put into our qs and ks that has a deposit beta sensitivity of about 50 but if you look back at the last rating cycle the reality was is that our actual performance was less than 20 so our asset sensitivity is obviously very strong and we feel like we re very well positioned for what we hope to be a rising rate environment hopefully in the not too far future certainly the trends that we ve seen of late on that front in terms of some steepening of the yield curve are very encouraging and to further benefit that we hope to see a remixing from the secured investment securities portfolio into the loan portfolio obviously we ve got tremendous on balance sheet liquidity and right now that investment portfolio has grown off about 700 million annually that we can redeploy into loans and that amount actually increases as we go forward so it s we re very well positioned and comfortable about how that looks going forward especially in a rising rate environment david feaster raymond james analyst all right that s great color thanks everybody operator thank you our next question comes from jeff rulis from d a davidson your line is open jeff rulis d a davidson analyst yes good morning clint stein president chief executive officer good morning jeff jeff rulis d a davidson analyst question on maybe aaron i might have missed in your prepared remarks the discussion on the margin specifically you mentioned anticipating a rebound could you frame that up again i apologize for missing i just wanted to get that straight aaron j deer executive vice president and chief financial officer just no near term my expectation is that we re probably going to see continued margin pressure just given where new asset yields are coming on both on the loan book and the investment securities portfolio but with an anticipation of rising rates that s when we would expect to see a rebound jeff rulis d a davidson analyst okay so we yes i guess the follow up is maybe more specifically to spread income expectations and i think you kind of touched on a little bit with what you think you do on liquidity but what if you do have broad nii expectations could you share that aaron j deer executive vice president and chief financial officer we haven t given guidance on our nii expectations but obviously we had the benefit of ppp this quarter that s going to go away but now on a go forward basis of course we ll have the merchants bank transaction that is going to benefit that number on a go forward basis jeff rulis d a davidson analyst okay great clint i ve got two questions on the on umpqua announcement and the first being look you ve had a couple of weeks to digest this and also get feedback from others and the first question being what do you think the most misunderstood piece of that combination that you that you ve heard that you ve had to sort of dispel and then the second thing is sort of the biggest risk that you see from the combination integration etc thanks clint stein president chief executive officer yes well i think the response to the first question and we stated this on the investor call at the announcement and i don t know that it necessarily resonated and that was the statement that we made that we were more similar than what the market perception has been and i realize that we ve spent the past several months getting to know each other organizationally on a very very detailed level and so i guess as we progress toward the close and then through the integration i think it will become more apparent to everybody on the outside looking in that we truly are much more alike than we are different and so i do think that there s a bit of a perception issue there i think the biggest challenge to pivot to the second part of that question the biggest challenge going forward is as we go through the integration maintaining our external focus and that s something that i m very confident in our ability to bring both our companies together into one it s going to be a very powerful dynamic environment but i do think that in some of these instances really in any type of merger activity there could be a tendency to become inwardly focused for a period of time and so that s something we re very very much aware of and we spoke about the office of integration that we re setting up that is very active we have steering committee meetings going already on that we have four of what i ll consider very very bright mines and both companies two executives from umpqua two from our executive team that are going to be fully dedicated to that office of integration and i think a good way of thinking about it is how we went through the ppp process and the first round for the whole industry forced everybody to become inwardly focused and it was an all hands type activity but then when we went through the second round of ppp we had a very similar outcome but many of our bankers the vast majority of them were able to maintain their external focus and that pivots back to david s question about the momentum and the growth opportunities that we ve had so that s at a high level i think our plan to combat that risk and i feel really good about our prospects there jeff rulis d a davidson analyst appreciate it clint thanks clint stein president chief executive officer thanks jeff operator thank you our next question comes from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst hey thanks good morning everyone clint stein president chief executive officer good morning jon jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst maybe for you chris you kind of alluded to it in your comments but what changes with your approach on expenses with the pending merger and kind of what are you spending on now and where are you maybe pausing a bit chris merrywell executive vice president chief operating officer i think when you look at our approach has always been one of consistency we don t put out a big announcement of branch consolidations it s just the normal course of business i think with clint as our ceo we ve always in previous calls talked about offsets when we re making investments into technology and things of that nature and i expect all of that to continue to move forward now as we come together there s going to be opportunities the investor deck is out and talks about some of those opportunities and i wouldn t expect that we re not going to change culturally who we are with our approach to expenses we ll run and we ll use the office of integration to highlight things that where there s overlap where there s locations that have overlap and we ll work through our thoughtful process on when and how we institute those savings but i would expect that to be a collaborative process that has very similar results to what we ve done previously jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay thank you for that and aaron can you review you throughout a couple of puts and takes and expenses to kind of get back to a core can you give us those again aaron j deer executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so reported we re about 90 million right about 2 2 million in merger related costs there was about 500 million in i m going to call them technology fees that were we ll call them nonrecurring i guess but they were just unusual items we also had about 500 000 in did i say 500 000 sorry in technology costs and then another 500 000 in kind of some outsized branch maintenance costs that just kind of happened to hit during the quarter and then of course there s also the provision front funded commitments during the quarter that obviously can bounce around depending on utilization and commitments but that was also a factor in the quarter jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay okay good thank you for that a couple of questions the new loan production yields look like they re up quite a bit from the previous quarter is that simply mix or is there something else happening there clint stein president chief executive officer it s mostly mix jon in the second quarter as you remember may remember we had a few larger high credit very competitive deals that we have brought on so it s really the mix jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay okay good and then aaron another question for you i think you were talking about slide 10 earlier with some of the rate sensitivity updates and i guess what s nuance here i guess the way that i read it is with a 25 basis point hike about 3 billion of your 4 2 billion in variable and floating rate reprices is that the message you re trying to get across with this aaron j deer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think in particular the chart in the upper right gives you a sense previously we weren t kind of disclosing what kind of what happens at each hike in terms of how that influenced kind of what comes out from under the floor or off the floor i guess i should say and so we re just giving a more granular level of detail there for you to kind of understand the pacing of how it s going to play out jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst yes okay good that s very helpful and then andy i think you thought you re going to get away without a question but how are you guys thinking about reserve and provision levels at this point obviously things look very clean but any thoughts on that andy mcdonald executive vice president and chief credit officer yes i think it s going to continue to be the dynamic between the economic forecast and i still continue to believe that the portfolio will continue to deal and then you got loan production so those are the three things that i see as the drivers going forward i mean certainly the economy i think gdp came out at 2 for the last quarter so so hopefully loan production stays there the pipeline i think is pretty good so it s really going to be sort of that forecast which is a huge cecl driver but we continue to see healing in the portfolio which is helping offset the declining forecast jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst yes okay okay thanks for everything appreciate it clint stein president chief executive officer thanks jon operator thank you and our next question comes from andrew terrell from stephens your line is open andrew terrell stephens analyst hey good morning clint stein president chief executive officer good morning andrew terrell stephens analyst if i m looking into the kind of growth by portfolio this quarter i think a little over half of it came from residential real estate was this just from retaining more kind of mortgage production on balance sheet from your mortgage business and just given kind of the really strong deposit flows should we expect to see the residential portfolio continue to build from here as kind of a lever to deploy some excess liquidity or as i think about kind of the prepared remarks it sounds like the gross outlook was pretty optimistic so should we expect growth to shift back more toward commercial clint stein president chief executive officer yes yes andrew i think if i understand it correctly we did choose to retain some mortgage production during the quarter we made a small purchase as well about 30 million the metrics were such that it made sense that we would do that c i is still a big part of what we re doing and when i look at the pipeline and go forward i would say that yes commercial is more of the driver of where we re going but we saw an opportunity and it made sense during the quarter andrew terrell stephens analyst understood thank you and then aaron i apologize if i missed this but do you have the yield for the new securities purchased during the quarter aaron j deer executive vice president and chief financial officer the new purchases were the average was 1 48 and encouraging that we ve seen an upward trend in that not surprisingly given what we ve seen in the rising slope of the curve so hopefully we ll see that trend higher from here andrew terrell stephens analyst got it thanks okay the rest of mine were asked and answered already i appreciate it operator thank you and i am showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back over to mr stein for any closing remarks clint stein president chief executive officer thank you for attending our third quarter

discuss third quarter financial results and provide you with updated earnings guidance for 2021 then we ll be happy to take your questions john john b kilroy chief executive officer and chairman thanks michelle hello everybody thank you for joining us today i ll start with some macroeconomic comments before getting into our leasing and capital allocation it s been just over 1 5 years since the pandemic began and we are really starting to see the revitalization of cities across the west coast city drillers are returning to their urban apartments and once again embracing city life after a tough 2020 residential net absorption is approaching 100 000 units in our five markets driven in large part by high density areas like hollywood south of market downtown seattle and downtown austin restaurants bars coffeehouses are full concerts and sporting events have returned and slowly but surely more companies are coming back to the office the recent easing of the san francisco mask mandate is another step in the right direction that we believe will continue to encourage more infers and gatherings and collaborations the technology and life science companies that make up so much of our portfolio continue to thrive stock prices are near all time highs and vc fundraising is on track for a record year which is translating into a war for talent growth in job postings and additional real estate procurement improving market conditions helped to drive a strong and productive leasing quarter for kilroy we signed more leases in the third quarter than the first two quarters of 2021 combined since the second quarter we have signed just under 600 000 square feet of development new and renewal leases for the 510 000 square feet in the stabilized portfolio that were signed gaap rents were up on average 26 and cash rents were up 14 additionally we have a number of leases under documentation and in austin we re very encouraged with the market and our early stage lease negotiations a few facts according to recent reports about austin there are 185 people moving to austin on average each day and interest among companies wanting to move to austin and those that want to expand in austin is above pre pandemic levels let s look at some of these transactions in the office sector we signed a long term 71 000 square foot lease in the utc submarket of san diego the lease is for a new development projects which we commenced construction on just last month so now it s 100 leased just a month after starting construction the competition between technology tenants and life science tenants remains healthy both sectors continue to grow and seek more modern efficient work environments in life science the third quarter was particularly active for us we signed three leases totaling 330 000 square feet of headquarters space with publicly traded companies in san diego including tandem diabetes care dermtech and sorrento therapeutics the mark to market rent increases on these three leases were approximately 45 with an average term of approximately 12 years in residential we now have fully leased all 608 units in our one paseo project at rent levels that have increased 25 since the beginning of the year jardine our hollywood luxury tower that was completed last quarter is now more than 60 leased well ahead of projections with respect to leasing i d like to highlight the following trends which we feel bode well for the future of our enterprise sentiment among corporate real estate executives is more positive than it has been in the past 18 months we re experiencing significantly more tours and requests for proposals within our portfolio this is both for existing and development projects rental rates and strategically located modern buildings are on the rise as the result of tenants seeking the best space in the market vibrant and distinctive office curated retail and residential experiences are drawing a talented labor force back to metropolitan areas moving to our capital allocation activities we made two significant announcements during the quarter first in september we completed the off market acquisition of west 8th in the denny regrade submarket of seattle for 490 million west 8th is a 539 000 square foot lead platinum office tower situated on a full city block just steps from amazon s five million square foot headquarters campus we like the opportunity for a number of reasons the location is terrific with unmatched transit access and proximity to numerous retail amenities rents continue to increase in this submarket and we see significant rental upside and given the quality and condition of the building we expect limited capital investment in any releasing scenario year to date this brings our total acquisitions to 1 2 billion which have been funded by our 1 1 billion dispositions the second announcement relates to our continued allocation of capital to our life science platform earlier this year we commenced construction on the second phase of our approximately 50 acre three million square foot oyster point project which is a life science campus in south san francisco kop 2 which totals just under 900 000 square feet across three buildings will be a home to numerous amenities that will serve all phases we are particularly excited about phase two given the strong demand rising rental rates and timing no other competitive project will be delivering in this time frame we are in early discussions with multiple prospective tenants interested in securing major portions of the project and expect even more interest in the buildings once construction goes vertical in the first quarter of next year in addition to kop we are expanding our san diego life science significantly availability for top tier space in the region s most sought after life science submarkets is essentially nonexistent barriers to entry are high and rental rates are at historic levels and we are capitalizing on these dynamics in del mar utc and the i 56 corridor where we have modern highly convertible assets and a land pipeline in the utc and del mar submarkets as i noted in my earlier remarks we signed 330 000 square feet of pre leases across three buildings which will be converted to life science use and just a few miles east on the 56 corridor we expect to commence construction next year on the first of two phases of our santa fe summit project each phase consists of approximately 300 000 square feet to summarize we will deliver 2 5 million square feet of state of the art life science facilities over the next 30 months and over time the three future phases of kilroy oyster point will expand our life science portfolio by another 1 5 million to two million square feet when completed we have assembled a best in class life science portfolio in the strongest locations which will total 5 5 million square feet with an average age under five years with full buildout life science and healthcare tenants will be 25 to 30 of our noi lastly delivering our in process development and positioning our future development projects remain a high priority in our capital allocation strategy we have 2 6 billion of in process projects on track for completion over the next two years this pipeline is 52 leased and 74 leased when excluding the just commenced kop 2 which we started five months ago they will generate approximately 170 million in incremental cash noi when stabilized which will grow our current annual noi by more than 20 all else being equal the cost is fully funded through the year end 2022 i ll wrap up with a few final observations in nearly every conversation we were having these days with our tenants and potential tenants one big theme emerges companies want a work environment that attracts excites and motivates their workforce they want location scale a contemporary design a healthy environment and relaxed ambience that will draw people in and support their creativity and productivity this is the most profound impact the pandemic has had on the office sector and we think krc is well positioned to capitalize on these conditions over the last 10 years we created the youngest best in class platforms across office life science and residential and we are poised to deliver strong growth and value creation over the coming decade we re more encouraged every day about our market s recoveries the reopening is going to happen in fits and starts but it is happening and a final comment on sustainability in gresb rankings we have been named number one in sustainability across all publicly traded companies across all asset classes in the americas for the eighth year running that completes my remarks now i ll turn it back over to michelle michelle ngo chief financial officer senior vice president and treasurer thank you john ffo was 0 98 per share in the third quarter quarter over quarter the 0 10 increase was largely driven by the acquisitions to date noi contribution from our one paseo office and our residential projects as well as 0 015 of lease termination fees on a year over year basis as a reminder the sale of the exchange had an impact of approximately 0 13 of ffo per share on a same store basis third quarter cash noi was up 16 6 reflecting strong rent growth and a 17 million cash termination payment gaap same store noi was up 3 2 this termination payment is related to the new 12 year lease we executed at 12400 high bluff for 182 000 square feet of space on an earnings basis approximately 7 million which is a net amount after lease write offs will be amortized over the next three years 700 000 of it was included in the third quarter adjusted for termination payments same store cash noi was 3 7 and same store gaap noi was up 2 2 at the end of the third quarter our stabilized portfolio was 91 5 occupied and 93 9 leased third quarter occupancy was down 30 basis points from the prior quarter driven by approximately 90 000 square feet of move outs offset by the west 8th acquisition and the cytokinetics lease at kop 1 which was added to the stabilized portfolio at the end of the quarter revenue recognition for 100 of this 235 000 square foot building commenced october first turning to the balance sheet after funding the west 8th acquisition for 490 million issuing 450 million of green bonds which closed october seven and the redemption of 300 million of 3 8 bonds which was completed earlier in the week our liquidity today stands at approximately 1 5 billion including 390 million in cash and full availability of the 1 1 billion under the revolver we have no material debt maturities until december 2024 our net debt to q3 annualized ebitda was 6 7 times pro forma for the bond activities noted above which should decline as we continue to deliver our lease development projects all else being equal lastly our expirations over the next five years remain modest with an annual average expiration of 7 2 excluding any impact from directv we do not have an update to provide on the directv matter at this time in 2022 we only have one lease expiration greater than 100 000 square feet in san diego this tenant is likely to this tenant is expected to vacate in early 2022 now let s discuss our 2021 guidance provided in the yesterday s earnings release to begin let me remind you that we approach our near term performance forecasting with a high degree of caution given all the uncertainties in today s economy our current guidance reflects information and market intelligence as we know it today any covid related restrictions or significant shifts in the economy our markets tenant demand construction costs and new supply going forward could have a meaningful impact on our results in ways not currently reflected in our analysis projected revenue recognition dates are subject to several factors that we can t control including the timing of tenant occupancies with those caveats our assumptions for 2021 are as follows cap interest is expected to be approximately 80 million same store cash noi growth is expected to be between 5 and 5 5 for the year we expect year end occupancy of approximately sorry of approximately 91 5 for the office portfolio and north of 80 for residential our guidance does not assume a material increase in transient parking but as we ve noted on prior calls we expect to pick up 1 million a month when we get back to pre covid levels with respect to the three san diego life science transactions we will be adding them to the redevelopment portfolio and capping interest in phases as follows on average we are modeling six to nine months of redevelopment which are estimates based on what we know today and could be impacted by a variety of factors including tenant modifications at 12340 el camino real which is 100 leased to dermtech we expect to add this 96 000 square foot building to the redevelopment pipeline this quarter at 12400 high bluff which is approximately 85 leased to tandem diabetes we expect to add 75 of this 182 000 square foot lease to the redevelopment pipeline in late 1q next year at 4690 executive drive which is 100 leased to sorrento therapeutics we expect to add this 52 000 square foot lease to the redevelopment pipeline in two phases half in late 1q next year and the remainder in early 2023 we do not have any additional acquisitions in our forecast taking into account all these assumptions we project 2021 ffo per share to range between 3 74 to 3 80 with a midpoint of 3 77 this updated midpoint is the same as our prior guidance even after including the debt redemption costs of 0 115 in the fourth quarter this is largely driven by the acquisition of west 8th which contributed 0 06 to our results and earlier revenue recognition of cytokinetics and better operating results including 0 015 of lease termination fees all totaling 5 5 0 55 excluding the 0 115 of debt redemption cost the midpoint of our guidance would have been up 3 or 3 89 of ffo per share that completes my remarks now we ll be happy to take your questions operator questions and answers operator the first question comes from nick yulico from scotiabank nick yulico scotiabank analyst maybe just first question if rob could perhaps go through some of the leasing dynamics you re seeing in your markets a robert paratte executive vice president of leasing and business development sure nick and hello everybody let me start with some highlights that i think may address questions that others have and there are four key ones i d like to make what we re seeing on the ground and this isn t necessarily just strictly our five markets that we operate in i think it s a national trend but the office will remain the center of the work ecosystem it may change in its configuration but it s going to remain the place where people come to conduct meetings and collaborate and we re seeing companies both our clients and others spending a lot of money on their office space so i think that s one important point hybrid work is going to be given we know that the third point i d make is that the net impact of hybrid work we think is going to be minimal in terms of space demand reduction or footprint shrinkage recently cbre conducted a survey nationally of 185 companies and only 9 of those surveyed expect to experience a decrease in square footage so i think that s really telling and as john alluded to in his comments health safety and wellness are going to continue to be a very high importance to employees so you will see a flight to quality as we ve talked about to buildings that provide that sort of outdoor space stairwells where you can walk rather than take elevators etc going into the markets just some overall general again highlights true activity across our five markets has continued to increase particularly in san francisco restaurants retail and hospitality are visibly improved in terms of just sheer numbers of people in the streets and bars and restaurants driving in this week to san francisco it s truly amazing at 08 00 or 8 30 in the morning seeing the number of people that are in coffee houses and coffee shops gathering and enjoying one another our parking garage here where john and i office at 101st two months ago was relatively empty and today and yesterday they already had the full sign out so the traffic is back and we re starting to see a major increase in parking occupancy what i would say another interesting note is that despite all of the work from home and postponement of people coming back in conversations with many of our clients a large majority of them have opened up offices on a voluntary basis to people and you can see that in the lobbies of various buildings particularly in san francisco with relation to office occupancy austin is probably the leader in the country with almost 50 occupancy san francisco and san jose are trailing other metro areas at roughly 20 but those two markets are increasing fairly quickly primarily because san francisco relapsed its mask mandate on october 15 the last thing i d say is the general commentary is that real estate executives are focusing on two primary things today when they re doing their planning it s what will hybrid work models look like and what will these work models mean in terms of future space requirements and needs within the office environment and then i ll just touch on our markets quickly and then if you have more questions go ahead san diego let s start at the south and work north san diego s large tech and local vc backed companies are extremely active right now to be honest fire category and legal requirements are slower to emerge but we re starting to see an uptick i know people have questions about 2100 kettner we ve seen a pretty significant uptick in activity in fact last week we had three tours alone we received a rfp yesterday and we are pursuing a multi tenant strategy at the project based on the activity we re experiencing today in los angeles more positive news and i think it s really focused in the culver city hollywood and west l a portions of the market we re seeing a reduction of space on the market as sublease space is either leased or taken off the market particularly in west l a continued expansion of gaming media and technology companies are focused on west l a culver city and santa monica and there s demonstrated proof just by the absorption recent new significant deals in the market are apple roku hulu activision snap riot sony and amazon and that s very encouraging compared to where we were a year ago with particularly the west side where there was more sublease space on the market that had been there for quite a while quality assets and i would say this is sort of a general comment in our markets quality class a assets that are well located are able to hold rates here and there there may be some added concessions but generally there is a flight to quality and landlords are able to maintain rates san francisco again we are hoping that we ve plateaued and started to see a slight decrease in sublease space we re down to seven million square feet from nine million square feet we have in q3 which is pretty encouraging 2 25 million square feet of lease deals signed which brings us to a total of 3 9 million square feet for year to date that s the highest level of activity since q4 of 2019 so we re watching this very closely and hoping that we are turning the corner here right now today there are seven tenants in the market over 100 000 square feet one thing i d like to finish with san francisco because again it probably out of our markets has the most sublease space and has been the focus of many questions and that sort of thing is that the city really is going to moving into a haves and have nots and to illustrate that point i d point out that for trophy buildings most landlords on average have increased their asking rates to an average of 98 36 a foot on a fully serviced basis and when you contrast that with class b buildings they ve been lowering their asking rates to 72 a foot so there s a real disparity between class a trophy and class b space and sublease space would fall into that latter category and that data is borne out by jll so again we re watching that closely luckily we don t have a lot of space available right now and so we see continued improvement in san francisco and again as i said earlier hopefully we re plateauing south san francisco is a great story i could go on and on but we re very pleased with the activity we have we are we have just started our phase two at kilroy oyster point we re seeing very strong demand when we deliver in and around 23 we think the window will be optimal given that there s very little product competing with us at that time and i would the last thing i d say about south san francisco is projects that are vertical meaning they re under construction and starting to appear in the skyline are either fully leased or the space is largely committed so again we re feeling very good about not only the absorption of space but also what we see happening with rental rates in san francisco moving to seattle again just a very good story particularly for 1 5 years we talked about how strong the bellevue market is but the cbd of seattle is really coming into its own sublease space has continued to decline we ve seen rental rates tick up slightly in class a again trophy well located product the rainier square new product that amazon has been subleasing in the cbd the traditional cbd continues to have a lot of activity and it s leasing up and so we think that bodes really well for our recent west 8th acquisition which is in the most highly amenitized modern portion of the market and we also are noticing that that shift toward this modern amenity base in and around the west 8th area where our six0 project is creating more interest from companies even outside of the seattle area so more to come on that but seattle is really coming into its own the last market i would probably want to focus on is austin we re very pleased as john said with what we have going on in austin we have over 200 000 square feet of activity at our building right now in some stages of documentation i don t want to make any promises about timing those companies sort of run the range from professional services to tech and the last thing i would note is that there are two pending i think i ve said this before during baml there are two large pending transactions that total over 900 000 square feet that are imminent in the cbd and that bodes even better for r d tower there also was one large transaction tech transaction that closed in the domain submarket that was over 300 000 feet so all in all that s the wrap up on the markets and we re feeling better about everything we re seeing in each of the submarkets nick yulico scotiabank analyst that s very helpful just on oyster point can you remind us i guess two things one can you just give us a feel for where market rents are right now and then separately remind us how on phase one the rest of the noi is going to flowing from a gaap standpoint over the next couple of quarters a robert paratte executive vice president of leasing and business development yes nick i ll handle the first one i don t want to pinpoint because the market is moving and it s moving in the right direction but safe to say i think rents are achieving 7 net right now and will exceed that just based on the absorption that s going on in the activity michelle ngo chief financial officer senior vice president and treasurer yes nick with respect to kop phase one and the remaining revenue commencement we said cytokinetics commenced in early october and stripe who occupies the remaining two buildings will come online in november operator the next question comes from manny korchman with citi manny korchman citi analyst maybe as you expand the development pipeline have you seen any issues with the supply chain disruption or especially since i feel like some of it s coming a little bit faster than you expected john b kilroy chief executive officer and chairman yes manny this is john we obviously have a group that monitors all of that stuff and there are some disruptions for sure we made it a decision at kilroy a couple of years ago that we were going to reduce our dependence upon offshore suppliers as much as we could possibly do and we have but we are still dependent because of steel we don t fabricate any steel in china but you have to buy the bulk steel bring it here we re very focused on what we can control and so as you probably know there s a lot of ships that are at anchor waiting to unload all of our ports and we ve been very focused on making sure that the stuff we have coming from offshore is going to ports that don t have the jam up that l a has as an example in regards to delivery of things we forecast everything that takes longer and with regard to construction costs we ve been forecasting anywhere from 5 to 6 per annum increases across the board and cost and we ve done better than that everything that we have under development right now has been bought things that we are going to start we will buy we ve had pretty good luck in that regard we ve been able to deliver everything at or below what we forecasted but we re keeping a close eye we ve had to make some selections of alternative materials in a few cases to make sure that we don t have a supply problem so that s kind of a general comments and more to come but we do have a pretty robust risk management function within our construction development activities manny korchman citi analyst and michelle going back to your prepared remarks you spoke about one large vacate in i think you said early 22 if i look at your exploration schedule for 22 if that vacates in the first quarter it seems like those rents are sort of well below the rest of your portfolio and i m wondering if this tenant falls into that or otherwise if you could just give us some more details on the move out michelle ngo chief financial officer senior vice president and treasurer yes rob i don t know if you have any color on the move outs but i guess with respect to market rents i d say last quarter we said across our portfolio rents are about 15 below market i think in looking at 22 explorations it s in that 20 to 25 below market range a robert paratte executive vice president of leasing and business development yes manny this is rob just a little more color we ve anticipated this vacate we ve been talking to the tenant off and on some of their work is related to the government and contracting and so we are pursuing and have activity sort of in a wide variety of sizes somewhere from 50 000 feet to in excess of 100 000 feet so given we haven t gotten the space back yet we re already working on some things and feel pretty good about it there s a lot of activity as john said in his comments just a lot of activity out in that corridor right now manny korchman citi analyst and michelle just from a modeling perspective can you be more specific on the timing we should assume for next year michelle ngo chief financial officer senior vice president and treasurer it s in the first quarter operator the next question comes from jamie feldman of bank of america jamie feldman bank of america analyst great just to confirm what was the size of the san diego move out michelle ngo chief financial officer senior vice president and treasurer it s about 125 000 to 130 000 square feet jamie feldman bank of america analyst okay and then i guess thinking about next year it sounds like you think nothing else sizable michelle ngo chief financial officer senior vice president and treasurer no that was the only sizable one jamie feldman bank of america analyst okay just looking at first of all i d like the revised supplemental so thanks for freshening it up it s great page 30 to have the future development pipeline i m just curious what your thoughts are given the multiyear lead time to get something built what are your thoughts on starting incremental projects now it seems like you guys think the markets are starting to recover john b kilroy chief executive officer and chairman well this is john we are as i mentioned in my comments we will be starting phase the first phase of what of the two phases that remain at santa fe summit that s about 300 000 square feet so we have two we have two phases there for 600 000 feet it could be that we start both if we have if we ve leased one of the phases so that will that s going to commence next year we ve got a few other things that we re looking at but nothing to announce at this point from an entitlement standpoint we did receive all our entitlements now for the flower mart we were able to revise the phasing and whatnot on that project to be roughly plus or minus 500 000 square feet per increment which is very good but we don t have any plans to start that right away we want to see the market solidify here in san francisco and then we have our six0 project up in seattle but that i think is about a year away from being able to start we do have a little project i failed to mention that is on 26th street in santa monica it s an existing building of about 40 000 square feet that will be remodeled and then about another roughly 100 000 square feet plus or minus in two adjacent buildings that we re receiving approval on and that will be sort of a low rise very modern campus and we could end up starting that next year which we d be inclined to do because we already have pretty strong demand for it so that s sort of the development view that we have right now we are readying phase three and four of kilroy oyster point and we re not ordering material but we are want to be in a position to start that as soon as we made some leasing progress at kop 2 jamie feldman bank of america analyst okay and i mean the announcements of expansion in austin just continue any latest thoughts on how you can grow there beyond indeed a robert paratte executive vice president of leasing and business development i don t want to share them publicly for competitive reasons because it is a competitive market but elliot and his team have been working on a number of things there and we re hopeful that we re going to be able to complete some other things maybe as early as this quarter but maybe it will be next year but you re quite right i mean what we see there is that it sort of reminds me jamie of when we bought oyster point and cambridge was at sort of 90 triple net and oyster point area was sort of at 55 56 57 triple net and we said we think the same these are the same tenants they re going to end up paying more like cambridge prices in due course and that s exactly what s happened at oyster point and now cambridge as you know is well north of 100 triple net and it s the same tenants that are paying higher rents around the world that are moving into austin and at least in the big tech i think there s going to be a lot of lift we re not really interested in older product that doesn t meet the demands and needs of the modern tenant unless it s an old building with a lot of floor height that we can convert so we are scouring the market regularly we re in negotiations all the time nothing now to report but hopefully something will break loose here in the next few quarters operator the next question comes from derek johnston with deutsche bank derek johnston deutsche bank analyst l a l a remains a bit of a hole in the portfolio and really what otherwise is pretty well occupied i think it s around 87 what do you see going on in that market and what s it going to take to get back to the 90s or maybe even 95 or higher basically in line with your other core markets john b kilroy chief executive officer and chairman yes this is john i m going to turn it over to rob here in a minute but if you look at l a there are a lot of big tenants and there are a lot of small tenants and small tenants have lagged in this pandemic area for obvious reasons it s easier for them to move into the home or move into wherever they re moving there are more of those kinds of spaces available but we are seeing really strong signs of life the big users as rob pointed out are making moves forward we re seeing a lot more requests for proposals we ve done an awful lot of little deals recently and rob do you want to add a little bit more color on that a robert paratte executive vice president of leasing and business development yes i guess what i would say derek is that l a is such a large market when you really look at it considering it can run from long beach all the way up to thousand oaks and carlsbad excuse me and calabasas and so it is a function of very many submarkets we don t focus on downtown l a west l a as i said in my comments earlier did have quite a bit of space on the market between 2100 colorado and santa monica business park and the water garden but particularly at santa monica business park and colorado they ve had significant absorption and the gaming industry is actually coming out of sort of from the background now competing with tech companies for space on the west side so we re seeing i guess i would say culver and hollywood have been fairly stable throughout the pandemic because of all the film production and those locations are just attractive to the media companies and i think what s happened is that west l a and particularly deeper into the west side like santa monica you re starting to see that increase in activity and it s starting at the big tenant level like the names i went through but to john s point smaller sized firms are now starting to surface they really didn t when you look about it if you re if a city is shut down and you re not going into the office and you don t have to do something with a lease you re not going to do it and they haven t for about 1 5 years but we re starting to see more activity in that smaller john b kilroy chief executive officer and chairman well if you look at as an example our tribeca west project which is very much geared toward shorter term production directors all that movie content stuff a lot of those people could go to work last year now all of a sudden our occupancy is increasing substantially so as things loosen up people get back to work they need space to work and they lease space so that s a good trend that s what we re saying derek johnston deutsche bank analyst all right great color last one so looking at some office companies that have already reported so far they seem to have been able to drive longer term commitments from the tenants i know you guys were always a little lighter on term historically but is this like a california thing or a tech issue and could you share any insight on when you think your lease terms will return to like the seven to 10 year levels and what john b kilroy chief executive officer and chairman well i don t know how you re getting that statistic and michelle or rob you can help me but i think kilroy has had among the longest term leases because we do so much with big companies and those are generally anywhere from 10 to 16 17 years so i m not quite sure where that s coming from and so tyler h rose president and company secretary derek this is tyler i think what you re looking at is the lease term on some of our renewals within the high four year range but if you take into consideration the leases we signed in san diego which are not in that category those were averaging over 11 years so the average lease term for what we actually leased last quarter was 9 5 years so it s still in line with what we ve been doing it s a little hard to follow in those numbers operator the next question comes from steve sakwa with evercore isi steve sakwa evercore isi analyst i was just wondering maybe rob if you could maybe touch a little bit on the life science demand specifically in south san francisco i realize that kop two doesn t have steel coming out of the ground but maybe what are your expectations on timing and maybe you or john could just address the broader infrastructure issues in south san francisco and how you guys sort of think about mass transit getting everybody that s going to be coming to that entire area as genentech looks to double their footprint and you and many of your peers look to continue to add density to south san francisco a robert paratte executive vice president of leasing and business development yes i look at this a little bit as fly fishing steve you ve dangled the fly out there but i m not going to snap at the fly with respect to timing and what we re doing and when we ll be able to announce something but i would say that demand in the market even though there s been tremendous absorption in the market today demand is still tracking at about four million square feet so as space gets absorbed there s new demand appearing so that s a very positive sign as i mentioned earlier rental rates are on the move and we re very pleased by that so and then with respect to the second part of your question we are in a lot of discussions with not only our existing tenants but potential tenants and others that are our neighbors on a variety of transportation solutions and ideas and so it s something that everyone in oyster point and frankly everyone in an urban area is going to have to address at some point it s circulation and moving people around but i think one of the best assets we have is the bay and genentech as an example has a very significant robust ferry service that they run throughout the bay area steve sakwa evercore isi analyst okay and maybe piggybacking off one other question on austin and just your desire to grow down there i guess john have you gotten closer to formalizing or finalizing who might be running that region and sort of how you think about whether it s an internal external candidate john b kilroy chief executive officer and chairman yes we have identified and it s somebody from within that will be running it from an asset management standpoint from a leasing standpoint obviously rob has the all event responsibility and has a very firm handle on that we have one of our top leasing people from this area here in san francisco who is responsible for the leasing currently at indeed tower as we expand our platform there we re obviously going to need more bodies and we re working on that we ve been going through that process nothing to announce right now but we re very actively looking not only to have the management team that we want and we have some really good candidates where we ve been interviewing candidates now for several months right rob a robert paratte executive vice president of leasing and business development yes yes john b kilroy chief executive officer and chairman and we re down to a couple three that we think could end up being very senior to our efforts there the underwriting with regards to all the math the investment leads and so forth that s elliott and his team jeff jesse one of his young superstars is very involved in everything to do at austin so we re going to have a great team and we re going to have the kind of team we ve had in our other areas which is capable of acquisitions dispositions if and when that becomes appropriate obviously development and then managing and we re spending a lot of time with our tenant base many of whom are in austin and growing in austin and have future plans to grow in austin about what we re doing and so forth and i think that s encouraging so more to come steve sakwa evercore isi analyst okay and then maybe just last question john on the flower mart i know there s some flexibility on that site but how do you sort of think about the toggling between office and residential and would you look to maybe shrink the office component add residential to maybe jump start that project or how do you sort of think about that moving forward john b kilroy chief executive officer and chairman yes well our basis is pretty attractive and i ve always said that we re not going to be doing stupid things in the short term that impact negatively the long term you re quite right we can do residential the key was to get the entitlements for the office we now have the largest entitled property i think in recent history if not ever in san francisco for office seven acres roughly 2 5 million square feet you can go from office to resi you can t with prop in go from resi to office so we sort of have an ideal menu if you will and we have a big enough site and three major streets so we can slice and dice as we want to as i started to say earlier the with there s been a lack of clarity for sure with regard to when things are going to roll back in san francisco we re seeing the apartments come back with a vengeance and my understanding is they re getting record rates and once again it s tough to find apartments and one of the things that s happened in apartments is that where sometimes kids were loading up three or four people to a two bedroom they don t want to do that anymore they want greater distance so what rob talked about a greater amount of square feet per person in office it s sort of the same thing happening in residential so we re going to see how this plays out here probably over this next there s no time line but over the next several quarters and we ll make a decision how we want to do things but we like optionality and whether it s our property up in the six zero up in seattle or whether it s the flower mart or whether it s the two blocks we own in east village in san diego we have the ability to go office we have the ability to go residential we have the ability to go some combination thereof and we have the ability to add retail if we want so we have lots of flexibility operator the next question comes from john kim with bmo capital markets john kim bmo capital markets analyst i wanted to follow up on derek s question on lease terms because if you look on page 18 of your supplement on leases executed most of these leases were new leases and average lease term is about 4 3 years so i was wondering if leases have come down on term if there s been any month to month that s in there that s driving that number down tyler h rose president and company secretary again the redevelopment leases that we signed in san diego are not in that category so those are the leases in our stabilized portfolio so when you add in the leases that are not in that category it s 9 5 year average michelle ngo chief financial officer senior vice president and treasurer yes and just to clarify so the lease numbers include the redevelopment leases but the lease economics that you see in the weighted average term does not reflect the term of the three redevelopment leases which are on average about 12 years john kim bmo capital markets analyst right so you have some redevelopment in life science leases that are long term and then you have others that are the tenant is committing on a shorter term basis tyler h rose president and company secretary right michelle ngo chief financial officer senior vice president and treasurer that s correct john kim bmo capital markets analyst okay rob you mentioned in your prepared remarks or sorry in an answer the bifurcation between trophy and class b performance i know most of your portfolio is class a and trophy and that s what we focus on but what percentage of your portfolio do you think is in that other category a robert paratte executive vice president of leasing and business development i don t think we have any i mean i m drinking the kool aid but i don t think we have any beer certainly no obsolete projects and as john said we ve got probably the youngest portfolio in the reit industry so i don t think we have any john kim bmo capital markets analyst can you also comment on sublease space in your portfolio i know you talked about the market overall but what s in your in the kilroy portfolio a robert paratte executive vice president of leasing and business development yes probably the largest piece of sublease space is the 350 mission sales force sublease a good portion of that has recently been absorbed and they re continuing to market the balance of the space i m not sure today whether they intend to take some of that off the market and occupy because they re as you know they re downtown campus here right outside john s office multiple buildings have a lot of people back in at work and we know they ve also started bringing sales teams back in on a mandatory basis here and there for meetings so more to come on that but that s the largest operator the next question comes from blaine heck with wells fargo blaine heck wells fargo analyst just one for me probably for john or rob during the pandemic obviously office leasing activity was down everywhere but maybe focusing on the bay area it seemed like the valley did a little bit better than san francisco cbd where you saw obviously a lot of the sublease space flood the market you guys talked about the cbd market showing some encouraging signs lately which is great but how do you think about any differences in the recovery in the valley versus san francisco cbd in particular a robert paratte executive vice president of leasing and business development yes blaine we re actually really the valley is very interesting because there s been a tremendous amount of activity and again it s one of the themes that we ve said continually on our calls and investor meetings is that there s the haves and have nots in the valley and it really depends where property is located in proximity to both the major freeway arteries that run to the bay to san francisco but also caltrain and there are some really significant transactions that have happened in the last three to four months apple being brought probably primary at over 500 000 feet of new absorption but there are other fan companies that are expanding significantly there sony has done another large requirement in the valley and at least our experience with the valley and as it relates to san francisco as these markets sort of operate in tandem and what s happened in past cycles where there s been major absorption in the valley there is a spillover effect to san francisco and so we re starting to watch for that now in the cbd of san francisco but the valley if you just take a step back san francisco was more shut down as i ve said before than any city in the country it s starting to open up the valley was nowhere near as restrictive and so demand and activity have continued to increase

updated october 29 2021 at 6 10 pm et updated nov 2 8 10 p m et children as young as 5 will be able to get vaccinated against covid 19 in the u s within the next several days while some parents aren t sure how they feelabout this others are waiting eagerly for a chance to protect their children from covid 19 but federal agencies can t be rushed here s what has to happen before the pfizer biontech shots can start going into kids arms loading currently pfizer is the furthest along in this process but moderna has shared some promising results from its vaccine trial with this age group and johnson johnson is expected to begin vaccine trials for young kids in the future as well here are more details on what the regulatory process entails and how it is going for the pfizer vaccine step 1 drugmakers complete the clinical trial pfizer and biontech have completed a three phase clinical trial in children 5 to 11 years old the companies submitted all of the data from that trial and an application for emergency use authorization to the food and drug administration on oct 7 the main study included 2 250 kids and found that the lower dose version of the vaccine was 90 7 effective in preventing symptomatic covid 19 it was given as a series of two shots 21 days apart and the dose was 10 micrograms a third of the dose given to adults and teenagers no serious side effects such as heart inflammation were reported although with only a few thousand children included in the research that sort of rare problem wouldn t necessarily be detected step 2 independent scientists review the data this week on oct 26 a panel of outside scientists considered pfizer s safety and efficacy data along with an analysis from fda scientists on the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different pandemic scenarios after some lively discussion the group overwhelmingly voted yes that the benefits of the pfizer vaccine outweigh the risks for use in this age group step 3 fda officials weigh in next the fda the agency itself considered the advisers vote on pfizer s smaller dose shot for kids on friday fda officials decided to extend the emergency use authorization for pfizer s covid 19 vaccine to younger kids acting commissioner dr janet woodcock assured parents in a statement that the agency had rigorously evaluated the data and this vaccine meets our high standards step 4 more independent scientists debate and vote but wait there s more yet another federal health agency and its advisers had to weigh in before the shots can become available this time it s the centers for disease control and prevention you can think of it like this when it comes to vaccines the fda is in charge of the what and the cdc is in charge of the who the cdc s advisory group met tuesday and voted to recommend the vaccine for all children in the 5 11 age group dr amanda cohn served until recently as the executive secretary for the cdc s vaccine advisory group and she s a voting member of the fda s vaccine advisory group explained the difference between the two federal advisory groups that weigh in on these kinds of decisions the fda decides whether a vaccine or other product is safe and effective she explained at the fda advisory meeting this week the cdc s group then considers and votes on who would benefit from the vaccine and who should get vaccinated their deliberations include factors such as equity feasibility and the potential impact of recommendations on a population she said when they vote the cdc s advisers could follow the fda s lead in their recommendations or they could make more focused or nuanced recommendations cohn said for instance they could have recommended it for a certain subgroup like children with underlying conditions or those who haven t had a prior coronavirus infection step 5 cdc director makes final recommendation even then a vote from the cdc s advisers isn t an official recommendation that comes from the cdc s director dr rochelle walensky on tuesday night she greenlit the advisers recommendation if she had chosen to she could have changed the recommendation from what the committee voted on as she did with boosters but she followed their lead and recommended them to all kids aged 5 11 only after the cdc director issues an official recommendation can shots get distributed to pediatricians and pharmacies around the country step 6 the shots get distributed to providers and pharmacies experts have been reassuring the public that the rollout of this new lower dose vaccine won t be a repeat of the disarray of the original covid 19 vaccine rollout last winter we will be ready immediately following fda and cdc s decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly easily and conveniently jeffrey zients the white house s covid 19 response coordinator said at a news conference wednesday the immunization managers planning the rollout in each state feel much more ready this time says claire hannan executive director of the association of immunization managers we have plenty of vaccine and i think that we re very well prepared she says still she warns that parents shouldn t expect that they ll be able to get their kid vaccinated the instant the regulatory hurdles are cleared there will be challenges getting the vaccine to the right providers to meet the demand experts suggest looking out for guidance from your child s pediatrician and school parents will also be able to find pharmacies with pediatric covid 19 shots in stock at vaccines gov a cdc website launched in

matt good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for the third quarter of 2021 we reported net revenues of 3 8 billion a 24 increase over the same quarter last year and adjusted ebitda of 347 million up nearly 14 versus q3 last year and up 34 compared to q3 2019 our adjusted ebitda margin was 9 1 compared to 9 9 a year ago adjusted eps was 0 67 versus 0 66 in the third quarter of 2020 and 0 45 in q3 2019 i m pleased with the performance this quarter as we continued facing challenges resulting from the ongoing pandemic and unprecedented economic conditions in u k our overall portfolio performed well in the third quarter despite labor shortages that affected our product mix in both the u s and u k in u s commodity chicken pricing remained well above 5 year averages and our diverse portfolio allows us to capture the upside while protecting us from future downsides turning to the broader u s market chicken production in q3 increased an estimated 1 8 over last year due to a slight increase in head along with higher average live weights putting production at 0 3 greater on a year to date september basis usda data indicated that the hatch rate continued to decline throughout the quarter suggested limited growth in the next months usda outlook indicates a 0 5 increase in supply in q4 which will take the total increase for the year at 0 3 in the u s market retail demand remained extremely strong throughout the quarter while trip frequency has yet to return to pre covid levels consumers are still buying more units per trip compared to 2019 and demand for fresh chicken remains above the pre covid base line meanwhile retail daily posted improvements year over year and frozen category continues to grow even when compared to extremely strong demand levels in q3 last year foodservice in u s continued to recover as commercial chicken demand was comparable to pre covid levels however the noncommercial channel of foodservice are still slow and chicken demand retained below 2019 levels for noncommercial outlets such as schools and workplace cafeterias the overall increase in demand has maintained pressure on already low cold core storage stocks which remains 17 below september 20 levels as a result of robust demand commodity chicken pricing remains significantly above the 5 year average and only recently began to align with seasonal trends in our u s business demand and pricing has been strong however we have not been able to capture all of this increased demand and pricing due to continued labor shortages the labor shortage and its affects our product mix are ongoing challenges that will be with us for a while affecting our ability to hand portion and trim products that command a higher margin unfortunately labor is a nationwide problem across numerous industries and it will take time to resolve a great example of our key customer partnership with our retail customers was to demonstrate our flexibility to itemize our product mix to continue to provide superior levels of services in the u s market retail sales in q3 had a difficult comparison versus 2020 pantry loading but still remain comfortably above 2019 levels in the fresh and frozen segments however given the trip frequency reduction retail daily sales are still down versus 2019 but we see upside potential in this category as the improvements in unit sales continued commercial foodservice in u s has experienced continued strength with full service restaurant demand improving again in q3 with a second consecutive quarter of double digit year over year growth while qsr demand remains robust with q3 improving 6 versus 2020 and nearly 14 nearly versus 2019 we continue to monitor the commercial foodservice demand while the industry address labor shortages the noncommercial channel demonstrated strong year over year improvements with the reopening of schools however the channel continues to lag 2019 levels pilgrim s has adjusted volume and mix between channels to adapt to changing consumer demand patterns we are well positioned to adjust production and channel mix given our presence across all bird sizes from large to small commodity large bird deboning continued its momentum throughout the year and once again generated significant improvements year over year chicken remains the most affordable meat protein which supports the growth in the commodity sector the volume revenue and profit growth were driven by support from foodservice demand and overall strong market pricing our case ready business delivered volume and revenue growth versus the prior year but is pressured by the increase in grain and labor cost we adjusted prices in the second quarter and continued operational improvements to adjust these cost headwinds we continue to partner with key customers to deliver both growth and value for them strong qsr and retail daily demand drove year over year improvements in our small bird business we continue to see strength in this business unit with our partnership with key qsr customers in our u s prepared foods business q3 sales grew 45 year over year driven by price adjustments to cover high input costs including meat labor ingredients and supplies year over year sales volume was up 6 5 driven by strong demand of our retail consumer brands just bare and pilgrim s our volume in the consumer channel was up 16 versus q3 last year and more than double 2019 levels as we are seeing the results of our efforts to positively grow our retail brands supported by digital marketing we continue to gain distribution and build the just bare brand through e commerce retail and club stores and we had an additional boost in brand awareness from successful social media advertising and great customer reviews corn prices moderated in q3 as the u s began harvesting what is expected to be the largest crop since 2016 usda is currently projecting a corn crop of just over 15 billion bushels which is expected to increase from the carryout from 1 2 billion bushels last year to 1 5 billion bushels this year even with a large estimate for u s export demand china is also expected to see a recovery in supply after importing 28 million tons of corn this year while also seeing a 13 million ton increase in their domestic production although global energy and wheat markets are supporting corn currently global stocks are in a better position than they were last crop year soybean meal prices also fell during the quarter on expectations that the u s suppliers will build from last year usda is currently projecting a carryout of 320 million bushels up from 256 million last year export demand is also expected to fall 8 from last year on lower demand from china in addition to the u s supplies brazil is expected to produce a record 144 million tons which should build global stocks even further meal prices are also being depressed by the large expected increase in demand for soybean oil into the renewable diesel which is driving soybean oil prices higher european feed wheat prices increased in q3 despite a 13 million ton increase in domestic production in the u k specifically where we source the majority of our wheat we have seen a 50 increase in production from last year s poor harvest stocks in the main exporting countries declined again this year driven lower by our large drop in russian wheat production export tariffs in russia are also having a negative impact on the production and availability of exportable wheat out of the black sea overall we feel confident in large supplies of corn and soybean that should be a tailwind for feed cost in u s and mexico going into 2022 while wheat prices continue to remain high until we see a relief in global supplies next summer usda chicken inventory was flat from june to september a period of time in which seasonal increases in total inventories will be expected and remains down 17 from previous year combined meat inventories have increased by 11 from june but are down 17 year over year which is in line with expectations despite continued export supply chain disruptions regarding exports although the data is still incomplete for q3 throughout august total usda broiler exports including paws grew by 6 6 driven by mexico up 27 exports to china grew 4 primarily due to the paw market which made up nearly 62 of china s u s poultry imports the increase in poultry export volumes and value are driven by the competitiveness of u s poultry restrictions due to the avian influenza and shipping bottlenecks around the world we are optimistic that countries with covid restrictions will ease through q4 and will further support u s export demand pilgrim s export volume grew combined to outpace the industry and we are utilizing additional ports to avoid congestion on the east coast and in the gulf of mexico our u s operations has managed to increase labor costs and higher grain prices through the benefit of a strong cutout and increased pricing to our customer base to recover these higher input costs while effective operations are helping us to control costs following our strategy of diversified portfolio and balance of cost plus market and fixed pricing contract structures provide us the platform to manage throughout the volatility of our input costs also our team has done a fantastic job navigating both supply chain disruptions such as trucker shortages and inflationary pressures to support our key customers and deliver strong quarterly results turning to our international business mexico continues to perform well although easing from the levels achieved in q2 as expected due to the seasonality of the business in addition we re beginning to see the effects of inflation on inputs grain pricing however has moderated since the first half of the year allowing for more competitors to reenter the market also during the quarter we saw a significant increase in chicken and pork imports into mexico causing pressure on market pricing we continue to focus on our business through process improvements in our fresh business as prepared foods saw ongoing growth in qsr and foodservice in addition to growth in our retail brands pilgrim s del dia and alamesa during q3 we experienced unprecedented challenges in u k due to the current economic environment we were faced with sudden serious labor shortages as eu workers returned home following brexit affecting our ability to process back and transport products this is in addition to the significant cost pressure from feed ingredients especially oils and micronuclei and increased cost for utilities logistics labor and packaging with these hits to our cost moy park s ebit was impacted both versus q3 last year and versus the prior quarter although sales were robust they were at significantly reduced margins as we experienced unprecedented costs to clear the backlog of birds we have been unable to process we began to see price recovery at the end of the quarter as we open negotiations with our customers to recoup some of the extraordinary costs we experienced including a recent 300 increase in co2 costs due to the much publicized fertilizer company slowdowns in u k this should provide support to margins as we move into q4 we will continue to focus on operational excellence initiatives that deliver labor efficiencies better agricultural performance and improving yields in order to maintain our supply to key customers and superior levels of services as in previous quarter we are seeing consistent improvements in the moy park foodservice division and we expect this channel will see significant recovery as covid restrictions are lifted across the u k and european markets relative to the industry over the past 12 months moy park continues to outperform the average of the competitors in europe and we will continue to deploy capex on projects that drive quality safety and efficiency through reduced labor that tends to be an issue through the moy park business the pilgrim s u k business continued to be severely impacted by increased grain costs and low hog prices due to the high supply in europe despite market challenges including worsening labor availability and inflationary pressures in u k we have been profitable on an ebitda basis for the last 12 quarters in a row during q3 pilgrim s u k year over year retail volume remained relatively flat prior to last year while food services volumes demonstrated grow back to pre covid levels also our year over year volumes to china decreased due to the continued suspension of our export license at two plants as a result of covid 19 like moy park pilgrim s u k business has been affected by the labor and truck driver shortage and soaring energy costs in addition pork pricing has been depressed following china s decision to stop accepting hogs from germany while we continue to make progress within our operations the improvements were not enough to overcome the external costs that are pressuring results we are optimistic about building our operational improvements by continuing to optimize our manufacturing footprint extracting best in class operational excellence capitalizing on export opportunities optimizing our portfolio and strengthening our growing business with key customers to drive innovation in value added high margin areas we have a great team in europe dedicated to generating results by focusing on factors within our control while ensuring and protecting the safety and health of our team members we are firmly committed in supporting the u k farming industry and supply our key customers in order to feed the united kingdom and ireland we re also excited about our portfolio products in u k and europe given that on september 24 we closed the kerry food group s meats and meals acquisition going forward this business will be known as pilgrim s food masters pilgrim s food masters will support key customer relationships by providing an array of value added protein products and prepared foods anchored by a portfolio of strong brands as one of the largest protein producers in u k and ireland we see the opportunity to innovate within our key customers and develop new products that will excite consumers in the region under this challenging environment we are pleased with our overall performance and our results in the third quarter we are committed to being the best and most respected company in our industry and remain focused on producing high quality food for people around the world in a sustainable manner while creating the opportunity of a better future for our team members with that i would like to ask our cfo matt galvanoni to discuss our financial results matthew galvanoni chief financial officer thank you fabio and good morning again for the third quarter of 2021 net revenues were 3 83 billion versus 3 8 billion a year ago with an adjusted ebitda of 347 million and a 9 1 margin compared to 305 million and 9 9 margin in q3 last year we achieved 162 5 million of adjusted net income in the quarter we reported gaap net income of 61 million versus gaap net income of 34 million in 2020 the most significant adjustment in the quarter was an additional 126 million accrual related to legal settlements adjusted ebitda margins were 10 7 in the u s 13 1 in mexico and 3 in europe our adjusted ebitda in the u s in q3 was 263 million compared to 180 million a year ago and 176 million in 2019 sales were up due to strong market pricing and slightly higher volumes compared to both 2020 and 2019 gross profit margins were higher compared to both 2020 and 2019 also in mexico adjusted ebitda in q3 was 56 3 million versus 69 2 million a year ago and 45 million in 2019 net sales were up due to higher market pricing and volumes over the last five quarters mexican business has benefited from a balanced market supply demand and dynamic however in addition to seasonal pricing decreases recent increases in chicken and pork imports are headwinds to current market prices for moy park adjusted ebitda in q3 was 19 8 million versus 39 6 million a year ago and 37 9 million in 2019 pilgrim s u k had adjusted ebitda of 8 million in q3 compared to 15 4 million a year ago as fabio previously referenced both moy park and pilgrim s u k results were negatively impacted by labor shortages energy cost increases and transportation challenges as the acquisition of pilgrim s food masters closed at the end of our third quarter financial reporting period we ve only included our preliminary purchase price allocation of the acquisition within our september 26 balance sheet we will begin recording pilgrim s food master s financial results in the fourth quarter in total we incurred covid related costs of approximately 6 2 million in the third quarter however this is a decrease of approximately 19 million compared to the prior year overall our sg a in the third quarter was higher than prior year primarily due to an increase in legal defense costs we ll continue to prioritize our capital spending plans this year to optimize our product mix and strengthen our partnerships with key customers for example during the quarter we invested in automated deboning technology in our live oak florida complex we anticipate our full year 2021 capex spend to be within our previously discussed range of 375 million to 400 million we reiterate our commitment to invest on strong roce projects that will improve our operational efficiencies and tailor our operations to address key customer needs to further solidify competitive advantages for pilgrim s our balance sheet continues to be robust given our relentless emphasis on cash flows from operating activities focus on management of working capital and disciplined investment in high return projects our liquidity position remains very strong following the august increase and extension in our line of credit we have approximately 1 7 billion in total cash and available credit at the end of the quarter our net debt was 2 7 billion with a leverage ratio of approximately 2 2 times the last 12 months of adjusted ebitda even after our recent issuance of 900 million of senior notes to purchase the kerry foods meats and meals business at the end of the quarter our leverage is at the lower end of our target leverage ratio of two to 3 times we expect full year 2021 net interest expense to be approximately 115 million exclusive of the debt extinguishment cost of 24 million we recorded in the second quarter we will stay focused on creating shareholder value as we optimize our capital structure to continue executing our growth strategy our capital allocation strategies will remain aligned with our growth strategy and each opportunity will be evaluated against our value creation standards i ll now turn the call back over to fabio for closing remarks fabio sandri president and global chief executive

the year ended december 31 2020 and our form 10 qs for the first and second quarters of 2021 in the press release we filed this morning and in our subsequent filings with the sec 10 stocks we like better than overstock com when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and overstock com wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see

non gaap financial measures the slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the sec each posted on our investor relations website contain additional disclosures regarding these non gaap measures including reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measures this presentation is available for download on our investor relations website and our summary slide contains instructions for asking questions during our q a session with that let me turn the call over to you jonathan jonathan johnson chief executive officer thank you alison and good morning everyone overstock delivered another strong quarter even as we lapped our highest quarter of revenue growth since 2004 and navigated significant industrywide supply chain disruptions as you ll see when adrianne reviews the financial results we once again exceeded quarterly consensus expectations on both the top and bottom lines and the metrics we look at indicate overstock gained about 50 basis points on online market share year over year compared to our top home goods retailer peers i m eager to see this confirmed as others release results in the coming weeks before i jump into the specifics on the quarter i m reminded of a warren buffett quote only when the tide goes out do you discover who s been swimming naked well the pandemic tide it lifted all online home retail home furnishing companies in 2020 has begun to go up and overstock continues to operate at over two times our pre pandemic sales level and we consistently deliver profits within our stated targets this is because in the six months that preceded the pandemic and then a month since this management team has made and continues to make foundational improvements to our business operation the pandemic tide is receding and we are wearing an operational wet suit if you will for the last six quarters we consistently delivered results well above our pre pandemic numbers during today s call we ll follow the agenda on slide 3 next slide please i ll start with a comment on macroeconomic trends they remain strong and favorable we ve shown these numbers before but i ll quickly review them in 2020 one in 10 americans moved when people move that creates opportunities for us as the furniture and home furnishings purchases are often move and project based even if customers start with one room and move to the next and then to the next we have lots of opportunities to support these movers by helping them furnish each room within the four walls of their home and their living spaces that extend to the four corners of their property u s home sales continue to grow year over year and forecasted consumer spending remains strong all these macro trends support category growth our supply chain is broad and distributed our vast partner network reduces single source risks shipping bottlenecks and supply chain kinks in fact we re proving that our supply chain works well in times of high consumer demand and low supply partially because suppliers don t want to tie up limited inventory in one or two distribution networks unlike some of our competitors we don t pressure from our partners to lock up inventory in our distribution centers as a result we tend to get favorable priority on inventory our asset light business model aids in reducing gross margin pressure we own almost no inventory we continue to expand our extensive partner supplier network we can flex our distribution center footprint as demand fluctuates and we work closely with our regional and national contracted carriers providing them accurate and timely forecasts to improve our delivery accuracy and meet customer expectations we have a great business model it s a great business model and periods of high demand and low supply it is a great business model when there are kinks in the supply chain and of course we think it is a great business model in more normal business circumstances all this adds up to long term favorability speaking of long term rather than opine on what we expect in q4 let me just give some brief comments on what we think we see for 2022 from our current vantage point including our perspective on the macro environment we are comfortable with consensus estimates for 2022 revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margin in fact we think the annual estimate for 2022 revenue growth is a bit pessimistic noting we have beat top line estimates for seven consecutive quarters our goal is to continue to grow our market share and then to build the business in 2022 and beyond slide 5 please next i ll provide a brief corporate update we announced a 100 million stock repurchase program something the company has not had in place since 2015 we have a healthy balance sheet and we ve proven we can consistently perform within our financial model so we think this is a strategic way to deploy capital we have not yet made any stock repurchases under this program so we have ample dry powder it s great to note that the utah district court once again dismissed the security class action lawsuit against overstock the plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal we ve won this case twice in the lower court and i believe we will win it again in the appellate court i m also very proud of our announced philanthropic partnership with mercy housing a non profit organization dedicated to providing affordable homes nationwide to individuals and families with lower incomes through this partnership we help provide one of the most basic and important needs a comfortable affordable and long term home this aligns perfectly with overstock s vision of creating dream homes for all i ll now hand the call over to adrianne lee who will review our strong third quarter financial results adrianne adrianne lee chief financial officer thank you jonathan slide 6 please as announced on last quarter s earnings call the medici ventures businesses are deconsolidated from our financial statements and the medici fund is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet on a quarterly basis we record our proportionate share of the fund s reported net income or loss i will begin with a high level summary of our third quarter results followed by a review of key customer metrics and performance indicators next slide please the third quarter of 2021 was another strong quarter and in line with the near to mid term financial targets we are maintaining the significant sales gains from the pandemic and delivering financial results in line with what we committed to deliver market share growth and profitability revenue declined by 4 year over year but more than doubled versus the third quarter of 2019 adjusted ebitda was 36 million in the third quarter a year over year decrease of 10 million driven by lower sales and one time gross margin benefits recognized in 2020 adjusted ebitda improved 41 million compared to the third quarter of 2019 we reported diluted earnings per share of 0 63 excluding the impact of truing up our tax valuation allowance which is customary when a release is done during an interim period as opposed to this year end diluted earnings per share was 0 54 in the quarter a decrease of 0 27 versus 2020 and an improvement of 0 94 per share compared to the third quarter of 2019 we ended the third quarter with a healthy balance sheet and 512 million in cash as jonathan discussed our board authorized a 100 million stock repurchase program that we have yet to execute against and i would i will speak to these financial metrics in greater detail in the following slides next slide please we posted revenue of 689 million in the third quarter a decrease of 4 year over year and an increase of a 102 compared to the same period in 2019 this quarter maintains our trend of essentially doubling our pre pandemic sales run rate of which we have done so for the past six quarters revenue performance was driven by a 24 year over year increase in average order value and a year over year improvement in order frequency we continue to believe there s opportunity in the growing furniture and home furnishings market and that the shift to online purchasing will persist our revenue trend over the last two quarters while we lap peak pandemic restrictions supports our business sustainability profitability and be able to illustrate the foundational improvements we have made and continue to make in the business next slide gross profit came in at 157 million in the third quarter a decrease of 12 million versus the prior year and an increase of 88 million compared to the third quarter of 2019 gross margin was 22 7 for the third quarter which is right within our targeted range and a 70 basis point improvement versus the second quarter of 2021 an achievement during significant industrywide supply chain challenges the year over year margin decline of 78 basis points was expected and driven by a few notable non recurring items from the third quarter of 2020 if you recall gross margin in the second and third quarter of 2020 benefited from lower discounting activity as we balance marketing efforts against product availability and stock outs and fulfillment related charges to protect the customer experience notably gross margin improved 270 basis points year over two in other words versus our pre pandemic run rate next slide please this chart illustrates g a and tech expense over the past nine quarters in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue g a in tech expense declined by 7 million year over year and remain relatively flat sequentially illustrating we re running the business efficiently as a percentage of revenue g a and tech expense was 7 6 for the third quarter and created of nearly 60 basis points of leverage compared to the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 g a and tech expense increased by only 9 while revenue increased by a 102 and improved 653 basis points as a percent of revenue our absolute g a and tech spend is in line with pre pandemic levels we continue to be measured in our spending and have operated within a consistent tech and g a spend profile over the last several quarters next slide please in the third quarter we delivered adjusted ebitda of 36 million which is down versus a year ago but up significantly versus the two year comparable period adjusted ebitda margin that was 5 2 and right in line with our stated targets adjusted ebitda margin decreased year over year mainly driven by one time gross margin benefits in 2020 but an increase of 660 basis points versus 2019 this is a well managed outcome driven by our focus on market share growth and disciplined expense management next slide now i will turn to our operational metrics that we use to manage and assess our business performance in which we began disclosing at the beginning of this year this slide shows active customers and order frequency active customers as measured on a trailing 12 month basis so as online penetration has receded from the all time highs experienced during peak pandemic restrictions this metric has somewhat a trend customer base declined to 8 7 million at the end of the third quarter that represents an increase of 5 compared to our third quarter of 2020 and an increase of 60 or 3 2 million customers versus 2019 orders per active customer was a 101 68 times in the third quarter essentially flat sequentially and an improvement of 3 year over year we anticipate order frequency will increase over time and be influenced by our customer retention efforts on our larger home customer base as we continue to increase overstock s brand association with homes it s important to point out that while active customers has declined we have been able to strategically offset this decline with an increased average order value an average order value more aligned with the home category in which i will discuss in greater detail on the next slide next slide this slide shows average order value and orders delivered average order value improved 24 year over year to 214 and remained relatively flat sequentially the year over year improvement was primarily driven by our continued sales mix into home categories orders delivered was 14 5 million for the trailing 12 months period this is an increase of 8 compared to the prior year or 1 1 million orders and an increase of 51 or 4 9 million orders compared to the 2019 level the sequential decline is attributable both to our decline in active customers during this the period and as expected as we lean into home we are maintaining our elevated quarterly sales trends that began during the pandemic last year with a different dynamic than we have historically had the value of each order or aov is improving while the absolute number of orders has declined it s a strategic trade off and reflects the purchase behavior of the customers we are targeting home customers that trust us with higher value items and who have a higher propensity to make a repeat purchase it s important to remember that there may be some near term noise in our operational metrics as we exit non home categories and as online penetration stabilizes but over time we expect consistent improvement we do expect a decline in average order value in the fourth quarter consistent with the seasonal sales mix shift within home and home furnishing categories in summary we are pleased with how we executed in the third quarter and our ability to continue to deliver solid financial results in line with our stated targets with that back to you jonathan jonathan johnson chief executive officer thanks adrianne the team again executed well during the third quarter navigating competitive pressure ios privacy changes and pervasive supply chain kinks to deliver solid financial results profitable results that are in line with our targeted margin guardrails our team is focused and committed improving we are implementing and continue to implement meaningful foundational operational changes slide 14 please we ve had 20 months of sales performance that has been double or nearly double our pre pandemic run rate despite these numerous and varying supply chain challenges i m eager to see what we can do when the bottlenecks in the supply chain subside i suspect we will be able to significantly grow the number of skews we offer as we increase the breadth and depth of our home products slide 15 next i ll provide some additional insights into our e commerce business including where our focused strategy is paying off our agile operations that are key in today s environment and where we are targeting and driving growth slide 16 please we believe that online penetration continues to grow and will finish the year in a pre pandemic growth rate it s nice to again see nice growth in that penetration in 2021 even after the large surge we saw last year importantly third party forecast project continued migration in 2022 and beyond as customers recognize the broad assortment available value and ease of purchasing furniture and home furnishings online add to this online migration the growth in the home market tam and overstock has two very nice tailwind factors slide 17 please we shared this slide for several quarters and continue to believe it illustrates well where overstock fits in the overall market and the significant white space available in the quadrant where home goods expertise meets smart value this quadrant is the right place for overstock and we have been strategic about choosing to focus on it we re targeting customers who already have a propensity to shop with us so we have purposefully played to our natural strength and these customers represent roughly 40 of the market so overstock has ample growth opportunity in this space and with these targeted customers i will now talk to each of our three brand pillars each of which help to find overstock s value proposition slide 18 our first brand pillar is product findability as we continue to lean into home it s critical that our customers know us for our home furnishings offerings and can quickly and easily find the home products they re looking for one of the critical strategic moves we have made has been to focus on home a home good expertise gives us significant white space opportunity i just discussed and it s important to know the customers who purchased home products from us had a better experience of two times higher basket value and are more likely to make repeat purchase we ve made good progress to associate the overstock brand with home for example we have increased our brand association with home by 11 points since december 2020 we ve expanded our new home skus by a 150 year over year including this showcasing of exciting home brands like casper and kitchenaid once supply chain kinks moderate we expect significant new sku growth as we add even more partners and our existing partners bring new skus on site we held the number one traffic share in outdoor furniture during the summer months that s a big deal 94 of our sales were in home categories a slight improvement from last year as we continue to strategically remove non home products from our site our goal is a 100 of sales to be home related by this time next year even with these wins overstock still does not have enough brand association with home it s paramount that overstock is seen as an online furniture and home furnishings destination and that we make finding our home products easy and fast we know there is room for improvement and our team is eager to continue to execute against this strategy slide 19 our second brand pillar is smart value smart value means offering great products at great prices or said differently the highest quality products for the price our promotional model is intentional and critical to attracting and retaining our customers they love finding a deal and want to feel like they are winning our competitive pricing tend to remains to offer a winning price post promotion we have continued to see the progress in our smart value pillar i ll mentioned three areas of improvement first our promotional model especially around holidays and special events is resonating with customers we have the largest fourth of july and labor day sales results in company history second our competitive pricing strategy was again within our targeted range we increased our comparable set from last year by 14 percentage points and kept 80 priced within the competitive range third roughly 60 of our new customers were within our targeted segments significantly higher than the 40 of the population these customers represent we know how to reach these customers and we are meeting one of their top purchase drivers value and of course our free shipping on everything policy is an important component of smart value and a benefit that really matters to our customers and differentiates us from our competitors slide 20 our third brand pillar is just easy delivery and support this includes getting the right product assortment and then optimizing its journey to the customer we have a distributed supply chain with our partner base dropship model that includes more than 3 000 partners with more than 5 000 fulfillment centers nationwide this is an advantage when navigating industrywide supply chain disruptions and allows us to flex quickly for changes in demand our carrier network is diverse both regionally and nationally where we have seen challenges is mainly highly populated metropolitan areas and areas close to ports to navigate these challenges we continue to provide timely forecasting and communicate frequently allowing us to meet customer expectations a proof point of our advantageous business model and robust analytics was our ability to capitalize on the demand for outdoor furniture since we re not limited by shelf space and we have a wide network of products and we were able to meet this significant demand and we re in fact no 1 in traffic share for outdoor furniture this summer besting everyone including our largest peer in short our operating model provides a significant advantage especially during times of high demand and low supply economic uncertainty and industrywide supply chain disruptions it has been working well for us especially over the last 20 months it s distributed and flexible allowing us to scale effectively and efficiently slide 21 usually when we talk about the support we talk about customer support and this time of increased supply chain constraints i will focus on how we support our partner suppliers we believe our superior partner relations and support gives us priority on inventory and increased in fact our inventory levels have significantly improved versus last year although they are not yet back to the pre pandemic levels importantly it is our supplier partner suppliers are more efficient and effective this benefits our customers by providing greater assortment higher end stock improved speed of delivery and overall customer service part of the support we provide partners is through our proprietary software overstock supplier oasis which provides real time sales data our pricing opportunities operational and fulfillment metrics and all at sku level it also provides business development analytics data to support manufacturing and new assortment opportunity this is a very real way for our partners to grow their business with us as we add value to our partner suppliers it benefits us through increase assortment of home products of breadth and depth in fact the number of home related skus with sales has increased from pre pandemic levels in both the 2020 and 2021 customers are finding smart value across a large product pool and when they can t find the exact product they want they are finding natural replacement products those are our three brand pillars together they form our differentiated value proposition and guide our strategy slide 22 please as you ve heard me say so many times our mantra is sustainable profitable market share growth growth is a key component of our mantra and one that we spend a significant amount of time strategizing on we gained great momentum and have included on this slide several key drivers to support this growth as i ve already noted even with our recent wins there continues to be a big opportunity to increase overstock s brand association with home we re continually increasing the breadth and depth of our home good assortment as i noted earlier having such great brand products like casper and kitchenaid help our customers associate overstock with quality we re expanding internationally focusing first on canada by shipping to our canadian customers from canada instead of from the u s a while the investment in the canadian customer experience is also progressing nicely we expect to take what we learned from canada from the canadian experience and use it as a template for future international expansion efforts we are establishing our government business as i ve consistently said for the past few quarters the government business is a longer term growth strategy for us and one we think will help open other business to business opportunities we have a great mobile app but it remains under adopted we did some of the effective app only promotions for our 2021 customer day and we re pleased by the outcome in fact mobile app revenue in q3 was at its highest percentage of revenue ever we still need to better focus on optimizing our market channels with the goal of increasing direct traffic a brand association with home will certainly aid in that effort we feel well positioned poised with a great business model and many levers to pull to continue to gain market share while delivering profitability slide 23 as i ve mentioned several times before we believe we are in the middle of a secular shift where consumers are increasingly buying furniture and home furnishings online we have intentionally set our near and mid term growth and margin targets with such desire to then take market share during this secular shift while delivering profitability when we feel the industry has reached its natural maturation point we may consider revising our targets and establishing a different longer term margin framework we have consistently delivered against our financial targets which are as follows top line outpacing the market driven by our technology our customer focus and our business model gross margins in the 22 range which may fluctuate slightly from quarter to quarter disciplined g a and tech spending to continue to drive operating leverage and adjusted ebitda margins in this mid single digits overstock has been operating within this framework for six consecutive quarters and with the operational changes we continue to make in the business we expect to continue to do this slide 24 please next i ll briefly discuss significant updates on the medici ventures fund slide 25 i will provide some updates to our two biggest holdings in the medici ventures fund starting with tzero the tzero board is engaged in an active search for a new ceo it is focused on hiring the right person rather than making a quick and hasty decision in the meantime acting ceo alan konevsky has been doing a great job leading the tzero operation in the past few months tzero has initiated trading of the exodus digital security announced new digital securities that plan to trade on the tzero ats partnered with wealthblock for private companies seeking continuous secondary liquidity launched support for eight more cryptocurrencies on the tzero crypto app and received general approval to then self clear trades in my mind tzero is seeking to provide the thing that has won the day in tech from time immemorial the suite tzero s goal is to create a suite so that the customer will have one place to buy and sell unique private securities public securities crypto and ntfs nfts among other things when i m asked how tzero will compete with robinhood or coinbase that feels to me like being asked how microsoft competes with a single spreadsheet solution and remember that the tzero capital markets suite and the capabilities behind it may be able to be used for both b2c and a b2b solution turning to significant news this quarter from bit the central bank of nigeria announced its selected bet as its technology provider for the enaira the country s central bank digital currency the enaira launched on monday that much shorter time from announcement of the deals to launch of the enaira also shows that the bit team is winning deals and implementing quickly remember nigeria is the world s seventh most populous country and that population sku is young and tech savvy i think this is a big deal while we the detailed terms of the enaira deal with the central bank of nigeria are necessarily private at the request of the central bank the basics are that bit receives payment in two ways first a licensing fee for the software that is related to the number of participating institutions and second a variable fee on usage a per transaction fee as the network grows i think bit has real potential upside as it gains traction and as more central banks look at issuing central bank digital currencies slide 26 this slide notes a few other updates the medici ventures fund companies have disclosed this publicly medici ventures fund participated in ripio s recent up route slightly increasing the fund s ownership percentage in ripio medici land governance is doing proof of concept pilot in new york city votes continues to support elections even in this off cycle year it s been six months since overstock closed the pelion ventures transaction we re pleased with our pelion acting as the fund s general partner pelion is actively helping many of the portfolio companies advance their respective businesses and the overstock management team can focus on the e commerce business i remained bullish on blockchain technology and the many of the companies in the medici ventures fund i think the market does not yet fully appreciate the value of the fund and so on that note i understand pelion is planning to hold a medici fund day in q2 of this year slide 27 i ll now briefly recap the quarter and then we ll move to q a slide 28 we continue to improve overstock s brand association with home increased the number of home products on our site and notably we outperformed peers in the outdoor furniture category as we look forward we believe we have a really exciting event driven strategy to support the holiday season the u s consumer continues to spend on the home and our supply chain is prepared to support sustainable profitable market share growth as i noted earlier from our current vantage point including our perspective on the macro environment we are comfortable with the consensus estimates outlook for 2022 revenue growth and adjusted ebitda we are looking to continue to grow and build this business in 2022 and beyond in summary we are pleased with our progress have focused on execution the market is large and growing our business model is distributed and flexible and our targeted customers are a sizable market segment perhaps the best way to view us is that we are a company gaining market share in a long term growth market now operator let s take some questions questions answers operator our first question will come from the line of lavesh hemnani from credit suisse you may begin lavesh hemnani credit suisse analyst hey everyone good morning and thank you for taking my questions so thank you for the color on 2022 just to start with that with regard to expectations for 2022 how incremental does gsa become as you move through the year is it going to be a major factor for 2022 and then i have a follow up jonathan johnson chief executive officer gsa great question lavesh great question gsa we do not think is going to be an incremental factor in 2022 gsa is a long term play as i ve mentioned before it started slower than we had hoped and expected but that s ok it has helped us add partners who we think will grow for us it started as a pilot worthy site which is now a full fledged site the gsa has limited our ability to advertise to customers but it s now loosening somewhat and it has taken time to expand our product offerings but that s taking off so gsa is not a big factor in our 2022 plan lavesh hemnani credit suisse analyst got it thank you for that color and just a quick follow up on the short term trends as i go back to the last call you sort of indicated expectations for trends to improve later in the quarter so if you can just provide some cadence on the q3 sales trends by month and what you re seeing in october so far thank you jonathan johnson chief executive officer lavesh great question let me give some color on q3 intra quarter sales our year over year revenue comp was better in august than it was in july our year over year revenue comp was better in september than it was in august and i expect our year over year revenue comp for q4 will be better than it was in q3 and then we ll then be growing top line again now we ve been giving intra quarter color since the start of the pandemic based on some sec guidance about early pandemic color and disclosure now that we ve lapped our two toughest quarters to comp it no longer seems necessary or frankly prudent to give intra company quarter and instead we re really focused on a longer horizon that s the comments in the prepared remarks about our current view of 2020 i will say this even as we sharpen our focus on home we do expect to be competitive and provide greater assortment of home giftables for the holiday season i hope that s helpful lavesh hemnani credit suisse analyst helpful thank you so much operator our next question comes from the line of anna andreeva from needham you may begin anna andreeva needham and company analyst great thanks so much and good morning and congrats guys really great results two questions to jonathan really exciting about the appeal opportunities can you maybe talk about some of the new subcategories where overstock has the right to win i think you mentioned that the casper and kitchenaid and also where you plan to add the additional depth and what s the timeline which you think of for next year as you begin to flow in those skus and so second question to adrianne really solid expense control i think right this is the second quarter in a row that opex dollars are declining it sounds like we should expect leverage to continue maybe adrianne can you talk about some of the specific buckets where you re seeing the opportunity thanks so much jonathan johnson chief executive officer anna thank you it s good to hear your voice as far as increased skus as i mentioned our distributed and diverse supply chain has helped us on this front as people have been expanding their living spaces for the four walls of their home to the four corners of their property outdoor furniture was a big deal and our merchandising team was able to work with our partners despite supply chain challenges to do this well we are working on expanding breadth and depth and i ll turn it to dave to talk a little bit about where we re focused without giving away too much of our inside baseball and some of the timing on this dave nielsen president yeah thank you jonathan we are adding products every day in multiple categories and there are categories where we are well penetrated and we own the categories as jonathan mentioned with outdoor furniture earlier and then there are categories where we re really underpenetrated we re focusing on adding products always in those areas and with vast distributed network of partners we like the potential that they bring us to add these new product categories so just to give you a couple of them like storage and organization to be specific is one that has just really taken off for us recently and we re continuing to put resources behind it having our home strategy of removing some of our non home products has allowed our teams to focus even more on those home categories where we are underpenetrated and see opportunity for future growth jonathan johnson chief executive officer thanks dave adrianne why don t you address the question on expense controls adrianne lee chief financial officer certainly anna yes our kind of absolute dollars as you ve noted have been relatively consistent over the last nine quarters i think two things obviously to takeaway is that we don t mean to add a significant amount of g a and tech expense to support additional sales and we ve got a lot of scalability in our business and the second is just we re very disciplined with our investing and so as we invest dollars into the business we re very focused on rois and making sure we can have our guardrail s worth within our investment so i would just say nothing in particular that we re targeting as takeouts it s more of just being really measured in our spending and investing jonathan jonathan johnson chief executive officer yeah anna this is a great question we follow the financial recipe card it s what we call it internally that we share with the street we are going to have 22 ish gross margins and then we re going to manage expenses tightly to bring in mid single digit adjusted ebitda i sometimes hear that only reason overstock is now taking market share is we re cutting price not so we re taking market share because we are running a great business type and because we re offering smart value to our customers this is a growing segment and we re growing businesses i think as long as we follow that financial recipe card there is market share to be taken as i ve said so many times keeping our gross margins at this level for now is we think absolutely the right thing to do the example i ve given so many times is the oklahoma land rush when the bell went off the started to go on they didn t take time to water the horses and feed the oxen they ran we re not taking the time to water the horses and feed the oxen we re staying at 22 gross margin and taking market share anna andreeva needham and company analyst ok that s terrific thank you so much guys and best of luck for the holiday jonathan johnson chief executive officer thanks shop only and shop off anna that s what i would say operator next question will come from the line of peter keith from piper sandler you may begin peter keith piper sandler analyst hey good morning everyone and great results and nice summary with the prepared remarks as well jonathan you guys talk about sustaining this 22 gross margin and sustaining the mid single digit ebitda margin we get a lot of questions and push back that right now we re in a very low promotional environment and that as we go into 2022 and inventory availability gets better and promotions pick up that overstock is just going to get beat up and see margin pressure why would that thinking be wrong jonathan johnson chief executive officer well if we were yes we re in a low promotion environment but we re also in a very competitive advertising environment i mean ad spend is aggressive it felt like there was cooped up ad dollars from last year people are spending more on their ads than they have in the past maybe it s that low competitive because there s limited some have limited skus we seem to be able to find the skus we need and if we don t have the exact sku we need we have a replacement sku that our customers are finding liking and buying so when the supply chain kinks get unkinked and products flow a little more smoothly i think it s going to be great for us we re going to increase the number of skus we have on site we re going to have more products to offer we re going to be able to continue to compete on price and do so well that s just i get that there will always be a bear case that s the best bear case i don t get it that s not a very good one peter keith piper sandler analyst ok fair enough and then so you did just tease out a little bit of commentary around q4 in the previous question so is it we to understand you would expect a year on year growth or it s a quarter on quarter growth for the quarter jonathan johnson chief executive officer i said i think we ll be growing our top line again i think that s year on year growth peter keith piper sandler analyst very good thanks so much everyone jonathan johnson chief executive officer yeah thank you peter operator our next question comes from the line of victoria james from d a davidson you may begin victoria james d a davidson analyst thank you for taking my call so i have two questions but let s take them one at a time you commented a bit on the last question about the supply chain so from your vantage point what is it going to take to improve the supply chain and logistic challenges and when should we expect a significant improvement jonathan johnson chief executive officer that is the 64 000 question to go back to 1970s gameshow far less it s going to take some time our rig is going to go beyond the end of the year and into 2022 and the supply chain has many links and that several of those links have been kinked at different times early on it was the manufacturers that doesn t seem to be the kink right now then it was the carriers from warehouse to customers we worried about ship again which by the way didn t affect us because of our forecast another with the ports and the containers there s just no containers today it seems to us that the worst kink is the trucks and chassis as containers empty containers are piled up at the ports the supply chain is fragile and that s why we like our model it s on so many so well distributed that if once the bar is not getting something others can t and one thing we ve noticed our supplier partners are nimble some of them are smaller and their ability to call in a favor with a tracking or shipping company to deliver a smaller number of containers rather than hundreds or thousands of containers has been real and so part of the reason we like the model i think this is here to stay for a while unfortunately but there is dave i ve dave you re much deeper into the logistics than i am anything you d add to that dave nielsen president no i think that was well answered victoria james d a davidson analyst thank you for that and then my next question would be davidson we ve been monitoring a bunch of different data about what consumer trends are doing specifically we ve been looking at gsa throughput data and we ve seen that consumers are clearly traveling more this year than they were last year how if at all do you believe that s impacting the home category jonathan johnson chief executive officer fair question we think as i mentioned on our call in q2 we think it did have an impact negative impact in q3 is pent up travel demand particularly at the end of the summer people got to the beaches they ve got to the mountains they got to wherever they were going i think that s still there s still some of that there my premise is there s pent up gathering today and that people will gather during the holidays and they re going to travel and gather i know i m just so eager to be with family and friends in thanksgiving and christmas i think gathering demand spills over into home demand when you re going to host people you ve got to make sure your house just looks a little bit better the home is where is going to feel a little more homey and so we yes there is that demand but we think that some of it is correlated again dave anything you would add to that dave nielsen president the only other thing i would add is in this new work environment where people are working more remotely people are more aware of their home surroundings and they are remodeling and they are updating more frequently than they did before and so we think that really plays to our advantage as well even though the travel restrictions are easing there are other counter activities going on that are holding that demand high victoria james d a davidson analyst great color thank you so much operator thank you and our last question for today will come from the line of curtis nagle from bank of america you may begin curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning thanks very much so apologies if i missed this but jonathan just i guess a quick question on 3q in terms of the incremental supply chain improvements vendor improvement or i should say product improvement like what specific categories did you really see an incremental benefit really made a difference in what looked like a pretty nice quarter jonathan johnson chief executive officer curtis good question we did talk about that a little bit in the prepared remarks i think a category we highlight is outdoor furniture we beat the no 1 space in that this summer we beat everybody in that this summer and i think it s because we ve got this broad supply chain our partners have were there for us and we were there for them they needed to move it because the outdoor furniture is seasonal and they know who they can move product with and that s us that s us and so that s why we think we re getting a good first look at inventory as i also mentioned they don t like tying up their inventory in any particular one supply chain and when they feel pressured and pressured i think is a euphemism when they feel this pressured to put their product in one channel dc they don t want to do that because they re not sure that that distribution channel can deliver what they need and so really they keep it on and that s why we don t require or pressure people to put product in our supplier oasis fulfillment center services warehouses and we think it makes a big difference for us curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it expense and then this is a follow up yeah how should we think about capital allocation balance sheet is in great shape where does that where did cash go over the next couple of years in terms of deployment jonathan johnson chief executive officer great question as we well adrianne and i mentioned we have a 100 million stock repurchase program we haven t executed on that at all we ve got dry powder on that i think as we learn from our canadian expansion to in the future we can use that capital to expand internationally i will say there s not a second country that s imminent right now but we have this are learning from canada and when we feel like we re ready to go we ll release that one we ll release that horse and have it off and running and then we get pitched ideas all the time and we look at them carefully thus far none have seemed like the right niche the perfect right fit but when we find one it s nice to have some capital in reserve as dry powder curtis nagle bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok makes sense thanks very much jonathan johnson chief executive officer well we appreciate everyone participating on today s call we re passionate about the business we re in and our business model flexible and scalable macro trends support the category and the gains achieved during the pandemic are proving sustainable the business model is resilient within economic cycle especially with our foundational operation operating improvements as the pandemic tide goes out overstock is wearing an operational wet suit that will allow us to continue to take market share we appreciate your interest and ownership in overstock until next time we ll keep working hard to consistently deliver sustainable profitable market share growth talk to you after the first of the year operator duration 58 minutes call participants alison fletcher deputy

this week fast casual salad chain sweetgreen announced its intent to go public and start trading on the new york stock exchange as part of its s 1 filing with the u s securities and exchange commission to begin the ipo process the company finally proved that it is as it s been arguing for years actually a tech company and not just a run of the mill expensive salad chain by following in uber and doordash s footsteps and posting consistent yearly net losses in the millions of dollars as dan primack at axios points out those losses reported in the ipo filing occurring every year since 2014 contradict the chain s claims in 2018 and 2019 that it was profitable sweetgreen s ipo follows in the footsteps of many restaurant brands including oregon born coffee shop dutch bros and chicago hot dog favorite portillo s to pursue going public in the last year alone it s a huge step for the company which plans to double the number of restaurants it operates across the country in the next five years which would mean more than 280 locations for the chain scattered across 13 or more states after its latest funding round the company boasted a 1 78 billion valuation sweetgreen s owners have long insisted that the company sells a whole lot more than just salads in a 2018 interview with recode co founder jonathan neman described the chain as a food platform not simply a restaurant eventually it hopes to build a full food ecosystem that can facilitate delivery managing its supply chain and operating its stores via its proprietary tech platforms in the media world you had networks and distributors that took the content and distributed it in our world you now have these platforms these uber eats of the world neman said in 2018 our goal is to be a content creator and a food platform so a full vertically integrated food system from supply chain production content creation and ordering in its s 1 filing the chain reports that despite serving more than 1 3 million customers in the 90 days prior to its filings and raking in revenues of more than 300 million sweetgreen is not a profitable business and it s unclear when it will be the company blames the pandemic for lower revenues in 2020 but the company is also burning tons of cash as it pursues both growth via new restaurants and making acquisitions like spyce a company that makes service robots which could theoretically end up making sweetgreen s salads instead of human workers in the world of tech of course this is par for the course plenty of wildly popular tech start ups like uber and netflix were not profitable before going public more than a decade after it was founded in 2009 uber is finally hoping to have its first profitable quarter ever this year in the world of tech investing growth is king as long as sweetgreen continues to promise its investors that it will open new stores and work on fancy salad robots it s likely that the company s hype among investors will stay fully intact but what happens when in five years there is a sweetgreen on every corner and it has to now you know be a restaurant when every salad costs 30 because of inflation and supply chain shortages and when we re all tired of eating the same damn kale and quinoa salad for lunch every week there are only so many ways to make a salad and it s unclear whether or not even considering plans to add side dishes and desserts sweetgreen will ever be able to reach chipotle or starbucks levels of ubiquity that question also becomes more complicated considering that the covid 19 pandemic is still lingering sweetgreen s business has largely been fueled by office workers many of whom will now be able to work from home permanently the company s financials indicate that it has been able to replace some of the revenue lost from restaurants in central business districts by opening new restaurants in the suburbs but it s hard to think that the fates of in person work and sweetgreen aren t intertwined even as the popularity of delivery apps and ghost kitchens grows what is clear though is that the latest restaurant unicorn to be valued at more than 1 billion is maybe just a regular old tech unicorn at least in the eyes of the venture capitalists that have already fueled its rise what exactly that means for those of us who are more interested in the salads than stonks remains to be seen

our kaybob development program with strong execution on our d c activities including delivering cost savings of approximately 20 on well completions to date and we have continued to reduce our net debt putting us on track to attain a leverage ratio of 1 times adjusted funds flow in early 2022 the rate of change and the improvements we have made to our business during the current commodity price environment are significant and shouldn t be lost on anyone for those that have watched our industry evolve over the past several years you can appreciate how much stronger companies are now versus past cycles balance sheets are healthy and continue to strengthen daily providing protection for shareholders during periods of commodity price volatility management teams are increasingly focused on shareholder friendly capital allocation programs which is also a positive for the supply demand balance and the overarching esg performance of our sector has improved tremendously especially within the canadian industry at crescent point specifically we have been able to take advantage of the current pricing environment through our industry leading netback our strong market access position and a product mix comprised of both light oil and condensate when we look forward to the upcoming year we are excited about the position we are in and the opportunities we see to create additional shareholder value for example in a 75 wti price environment we expect to generate 925 million of excess cash flow in 2022 which is after the dividend we recently increased we are in a solid position to further strengthen our balance sheet return additional capital to shareholders and evaluate projects that can enhance sustainability to create additional returns for our shareholders on a debt adjusted per share basis i ll now turn it over to ken to discuss our financial results ken ken lamont chief financial officer thanks craig for the quarter ended september 30 2021 adjusted funds flow totaled 394 million or 0 67 per share fully diluted this is supported by a strong operating netback of over 44 per boe the third quarter development capital expenditures which includes drilling and development facilities and seismic costs totaled 187 million i am pleased to report that we generated over 180 million of excess cash flow in the quarter which we used further to strengthen our balance sheet i will also note that since closing our kaybob duvernay acquisition in the second quarter of 2021 we have already paid off more than 80 of the cash portion of that total purchase price our net debt as of september 30 2021 totaled 2 1 billion or approximately 1 4 times our last quarter adjusted funds flow we are currently on track to exit the year with net debt at or below 2 billion and expect further to reduce our leverage to 1 times adjusted funds flow in early 2022 as craig mentioned earlier we expect to generate upwards of 925 million of excess cash flow in 2022 based on our preliminary guidance at 75 wti to lock in some of this excess cash flow we continue to layer in commodity and differential protection through our disciplined hedging program our hedging philosophy in this rising market is a portfolio approach whereby we layer in a mix of swaps collars and 3 way instruments in order to provide a combination of true floor protection and hedges with some upside participation currently we have approximately 45 of our oil and liquids production net of royalty interest hedged for 2022 for the 3 month period ended september 30 2021 net income totaled 78 million and included approximately 44 million in nonrecurring charges primarily related to a revaluation of the company s tax pools this reevaluation of tax pools primarily relates to the estimated future usability of these pools in particular those that were a part of past acquisitions our total tax pools at the end of the quarter were significant at over 10 billion and continue to enhance our ultimate excess cash flow generation in a rising price environment late in the quarter we announced the fourth quarter dividend increase to 0 03 per share payable on january 4 2022 to shareholders on record at december 15 2021 this equates to an annualized dividend of 0 12 per share an increase of 0 11 per share from the prior level as you recall our capital allocation framework initially prioritizes discretionary excess cash flow toward the balance sheet and the base dividend over the past year we have significantly improved our business fundamentals our excess cash flow profile and our balance sheet which led to our decision to start returning additional capital to shareholders we believe that the current quarterly dividend of 0 03 per share is sustainable provides flexibility within our capital allocation framework and has the ability to grow over time as it equates to a conservative payout of approximately five percent of funds flow at 50 wti in addition to a sustainable growing base dividend model we will also evaluate additional forms of returning capital to shareholders over time as we have in the past all in context of our capital allocation framework and leverage targets i ll now turn things over to ryan to provide some operational highlights ryan ryan gritzfeldt chief operating officer thanks ken third quarter production averaged 132 186 boe per day comprised of over 80 oil and liquids in line with our previously released guidance compared to our prior quarter our overall production reflects our recent disposition of noncore assets our conservative 2021 program with expenditures below sustaining capital requirements and the timing effect of several high impact multi well pads that were brought on stream during the first half of the year in the kaybob duvernay we initiated our first multi well pad drilling program during the third quarter with strong operational execution to date we expect to complete these wells during the fourth quarter in addition to focusing on generating strong full cycle returns and excess cash flow our near term strategy in the kaybob duvernay is to improve upon already strong economics through a combination of cost efficiencies and productivity enhancements primarily through our completions design i m proud to report that we have achieved early success on our cost reduction initiatives in this play during third quarter we entered into a farm in agreement with a kaybob duvernay operator to complete certain wells in exchange for working interest in these wells and additional lands both in close proximity to our existing assets this arrangement provides us with the opportunity to further delineate our land position and add locations to our kaybob duvernay inventory as part of this agreement we successfully completed a five well pad in late third quarter achieving completion costs approximately 20 below those we had expected when we first entered the kaybob duvernay play earlier this year i d also note that we achieved these cost reductions despite shifting to a new higher fluid intensity frac design that is more representative of our go forward plan production from these wells is expected to be on stream during fourth quarter of this year in our other operating areas in saskatchewan and north dakota we continue to successfully execute our development plan of low risk high return wells in viewfield and shaunavon specifically we ve had success this past year in expanding the economic boundaries of each play through our step out drilling programs we also received approval from the government of saskatchewan to fully unitize an additional two units in viewfield bringing our total now to six units this provides us the opportunity to further expand our waterflood program over the coming years as part of our decline mitigation initiatives in 2021 we have now converted approximately 115 well producing wells to water injection wells and remain on track to convert over 135 wells this year finally i d like to once again thank our operations teams and in particular our field staff who continue to demonstrate our commitment to safe operations and operational excellence throughout the quarter i ll now pass it back to craig for some final remarks craig bryksa president chief executive officer director thanks ryan i m very proud of the results and success we ve achieved over the past year and i m excited by the initial progress we are seeing in our new kaybob duvernay play as we near the end of the year we are narrowing our 2021 average production guidance to 132 000 to 134 000 boe per day which is at the higher end of our previous range and our capital expenditures will be approximately 625 million rather than increasing our capital budget to account for the costs associated with the additional completions on our new partner wells in the kaybob duvernay our overall expenditures have remained within our prior range as we made the decision to reduce spending in other operating areas this demonstrates the type of capital discipline you can expect from this team we recently established our preliminary 2022 guidance which we anticipate formalizing prior to the end of the year under our 2022 capital plan we expect to generate annual average production of 131 000 to 135 000 boe per day within a conservative budget of 825 million to 900 million in development capital expenditures this budget along with our recently increased dividend is fully funded at a low oil price of approximately 40 wti and generates approximately 1 billion of excess cash flow at an 80 wti price environment as you can see our business stands to stay in a dramatically different position than just 18 months ago the current commodity price environment provides us with significant flexibility and the opportunity to enhance our value creation as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet we ve laid out our strategy guided by our capital allocation framework and we ll continue to execute our plan to deliver value to our stakeholders i d like to thank everyone for their continued support and our employees for their hard work and execution of our business strategy i ll now open the call for questions from the investment community operator please open the call questions and answers operator thank you sir and your first question will be from patrick o rourke at atb capital markets please go ahead patrick o rourke atb capital markets analyst hi good morning guys thank you for taking my question just wanted to ask a few things with regards to cost structure and inflation that you re seeing out there in particular the duvernay the nature of those well costs are probably a little bit different than what you ve historically experienced with here from what we re hearing the high spec market for rigs is a little bit tighter and i m just wondering are you still pretty comfortable with those costs maybe i ll add on obviously it appears to us in the public data that the jv partner operated these wells that were recently completed and one million dollar or i think 20 ahead of your budget which is pretty impressive stuff are you able to apply any of those learnings or anything on the technical front to your upcoming completions craig bryksa president chief executive officer director so thanks for the question patrick it s good to hear from you so it s craig here when we put out our 2022 guidance we did build in inflation into that so we feel very good at where we re at in that 820 million to 900 million of capital spend like you say that was built in and we are seeing very good initial progress on both the drilling and completions in the kaybob duvernay so like we mentioned today 1 million under on the fracs there on that 20 reduction that we re seeing so making good progress on that but maybe i ll pass it to ryan he s probably the best person to talk to you about our cost structure and what we see on this over the next little while ryan gritzfeldt chief operating officer yes hi patrick yes i mean obviously we re working through all that right now as we finalize our 2022 budget but regarding cost pressures in a 70 75 world strip pricing for next year if you look at our total overall capital program yes we re probably expecting five ish percent increases some categories a little bit higher than others but overall five percent but obviously with some of the unit cost wins we ve had here in kaybob specifically on the completions like we spoke to obviously those will offset some of our cost escalations so overall still well within our preliminary capital guidance of 825 million to 900 million next year patrick o rourke atb capital markets analyst and then i guess in terms of those jv wells on the technical side in terms of the completion how similar do those look to what you have done or looked at with shell and had been planning on your own first pad here is there anything nuance that the operator did differently that you can take away from that or is it a very similar sort of completion design ryan gritzfeldt chief operating officer yes so the completion design that we used on these farm in wells are very similar to what our go forward plan is on our shell and obviously when we got into the play looking at the previous operators completion cost we had our eyes on that is that s where we could make significant improvements and so yes it was real satisfying to see our team execute on that and reduce those completion costs by one million dollar even with what we think will be a better frac design to increase our eurs in the area with a slightly higher fluid loading pumping those fracs and so one of the big things obviously our supply chain management efforts helped get that one million dollar savings per well and also a lot of efficiencies on site we are pumping hours per day is right up there compared to previous what we saw from the previous operator so combining all that we ve seen that 20 reduction on our completions so far and expect that go forward patrick o rourke atb capital markets analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you and your next question will be from jeremy mccrea at raymond james please go ahead sir jeremy mccrea raymond james analyst hi guys i want to expand or see if you could expand a little bit more on the jv with duvernay here i know there s very little details due to the confidentiality and i think the first question is why the confidentiality maybe how material this really could be in terms of the farm in terms of maybe amount of acreage the commitment how much does this draw down from other play any other little details or maybe when we would be able to find out more details of when some of this will come information will come forth coming craig bryksa president chief executive officer director yes so thanks for the question jeremy it s part of the terms of the agreement it s just the confidentiality structure around it what i can tell you is that it s three pads that we re looking at completing so called roughly 16 wells we ve done that first pad like ryan mentioned and very excited on the results that we ve been seeing not only on the cost savings but how the initial flowbacks have looked on those wells so it s exciting for us especially as we start to move it forward so we ll continue to execute on that we re on our second pad here now things are going well on that one and then from that we ll move to our pad that we re drilling right now and we ll complete that fully crescent point pad here in call it november but on that front things look good i can t really discuss any of the other details around the farm in and the partners just due to the confidentiality around that but i do know like i say three pads executing well against that things are going well we re excited to see the initial cost savings and how we can continue to drive that down and then when you look at how we re doing on our first pad drilling things on that front look very strong as well as far as the cost structure so starting to become very exciting for us here as we continue to move forward on that jeremy mccrea raymond james analyst okay and maybe just a follow up on that is this a strategy that you guys would like to employ more often going forward more farm ins or what was the reason for maybe not doing just an outright acquisition of some of this land craig bryksa president chief executive officer director yes i think it s like any other opportunity that s presented to you jeremy you evaluate it in the context of for us in the context of our balance sheet and sustainability and does it improve us in one or the other this deal we felt really good about it for a few reasons so for us at this point it made sense so all deals are different we re very disciplined as we look through things and if they do improve this then we would look to act on that in this case it happened to be farm in that allowed us to really get in and use our operating team and our operating structure and get after these fracs a little bit earlier and now apply the learnings that we ve had from utah north dakota into these fracs and now i ll take the learnings from this and apply this to our 100 crescent point wells that we re drilling right now so that s where you start to see the momentum moving and you can ideally you can feel some of the excitement in my voice as we start to get these results out to the market so look for further details to come as we continue to update the market on our 2022 budget when we finalize those things and then as we start to look forward into the new year jeremy mccrea raymond james analyst okay that s great thank you craig bryksa president chief executive officer director thanks operator thank you at this time we have no further questions mr bryksa please proceed craig bryksa president chief executive officer director thank you for joining our call today if

jeff albers jeff albers chief executive officer thanks kristin and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today in the third quarter we made tremendous progress toward bringing our life changing precision therapies to patients around the world today on our call you ll hear about three areas of fundamental growth the first is solid commercial performance anchored by ayvakit s advanced systemic mastocytosis launch in the us we re seeing broad demand from prescribers at both academic and community centers and across patients with different advanced sm subtypes this momentum provides a foundation for continued leadership and growth for our sm franchise as we look to deliver topline data from our pivotal pioneer study of ayvakit in non advanced systemic mastocytosis in mid 2022 and accelerate development of blu 263 our next generation kit inhibitor the second area of growth is based around the continued execution and expansion of our r d vision with a robust pipeline of innovative precision therapies advancing at all stages of development as fouad will describe our next wave of clinical programs is progressing rapidly toward multiple proof of concept readouts we ve been encouraged by widespread interest in our symphony trial of blu 945 and we re on track to initiate a phase 1 trial for blu 701 in the fourth quarter beyond our egfr franchise we continue to expect blu 222 our cdk2 inhibitor and blu 852 our map4k1 inhibitor to advance into clinical development next year and a third area of strength is our current financial position which as mike will describe in more detail enables us to drive revenue growth across multiple domains invest in a range of high value r d programs and continue to build a world class company with integrated global capabilities for some time we ve talked about the promise of diverse revenue streams across the strategic pillars of our business this diversity is now truly coming into view as we re able to increase our full year revenue guidance based on activity throughout our portfolio both independently driven and through our strategic collaborations combining our prolific scientific platform and commercial execution with the financial and organizational strength to bring in external assets we re well positioned for blueprint to be the leading driver of innovation in precision medicine for years to come with that i ll turn the call over to christy to discuss our commercial efforts christy christy rossi chief commercial officer thanks jeff good morning everyone let me start by sharing our third quarter results our ayvakit net product revenue was 17 3 million net and user sales of gavreto as reported by roche were 5 5 million for the quarter as a reminder the booking of gavreto sales shifted to roche at the beginning of the quarter q3 was our first full quarter of the ayvakit us launch in advanced systemic mastocytosis and the positive early trends we have been seeing reinforce our view that sm across advanced and non advanced forms of the disease is the most significant near term opportunity that we are pursuing at blueprint medicines as i reflect on the launch dynamics to date a key theme that gives me confidence is breadth breadth of prescribers accounts and patient types let s start with the breadth of prescriber and account activity as i ve shared previously a key focus area for blueprint has been engaging with sm centers of excellence and key accounts where patients are more concentrated over the first few months of the launch our efforts to engage these centers have gained good traction with approximately two thirds now utilizing ayvakit commercially as we continue to focus here we also know that many patients are cared for in a community setting and that prescriber education and patient identification there will be critical to the long term trajectory of the launch with that in mind i m very encouraged that approximately half of our volume is coming from community prescribers and accounts overall through the end of q3 we have had more than 100 new prescribers or accounts utilizing ayvakit for the first time since our approval in advanced sm this prescriber breadth will catalyze our ongoing efforts to identify more advanced sm patients and ensure they have access to ayvakit therapy we are also seeing breadth of ayvakit utilization by patients across their advanced sm treatment journey we continue to see a fairly even mix of patients switching from other therapies and those who have no indication of a prior advanced sm therapy we will gain additional insight into these patient dynamics as we move through the launch but this early data suggests that ayvakit is being used among the prevalent pool of diagnosed advanced sm patients as well as in newly diagnosed incident patients finally we are pleased that the demand we are seeing has been supported by strong patient access to therapy and a rapid time to fill prescriptions in total this combination of increasing prescriber and account breadths new patient starts and the long durations of therapy we expect based on our clinical trial experience form a foundation for longer term revenue growth as we continue to execute on our launch in advanced sm we are also focused on building our leadership position in sm more broadly a key priority is increasing disease education and patient identification so that more patients who are suffering from sm can be diagnosed and offered appropriate treatment i m very excited about progress we ve made in the third quarter to increase access to testing which is critical to achieve this goal we ve initiated a partnership with labcorp to make highly sensitive blood based kit d816v testing available for patients across the united states testing is now widely available and accessible through our sponsor testing program to qualifying patients where an sm diagnosis is suspected we anticipate that the widespread availability of testing will help to improve the rate of diagnosis in the us and facilitate improved access to care for patients overall we ve taken important steps this quarter toward realizing the potential we see to transform care for sm patients globally i m excited about the road ahead as we continue to execute on the us launch and look to plan global launches in advanced sm the readout of pioneer next year and the opportunity for ayvakit in non advanced sm and of course our ongoing development of blu 263 let me now turn to gavreto as we ve mentioned a key strategic rationale for our collaboration with roche and genentech was that it enhanced our ability to reach more patients globally we re excited to begin to see this come to fruition in the us we continue to focus our efforts on expanding the red inhibitor market through increasing comprehensive and actionable biomarker testing rates at diagnosis we were pleased with the continued growth we saw during q3 bolstered by strong momentum coming out of asco where we shared updated data on treatment naive patient from the arrow study during the third quarter we also received a positive chmp opinion for gavreto in a line agnostic non small cell lung cancer setting an approval in this indication would be a competitive advantage in the eu territory for gavreto this combined with the multiple planned regulatory applications that roche is pursuing in additional geographies and the ongoing strong launch of gavreto in china by our partners at cstone provides a clear roadmap for global revenue growth with that i would now like to turn the call over to fouad to review our clinical portfolio fouad namouni president of r d thanks christy and good morning everyone earlier this year i shared the broad r d vision to position blueprint medicines as the world s leading precision therapy company this included three areas of focus therapeutic area leadership in precision oncology and hematology with a near term focus on systemic mastocytosis and lung cancer innovative drug development including the creative use of trial designs translational data and regulatory strategies to bring our therapies to patients faster and continue with scientific leadership through the productivity and the expansion of our research platform i m excited to update you today on the very good progress that our r d team has made toward realizing the vision across our portfolio first we continue to expand our leadership in systemic mastocytosis through robust execution of our kit programs for ayvakit our registration directed pioneer study in non advanced sm is on track to deliver topline results in the middle of next year for blu 263 our next generation kit inhibitor the phase 2 3 harbor study also in non advanced systemic mastocytosis is now underway in the third quarter we began patient screening in the phase 2 portion of the study carrying forward momentum as we wind down pioneer enrollment as a reminder harbor is enrolling a broad population of patients with non advanced sm including patients with milder forms of the disease combined with the encouraging commercial launch of ayvakit in advanced sm these studies position us to dramatically improve the standard of care across all forms of systemic mastocytosis second we have significantly advanced our clinical program in egfr positive lung cancer for blu 945 patients enrollment in the symphony trial is accelerating with significant and growing demand at multiple clinical sites as the dose escalation phase of the study is moving rapidly we are now planning combination expansion with third generation egfr inhibitors such as osimertinib next year this approach will accelerate and extend our development effort across multiple patient populations we are also happy to report that we expanded the trials of global scope with now a clinical trial agreement in place for japan this represents an important milestone toward building a robust trial footprint for our egfr therapies in asia for blu 701 we have submitted an i d application to the fda and we are on track to initiate a phase 1 2 study in the fourth quarter similar to the symphony study we plan to explore combination development early in this study including with blu 945 furthermore pre clinical data continued to support our clinical development strategy we have recently completed studies generating compelling data on the potential of a blu 945 and blu 701 combination which we are submitting for presentation at a scientific meeting in early 2022 finally our early stage research pipeline continues to flourish in recent months we have rapidly progressed blu 222 our selective cdk2 inhibitor through i d enabling work and we now anticipate it will enter the clinic in the first quarter of 2022 earlier than previously expected more broadly we have also nominated multiple undisclosed research programs this year these include a number of exciting targets with the potential to further extend our scientific leadership in precision oncology and hematology as these programs progress through discovery research we look forward to sharing more information on another wave of therapeutic candidates i would now like to turn it over to mike to discuss financial updates mike mike landsittel chief financial officer thanks fouad earlier this morning we reported detailed third quarter financial results in our press release for today s call i ll touch on a few highlights from the quarter but first as we head into the fourth quarter blueprint continues to build on our strong foundation strong financial foundation through a range of revenue sources in addition to our growing base of global revenues from ayvakit and gavreto sales progress across our multiple strategic collaborations is expected to meaningfully contribute to our fourth quarter revenues based on increased anticipated milestone and other collaboration payments including the acceleration of potential milestone achievements into the fourth quarter we are raising our annual revenue guidance for 2021 to between 170 million and 180 million in the third quarter total revenues were 24 2 million including 17 3 million of net product revenues from sales of ayvakit and 6 9 million in collaboration revenue collaboration revenue for the quarter was primarily driven by commercial supply shipments to our partners cstone and roche as well as royalty revenue for sales of gavreto and ayvakit by cstone in china as a reminder us gavreto sales are now being booked by roche with our share of profit or loss appearing on our income statement our total operating expenses in the third quarter increased slightly compared to the second quarter of 2021 driven by continued growth in r d expenses as we bring multiple programs into clinical development over the next few quarters we anticipate that investment in our promising early stage programs as well as our commercial efforts with the ongoing launch of ayvakit in advanced sm will continue quarter over quarter operating expense growth finally we ended the third quarter with nearly 1 3 billion in cash on hand ensuring we have sufficient resources to invest in our pipeline overall this combination of growing product revenues and progress through our collaborations fortifies our exceptionally strong financial position allowing us to focus on execution across our portfolio as we enter another transformative period of growth for the company i would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions operator questions and answers operator our first question that comes from salveen richter from goldman sachs your line is now open andrea tan goldman sachs analyst hi everyone thanks for taking the question this is andrea on for salveen congratulations on the quarter christy maybe a question for you just wondering if you could speak a bit more on your partnership with labcorp and how you expect this to expand the potential addressable population and then very quickly if you re seeing any utilization in non advanced patients at these centers of excellence christy rossi chief commercial officer sure so we re quite excited about the partnership with labcorp throughout this year building capability and making highly sensitive blood based kit d816v testing available in the us has been a key strategic focus of ours and as i ve discussed before we believe blood based testing will greatly facilitate access to diagnosis for patients particularly for non advanced sm patients where that diagnosis may be suspected and so the partnership with labcorp labcorp has this testing available commercially so that in and of itself will be very helpful for prescribers who use labcorp nationally we will have a we have a sponsored testing program that is available where if a patient is suspected of having an sm diagnosis they can receive access to testing through blueprint and so we believe that this will reduce the potential barriers and hurdles for patients to access testing and also ensure that if a provider suspects sm they utilize the appropriate type of testing so that the results that they get can be trusted and so we re really excited about this as a step forward in terms of utilization of ayvakit our best understanding continues to be that patients who are being prescribed right now are advanced sm patients by and large we of course don t have perfect visibility into every patient and as i said before the diagnosis and subtyping in sm is complex to say the least but certainly that s our understanding based on the intelligence we have from speaking to healthcare providers andrea tan goldman sachs analyst great thanks so much operator our next question comes from reni benjamin from jmp securities your line is now open reni benjamin jmp securities analyst hey thanks guys for taking the questions and congratulations on a great quarter can you just give us a breakdown of maybe gist versus sm in terms of the kit revenues and can you just also give us an update on the tapestry study and if pioneer enrollment is completed because i think to meet this deadline at least by our calculations and the follow up that s required i would think enrollment had to have completed in the third quarter but i m not too sure i might have a calculation off here thanks very much jeff albers chief executive officer yes so christy why don t you take the first half and becker take the second half christy rossi chief commercial officer so in terms of revenue we obviously do not provide a formal breakdown in terms of indication split but as you ve seen if you kind of look historically and as we ve discussed gist has been i would say relatively consistent revenue stream for blueprint at this point and so when we look at quarter on quarter growth it s really coming from advanced sm primarily as well as a little bit of international as well but advanced sm is really the key driver if you look on quarter on quarter growth becker hewes chief medical officer and then with respect to the two trials you mentioned tapestry again we re transitioning to roche and there continues to be enthusiastic interest in getting multiple tumor types into this study with respect to pioneer we have as i mentioned on the last call the processes to screen patients and make sure that the patients with the right pfs score severity of disease are enrolled in the study we ve actually stopped the pre screening and so we filled our screening group of patients and we re converting those into patients enrolled in the study and we are looking forward to revealing topline data in the middle of next year reni benjamin jmp securities analyst got it thanks for taking the question becker hewes chief medical officer i just want to also i ll also mention that we re taking that momentum and we re shifting it over to blu 263 the harbor trial has an even more extensive site list we discovered a lot more interest and really enthusiastic about this next generation kit inhibitor moving into the treatment reni benjamin jmp securities analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from dane leone from raymond james please proceed with your question dane leone raymond james analyst hi thank you for taking the questions i ll keep it to two for me firstly could you comment at all in terms of the progress with the blu 945 phase 1 enrollment in treatment anecdotal evidence that i think most us have seen at this point does suggest you re getting a mix of patients that do and do not have a t790m mutation so be curious about your thoughts around the complexion of the patients getting treated in that dose ascending study and kind of the implications for evaluation of the therapeutic index and what s going to be effective for those patients with t790m and then secondly for me could you just maybe comment a little bit more in terms of the treatment center utilization around asm now for those treatment centers open where do you think the percentage of docs and patients being treated now that would qualify for avapritinib are getting the drug and just some of the hurdles that your team s trying to get over now to increase that utilization rate heading into 2022 thank you jeff albers chief executive officer all right so fouad why don t you take the 945 study question and becker can add color as necessary fouad namouni president of r d thank you dane for 945 in the symphony trial we are very happy with the way it is progressing in the dose escalation phase and we have four months in the phase 1 we have seen really a good momentum we are also very happy that our use by the investigator of tumor and ct dna is able really to pick on a variety of mutation tm mutation cs mutation double mutation and triple mutation all this information and with the profile of 945 would allow us in the next months to have a much better understanding of the safety profile and also be able to see detection of clinical signals we will be sharing data next year on the first part of 945 jeff albers chief executive officer all right and christy don t you take the breakdown of where we re seeing activity in asm christy rossi chief commercial officer yes so i think your question sort of speaks to i think what the opportunity is going forward in terms of additional opportunity at centers as well as beyond that so as i said we re pleased to see that we ve had engagement and utilization by two thirds of sort of the accounts that we consider to be key accounts in centers of excellence which is great but i m also very happy that we ve got a significant amount of utilization coming outside of those accounts in the community i think there is additional opportunity within key accounts i think what s interesting about sm is that it is still an immature market in many ways and so unlike other diseases where you may have one specialist at a center that tends to have every patient funneled to that person what we see in advanced sm is that these patients at a center may be maybe seen by multiple providers and so one trend that i ve been watching and interested to see is that we re starting to see more than one prescriber at a given account utilizing ayvakit and that deepening within accounts is something that we re going to continue to focus on as we go forward but long term i think the key driver for us of additional patient identification and growth will be also really getting out into the community where we have that tale of patients that are presenting and again really happy with what we re seeing certainly looking forward to having additional catalysts going forward as our data gets out and we continue to educate and identify more patients there dane leone raymond james analyst thank you operator and the next question comes from marc frahm from cowen your line is now open marc frahm cowen company analyst hi thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter hey christy just to follow up on the last points about physician use and who they are when you are seeing use in the community is that still just with community based oncologists or are you seeing some use in other places like allergist office and things like that that may have broader populations than just asm within their practice and then for the and then also to follow up on dane s question on the different types of patients enrolling in 945 would you expect to ultimately have expansion cohorts that are broader than just c797s or some of these other resistance mutations or is c797s really the main focus christy rossi chief commercial officer sure so i can start with your first question so in terms of the mix of prescriber types that we re seeing the vast majority of utilization right now is coming from hematology whether that s at a center of excellence or in the community we have seen some utilization by allergy i think what s important to keep in mind is that allergists play a role in the management of advanced sm patients and certainly are a critical point in the pathway to diagnosis for many of these patients and will often be involved in co managing patients with hematologists and so we ve seen some utilization coming from allergy but again the vast majority coming from hematology at this point fouad namouni president of r d and for your second question marc for 945 945 is our triple mutant agent covers the drivers with also t790m and c797s the way the symphony phase 1 trial was designed is to expand in all subgroups of mutations so we ll be expanding in triple mutation we ll be expanding also in cs double mutation and in tm double mutation so we ll have really a very good understanding across a broad spectrum of these combinations of mutations becker hewes chief medical officer i just wanted to add one thing marc the 945 compound is optimized to hit the triple mutation but it is a compound with a really large winded wild type so we expect extraordinary safety that really plays into our plan to combine these molecules and move to earlier lines of therapy and we re really open to all levels of activity for this compound just given how safe we expect it to be marc frahm cowen company analyst okay thanks very helpful operator our next question comes from andrew berens from svb leerink your line is now open andrew berens svb leerink analyst thanks let me also add my congratulations on the great execution this quarter just a few for me i m trying to get a sense for how excited we should be about these results being sustainable were there a meaningful percentage of patients using ayvakit this quarter from the expanded access program do you guys have any color on how many lines of therapy they had seen previously on the average or how long ago the patients had been diagnosed and then a question on gavreto for christy i didn t hear you give a percentage of new patient starts like in prior quarters and just wanted to see if i had missed that and again wondering why the 40 you saw in q2 and the 25 in q1 doesn t seem to be translating to revenues is it really just that the rep market is not that large christy rossi chief commercial officer so i think all those are for me so happy to start with the sm color so in terms of patient dynamics in the quarter we did have some patients who were on access programs prior it s the minority certainly of the patients that we saw coming onto ayvakit through the quarter i think your patient your question sort of speaks a little bit to is this a bolus and i think what we ve seen certainly is that there were patients who were frankly waiting for ayvakit approval there was a lot of excitement from the centers that know ayvakit well and have experience waiting for the drug to become available commercially so certainly we re pleased that we were able to pull those patients on and offer them treatment upon approval what we now see and what i think will be sort of offsetting that and continuing to drive growth is the rate of new prescribers and accounts that continue to come on board and so i m really excited about just the breadth again of prescribing i see that as a critical indicator of long term growth potential and pleased to see that we ve continued to really add new prescribers and accounts at a very steady clip as we ve moved through the quarter in terms of lines of therapy as i said our best data right now suggests that we re seeing a pretty even split in terms of patients who ve been on a prior therapy versus those who say that they do not have indication of a prior therapy our visibility into that right now is limited and as we start to see our own patients through claims data we ll have a better sense frankly of exactly what we think that mix looks like and so i would say that we ll gain insight to that as we continue to move through the launch in terms of gavreto the question about sort of how do we think about new starts and then kind of moving through to revenue so with the transition to genentech our level of sort of individual patient visibility is simply different they have a different distribution model than we do and so really we re looking at prescriber level demand now as kind of the best indicator of growth and had our strongest quarter this to date essentially in q3 and so we re excited about that and that it speaks to i think the ongoing growth of the market which we re seeing across both blueprint and lilly it will take time as i ve said before between new products new patient starts or transitioning into revenue new share is a leading indicator of total share which then will translate into revenue over time and of course our quarter on quarter revenue growth continues to be really strong andrew berens svb leerink analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from avatar jones from morgan stanley your line is now open avatar jones morgan stanley analyst thank you for taking my questions many have been answered but i have one question on ayvakit do you have any visibility into the average duration of therapy to date and moving forward how would you suspect this will evolve thank you christy rossi chief commercial officer sure so duration of therapy is one of the aspects of the ayvakit opportunity in advanced sm that i think is most exciting and certainly will be a critical driver of growth particularly as we get further into the launch and can see patients sort of accumulating because they can stay on therapy i also think it s exciting because we have the potential i think to really impact how long patients are living well with advanced sm which i think is a really exciting clinical opportunity at this point in the launch it is just it s too early to really have any meaningful insight into duration of therapy right we re a couple of a few months onto the market at this point certainly our clinical data suggests that patients may be on for years and so i think we ll have better insight as we go through over the next year to two to really understand what we re seeing in terms of what that looks like avatar jones morgan stanley analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from arlinda lee from canaccord your line is now open please proceed with your question arlinda lee canaccord genuity inc analyst hi guys congratulations on the quarter and the launch i had maybe an additional follow up on additional color that you might be able to provide on the breakdown of newly diagnosed patients versus those that were already known and if you can maybe talk a little bit about the turnaround time for the labcorp tests and what kinds of you said that it would be available to patients that were eligible could you provide additional information on who might be available thanks christy rossi chief commercial officer sure so again in terms of the splits of patients that we re seeing right now we re really relying on the feedback we hear from patients and prescribers directly which is how we understand that mix of about half saying they do not have prior therapy versus half saying coming from a variety of other therapies that are being used no indication of prior therapy does not necessarily mean that they re newly diagnosed and so we will continue to gain insight to that as i said as we start to kind of see claims data and other sources that will help inform our understanding our expectation certainly is that as we move through the launch we will shift from being utilized primarily in prevalent patients who are already diagnosed to newly diagnosed incident patients and so that s a dynamic i would anticipate we will be but again it s just too early to really know what we re seeing in terms of the labcorp test the turnaround time is fairly quick i believe it s something on the order of less than a week and the eligibility criteria essentially we ask physicians to fill out a form where they have to specify one or two of a couple of different symptoms that are often hallmarks of a potential sm diagnosis so essentially what we re looking for is suspicion clinical suspicion of sm in order to be eligible for the test arlinda lee canaccord genuity inc analyst great thank you and congratulations again operator the next question comes from michael schmidt from guggenheim your line is now open please go ahead paul jeng guggenheim securities analyst hi this is paul on for michael thanks for taking our question just one from us on the cdk2 program can you provide your thoughts on how to potentially compare it with other cdk2 approaches in development for instance like are included in triple inhibition of dda 2 6 that are being explored just hoping to see your early read there on the landscape thanks jeff albers chief executive officer so fouad why don t you start maybe becker can add color if needed fouad namouni president of r d thank you our cdk2 inhibitor that is entering the clinic early next year as i mentioned earlier is a selective one it has been developed as a validated target a regulatory partner of ccne1 with particular selectivity over cdk1 cdk4 cdk6 and others this allows our cdk2 inhibitor to be selective leading to efficacy and potentially in very favorable safety profile when you look at the entire landscape one of the challenges the landscape faces in developing cdk2 inhibitor is selectivity over cdk1 but also over cdk6 so we do believe that our cdk2 with its very selective profile is also a very good partner for combination with cdk4 6 we believe the strategy of developing a selective sole cdk2 inhibitor is a good strategy that gives us the ability to combine different doses with cdk4 6 our development strategy targets two major areas ccne driven cancers where we believe that tumor addicted to the pathway ovarian cancer endometrial cancer so cdk2 will be developed in combination with standard of care and the diseases the other part of the development of cdk2 will focus on the emerging issue of resistance to cdk4 6 in breast cancer we know today that ccne1 over expression is behind the resistance to cdk4 6 in breast cancer so we ll be looking to really contribute to reverse this resistance not only in the late stage by combining cdk4 6 in breast cancer but also in the early stage paul jeng guggenheim securities analyst great thank you operator our next question comes in joel beatty from baird your line is now open benjamin kallo robert w baird analyst hello this is benjamin kallo on for joel two questions for us one on ayvakit and then one on the pipeline as far as ayvakit do you have a sense i m not sure if i missed it or not but the number of repeat prescriptions and then on the pipeline i m just curious if you could maybe put into context the relative risk of the different plan initiations for 701 222 and 852 do you see one as more highly risky or less risky than the others thank you christy rossi chief commercial officer sure this is christy i can take them the first one on repeat prescriptions so again we re early on in the launch we ve seen nothing that would be any different than what we would expect which is in terms of we expect patients will be refilling certainly we do know that often if patients are going to find their right dose that is the dynamic that happens early on and so dose modifications etc tend to be occurring in the first few months our strategy around flat pricing etc really mitigates a lot of the impact that we would expect to see from that but that s a trend we ll continue to watch but so far we re seeing everything essentially in line with what we would expect jeff albers chief executive officer sure then in terms of the relative risk maybe fouad i ll have you start but yes i think it s a question we look at all of our programs in terms of going after known oncogenic drivers of disease where there should be a higher probability of success in cases where we can get to clinical proof of concept as quickly as possible remains a hallmark of our portfolio selection priority or our process we do always take into account as well though the size of the opportunity the relative opportunity so right before you enter the clinic it s almost an impossible exercise but fouad why don t you take a stab fouad namouni president of r d the only thing i would add jeff to our answer is blueprint as a leading precision medicine company has really one of the strongest expertise in rationally designing molecules that are selective against targets that we would like to use as treatment to jeff s point these targets are well validated and are important for the treatment of cancer it s now taken blueprint to a next level of targets with a broader scope of the opportunity whether you think about it from egfr mutated lung cancer or breast cancer resistance to cdk4 as an example for cdk2 obviously these studies are either in phase 1 or entering the phase 1 clinical trials in the next weeks or months so we would have more information to determine really the profile of these agents but i think with responder hypothesis as a part of the development with selectivity with windows of data or with therapeutic indexes in the development of this compound i m confident that we will run these compounds very efficiently and the data will tell us what we when we see it from the phase 1 jeff albers chief executive officer yes and maybe i ll circle back it s interesting kate haviland our chief operating officer often talks about the idea that how do we get better with subsequent programs over our first wave of programs and it has always been a cornerstone of our strategy to develop molecules that can be combined with other effective therapies if we really want to change course of disease and so as becker noted earlier on 945 that was part of the target product profile that to reach the full potential was to focus on the window of a wild type so that you could see various combinations expanding the opportunity over time similarly i d say that s true for blu 222 our cdk2 program that we will certainly be looking for single agent activity but the true opportunity comes in how you combine over time and so that selectivity that fouad talked about with respect to blu 222 is really critical to what we hope to see as we move into the clinic benjamin kallo robert w baird analyst got it thank you so much for those insights operator the next question comes from peter lawson from barclays your line is now open peter lawson barclays analyst great thanks thanks so much for taking the question just kind of thinking about the gist and the asm revenues underlying this is there any way is there any point where you d break out those revenues and or would you kind of break out when gist or rather asm kind of exceeds the gist revenues just your thoughts there and if that happened this quarter and then a second question for mike just sort of breakout of the guidance how much is that milestone driven should we think about a milestone number as a 75 million or a 50 million number thank you jeff albers chief executive officer okay so maybe i ll start we don t have perfect visibility into every patient so the effort of trying to break out exactly where each of them sits will probably be difficult so i don t think it ll be a focus i mean based on the data we see as christy has already highlighted the growth is clearly coming from asm but exactly where that line is i don t think we have that degree of detail and then maybe mike you mike landsittel chief financial officer yes so just a little bit more color on the revenue guidance i think maybe backtracking a little bit like early in the year we guided to the fact that we might have 80 million in potential milestone payments what we ve seen we ve recognized a little bit of that today but what we ve seen is primarily a lot of potential milestones are now concentrating in q4 and that also includes the acceleration of potential milestones that were originally i d say forecast for 2022 so as those come together and come to fruition in q4 the bulk of the revenue guidance raise that we re seeing is driven by milestone revenue that we anticipated as well as other collaboration payments supply payments and royalty payments jeff albers chief executive officer yes and maybe i ll add to that i mean that s i think that s an over and underappreciated aspect of our current position is that we ve always focused on retaining meaningful commercial rights and bringing therapies to patients on our own but we also have looked at collaboration as an opportunity to either accelerate or expand our reach and the breadth of collaborations we now have in place is truly differentiating our revenue streams and what is in exactly quarter over quarter maybe a little bit lumpier than revenue growth with end user revenue growth but we re seeing a mix of milestone payments royalties and other payments from partners that is going to continue on as we go forward so i would say in my seat i don t really care where the revenue comes from it s meaningful and it allows us to continue to invest in our research platform which is the way we re going to drive long term shareholder value peter lawson barclays analyst thanks for that just to follow up on christy s comments about asm are the majority of patients going to come from the heme or the allergy side for asm eventually christy rossi chief commercial officer yes advanced sm certainly will be majority of hematologists that s the specialty that tends to primarily manage as i said allergy certainly can be involved sometimes they re involved in co management but we expect hematology to continue to be the primary driver for advanced sm peter lawson barclays analyst brilliant okay thanks so much operator our next question comes from david nierengarten from wedbush your line is now open david nierengarten wedbush securities analyst hey thanks for taking a question i ll skip any commercial questions that often beaten to death on the pipeline for 701 and 945 maybe if you could help us out with the ultimate goal is it to have a combination therapy with 701 and 945 in that setting and say second line mutated egfr mutated lung cancer and then if that s the ultimate goal what do we need to see from these single agent studies to accelerate your entry into the clinic with a combo thanks fouad namouni president of r d thank you david 945 and 701 our fourth egfr a fourth generation egfr agent have been developed with combination in mind and have been designed with combination in mind so very quickly 945 as becker mentioned earlier has one of the widest selectivity profiles over wild type egfr and that allows this compound not only to be developed as a same agent but also to be developed in combination with other agents as i mentioned earlier we ll be starting next year combination with third generation egfrs and 945 701 has been also developed as a single agent highly potent on cs mutation on driver mutation highly brain penetrant but also developed toward combinations with other agents so for the on target combination strategy we would like to see each agent developed as a single and in combination in the late stage but our ultimate goal is to move these two agents together to the frontline treatment of egfr positive non small cell lung cancer and that s because of the profile of both agents the potential synergy and combinability in terms of being able to displace and do better than standard of care we will also be looking in addition to the combination of 701 when it s ready and 945 to combination with other agents i talked about egf third generation such as osimertinib but we will also be looking at combination with off target agents just given the profile and the selectivity of these compounds off target agents can include a variety of things it could be med inhibitor it could be ras it could be chemotherapy and others i do believe that these four generation agents developed together could become transformational in the treatment of egfr mutant non small cell lung cancer david nierengarten wedbush securities analyst thanks and maybe just a quick follow up on the other potentially off targets agents again i guess i m curious how far you might look into those before again focusing on 945 701 or is it going to be just a broader basket study and open to just interpreting the results as they come thanks becker hewes chief medical officer sure so this is becker i ll take that with respect to combining with agents that have other mechanisms of action and address resistance or potential resistance for other targets such as mat or ras inhibitors initially we need to get the tolerability and dosing information for our single agents but i don t see it as a sequential development we tend to do these things in parallel we re quickly adding combinations to our ongoing studies and the we ll let the pre clinical data guide us to an extent but emerging data on resistance and trying to get in front of resistance is really where we re going with this program in a broad fashion david nierengarten wedbush securities analyst got it thanks operator our final question for today comes from brad canino from stifel your line is now open brad canino stifel financial corp analyst great thanks for fitting me in and great launch and execution here i mean just one more for me on the egfr trial and again specifically on that cohort that t790m but not c797s it looks like per the protocol they re going to go first gen to osi to 945 and like we talked about previously on the call likely cancer there is driven by something other than t790m like mat so are you expecting to see and should we be looking for monotherapy 945 efficacy in this specific cohort because you ve been talking about the higher therapeutic window and wild type sparing or is this really the focus safety on this cohort thanks becker hewes chief medical officer this is becker i mean obviously in phase 1 safety is the initial focus and the main focus of this study however just a reminder 945 will inhibit very strongly any protein that has the t790m mutation on it we are trying to understand better the heterogeneity of this cancer there are patients where we believe that there the egfr mutations or the egfr protein is still the primary driver and the more we look the more patients that seems to be the case there are other patients where it s more heterogeneous and you have multiple populations of cells or even multiple drivers within a single cell and so as we

drugmakers complete the clinical trial pfizer and biontech have completed a three phase clinical trial in children 5 to 11 years old the companies submitted all of the data from that trial and an application for emergency use authorization to the food and drug administration on oct 7 the main study included 2 250 kids and found that the lower dose version of the vaccine was 90 7 effective in preventing symptomatic covid 19 it was given as a series of two shots 21 days apart and the dose was 10 micrograms a third of the dose given to adults and teenagers no serious side effects such as heart inflammation were reported although with only a few thousand children included in the research that sort of rare problem wouldn t necessarily be detected step 2 independent scientists review the data this week on oct 26 a panel of outside scientists considered pfizer s safety and efficacy data along with an analysis from fda scientists on the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different pandemic scenarios after some lively discussion the group overwhelmingly voted yes that the benefits of the pfizer vaccine outweigh the risks for use in this age group step 3 fda officials weigh in

or they could make more focused or nuanced recommendations cohn said for instance they could have recommended it for a certain subgroup like children with underlying conditions or those who haven t had a prior coronavirus infection step 5 cdc director makes final recommendation even then a vote from the cdc s advisers isn t an official recommendation that comes from the cdc s director dr rochelle walensky on tuesday night she greenlit the advisers recommendation if she had chosen to she could have changed the recommendation from what the committee voted on as she did with boosters but

it s like we don t exist say people living near giant mines like minas rio in brazil s mining heartland state of minas gerais though residents largely don t benefit and live in fear of yet another environmental catastrophe caused by such mines like the samarco mariana brumadhino mines tailings dam collapses their owners are making huge profits from this polluting industry marked by a lack of transparency one way for brazil to respond would be joining the extractive industries transparency initiative as 11 other latin american and caribbean countries have already done the views expressed are those of the authors not necessarily mongabay ana and her family live one kilometer from the tailings dam that carries toxic waste away from the world s ninth largest iron ore mine minas rio situated in brazil s mining heartland state of minas gerais thoughts of the dam rupturing never leave her we live here between the hope of being able to leave and the constant fear of something bad happening we sleep in fear we wake up in fear it s an endless fear says the 21 year old student who doesn t want to use her real name for security reasons on 5 november 2015 a tailings dam collapsed at the samarco mariana mining complex in minas gerais releasing 11 7 million cubic meters of liquid waste it killed 19 people left hundreds homeless and pollutants flowed 600 kilometers down the rio doce to the atlantic ocean just over three years later another environmental catastrophe hit minas gerais when the tailings dam at córrego do feijão iron ore mine in brumadinho gave way on january 25 2019 a torrent of mud and mining waste killed 270 people and caused untold environmental damage for ana and others in her close knit community disaster anxiety is compounded by the impact the mine already has on their lives we live with noise pollution 24 hours a day there is also the stench of the dam which is very strong before the mine there was a waterfall a river today there is no more the river is polluted no fish she says human rights ana s testimony echoes the wider story of brazil s extractive sector those living near mining oil and gas operations rarely benefit from them instead their life quality invariably drops while the wealth these industries generate flows into the hands of a small minority the lack of transparency and accountability which enables this is laid bare in a new report by brazilian ngo ibase instituto brasileiro de análises sociais e econômicas and global transparency coalition publish what you pay our report focuses on minas rio which is owned and operated by uk multinational anglo american and which makes vast profits exporting iron ore to china while leaving little behind for local communities it documents how communities including ana s have suffered numerous environmental and human rights impacts since development began on minas rio in 2009 these include contaminated streams rivers pastures and farmland water shortages which have reduced local food production agricultural production in the local municipality of conceição do mato dentro has declined by two thirds since advent of minas rio and dust plumes leading to respiratory diseases particularly among children and older people while a direct causal link remains unproven municipal data shows increases in violence including against women since the opening of the mine ana is among those who have little doubt about the connection between the two see related unequal exchange for brazil community in shadow of anglo american s minas rio mine we could come and go women could walk alone without much fear after the mining company arrived the violence here increased a lot our freedom ended she says many of those worst affected by the mine live on scattered family farms often linked by kinship ties and are of afro descendant ethnicity a disproportionate impact which could be classed as a form of systemic racism too little transparency our research also exposes the brazilian government s lack of transparency and accountability at national and subnational levels for the mining tax and royalty receipts it gets from the companies it grants concessions to under uk extractive industry transparency regulations anglo american which is listed on the london and johannesburg stock exchanges and uk incorporated publishes its disaggregated payments to all governments worldwide annually for minas rio payments reported by anglo american as made between 2015 and 2018 totalled 79 9 million yet we found that the local municipality conceição do mato dentro fails to report to citizens how it spends its share of the money received from the mining company via the national mining agency and that it s possibly receiving a smaller share of royalties than it s due this falls short of international best practice pressure for change while the study focuses on a single mine it sheds light on the wider problems surrounding mineral extraction in brazil and beyond around minas rio and countless other mines and oil wells around the world people are living in poverty and environmental degradation but pressure for extractive companies to remove the stain of environmental and human rights violations from their supply chains is growing stronger with mounting calls from civil society and investors one concrete way for brazil to heed these calls would be by joining the extractive industries transparency initiative eiti as 11 other latin american and caribbean countries have already done the eiti leads the implementation of global standards for the good governance of oil gas and mineral resources it enables the kind of transparency and accountability and a forum for dialogue between government industry and civil society that brazil s extractive sector desperately needs removing the shroud of secrecy that still cloaks much of the extractive sector requires governments including brazil s to make oil gas and mining data accessible to their citizens by among other things publishing the full texts of all contracts licenses concessions and other legal agreements what s more for the human rights of those living near mines to be truly respected companies proposing new mining projects should be required to conduct and publish comprehensive human rights impact assessments and to secure the free prior and informed consent fpic of local communities as recommended by the international council on mining and metals which counts anglo american bhp and the rio tinto group among its members companies operating current mining projects should publish and consult locally on human rights impact reports with new assessments every three years when public concerns like those we have identified at minas rio arise companies should publish and implement human rights management plans to address them anglo american maintain that sustainability is at the heart of its decision making and that it strictly complies with the applicable legislation and has its activities licensed and monitored by the competent authorities while following the best international standards and guidelines the mayor of the conceição do mato dentro said the municipality would go broke without the mine and that anglo american is actively supporting sustainable development in the area many living near minas rio disagree if government officials really saw us as people affected by mining we would not be living but it s like we don t exist it s like there are no people in our community says ana athayde motta is executive director of ibase and miles litvinoff is the former director of pwyp uk related listening who benefits from resource extraction in the drc listen here
elon musk isn t happy with a personal fortune that is flirting with 300 billion the tesla ceo the richest person on earth has been attacking a democratic proposal to tax the assets of billionaires like him the idea behind the democratic plan is to use revenue from a billionaires tax to help pay for a domestic policy package being negotiated in congress that would among other things help combat climate change provide universal prekindergarten and expand health care programs the proposal wasn t included in president joe biden s framework for the domestic policy package released thursday though that deal among congressional democrats isn t final musk who recently blew past amazon founder jeff bezos as the world no 1 in wealth thanks to tesla s soaring share price would be liable for perhaps a one time 50 billion tax hit under the democratic proposal forget it he says my plan the spacex founder tweeted thursday about his fortune is to use the money to get humanity to mars and preserve the light of consciousness he may well get his wish with the proposal removed from the white house framework earlier this week musk argued the fundamental problem is that government spends too much money and he warned that the billionaire tax proposal could lead over time to tax hikes for more americans eventually he tweeted monday they run out of other people s money and then they come for you the democratic proposal unveiled wednesday by sen ron wyden would tax the gains of people with either 1 billion or more in assets or three consecutive years of income of 100 million or more at the capital gains tax rate of 20 and the 3 8 net investment income tax rate it would apply to fewer than an estimated 800 people who would have to pay tax on the value of tradable items like stocks even if they don t sell them under current law such assets are subject to tax only when they re sold supporters have said the tax could raise 200 billion over 10 years that could help fund biden s legislative priorities republicans are unified in opposition to the proposal and some have suggested it would be challenged in court the democrats proposal came against the backdrop of growing concerns about vast economic inequality with the wealth of many american multi billionaires having accelerated during the covid 19 pandemic thanks to increased stock and home equity even more than before the virus struck john catsimatidis the billionaire grocery chain and real estate magnate who owns gristedes condemned the proposal as something you would expect putin to do referring to president vladimir putin of russia the billionaire tax plan catsimatidis told the associated press is a little bit insane the american people have reached the point where they re saying enough is enough said catsimatidis who lost a bid for the republican nomination for new york city mayor in 2013 stop spending the money stupidly they come up with budgets that are stupid budgets and they want to make everybody else suffer for it do we need infrastructure catsimatidis added sure we need infrastructure do we need bridges to nowhere no we don t need those you re talking about the people that create the jobs he said of billionaires we can get up and go somewhere else leon cooperman the outspoken billionaire investor who has long denounced sen elizabeth warren s own proposal for a wealth tax has added his voice to the exasperation coming from some of the uber wealthy in an interview with the daily beast cooperman said of the tax i doubt it s legal and it s stupid what made america great he said was the people who started with nothing like me making a lot of money and giving it back a relentless attack on wealthy people makes no sense not every billionaire shares such outrage a spokesperson for george soros the investor and liberal philanthropist told the ap that soros is supportive of the proposed billionaires tax and while warren buffett has yet to comment publicly on the proposal the billionaire head of berkshire hathaway has long called for higher taxes on the ultra wealthy like himself bob lord a tax lawyer and associate fellow at the progressive think tank institute for policy studies said that even if this particular proposal doesn t pass it does reflect how concerns about financial inequality are gathering momentum propublica reported in june that some of the richest americans have paid no income tax or nearly none in some years including musk who the report said paid zero income taxes in 2018 critics argue that musk s criticism of the billionaire tax proposal overlooks the fact that tesla s rise has been aided by government incentives and loans lord noted for example that the run up in tesla stock monday after a major order of teslas from hertz increased musk s wealth by roughly 37 billion more than what the irs collects in estate and gift tax revenue from the entire country in one year wyden s proposal lord suggested might need to close some loopholes but i think they ve done a pretty good job with it he said there are folks out there who are saying the billionaires will just put their money into non publicly traded assets but it s not going to be that easy it s a pretty well crafted bill such tax changes could also shift how billionaire philanthropists make donations brian mittendorf a professor of accounting at ohio state university said he believes that in the short term the billionaire proposal would lead some of the uber wealthy to rush philanthropic contributions into so called donor advised funds such funds would allow them to receive tax deductions up front without distributing any of the money donors can t get the money back from these funds if in fact this were to pass mittendorf said it creates huge incentives to donate some of these assets that have gone up in value before the tax hits ___ ap business writer glenn gamboa contributed to this article ____ the associated press receives support

north carolina sen richard burr and his brother in law are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission for potential insider trading a case that stems from their abrupt sales of financial holdings during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic according to recent federal court filings burr a republican is among several lawmakers from both parties who faced outrage over their aggressive trading in early 2020 before the economic threat from the virus was widely known that fueled accusations that the members of congress were acting on inside information gained through their official duties to benefit financially which is illegal under a law known as the stock act burr was previously investigated by the trump administration s justice department for offloading 1 6 million from his portfolio in january and february 2020 the department cleared him of wrongdoing almost a year later on jan 19 donald trump s last full day in office but the sec continued to

respond to requests for comment burr has previously denied any wrongdoing the filings stem from a case brought by the sec to force fauth to comply with a subpoena the agency argued that his close relationship with burr and a phone call between the two followed by calls to fauth s brokers made his testimony critical whether fauth was himself tipped with inside information from senator burr and whether fauth knew senator burr was violating his duties under the stock act by conveying that information are matters fauth is uniquely positioned to speak to the sec said in a filing to bolster their case sec attorneys released a timeline of phone calls from feb 13 2020 the day burr sold off the vast majority of his portfolio it was roughly one week before the stock market went into a tailspin at the time burr had material nonpublic information concerning covid 19 and its potential impact on the u s and global economies some of which he learned through his position as chairman of the senate intelligence committee and from former staffers directing the government s coronavirus response the sec alleges in the court filing that day after burr instructed his own broker to sell he

statute which burr and fauth are being investigated under was passed with bipartisan support in 2012 following a congressional stock trading scandal it was cheered by government ethics groups and watchdogs as a long overdue step but in the nearly decade since no one has been convicted under the law meanwhile congressional stock trading has continued apace legal experts say such insider trading

people line up at a coronavirus disease covid 19 testing at a mobile testing van in new york city u s photo reuters brendan mcdermid the u s economy grew at its slowest pace in more than a year in the third quarter as a resurgence in covid 19 cases further stretched global supply chains leading to shortages of goods like automobiles that slammed the brakes on consumer spending the weaker than expected growth reported by the commerce department on thursday also reflected decreasing pandemic relief money from the government to businesses state and local governments as well as households hurricane ida which devastated u s offshore energy production at the end of august also restrained economic growth but there are signs that economic activity is already regaining momentum amid declining coronavirus cases driven by the delta variant the number of americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a fresh 19 month low last week even with the third quarter setback the level of gross domestic product hit a record high and the economy is now 1 4 bigger than before the pandemic the growth speed bump in the third quarter is an unwelcome surprise certainly but it will not send the economy off into the ditch because it is partly based on supply disruptions in the auto industry that has cratered sales with inventories near record lows on dealer lots said christopher rupkey chief economist at fwdbonds in new york gross domestic product increased at a 2 0 annualized rate last quarter the government said in its advance gdp estimate that was the slowest since the second quarter of 2020 when the economy suffered a historic contraction in the wake of stringent mandatory measures to contain the first wave of coronavirus cases the economy grew at a 6 7 rate in the second quarter economists polled by reuters had forecast gdp rising at a 2 7 rate last quarter the meager growth came mostly from a moderate pace of inventory drawdown business inventories decreased at a 77 7 billion pace compared to a 168 5 billion rate in the second quarter as result inventories contributed 2 07 percentage points to third quarter gdp growth inventory accumulation remains weak owing to shortages especially of motor vehicles motor vehicle production fell at a 41 6 rate after declining at a 14 1 pace in the second quarter because of a global shortage of semiconductors excluding inventories the economy contracted at a 0 1 rate last quarter the scarcity of motor vehicles hammered consumer spending which grew at only a 1 6 rate after a robust 12 pace in the april june quarter consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity graphic consumer spending takes a breather spending on long lasting manufactured goods dropped at a 26 2 rate motor vehicles cut 2 39 percentage points from gdp growth the biggest drag from autos since the second quarter of 1980 excluding motor vehicle output the economy grew at a 3 5 rate last quarter a slowdown from the 7 4 pace in the prior quarter spending on services was surprisingly strong notching a 7 9 growth pace amid demand for air travel and car rentals demand for services at hospitals and restaurants rose as did bookings for hotel motel and university campus accommodation services spending accelerated at an 11 5 pace in the april june quarter graphic the drag from detroit the government estimated that hurricane ida cost about 62 billion inflation remained hot eroding spending power the federal reserve s preferred inflation gauge the personal consumption expenditures pce price index excluding food and energy rose at a 4 5 rate the core pce price index increased at a 6 1 pace in the second quarter the combination of high inflation and slow growth could fan fears of stagflation something that most economists do not believe is imminent as output is seen picking up through 2022 stagflation will be the talk of the town but we should not fall for this misleading narrative said gregory daco chief u s economist at oxford economics in new york inflation dynamics are definitely moderating expansion with sticky supply driven inflation but the economy isn t stagnating stocks on wall street were trading higher on upbeat earnings from caterpillar merck and ford the dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the european central bank pushed back against market bets that high inflation would trigger an interest rate hike as soon as next year u s treasury yields rose regaining speed slower growth will have no impact on the fed s plans to start reducing as early as next month the amount of money it is pumping into the economy through monthly bond purchases with the summer wave of covid 19 infections behind cases declining significantly in recent weeks and vaccinations picking up economic activity is regaining steam consumer confidence rebounded this month and orders for capital goods excluding aircraft raced to a record high in september the labor market is tightening though pandemic related worker shortages could keep employment growth moderate this month a separate report from the labor department on thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10 000 to a seasonally adjusted 281 000 last week the lowest level since mid march 2020 it was the third straight week that claims remained below the 300 000 threshold the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 237 000 to 2 243 million in the week ended oct 16 that was also the lowest level in 19 months given the massive number of job openings look for claims to continue declining for some time and look for the labor market to remain drum tight said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economics in holland pennsylvania though wages are rising inflation is reducing consumers purchasing power income at the disposal of households after adjusting for inflation decreased at a 5 6 rate last quarter the saving rate fell to 8 9 from 10 5 in the second quarter high prices and lack of trucks as well as communication equipment cut into business spending on equipment which fell at a 3 2 rate after three straight quarters of double digit growth trade was a drag on gdp growth for a fifth straight quarter following a drop in exports shortages and expensive building materials weighed on home building and remodeling leading to residential investment contracting for a second straight quarter government spending rebounded on state and local government investment

updated october 29 2021 at 6 10 pm et updated nov 2 8 10 p m et children as young as 5 will be able to get vaccinated against covid 19 in the u s within the next several days while some parents aren t sure how they feelabout this others are waiting eagerly for a chance to protect their children from covid 19 but federal agencies can t be rushed here s what has to happen before the pfizer biontech shots can start going into kids arms loading currently pfizer is the furthest along in this process but moderna has shared some promising results from its vaccine trial with this age group and johnson johnson is expected to begin vaccine trials for young kids in the future as well here are more details on what the regulatory process entails and how it is going for the pfizer vaccine step 1 drugmakers complete the clinical trial pfizer and biontech have completed a three phase clinical trial in children 5 to 11 years old the companies submitted all of the data from that trial and an application for emergency use authorization to the food and drug administration on oct 7 the main study included 2 250 kids and found that the lower dose version of the vaccine was 90 7 effective in preventing symptomatic covid 19 it was given as a series of two shots 21 days apart and the dose was 10 micrograms a third of the dose given to adults and teenagers no serious side effects such as heart inflammation were reported although with only a few thousand children included in the research that sort of rare problem wouldn t necessarily be detected step 2 independent scientists review the data this week on oct 26 a panel of outside scientists considered pfizer s safety and efficacy data along with an analysis from fda scientists on the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different pandemic scenarios after some lively discussion the group overwhelmingly voted yes that the benefits of the pfizer vaccine outweigh the risks for use in this age group step 3 fda officials weigh in next the fda the agency itself considered the advisers vote on pfizer s smaller dose shot for kids on friday fda officials decided to extend the emergency use authorization for pfizer s covid 19 vaccine to younger kids acting commissioner dr janet woodcock assured parents in a statement that the agency had rigorously evaluated the data and this vaccine meets our high standards step 4 more independent scientists debate and vote but wait there s more yet another federal health agency and its advisers had to weigh in before the shots can become available this time it s the centers for disease control and prevention you can think of it like this when it comes to vaccines the fda is in charge of the what and the cdc is in charge of the who the cdc s advisory group met tuesday and voted to recommend the vaccine for all children in the 5 11 age group dr amanda cohn served until recently as the executive secretary for the cdc s vaccine advisory group and she s a voting member of the fda s vaccine advisory group explained the difference between the two federal advisory groups that weigh in on these kinds of decisions the fda decides whether a vaccine or other product is safe and effective she explained at the fda advisory meeting this week the cdc s group then considers and votes on who would benefit from the vaccine and who should get vaccinated their deliberations include factors such as equity feasibility and the potential impact of recommendations on a population she said when they vote the cdc s advisers could follow the fda s lead in their recommendations or they could make more focused or nuanced recommendations cohn said for instance they could have recommended it for a certain subgroup like children with underlying conditions or those who haven t had a prior coronavirus infection step 5 cdc director makes final recommendation even then a vote from the cdc s advisers isn t an official recommendation that comes from the cdc s director dr rochelle walensky on tuesday night she greenlit the advisers recommendation if she had chosen to she could have changed the recommendation from what the committee voted on as she did with boosters but she followed their lead and recommended them to all kids aged 5 11 only after the cdc director issues an official recommendation can shots get distributed to pediatricians and pharmacies around the country step 6 the shots get distributed to providers and pharmacies experts have been reassuring the public that the rollout of this new lower dose vaccine won t be a repeat of the disarray of the original covid 19 vaccine rollout last winter we will be ready immediately following fda and cdc s decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly easily and conveniently jeffrey zients the white house s covid 19 response coordinator said at a news conference wednesday the immunization managers planning the rollout in each state feel much more ready this time says claire hannan executive director of the association of immunization managers we have plenty of vaccine and i think that we re very well prepared she says still she warns that parents shouldn t expect that they ll be able to get their kid vaccinated the instant the regulatory hurdles are cleared there will be challenges getting the vaccine to the right providers to meet the demand experts suggest

vaccine to younger kids acting commissioner dr janet woodcock assured parents in a statement that the agency had rigorously evaluated the data and this vaccine meets our high standards step 4 more independent scientists debate and vote but wait there s more yet another federal health agency and its advisers had to weigh in before the shots can become available this time it s the centers for disease control and prevention you can think of it like this when it comes to vaccines the fda is in charge of the what and the cdc is in charge of the who the cdc s advisory group met tuesday and voted to recommend the vaccine for all children in the 5 11 age group dr amanda cohn served until recently as the executive secretary for the cdc s vaccine advisory group and she s a voting member of the fda s vaccine advisory group explained the difference between the two federal advisory groups that weigh in on these kinds of decisions the fda decides whether a vaccine or other product is safe and effective she explained at the fda advisory meeting this week the cdc s group then considers and votes on who would benefit from the vaccine and who should get vaccinated their deliberations include factors such as equity feasibility and the potential impact of recommendations on a population she said when they vote the cdc s advisers could follow the fda s lead in their recommendations or they could make more focused or nuanced recommendations cohn said for instance they could have recommended it for a certain subgroup like children with underlying conditions or those who haven t had a prior coronavirus infection step 5 cdc director makes final recommendation even then a vote from the cdc s advisers isn t an official recommendation that comes from the cdc s director dr rochelle walensky on tuesday night she greenlit the advisers recommendation if she had chosen to she could have changed the recommendation from what the committee voted on as she did with boosters but she followed their lead and recommended them to all kids aged 5 11 only after the cdc director issues an official recommendation can shots get distributed to pediatricians and pharmacies around the country step 6 the shots get distributed to providers and pharmacies experts have been reassuring the public that the rollout of this new lower dose vaccine won t be a repeat of the disarray of the

u s president joe biden on thursday unveiled a framework for a 1 75 trillion u s dollar social spending package following weeks of intensive negotiations with congressional democrats the so called build back better framework includes 555 billion dollars in clean energy and climate investments 400 billion dollars in funding for child care and free preschool 200 billion dollars in child tax earned income tax credits and 150 billion dollars in investments for affordable housing according to a fact sheet released by the white house the framework seeks to impose new taxes on the largest corporations and the wealthiest americans to raise revenue of around 2 trillion dollars over a decade to fully pay for the social spending plan if passed the framework will impose a 15 percent minimum tax on corporate profits for firms with earnings over 1 billion dollars reported to shareholders and a 1 percent surcharge on corporate stock buybacks according to the fact sheet the framework would also apply a 5 percent surtax rate on individual incomes above 10 million dollars and an additional 3 percent surtax on incomes above 25 million dollars the framework is far smaller than biden s original 3 5 trillion dollar proposal and it has not been written into legislative language yet no one got everything they wanted including me but that s what compromise is that s consensus biden said in remarks at the white house before departing for a week of summits in europe given half a chance the american people have never ever ever ever left the country down so let s get this done biden said urging congress to pass both the social spending package and the bipartisan infrastructure bill it s not clear whether the framework would pave the way for the house of representatives to approve the 1 2 trillion dollar bipartisan infrastructure bill that was passed by the senate earlier this year progressive house democrats have held up the senate passed bill for months demanding a vote on the larger social spending plan
