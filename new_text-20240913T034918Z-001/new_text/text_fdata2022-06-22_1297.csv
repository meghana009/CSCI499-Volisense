tablet or email to your colleagues q1 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more overall silver producers expect demand to significantly ramp up in the next few years as industrial demand substantially increases the most significant trend that should increase demand for silver in the next decade is going to be green technology from renewables to electric vehicles all of which require a high degree of silver to produce should push demand up to record levels furthermore the difference between supply and demand should ensure prices remain where they are even though central banks continue to remove liquidity from the global markets another factor that could push up silver prices is the gold silver ratio the gold to silver ratio continues to be at a multi decade high and silver prices need to go much higher for that ratio to get back to historical levels risks global liquidity and demand continue to face macroeconomic headwinds which could put downward pressure on the price

amid economic downturn midterms are about money b efore explaining why donald trump s endorsements will ultimately not determine the winners and losers of the upcoming midterm elections i first give credit where credit is due ballotpedia has kept a scorecard of the former president s endorsements in the republican primaries some 94 percent of candidates who earned trump s coveted support emerged victorious while a majority of them might have won even without his nod the trump seal of approval did swing two major us senate races in ohio and pennsylvania key states that republicans must win to recapture the white house in 2024 trump remains the most dominant and popular personality in the republican party however if every election revolves to some extent around pocketbook issues this year the economy will overshadow every other issue and person running for office the economy s misery index zooms higher with each passing day inflation is running at levels unseen since the 1970s when jimmy carter clad in his button down cardigan sweater bemoaned what became known as america s national malaise after assuring us throughout 2021 that inflation was transitory the federal reserve board last week hiked interest rates three quarters of one percent in one day in the first six months of 2022 interest rates on government debt have risen from close to zero to well over 3 percent that s good for savers but bad for the stock market higher rates make bonds more attractive investments than stocks most major stock indices are in bear markets having shed 20 to 30 percent of their value not to mention bitcoin which has plummeted more than 70 percent from its 52 week high lauded as a store of value or even a futuristic replacement for cash bitcoin is proving to be what its detractors warned a highly volatile risky trading vehicle that can t always be cashed in on demand oh and of course there s the price of gas which has more than doubled in two years those are just some of the short term economic plagues america s national debt has crossed the 30 trillion mark which equates to more than 240 000 of debt for every american taxpayer the average consumer may not feel the pinch today but if interest rates remain this high or even higher the government will be spending some 66 trillion in the next 30 years just to pay interest on the debt according to the peter g peterson foundation that s a think tank named after a nixon administration economic appointee and former fed chair the foundation projects that by the late 2040s the us will spend more on interest payments than it does on medicare and social security market declines in recent years have tended to be sharp and short lived just like the gloom and doom predictions that accompany them the picture could be better or worse on election day 2022 it s safe to say that donald trump s tweets pronouncements or endorsements will always carry weight but will be weighed down by america s economic predicaments winners and losers will be determined by solutions that candidates can offer to ease the economic pain and the compassion they show for hard pressed consumers originally featured in mishpacha issue 916

david bowie s self titled debut album was released on june 1 1967 his movie career launched almost simultaneously bowie first appeared onscreen in 1968 on the bbc during an episode of the british tv drama theater 625 titled the pistol shot he went on to more than 30 eclectic and sometimes surprising roles appearing in several critically acclaimed mainstream movies like the man who fell to earth labyrinth and the linguini incident all while making almost as many studio albums for bowie the two careers weren t entirely unalike a point underscored when he created musical alter egos in ziggy stardust and the thin white duke my performances have got to be theatrical experiences for me as well as for the audience he told rolling stone in 1971 i don t want to climb out of my fantasies in order to go up on stage i want to take them on stage with me as you ll see in this list of david bowie s most compelling acting roles in television and movies the common bond was his boundless creativity the image 1969 bowie s debut as an actor came in a 13 minute short from director michael armstrong unknown at the time bowie played a nondescript character simply called the boy opposite actor michael byrne who went on to star in indiana jones and the last crusade the sum of all fears and tomorrow never dies in the image bowie appears as a ghostly figure who comes to life from a painting the man who fell to earth 1976 a larger role for bowie came several years later in the science fiction film the man who fell to earth about an alien that encounters complications as he tries to blend into the human race to save his own dying planet for his role as thomas jerome newton bowie won an award for best actor at the 1976 saturn awards just a gigolo 1978 another actor was originally set to appear in just a gigolo before bowie became interested screenwriter and executive producer joshua sinclair revealed to nme in 2021 unfortunately audiences ignored this poorly constructed tale about a prussian officer named paul ambrosius von przygodski who returns home to chaos listen you were disappointed and you weren t even in it imagine how we felt bowie complained in 1980 i mean oh god i really should have known better every real legitimate actor that i ve ever met has told me never to even approach a film unless you know the script is good if the script isn t any good then there s no way a film is going to be good luckily this flop didn t keep other prominent movie roles from coming his way in the future christiane f 1981 a 13 year old girl in 70s era berlin becomes addicted to heroin in an intense film that included a bowie cameo things in the teen s life gradually distort and disappear as she befriends a small crew of junkies and falls in love with a drug abusing male prostitute christiane f won a golden screen award in germany and was voted most popular at the montreal film festival the year it was released baal 1982 bowie played the title role in the bbc television adaptation of bertolt brecht s play after spending four weeks in rehearsals the week long shoot took place in august 1981 before baal was broadcast the following march as the protagonist bowie plays a drunken poet caught up in a downward spiral he also contributed several songs to the corresponding ep the hunger 1983 the film that critic roger ebert described as an agonizingly bad vampire movie wasn t a box office smash still it eventually achieved a cult following thanks to a cast that included bowie catherine deneuve and susan sarandon deneuve played a vampire named miriam in the movie while bowie was cast as her husband of 100 years stevie nicks told rolling stone that it was one of her favorite moments of bowie s career declaring his turn as john creepy and strange and amazingly beautiful merry christmas mr lawrence 1983 a war film about the experiences of a troop of british soldiers captured by the imperial japanese army during world war ii this christmas movie was a far cry from current light hearted hallmark flicks bowie embodied a british officer named major jack celliers who was interned by the japanese as a prisoner of war merry christmas mr lawrence covered topics including culture shock the dehumanization of war and homosexuality the film earned critical acclaim for its message of finding common ground and bridging gaps across cultural divides into the night 1985 jeff goldblum and michelle pfeiffer starred in this dark comedy action thriller which also enlisted the help of comedian dan akroyd just before spies like us and dragnet were released into the night follows ed orkin goldblum as an insomniac with a cheating wife and a dull job who ends up on a wild journey with a mysterious woman named diana pfeiffer after she drops out of the sky onto the hood of his car the adventure includes a memorable scene with bowie carl perkins and a particularly sharp weapon also making cameos were muppets creator jim henson and the film s director john landis absolute beginners 1986 director julien temple initially asked bowie to supply music for the soundtrack to absolute beginners after reading the script however bowie asked to play the gender bending character vendice partners instead the musical is based on the book by colin macinnes which is set in london in the late 50s and concentrates on the youth culture that will eventually become the trend influencing mod movement the title song absolute beginners served as bowie s final top five hit reaching no 2 in the u k the movie also featured the kinks ray davies labyrinth 1986 jim henson initially considered sting prince mick jagger and michael jackson for the role of jareth the goblin king in this musical fantasy before deciding on bowie labyrinth follows teenager sarah jennifer connelly through a surreal pursuit as she tries to rescue her baby brother from the clutches of the goblin king it was like a wonderland for me working on that film connelly told et in 2015 and i loved jim henson and david bowie was so sweet to me bowie wrote five songs for the soundtrack including as the world falls down and magic dance the last temptation of christ 1988 bowie appeared in martin scorsese s religious drama as pontius pilate the high ranking roman official who the gospels claim condemned jesus to die on the cross the last temptation of christ caused a stir when it deviated from the bible in retelling the story of jesus willem dafoe focusing on the main character s spiritual conflict as he wrestled with his divine nature by the late 80s bowie had become known for pushing the creative envelope unfortunately his overall screen time in the last temptation of christ accounted for less than four minutes in the 162 minute film the linguini incident 1991 this american crime comedy starred rosanna arquette opposite bowie as a fellow disgruntled new york city restaurant employee who set out to rob their mutual employer the linguini incident wasn t a commercial success or an award winner still bowie was reportedly quite happy with the end result twin peaks fire walk with me 1992 bowie built a successful acting career through a series of brief but pivotal roles and twin peaks fire walk with me served as more evidence he appeared as fbi agent phillip jeffries in the david lynch directed classic delivering an iconic performance in just four minutes of onscreen work in bowie s one scene he and co star kyle maclachlan imply disturbing ideas about mortality self control and the inability to escape from chaos basquiat 1996 it s a tall task for any actor to take on the role of iconic pop artist andy warhol but bowie had admired warhol s work for much of his career so the basquiat character served as one just more eclectic role in a portfolio of exuberant characters the movie also served as another mile marker on bowie s well documented journey of adventurous wigs mr rice s secret 1999 bowie portrayed a mysterious 400 year old man who helps a terminally ill teen find meaning in life in another adventurous and challenging role i have quite a few years of my own to draw upon though a year in manhattan is good for fatigue resource bowie quipped in 2002 i don t think you can play 400 there are no precedents a 400 year old may well have the ability to project the characteristics of a 19 year old who knows i just settled for him to be relatively low key zoolander 2001 bowie had no idea that this pivotal role in ben stiller s comedy classic was coming david bowie literally we just came up with the idea of who would be funny to judge this walk off bowie with his song fashion personified that stiller later admitted we put it in the script and sent it to him and he actually said yes that was one of those out of the blue things by the time bowie appears in this action comedy tensions have peaked between rival models derek zoolander stiller and hansel mcdonald owen wilson and they need a judge to settle the score enter a dapper looking bowie with let s dance playing in the background and the rest is slapstick gold if nobody has any objections i believe i might be of service bowie says playing himself arthur and the invisibles 2007 this animated flick based on the book by luc besson told the story of a young arthur who lives with his grandmother in an old farmhouse in connecticut to pass the time while his parents are away looking for work arthur reads his grandfather s journals and becomes inspired by the details of his adventures around the globe bowie plays emperor maltazard the father of darkos the emperor of necropolis and the main antagonist arthur and the invisibles was created in france for an english speaking audience and included the voices of madonna robert deniro chazz palminteri and harvey keitel in addition to bowie the prestige 2006 casting the small but vital role of nikola tesla was one of the most difficult aspects for director christopher nolan bowie actually turned him down the first time nolan asked the filmmaker said he begged bowie to take the part admitting that he had no idea how to move forward if the rocker didn t accept bowie eventually relented and played the serbian born tesla a pioneer of electronic engineering who died in 1943 august 2008 bowie didn t even rehearse this part beforehand he showed up knew his lines and was an absolute joy to work with director austin chick told the reeler august follows two brothers who are trying to keep their dot com company afloat as the stock market begins to collapse in august 2001 right before the 9 11 terrorist attacks the siblings were portrayed by josh hartnett and adam scott while bowie played a supporting role he sees a bit of himself in hartnett s character and sees this as an opportunity to teach a young man a lesson not destroy him forever chick said but you can tell he sort of relishes it i spent the whole day saying oh my god i m directing david bowie bandslam 2009 bowie s final movie role came in this pg rated teen musical which tells the story of a fledgling rock group looking for its big break in a local battle of the bands competition bandslam delivered another cameo for bowie or at least a toned down myspace checking version of himself as he sits in a coffee shop scrolling through his top 8 in one of the last scenes he comes across one of vanessa hudgens pop punk songs and becomes moved enough to email her i really like your band you know i m starting an indie label it served as a happy ending for a teen musical that was never intended to be epic while closing out bowie s career with another surprising role for underrated actor who was picky about his parts

or unanticipated events occurring after the date of this release except as required by law or by any appropriate regulatory authority adr frequently asked questions faqs the following faqs and answers in relation to adrs are for information purposes only and may not contain all information that may be important to you what is an american depositary receipt adr an adr is a negotiable us dollar denominated certificate representing ownership of share s in a non us company holders of adrs receive dividends in us dollars if applicable and have the right to vote on shareholders resolutions if applicable the term adr and ads are often used interchangeably adrs were specifically designed to facilitate the purchase holding and sale of non us securities by us investors what is the difference between a sponsored and unsponsored dr dr programmes are either sponsored by an issuing company or unsponsored if a company sponsors a dr programme it enters into a contractual agreement with the depositary bank and in the case of an american depositary receipt programme governed by us law also with the holders of the adrs this contractual agreement is known as the deposit agreement see further below a dr programme may also be unsponsored meaning that it is set up without the company s participation or even its consent a depositary will typically establish an unsponsored dr programme only if it believes that there is sufficient interest in the company s shares to generate adequate fee income or if a broker dealer has requested such a programme and agreed to assist with the expense while unsponsored drs are issued without its co operation the foreign issuer must be a reporting company under the us exchange act of 1934 or have obtained an exemption under rule 12g3 2 b from the reporting requirements of that act typically the depositary will request a letter of non objection from the issuer before establishing the programme furthermore the sec staff takes the position that an unsponsored programme may not coexist with a sponsored programme for the same securities because of resulting market disorder what is the difference between a level i level ii and level iii programme level i a level i sponsored adr program is the easiest and least expensive means for a company to provide for issuance of its shares in adr form in the us a level i program involves the filing of an f 6 registration statement but allows for exemption under rule12g 3 2 b from full sec reporting requirements the issuer has a certain amount of control over the adrs issued under a sponsored level i program since a depositary agreement is executed between the issuer and one selected depositary bank level i adrs can however only be traded over the counter and cannot be listed on a national exchange in the us level ii a sponsored level ii adr must comply with the sec s full registration and reporting requirements in addition to filing an f 6 registration statement the issuer is also required to file sec form 20 f see chapter 6 for details and to comply with the sec s other disclosure rules including submission of its annual report which must be prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap registration allows the issuer to list its adrs on one of the three major national stock exchanges namely the new york stock exchange nyse the american stock exchange amex or the national association of securities dealers automated quotation nasdaq stock market each of which has reporting and disclosure requirements level ii sponsored programs are initiated by non us companies to give us investors access to their stock in the us as with a level i program a depositary agreement is signed between the issuer and a depositary bank level iii level iii sponsored adrs are similar to level ii adrs in that the issuer initiates the program deals with one depositary bank lists on one of the major us exchanges and files form f 6 and 20 f registration statements with the sec the major difference is that a level iii program allows the issuer to raise capital through a public offering of adrs in the us and this requires the issuer to submit a form f 1 to the sec who or what is the custodian the custodian is the foreign correspondent bank of the depositary with whom the company s underlying shares have been deposited the custodian is usually situated in the same country as the company but this is not always the case on receipt of the company s underlying shares from an investor seeking to create drs the custodian will confirm such fact to the depositary and therefore allowing it to issue the equivalent number of drs to the investor delivering the shares what are the benefits of adrs to us investors us investors may prefer to purchase adrs rather than ordinary shares in the company s home market because adrs trade clear and settle according to us market conventions adrs allow us investors to diversify into non us securities relatively easily why is vection technologies seeking to establish an adr program vection technologies is seeking to establish the adr program to make it easier for us investors to invest in the company adrs are easier for us investors for reasons including reduced administrative costs and u s dollar denominated capital gains realisation what effect do you expect the adr program to have on your shareholder base the company expects that the adr program will generate stronger interest from u s investors what types of companies issue adrs adr issuers are typically large corporations with primary listings outside of the us any non us company seeking to raise capital in the us or increase their base of us investor can also issue adrs who is vection technologies depositary for adrs deutsche bank trust company americas is the depositary bank for vection technologies adr program the depositary bank plays a key role in issuance as well as cancellation of adrs it also maintains the adr holder register distributes the dividends in us dollars if applicable and facilitates the exercise by the adrs holders of their voting rights if applicable what is the difference between a registered adr holder and a beneficial adr holder a registered holder is the party whose name appears on the books of the depositary bank the registered holder is considered the owner of record a

after gary gensler was tapped to head the securities and exchange commission last year it quickly became apparent that under his watch the sec would pursue an aggressive agenda unlike anything the world of finance had experienced in decades one result has been a wave of new rule change proposals that has stunned wall street insiders who fear the end of the easy money enabled by years of lax regulation take for example two proposed rules that deal with the disclosure of shareholder activists stock and swaps positions including the sec s attempt to broaden the definition of investors acting as a group forcing even more public disclosure elliott management corp s richard zabel the firm s general counsel and former deputy u s attorney for the southern district of new york set the stage for hedge fund activists outrage at these proposals with a 32 page comment letter criticizing the sec s new rules with arguments from constitutional issues to conflicts with judicial precedent the commission has inexplicably decided to pursue new regulations that would effectively smother activism in the u s capital markets zabel wrote in addition to writing letters elliott s zabel has met with sec officials to press his case so have executives from third point millennium management exoduspoint capital management d e shaw pdt partners tiger hill partners marshall wace and citadel all of whom have met with the sec as representatives for the managed funds association and the alternative investment management association the two hedge fund lobbying groups but the hedge funds aren t fighting the sec alone a new organization which institutional investor has learned has at least one hedge fund backer has enlisted dozens of academics to argue against the proposals creating something of a firestorm of criticism that effort is the brainchild of frank partnoy a law and finance professor at the uc berkeley school of law who decided the sec s new aggressiveness was a good reason to create a nonpartisan nonprofit institute he named it the international institute of law and finance that could influence policy by convincing other professors to sign on to comment letters that he and his colleague robert bishop would draft there s a gap in terms of academics connecting with policymakers says partnoy a highly regarded academic and prolific writer whose work includes several nonacademic books including f i a s c o his first person takedown of the derivatives business in which he once toiled as a salesperson at morgan stanley in part that gap exists because there is no incentive for academics to get involved wonky academic comments on proposed sec rule changes typically fly under the radar but partnoy made them his mission now his work in comment letters signed by himself bishop and other academics is taking some heat in part that s because the financing of his institute which pays partnoy and bishop for their letter writing has been shrouded in secrecy as a result the new institute has been thrust into a bigger brawl with the sec about the activist shareholder proposals for the activists the new rules come at a time when their strategy has become less popular last year shareholders supported only 28 percent of director candidates proposed by activists in the u s down from almost 50 percent in the prior four years according to insightia which tracks activism insightia also found that settlements with management ahead of proxy votes had also declined meanwhile it noted that activist firms are managing more money than ever one of the most significant and longest debated sec rule changes that could affect activism is a proposed shortening of the period after which an activist investor who amasses a 5 percent control stake in a company s shares must file a 13d disclosure form under the new rule that window would shrink from ten days to five and give the hedge fund fewer days to buy more shares or swaps before letting the world know it intends to agitate for change often at the board level and in the c suite once activists disclose their position shares of the target company rise on average about 10 percent so the hedge funds want to make sure their buying is complete if the position is disclosed at a very early stage it removes a lot of the economic incentive to do activism says an individual at one of the hedge funds that has criticized the proposals some activist firms may leave the space entirely those who target smaller companies are especially at risk of leaving the business activists say but proponents of the new rule say that today s world of instantaneous electronic communication makes the long lead time unnecessary and a few advocates of shareholder activism say privately that they no longer oppose the change as it s widely viewed as an issue of market fairness moreover hedge fund activists are quite busy in europe where not only are there lower disclosure thresholds but once the threshold is reached future purchases are forbidden until such disclosure is made adds former sec commissioner robert jackson if you re in a position where your business model is so rickety that going from ten days to five turns you from a profitable activist to an unprofitable one maybe it s not such a bad thing for you to find another business the part of the proposed sec rule that has become the most controversial however is its attempt to broaden the definition of a group of investors working together triggering disclosure when the investors combined stake goes above or below 5 percent hedge funds say such a change would cast a chill on the entire activist market under the current rules investors have to reach some sort of an agreement formal or informal to be considered a group acting in consort for 13d filing purposes under the proposed rule no explicit agreement need be reached making the group definition somewhat nebulous investors could be deemed part of a group simply by buying securities after receiving information from another investor according to a comment letter submitted by pershing square capital management investors would be extremely unwilling to talk to each other says the aforementioned hedge fund activist on a 13d they would have to report that trading every 1 percent up or down once the total reaches 5 percent they re not going to do it the third major issue is timely public disclosure of swaps positions a rule that gensler has stated publicly is a response to the 2021 blowup of archegos capital management which secretively used total return swaps to amass 160 billion worth of stakes in companies ultimately resulting in billions of dollars in losses for its counterparty banks and other market participants when archegos collapsed archegos is an extreme example of how undisclosed swap positions can wreak havoc in the markets but hedge fund activists use swaps to give themselves an economic stake in a company without actually owning the shares at the time of their activist campaigns in fact they sometimes do not even have to disclose a 5 percent stake because most of the economics are in the form of the swaps but since going public with their position typically causes the stock to pop they want to do so when they are done buying however if the swaps are disclosed as the sec has proposed a hedge fund s intentions could be known even before it hits the 5 percent stock ownership threshold requiring disclosure once again limiting the potential for profit the sec s intent is logical says former commissioner jackson who is now a professor at new york university school of law i don t think that you should have to be transparent in something you do in shares and be able to hide something you do with swaps whether the new rules are logical or not the effort to stop the sec is growing with the opposition even spreading to congress a letter that quotes one of those drafted by partnoy s institute criticizing the proposed rules has been making its way through the house of representatives in hopes of garnering congressional opposition to the sec s effort we are deeply troubled by the concerns raised by advocates of corporate accountability and social responsibility regarding recently proposed rules at the commission that may impair the ability of engaged shareholders to seek important changes at america s public corporations states the letter a copy of which ii has received as david webber respected labor scholar at boston university school of law and author of the rise of the working class shareholder labor s last best weapon noted in his comment letter whatever problems we may face in america we should all agree that an overabundance of corporate accountability is not one of them the webber letter was drafted by partnoy s institute rep ritchie torres a democrat from new york s south bronx one of the poorest districts in the nation whose top donors include elliott has been circulating the letter according to an individual familiar with the effort torres whom opensecrets says is a top recipient of hedge fund cash in the current election cycle did not return multiple requests for comment nor did elliott comments from hedge fund activists are par for the course as is lobbying congress you re closing a profitable loophole so there s no surprise that we re seeing the type of pushback that we see right now says andrew park a senior policy analyst at investor advocacy group americans for financial reform who was recently named to the sec s investor advisory committee and has written in support of the sec s new rule proposals but partnoy s international institute of law and finance is trying to set itself above the fray by focusing largely on academics the fact that 85 academics signed on to the letter about swaps and 65 signed the letter that deals with the 13d rule changes is often mentioned by hedge funds as independent proof that their criticisms are valid at the very least the academic letters don t oppose the hedge fund stance take the issue of shortening the 13d disclosure window which is anathema to many activists even though partnoy told ii that he personally supports closing the window to five days the numerous letters partnoy and bishop have written tend to hedge their bets indeed the letter signed by 65 professors that the two academics drafted says there is disagreement among the members of the group about that specific part of the proposal adding that there is not enough data to support it then the letter adds that it does not seem unreasonable to reduce the ten day period somewhat those professors also say that there s not enough data to support changing the definition of a group a point on which partnoy says he agrees the idea that the sec can go out and do more research on these issues however was dismissed by former sec general counsel john coates now a professor at harvard law school who wrote in his comment letter that academics seem to misunderstand the institutional autonomy the agency does and does not have to conduct original research the apparent groundswell of academic opposition has led supporters of the sec s new rule labor and investor interests to suspect that partnoy s institute is representing the views of hedge funds in large part their furor comes because partnoy and bishop attempted to portray the criticism of the sec s proposals as so widespread that it has captured not just academics but also first amendment advocates and what they termed labor interests indeed the professors wrote not many are on the sec s side that s something of an exaggeration for one thing the afl cio has supported the sec s proposed rule changes and is furious about the attempt to suggest labor thinks otherwise i find any potential confusion about the labor movement s position on hedge fund disclosure surprising given that even a cursory search of the afl cio s website would find an executive council statement going back to 2007 that was highly critical of activist hedge funds and particularly the secrecy around it says brandon rees deputy director of corporations and capital markets at the afl cio more than a month after the comment period was closed the afl cio wrote a second letter supporting the sec s proposed disclosure rules that was also signed by 11 separate unions the proposed rules are designed to require timely and complete disclosure of activist hedge fund ownership stakes in target companies we view such disclosure as a matter of market transparency and fairness to prevent creeping takeovers and other abusive practices the letter stated it added that the proposals will benefit workers and long term investors including workers pension funds some argue however that there is a negative side effect to the dustup because you have labor and shareholder activists fighting against each other here the only winner is corporate managements says a hedge fund and sec policy veteran while hedge fund activists and the academics talk about the importance of holding management accountable through activism unions have a more complex relationship with the strategy some union pension funds may agree with hedge fund activists and profit from their activities but unions have also long opposed some forms of activism because the corporate changes sought by hedge funds are often associated with job losses as mentioned in the afl cio letter activist hedge fund campaigns targeting public companies are associated with a reduction in jobs r d spending and capital expenditures the afl cio wrote indeed a comprehensive study of over 1 300 such campaigns conducted between 2000 and 2016 found that after activist hedge funds acquire ownership the company s workforce experiences a steady decline 4 57 percent in the first year and 7 66 percent by the fifth year partnoy s institute did get some labor support but that is now being recanted i made a mistake says andy stern the now retired once powerful head of the service employees international union who has walked back an april 11 letter he signed that was critical of the new rules says stern i got contacted by an acquaintance of someone i knew who claimed there were a certain number of labor groups or advocates who were concerned about a small piece of the rule which was whether groups of labor people could actually communicate with activists stern says he received a draft of a letter from someone at partnoy s institute and signed it it was such a small favor now he regrets his name being tossed around as opposing the rules the institute he says must be either a front for or supporter of hedge funds partnoy says that stern is mistaken and that his donors are a diverse group of individuals and institutions he also reached out to people on both sides of the issue inviting academics and lawyers representing opposing interests to participate in a washington d c conference on the proposed rule changes partnoy says he also invited stern to the event but he declined to participate the berkeley law professor says the views expressed in the letters are based on more than two decades of his published research in various areas of academic scholarship as well as that of other academics his letters disclose that he and bishop receive compensation for drafting the comment letters but the other academics who sign the letters do not but there is at least one hedge fund supporter that ii can report pershing square ceo bill ackman the chairman of the institute s board is stephen fraidin a corporate attorney and partner at cadwalader who has also long worked for pershing square he serves on the hedge fund s advisory board and was the firm s vice chairman between 2015 and 2018 fraidin also knows partnoy from yale university where fraidin is also a part time law professor partnoy it turns out was one of his students fraidin who receives no compensation from the institute declined to comment ackman told ii that he has donated to the institute which is not required by law to disclose its backers but had no role in its creation and although ackman says he has forsworn activism pershing square did submit a comment letter of its own that focused its criticism on the sec s proposed new definition of a group that letter was written by fraidin but signed by pershing square s in house general counsel if partnoy s intent was to find broad support for what he considers the deficiencies in the sec s proposals his critics see something else afr policy analyst park complains that the institute is representing the interests of different groups that don t want to put their face on what s trying to be done here and i think that s what s a bit irritating about this it strikes me as not a genuine concern but rather one that is driven by monetary interests the only other labor supporter that partnoy s institute got onboard was boston university s webber whose comments were quoted in the letter making its way through congress separately the council of institutional investors a group that includes union pension funds made clear in its comment letter that it broadly supports the proposed changes while offering one specific suggestion for clarification on the group issue regarding communications made in connection with a control related transaction or communications made as a participant in such a transaction it might be read too broadly and have an unintended chilling effect of the sort of communications that routinely occur today the council wrote suggesting the sec change the language some of that group s members are also part of the afl cio which sought to clarify the issue in its recent letter saying that the proposed rules will not as some have argued interfere with shareholder advocacy on environmental social and governance issues it also suggested that the sec can better explain what it means by a group to avoid any confusion on the matter while the pension funds have been particularly concerned about communications they make regarding their support of shareholder esg proposals worries about the group definition which admittedly is confusing may be somewhat overblown as long as shareholders are just putting forth proposals casting no votes and not agitating for change in control of management shareholders communicating with each other would not be considered a group under the proposed rule even if they are demanding a change of control their joint ownership stakes are often so small as to not trigger the disclosure in the most prominent case activist investor engine no 1 mounted an aggressive proxy battle campaign against exxon mobil corp and three of the largest u s pension funds the california public employees retirement system the california state teachers retirement system and new york state common retirement fund announced their support for engine no 1 s plans but they were not required to do so the four investors did not together own 5 percent of the shares of exxon mobil the academics letters praise shareholder activism and seem to oppose doing anything that might limit it even though the academic literature is mixed on its benefits in fact bishop himself was a co author of 2019 research paper that concluded that other shareholders may be hurt by hedge fund activism because of what it called leakage of information which is precisely what tougher disclosure rules hope to prevent in the end however bishop and partnoy suggest that the sec either scrap the proposed 13d rule entirely and study the issues more or get congressional approval to make the changes it wants they also attack the swaps rule proposal as lacking legal authority among other problems and finally they say they are worried about a wave of litigation that would end with the rules being struck down indeed hedge funds are already threatening implicitly if not overtly to sue there s no question if the sec takes actions based on shoddy analysis without explaining what market failure they are trying to address they could be vulnerable to litigation in the future says an executive at one of the hedge funds involved in the lobbying effort it would be embarrassing for gensler in particular to have a rule that he pushed through struck down by the court the sec is used to its rules being challenged in court and it has lost a few important cases but supporters of these proposals aren t too worried especially since they believe the most controversial of the proposals the definition of a group will be clarified before the final rule is released yes the rules will get challenged there s no doubt in my mind because the same massive fund approach that s pushing back against this rule is going to challenge this says david katz a partner at wachtell lipton rosen katz which has represented many of the companies targeted by activists and has long lobbied for the changes now being proposed with regard to the litigation he says i don t believe that they re going to be successful
my 2013 honda crv that i bought used in 2016 will be paid off in six months and while i currently have no interest in replacing it i have been looking at newer cars to see what is available truth be told i ll probably drive it another 5 6 years until it starts to irritate me or becomes more expensive to maintain than purchasing a new one right now it is pretty cheap i check the oil and put in gas and every now and again i buy some tires i still have never replaced the brakes but i imagine that will be coming due soon i don t really brake very much and i have been driving these roads for so long i know which curves to bank out of and would guess i probably only hit the brakes 4 5 times on the eight mile drive to and from the big city at any rate i would really like to buy an electric car eventually but i just don t think they are there yet right now i m not sure the environmental cost of an electric vehicle lemme stop right here i am not an expert on this i am just doing my own thinking and if i am wrong chime in in the comments in fact i am really not an expert on anything other than napping and accidental injuries as i was saying from what i understand i m not sure the environmental cost of producing an electric vehicle doesn t really offset the gain to driving one the batteries are a real pain to produce and if you want a battery that will go a distance without recharge you have to upsize your battery so it costs even more to produce and requires more energy to make it s a complex thing from what i understand electric batteries require a lot of lithium cobalt and a whole host of rare earth materials the vast majority of which come from overseas and rare earth materials despite their name are not really that rare they are pretty much everywhere but the extraction process is dirty nasty and produce huge environmental impacts which is why we are totes cool with letting china and india poison their citizens extracting them and not mining them in say wyoming or california although that is changing so there is that there is also the issue that the availability of charging stations that can charge in a speedy manner are not there yet nor are there vehicle replacements for the kinds of cars i would like to drive in a hybrid option there s only one or two models that are hybrid from every major automaker with the exception of tesla but those cars are complete shit with horrid production the interiors are crap there are gaps in every window the consoles squeak and wiggle just utter shit on top of all that the vehicles still require electricity most of which is still generated by fossil fuels for various reasons we have not upgraded to safer nuclear systems and solar and hydro are not going to carry the load so you are still stuck driving a vehicle that is powered by coal or natural gas both of which have their underlying environmental costs on top of all this we are in a really awkward phase right now since we are not allowed to do any massive governmental capital investment because socialism and tax cut jeebus and generally not allowed to do nice things we can t just invest in government run renewables projects and update our power grid we re still in the early phases of most things including solar and nothing is really to scale yet and the people who want to do things can t because we re still in the lawsuit phase to see who gets to rob the american people and who is cheating by buying from china and blah blah blah on top of all this the gas issue is not going away in one regard we re finally starting to get close to the price we should be paying for gas i think 8 9 a gallon would be a target i would like to see in an ideal world and it s a price high enough to maybe start actually changing people s behaviors at the same time that will be devastating to the vast majority of americans regardless it s probably going to happen anyway because we simply do not have the refining capacity that we need to supply all our domestic needs a new refinery has not come online for like fifty years there are none under construction and no one wants to build or run them because everything is changing i read the other day that there is a refinery for sale that would create a couple hundred thousand barrels per day and no one wants to buy it refineries are big expensive difficult to maintain and everything is expensive to maintain and modernize additionally refineries are vulnerable to the whims of the market place as are oil drillers no one ever talks about it but trump absolutely fucked american energy producers in 2018 when he blackmailed the saudis to produce more oil because the price of gas was going high and threatening to fuck with his precious stock market the only thing in the world he cares about other than himself and that in turn put tons of american energy companies out of business because prices plummeted google how many oil production and exploration companies went tits up in 2019 then in 2020 when the price of oil futures was plummeting because the entire world was shut down in a global pandemic mr super fucking genius businessman bullied saudi arabia to cut production or we d stop helping them kill yemeni and might stop being quiet about the murder of kashoggi and so they did and the cuts in production were part of the reason we are in a crisis right now because that two year deal just ended two months ago so any way you slice or dice it we re just kinda fucked until things sort themselves out and it leaves very few good options for people like me who want to do the right thing i suppose all of this was a very long winded way of saying for right now i think a hybrid would be the best option for me but maybe in a few more years when there are more options available for right now i will just drive the vehicle i have because i can t afford a new one anyway and the environmental cost of building my car has already been dealt with i ll just drive left you are welcome to this look insight the twisted mind of john cole where there are no simple answers to anything and where i am probably half wrong about everything

japan has experienced a complete turnaround in terms of inflation in the last year moving from a deflationary environment in 2021 to one of 2 4 year over year inflation in april with more inflation potentially on the horizon it s creating an environment of opportunity for investors looking ahead to the end of 2022 and into 2023 with attractive prices potentially proving highly beneficial for japan s corporate sector wrote jeff weniger cfa and head of equity strategy at wisdomtree along with kevin flanagan head of fixed income strategy at wisdomtree in their most recent minds on the markets paper inflation has seen the japanese yen weaken from 115 per one u s dollar at the beginning of 2022 to its current 136 per dollar with japanese inflation still substantially lower than u s inflation japan could be aligning to be a big competitor not just against american corporations but also chinese ones as well so what s happened is because the yen is weakening against everything suddenly the japanese are really competitive against the chinese explained weniger on a recent call with vettafi it sets up a situation in which japanese corporations have earnings expectations that are lower than s p 500 earnings expectations and yet there s this tailwind behind it that tailwind is the yen s weakness making japanese manufacturers and suppliers much more attractive than their chinese counterparts for international businesses as supplier contracts begin to expire for 2022 japan becomes a much more appealing option for the fiscal year 2023 due to its prices being cheaper than those of its chinese peers china s yuan still remains somewhat pegged to the u s dollar and as the dollar strengthens the yuan is also gaining plenty of purchasing managers are going to check the math from various bidders and find that the japanese supplier they rejected in years past is now offering the best pricing weniger and flanagan wrote the missed opportunity for u s investors allocating globally in 2021 japan traded for 14 1x earnings and is forecast for 12 9x earnings for 2022 multiple points lower than the s p 500 s 2022 p e estimates of 19 5 even if japan does end up underperforming for the year its less ambitious earnings expectations create a room for disappointment gap for investors for reference the 2022 consensus for the msci japan index is 9 8 earnings growth compared to the s p 500 s 10 7 earnings growth forecast japan is the third largest economy globally and yet it remains vastly underrepresented in the msci all country world index acwi making up just 4 compared to the united states 61 what that translates to is that a vast majority of u s investors simply don t own any meaningfully sized allocations to japan despite its potential outlook there are challenges ahead for japan with japanese consumers unhappy as they are accustomed to deflation and strongly dislike the current inflation japan also remains almost entirely reliant on foreign oil grappled with negative gdp growth in the first quarter and could be in the midst of a recession similar to the u s in recession or near recession times having a newly competitive currency may be what saves a country s stock market from missing on earnings japan is in the driver s seat while u s domiciled firms have the proverbial front wheel drive up an incline from the dollar s relentless strength wrote weniger and flanagan the wisdomtree japan hedged equity fund dxj offers investment into the japanese equity market while hedging for currency fluctuations it s a pure play on japanese stocks as it removes the impact that the yen s value has while still offering exposure to japan s equities it is a popular choice when the yen is weak relative to the u s dollar dxj carries an expense ratio of 0 48 and top holdings include toyota motor corp at 5 25 japan tobacco inc at 4 91 and mitsubishi ufj financial group at 4 38 for more news information and strategy visit the modern alpha channel

in relation to adrs are for information purposes only and may not contain all information that may be important to you what is an american depositary receipt adr an adr is a negotiable us dollar denominated certificate representing ownership of share s in a non us company holders of adrs receive dividends in us dollars if applicable and have the right to vote on shareholders resolutions if applicable the term adr and ads are often used interchangeably adrs were specifically designed to facilitate the purchase holding and sale of non us securities by us investors what is the difference between a sponsored and unsponsored dr dr programmes are either sponsored by an issuing company or unsponsored if a company sponsors a dr programme it enters into a contractual agreement with the depositary bank and in the case of an american depositary receipt programme governed by us law also with the holders of the adrs this contractual agreement is known as the deposit agreement see further below a dr programme may also be unsponsored meaning that it is set up without the company s participation or even its consent a depositary will typically establish an unsponsored dr programme only if it believes that there is sufficient interest in the company s shares to generate adequate fee income or if a broker dealer has requested such a programme and agreed to assist with the expense while unsponsored drs are issued without its co operation the foreign issuer must be a reporting company under the us exchange act of 1934 or have obtained an exemption under rule 12g3 2 b from the reporting requirements of that act typically the depositary will request a letter of non objection from the issuer before establishing the programme furthermore the sec staff takes the position that an unsponsored programme may not coexist with a sponsored programme for the same securities because of resulting market disorder what is the difference between a level i level ii and level iii programme level i a level i sponsored adr program is the easiest and least expensive means for a company to provide for issuance of its shares in adr form in the us a level i program involves the

my 2013 honda crv that i bought used in 2016 will be paid off in six months and while i currently have no interest in replacing it i have been looking at newer cars to see what is available truth be told i ll probably drive it another 5 6 years until it starts to irritate me or becomes more expensive to maintain than purchasing a new one right now it is pretty cheap i check the oil and put in gas and every now and again i buy some tires i still have never replaced the brakes but i imagine that will be coming due soon i don t really brake very much and i have been driving these roads for so long i know which curves to bank out of and would guess i probably only hit the brakes 4 5 times on the eight mile drive to and from the big city at any rate i would really like to buy an electric car eventually but i just don t think they are there yet right now i m not sure the environmental cost of an electric vehicle lemme stop right here i am not an expert on this i am just doing my own thinking and if i am wrong chime in in the comments in fact i am really not an expert on anything other than napping and accidental injuries as i was saying from what i understand i m not sure the environmental cost of producing an electric vehicle doesn t really offset the gain to driving one the batteries are a real pain to produce and if you want a battery that will go a distance without recharge you have to upsize your battery so it costs even more to produce and requires more energy to make it s a complex thing from what i understand electric batteries require a lot of lithium cobalt and a whole host of rare earth materials the vast majority of which come from overseas and rare earth materials despite their name are not really that rare they are pretty much everywhere but the extraction process is dirty nasty and produce huge environmental impacts which is why we are totes cool with letting china and india poison their citizens extracting them and not mining them in say wyoming or california although that is changing so there is that there is also the issue that the availability of charging stations that can charge in a speedy manner are not there yet nor are there vehicle replacements for the kinds of cars i would like to drive in a hybrid option there s only one or two models that are hybrid from every major automaker with the exception of tesla but those cars are complete shit with horrid production the interiors are crap there are gaps in every window the consoles squeak and wiggle just utter shit on top of all that the vehicles still require electricity most of which is still generated by fossil fuels for various reasons we have not upgraded to safer nuclear systems and solar and hydro are not going to carry the load so you are still stuck driving a vehicle that is powered by coal or natural gas both of which have their underlying environmental costs on top of all this we are in a really awkward phase right now since we are not allowed to do any massive governmental capital investment because socialism and tax cut jeebus and generally not allowed to do nice things we can t just invest in government run renewables projects and update our power grid we re still in the early phases of most things including solar and nothing is really to scale yet and the people who want to do things can t because we re still in the lawsuit phase to see who gets to rob the american people and who is cheating by buying from china and blah blah blah on top of all this the gas issue is not going away in one regard we re finally starting to get close to the price we should be paying for gas i think 8 9 a gallon would be a target i would like to see in an ideal world and it s a price high enough to maybe start actually changing people s behaviors at the same time that will be devastating to the vast majority of americans regardless it s probably going to happen anyway because we simply do not have the refining capacity that we need to supply all our domestic needs a new refinery has not come online for like fifty years there are none under construction and no one wants to build or run them because everything is changing i read the other day that there is a refinery for sale that would create a couple hundred thousand barrels per day and no one wants to buy it refineries are big expensive difficult to maintain and everything is expensive to maintain and modernize additionally refineries are vulnerable to the whims of the market place as are oil drillers no one ever talks about it but trump absolutely fucked american energy producers in 2018 when he blackmailed the saudis to produce more oil because the price of gas was going high and threatening to fuck with his precious stock market the only thing in the world he cares about other than himself and that in turn put tons of american energy companies out of business because prices plummeted google how many oil production and exploration companies went tits up in 2019 then in 2020 when the price of oil futures was plummeting because the entire world was shut down in a global pandemic mr super fucking genius businessman bullied saudi arabia to cut production or we d stop helping them kill yemeni and might stop being quiet about the murder of kashoggi and so they did and the cuts in production were part of the reason we are in a crisis right now because that two year deal just ended two months ago so any way you slice or dice it we re just kinda fucked until things sort themselves out and it leaves very few good options for people like me who want to do the right thing i suppose all of this was a very long winded way of saying for right now i think a hybrid would be the best option for me but maybe in a few more years when there are more options available for right now i will just drive the vehicle i have because i can t afford a new one anyway and the environmental cost of building my car has already been dealt with i ll just drive left you are welcome to this look insight the twisted mind of john cole where there are no simple answers to anything and where i am probably half wrong about everything hybrid v electric and gas shortagespost comments 199

denominated certificate representing ownership of share s in a non us company holders of adrs receive dividends in us dollars if applicable and have the right to vote on shareholders resolutions if

between a sponsored and unsponsored dr dr programmes are either sponsored by an issuing company or unsponsored if a company sponsors a dr programme it enters into a contractual agreement with the depositary bank and in the case of an american depositary receipt programme governed by us law also with the holders of the adrs this contractual agreement is known as the deposit agreement see further below a dr programme may also be unsponsored meaning that it is set up without the company s participation or even its consent a depositary will typically establish an unsponsored dr programme only if it believes that there is sufficient interest in the company s shares to generate adequate fee income or if a broker dealer has requested such a programme and agreed to assist with the expense while unsponsored drs are issued without its co operation the foreign issuer must be a reporting company under the us exchange act of 1934 or have obtained an exemption under rule 12g3 2 b from the reporting requirements of that act typically the depositary will request a letter of non objection from the issuer before establishing the programme furthermore the sec staff takes the position that

the stock market has not been kind to mortgage lenders some are now trading in the 1 a share range in a one week period between june 10 and june 17 11 publicly traded mortgage companies lost a collective 6 14 billion in market capitalization as investors fled the space their valuations declined 17 4 to 29 billion in aggregate according to a housingwire analysis of stock data and it s unclear when or if they ll recover from the sell off the companies include finance of america companies flagstar bancorp guild holdings company home point capital loandepot mr cooper group new residential investment corp ocwen financial corporation pennymac financial services rocket companies and uwm holdings corporation people are reluctant to invest in the mortgage space at the moment because it s unclear how long the downturn is going to last bose george mortgage finance analyst at keefe bruyette woods kbw said you don t know how much money these companies will lose and what their book values will look like once this is done the bear stock market began on friday june 10 when the u s consumer price index showed an 8 6 increase year over year in may 30 basis points above the consensus estimates and the highest mark in four decades consequently the federal reserve raised the federal funds rate by 75 basis points on wednesday a hike not seen since 1994 chairman jerome powell also signaled the possibility of raising an additional 75 bps at the fed s next meeting in july investors last week scrambled to sell riskier assets amid growing fears that the fed will send the u s economy into a recession this year in a note published monday a team of goldman sachs economists increased their outlook for a u s recession citing concerns that the fed will act aggressively to control inflation even if economic activity weakens the goldman sachs economists now see a 30 probability of entering a recession over the next year versus 15 previously and a 25 probability of entering a recession in the second year if it is avoided in 2022 all the turbulence in the markets pushed purchase mortgage rates up 55 bps over the last week the largest one week increase since 1987 to 5 78 according to the freddie mac pmms other indexes showed rates north of 6 last week well qualified buyers in the non qualified mortgage space were locking rates in double digits several los told housingwire in terms of the mortgage originators refis are already largely gone so the question is whether this rate move is enough to slow purchase more meaningfully it s a little early to tell george said we are pretty negative on the industry and we have not recommended taking any of these names who was hit harder investors are fleeing from mortgage companies that are struggling to generate cash meaning those not delivering profits they are also punishing the classes of 2020 and 2021 a group of lenders that went public at high valuations often on the strength of lower mortgage rates and refi euphoria nonbank heavyweight loandepot suffered the biggest decline in valuation during the one week period the company lost 37 7 in market capitalization to 538 million on friday housingwire s analysis found the stock debuted in 2021 at 14 a share and closed on friday at just 1 52 a share the orange county based lender founded by anthony hsieh reported a net loss of 91 3 million in the first quarter due to a steep decline in origination volume and expense reductions that did not keep up with the rapidly changing environment company executives said they don t expect to have a profitable fiscal year citing pressures on margins and lower market volume among the six mortgage companies that went public during the good times besides loandepot rocket 19 4 uwm 16 4 home point capital 8 7 and guild 5 35 also experienced sizable losses in their valuations over the last week notably foa with a decline of 9 55 closed at 1 80 a share on friday joining loandepot in the 1

in the markets caused the wedbush securities s team of analysts to cut estimates for several mortgage companies mortgage rates have spiked to near 6 levels after hovering 3 for the last couple of years at an unprecedented pace rapidly evaporating the rate term refinance market jay mccanless brian violino and henry coffey said in the report while purchase volumes remain fairly strong from a historical perspective purchase rate locks are starting to see some pressure and total volume projections from the big three fannie freddie and the mba for 2022 and 2023 have continuously moved lower throughout the year wedbush reduced flagstar s price target from 50 to 48 maintaining its neutral rating for uwm which also has a neutral recommendation the analysts reduced the price target from 5 to

months wedbush has an outperform rating for guild price target 12 home point 5 50 and mr cooper group 60 the analysts also have a neutral target for rocket with the price target at 7 the worst since 2008 a number of industry observers said the mortgage market is facing its worst downturn since the financial crisis in 2008 on june 10 the day the inflation data came out the mortgage backed securities mbs market went no bid according to longtime mortgage broker louis barnes investors asked for higher premiums to invest in these assets amid a flight to quality caused by the expectation of higher u s treasury rates it s a tough time in the market right now because you don t know what rates to offer borrowers kevin heal senior analyst and fixed income strategist at argus research said he added from the mortgage side there are still securitizations happening the worry is if you re issuing a security at 5 5 but it could be the next day you walk in and then you re underwater heal expects that the gain on sale margin will decrease dramatically for mortgage originators over the coming quarters just because of the volatility and the fact that lenders will have to sell loans in the secondary market with lower gains he estimates margins in the retail channel could go down to 2 on average compared to 3 in the previous quarters however there is no reason for panic analysts agree originators are in a better position than in the past because they cashed in during the refi boom of 2020 and 2021 only three in the group of 11 companies had a reduction in the cash position in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the q4 2021 among them home point mr cooper and flagstar some socked away tremendous gains from the boom rocket has more than 2 3 billion in cash and new residential has more than 1 6 billion finance of america had a 60 6 increase in the cash position quarter over quarter and pennymac s cash position rose 44 during the same period many of those companies also bought back stock that investors were shedding lenders have already started to reduce costs protecting what s left of their diminishing margins the wedbush analysts said in their report that although most mortgage companies have begun to trim back their workforces to account for an excess capacity issue it will likely take a quarter or two before excess capacity is flushed out of the system in addition with originations going down some lenders can also boost their earnings by taking advantage of the strong demand for their servicing portfolios mortgage servicing rights msrs values tend to increase as mortgage rates rise and borrowers are less likely to refinance or prepay their loans there s a long term trend reflected on many days including friday in the mortgage industry towards higher rates less refinance and seemingly downward pressure on the purchase money market said henry coffey a mortgage and housing analyst at wedbush in this context we expect the servicing portfolio to be bringing more profits to mortgage companies in the coming quarters

drones at what appears to be a logistical base in central iran which might have been involved in the irgc s logistical air bridge to lebanese hezbollah abdoos used to work at the aerospace organization of iran s ministry of defense which works on the design and development of ballistic and cruise missiles there are a large number of missile development and test centers in semnan where he reportedly died in the line of duty nadimi said the two incidents followed another mysterious death of an aerospace engineer ayoob entezari died after allegedly being poisoned his relatives said claiming that he had received death threats before he passed away iranian judicial authorities however said he had not been a scientist but an ordinary employee of an industrial company and had passed away in a hospital after being sick the deaths of the aerospace related officers happened a few weeks after two other mysterious deaths colonel ali esmailzadeh a commander of the notorious quds force irgc s external operations unit died on may 30 after falling from the roof of his home in karaj west of tehran the islamic republic news agency reported esmailzadeh was a colleague of colonel hassan sayyad khodaei who was shot dead in his car outside his home in tehran in broad daylight on may 22 general hossein salami irgc s commander in chief appeared to say that the u s and israel are responsible for sayyed khodaei s killing adding that tehran would get revenge the enemy from the heart of the white house and tel aviv followed him for months and years door to door and alley to alley to kill him god willing we will take revenge he said if those deaths are indeed linked and of unnatural causes israel s mossad could be one of the main suspects nadimi said nadimi added that we cannot say anything with total certainty about who was involved as the nature of such works is the israeli foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment from abc news iran embarked on expanded drone operations against israel beginning in february 2018 when the islamic republic launched a drone from syria it tried again in 2021 launching two drones from iraq earlier in the year according to the jerusalem post israel s defense minister benny gantz has discussed drone threats from iran many times over the last year that report detailed how iran has been training drone operators from the region israeli prime minister naftali bennett on sunday warned iranian proxies that they would pay if they participate in iran s plots we are currently witnessing iranian attempts to attack israelis in various overseas locations bennet said at his weekly cabinet meeting the security services are working to thwart attempted attacks before they are launched we will continue to strike those who send the terrorists our new rule is whoever sends pays the deaths came amid attempts by international officials to save the 2015 nuclear deal the joint comprehensive plan of action between iran and world powers with the negotiations stalled iran s nuclear capabilities including its uranium enrichment level signal the country is the closest its ever been to making a nuclear weapon experts warn iran s stockpile of uranium is now enriched to 60 close to the roughly 90 weapons and in a form that can be enriched further the international atomic energy agency told abc news in late may it grew from 9 9 kg to 43 1 kg this number is approximate amount for manufacturing a nuclear explosive device this possibility cannot be excluded israel opposes the jcpoa and the negotiations to restore it saying it is giving in to iran s nuclear blackmail iran won t just keep its nuclear program from today they ll be getting paid for it bennett said in an official message in november amid talks to resume the deal the islamic republic which is under tough economic sanctions said it is still interested in pursuing talks iran won t distance itself from result oriented talks iran foreign minister hossein amirabdollahian said on twitter on friday calling on the u s to be realistic and to abandon sanctions lunacy amirabdollahian invited the iaea to focus on technical duties instead of adopting a politicized approach tehran accused the iaea of politicizing its nuclear case and referencing fake documents in the verification process of its nuclear program including what israel provides to the agency israel has openly boasted about its intelligence operation s influence on iran s nuclear program bennet on may 31 uploaded an extensive stock of secret documents of iran s nuclear program and shared the link with public access via his twitter account saying we got our hands on iran s deception plan u s department of state spokesperson ned price declined to comment june 16 about the possibility of the iranian deaths being linked he highlighted the white house s commitment to its allies saying iran will never be able to acquire a nuclear weapon tel aviv has announced that it has embarked on a new policy described as a turning point in the israeli strategy vis à vis iran which it s dubbed the octopus doctrine in the past year the state of israel has taken action against the head of the terrorist octopus and not just against the arms as was done in previous decades bennett said earlier this month the days of immunity in which iran attacks israel and spreads terrorism via its regional proxies but remains unscathed are over iranian president ibrahim raisi made it clear that iran is determined to take revenge for the recent deaths i have no doubt that revenge against the criminals for the blood of this martyr is assured raisi said a day after the death of colonel sayyad khodaei the iranian regime and especially the irgc are certainly conducting a major counterintelligence house sweep right now to identify and get rid of any foreign spy nadimi said emphasizing that those deaths will not have any effect on iran s nuclear or regional policies israel s foreign minister yair lapid on monday urged citizens in turkey to leave as soon as possible over threats that iranian operatives are actively planning attacks on israelis in istanbul following the events of recent weeks in turkey and after a series of attempts at iranian terrorist attacks against israelis who went on vacation in istanbul we call on israelis not to fly to istanbul and if you have no vital need do not fly to turkey lapid said on twitter copyright 2022 abc audio all rights reserved
indianapolis it may take until next week to get your baby or toddler vaccinated in indiana before long you should be able to get your toddler vaccinated without an appointment but the indiana department of health says vaccine supplies are limited at some locations some hospitals and pharmacies are requiring appointments until more vaccine is available the health department recommends calling ahead to see if you need an appointment the department expects it ll get simpler over the next several days as more doses arrive the centers for disease control gave final approval on saturday to vaccinate children as young as six months the vaccine had previously been available only for kids age five and up just one in five hoosiers age five to 12 has gotten the vaccine and community health network chief medical officer ram yeleti says while some parents have already called to ask when they can bring in their kids the rate among younger kids will probably be lower yeleti recommends parents get their kids vaccinated while the youngest hoosiers have been less vulnerable to the virus there have been nearly 48 thousand cases in indiana in kids under five with more than 700 hospitalizations and 17 deaths yeleti says there are no safety risks from the vaccine so even with cases being rare the benefit far outweighs the risk as with adults he says the vaccine won t necessarily keep kids from getting the virus but it will protect them against serious illness the cdc has approved both pfizer and moderna s pediatric version of the vaccine while the moderna vaccine uses the same two shot schedule as the adult version the pfizer vaccine requires three shots with the second after three weeks and the third shot two months after that yeleti says the two vaccines are equally effective choosing between them is just a question of where they re in stock and whether you want to get done faster

photo credit jelena zelen shutterstock the covid 19 pandemic brought into focus an indisputable fact about the u s today access to quality internet service is key to full participation in society and the economy as workplaces and schools moved online and households increasingly relied on internet enabled services like ecommerce and streaming platforms those with good internet service were better able to manage the transition than those without but inequitable access to high speed internet has been an issue for much longer than the last two years policymakers and business leaders especially those from low income and rural communities have long advocated for increased investment in broadband infrastructure to unlock greater economic opportunities in underprivileged areas these efforts along with the access issues raised during the pandemic have inspired major action over the last two years federal covid relief legislation like the cares act and american rescue plan included funds to support broadband expansion and a 65 billion investment in broadband was one of the major components of the bipartisan infrastructure package signed into law last november the importance of connecting more americans has grown as the internet has become a more ubiquitous part of society and the economy over time beginning in the 1990s the internet moved from primarily government and academic uses to application for communications business and other wide ranging uses by 2000 just over half of u s adults reported using the internet in some capacity and innovations like ecommerce and smartphones encouraged even greater adoption in the two decades since today 93 of american adults report using the internet according to a recent survey by pew research center while internet use is certainly common some populations and parts of the country may face greater barriers to reliable internet access experts refer to a digital divide between those who have reliable access to internet technologies and those who do not low income rural and minority households all tend to have less access to quality internet service and related technologies in some cases these households cannot afford the cost of service but in others internet providers may not service their communities at all for financial or logistical reasons the southeast is the region of the u s that lags furthest behind the rest of the country when it comes to broadband internet access along with access to computers in the home in mississippi for example just over half 50 1 of all households have access to broadband internet and only around 64 2 have a desktop or laptop computer in contrast many states in the northeast and west have much better access to technology new hampshire leads all states in the share of households with broadband internet access at 79 9 and utah leads in the share of households with a computer at 87 5 further there are some signs that states with fewer households able to access the internet also have worse internet quality overall states with a higher percentage of households that have broadband also tend to have higher average download speeds there is a similar but weaker correlation between the percentage of households with a computer and average download speeds many of the states that lead in download speeds are densely populated and have strong economies which helps service providers justify the cost of building infrastructure states in the mid atlantic and new england regions are among those with the fastest internet but residents of other well populated and prospering states like california texas and florida also enjoy excellent internet speeds the internet speed data used in this analysis is from highspeedinternet com s fastest and slowest states for internet speeds report statistics on internet and computer access are from the u s census bureau and pew research center for the purpose of this analysis statistics on broadband access include high speed internet subscriptions such as cable or dsl and do not include cellular data plans to determine the states with the fastest internet researchers at hotdog com ranked states based on

pawel gaul e via getty images investment opportunities considering monetary policy monetary policy is the basis for our investment decisions through it we can outline the prospects of an asset class and thus understand where to invest for higher returns during expansionary monetary policy phases interest rates are very low which encourages borrowing and growth rates risk free rates are low and as a result the stock market is the asset class that benefits most from this situation at the same time however the opposite is also true during tight monetary policy phases risk free rates rise and it is the stock market that suffers the most because of the pandemic in 2020 most of the world s major economies carried out expansive monetary policies as never before to support the economic shock brought about by covid 19 and ensure that the economy had enough money to restart 2 years later these ultra expansive policies have caused the economy to recover quickly but have entailed a much greater risk namely high inflation the reasons for such high global inflation cannot be attributed only to the huge injection of liquidity into the system but also to exogenous factors such as supply chain issues and the war in ukraine high inflation is a serious problem for a country s economic stability and central banks around the world will do their utmost to bring it back within the target range between 0 and 2 however it should be specified that not all major economies in the world are suffering from high inflation and this will be the focus of this article china japan and switzerland currently do not have serious inflation problems so interest rates are not expected to be raised as quickly as in the u s any economic crisis in the u s would still affect countries around the world because of globalization but i believe there are some countries that are better prepared than others to deal with a global crisis in particular switzerland in this article a u s swiss comparison will be highlighted and i will explain why i believe switzerland will perform better within the current macroeconomic scenario u s swiss comparison the comparison between these two economies will be made by looking at the growth of the m1 monetary aggregate their monetary fiscal policy their inflation rate and their respective yield curves before proceeding with the comparison it is important to note that the comparison should always be put into context based on the importance of the two countries the gdp of the u s is 28 times larger than that of switzerland united states m1 the monetary policy measures taken by the u s after the 2008 financial crisis were unprecedented in history and helped the country avoid a disaster like in 29 however just when the financial crisis was long gone a black swan called covid 19 arrived the temporary freeze in the world economy led the fed to print an unprecedentedly large amount in such a short time and to date there are many economists who believe the situation has reached a point of no return beyond any personal considerations there is no question that the growth of the m1 monetary aggregate has been off the charts u s m1 federal reserve bank of st louis personally unlike some investors such as michael burry i do not believe that this will lead to hyperinflation but at worst to high interest rates like the 1980s with a subsequent recession from january 2020 to december 2021 the m1 aggregate increased by 411 certainly not a reassuring increase if inflation is to be kept low switzerland s m1 switzerland as well as the u s has also employed an expansionary monetary policy since the 2008 crisis sometimes reaching negative interest rates at the time of the pandemic outbreak a further increase in m1 was inevitable but by no means comparable to that of the u s switzerland m1 federal reserve bank of st louis from 2019 to 2021 the m1 aggregate grew by 14 certainly a more reasonable increase how was it possible to achieve such a low increase compared to the u s if the pandemic also hit switzerland hard there are two main reasons switzerland s fiscal policy was reasonable and very well thought out unlike the us the swiss government has helped the hardest hit sectors of the pandemic such as tourism more but without going overboard in fact switzerland s debt to gdp ratio increased slightly by 2 3 from 2019 to 2021 and as of today stands at 41 4 in the u s on the other hand government aid not only was significantly larger relative to gdp but it affected virtually every sector of the economy every small business could benefit even those who did not need the money while the fiscal stimulus helped many struggling businesses there were many others who took advantage of it the u s debt to gdp ratio rose from 106 94 in q4 2019 to 123 39 in q4 2021 since this ratio is 3 times higher than switzerland s the us will suffer more than switzerland if the cost of debt increases the second reason mainly relates to the smaller contraction that the swiss economy experienced during the pandemic based mainly on the service sector and with already developed teleworking switzerland was able to cope with the pandemic without necessarily reducing its economic activity too much therefore it was not necessary to take on a lot of debt to support the whole economy as a result of these considerations i think switzerland has handled the pandemic much better and as of today is in a better position than the us the u s fiscal policy has been sloppy and it is paying the price for this negligence in contrast switzerland has shown better management of its resources and benefits from a significantly lower debt to gdp ratio inflation and interest rates in the u s inflation is currently the main problem in most developed economies not only in the us the reasons for such high inflation cannot be attributed to a single event but to a multiplicity of events for each country the reasons behind high inflation are the same what changes is the intensity of the events that triggered inflation greater than 2 the first reason relates to the supply chain slowdown as a result of forced shutdowns to slow the spread of the virus covid 19 slowed if not completely halted international trade and this led to significant price increases for products whose supply was particularly limited while this problem has affected all major countries it has not had the same intensity in each the u s is the country most exposed to supply chain related problems because of its heavy reliance on the import of chinese products the second reason was the prolonged injection of liquidity into the system even when inflation was continuing to rise in my opinion monetary stimulus should have been less and interest rates should have been raised earlier the third reason can be attributed to the outbreak of the war between russia and ukraine this event only exacerbated the inflationary pressures already in place due to the sharp rise in commodities especially oil and wheat sanctions against russia have had a boomerang effect affecting the u s and especially europe inflation in the u s is at 40 year highs and oil prices remain very high comparison between oil prices and inflation trading view it can be seen from this graph that high levels of inflation have frequently been driven by high oil prices consequently often leading to an economic slowdown if not a recession as of today with the s p500 down more than 20 and q1 gdp negative we may have already entered a recession despite a still low unemployment rate of 3 6 currently the u s economy is going through a very complex period and could last for months if not years yet with the current inflation rate at 8 6 and a gdp that is struggling to grow it would seem that we have entered a period of stagflation finally i would like to express my opinion about what i consider the most important asset of central banks credibility the fed showed from the beginning that it underestimated the problem of inflation by calling it temporary and continuing qe uninterruptedly to date we are faced with structural inflation at 40 year highs and rising month after month i do not think the fed has handled the whole situation as well as it could the credibility of the fed has been questioned many times since their forecasting ability has not been the best with the latest 75 basis point hike the fomc has signaled its willingness to tighten monetary policy quickly but will it be enough to calm inflation the fomc s forecast of the fed funds rate in 2022 is 3 4 still too low in my opinion against 8 6 inflation that has not peaked yet fed funds rate federal reserve bank of st louis considering the historical values of the fed funds rate 3 4 is not that high at the same time however if inflation continues to rise a paul volcker style increase in interest rates would almost certainly lead to a recession due to the rising cost of borrowing the fed has reached a point of no return and as of today faces a fork in the road either let inflation run its course with the risk of excessively devaluing the dollar or cause a recession by raising interest rates to stop inflation the latter scenario by the way must also be questioned will restrictive monetary policy really be effective in calming an inflation that mainly comes from supply and not demand how will higher rates reduce oil prices and supply chain problems raising interest rates among other things does not have an immediate effect on the economy so inflation may continue to rise inflation and interest rates in switzerland the first major difference with the u s is an inflation rate that is still under control in fact it is currently 2 9 the snb s target is the same as the ecb and the fed s between 0 and 2 so it is slightly higher the reasons why inflation is currently above its target are the same as in the u s but it is currently a more manageable situation how has this been possible first of all supply chain problems have had a minor influence in switzerland countries with a positive trade balance are those that have suffered the least from supply chain problems and switzerland is one of them the u s on the other hand historically has a negative trade balance so it needs many imports to sustain its country s economic activity dependence on china is very high as explained earlier switzerland s fiscal policy has been far more specific and reasonable than that in the us with inflation not too high today switzerland will be able to make a gradual increase in interest rates unlike the u s which will have a greater urgency to raise them as soon as possible switzerland is a country that has been committed to reducing its dependence on fossil fuels in recent decades therefore the increase in energy commodities has not affected the country as much as europe and the us the country is poor in fossil fuels but rich in water 57 of its domestic electricity production comes from hydropower again the best economies in the world should learn from the forward looking policies adopted by switzerland overall the snc has a wider range of maneuvering than the fed and can afford to keep interest rates still negative on june 16 the snb decided to raise its target interest rate by 50 basis points to 0 25 if the snb can afford to still have negative rates it is also because of the nature of its currency the swiss franc is considered one of the safest currencies in the world and a safe haven asset when there is turbulence in the financial markets since we are in a time of uncertainty where the swiss franc is appreciating against major world currencies the snc is in no hurry to raise interest rates in order to increase demand for swiss francs with a strong currency and low interest rates swiss companies can still finance themselves and innovate at affordable interest rates thus gaining a considerable advantage thus from this u s swiss comparison we can see that the approach used for tight monetary policy is very different between the two countries and this is mainly due to the different levels of inflation yield curve comparison the study of the yield curve is critical to understanding the medium to long term outlook for an economy typically a flat or even inverted yield curve has implied a recession or economic slowdown it is logical to expect higher interest rates for longer term maturities and when the reverse happens it can be a red flag u s yield curve investing com this is the u s yield curve and it is easily observed that yields are flat what is more over the past year short term rates have risen much faster than long term rates if this trend were to continue the yield curve would be inverted in a matter of a few months switzerland yield curve investing com switzerland s yield curve has no anomaly higher maturities are associated with higher yields comparison of the 3 main etfs spy ewl qqq up to now we have talked about the economic and financial differences between switzerland and the us but how they have performed in the financial markets since 2000 to make a comparison i will use for switzerland the ishares msci switzerland capped etf ewl while for the u s the etfs spy spy and qqq qqq the spy is the main etf replicating the s p500 sp500 while the qqq is the main etf replicating the nasdaq comparison between ewl and spy trading view as can be seen through this first chart the ewl vastly outperformed the spy from 2000 to 2013 what has been regarded as the lost decade for the u s stock market has instead been quite positive for the swiss the reason for such a wide gap lies in the resilience of the swiss stock market crashes are like the u s stock market but the speed with which losses are recovered is greater the years from 2000 to 2013 were full of uncertainty and in that case it would have been better to invest in the swiss stock market i personally find that there are currently several similarities to the lost decade and what happened 20 years ago could be repeated the exorbitant prices that some u s companies traded at unreasonable multiples reminds me a lot of what happened with the dot com bubble in terms of overvaluation despite these excellent results from switzerland looking at an even longer time horizon however the situation changes completely comparison between ewl and spy trading view over a period of 23 years the performance of spy was better than ewl but what was the reason for this difference the main reason is because of the tremendous growth of the u s tech sector which trailed the s p500 index to a sensational performance from 2009 to 2021 the growth was so rapid however that it led the index to be highly overvalued and to date it is paying the consequences ewl is also having significant losses but i don t think it is as overvalued as the s p500 so i expect the returns of the two etfs to match in the not too distant future comparison between ewl and qqq trading view looking at this other chart it is even more evident how the tech sector has had abnormal and certainly unsustainable returns in recent years the spread between the nasdaq and ewl has never been this wide except during the dot com bubble crisis i do not expect this spread to turn negative as it did during the early 2000 crisis but i do expect it to narrow thus resulting in a better performance of the ewl than the nasdaq there is still a lot of downside room for the nasdaq but not so much for the ewl from a very long term perspective the u s stock market may perform better but in times of crisis and bursting of financial bubbles ewl has proven to be a better investment in conclusion i would like to make one last point the purpose of this article is not to put the entire u s economy in a bad light in favor of the swiss economy but to consider new countries in which to invest in order to diversify the portfolio even more in times of market uncertainty i believe that having a diversified portfolio is crucial and i have explained why i think switzerland may be a good choice although i still consider the s p500 to be overvalued despite the recent crash that does not mean that there cannot be individual undervalued u s companies that you can currently buy at a discount

based on the positive phase 2 data the company will request a meeting with the u s food and drug administration fda to discuss the data and the regulatory path forward the phase 2 trial was designed for signal detection by assessing the safety tolerability and efficacy of zygel also known as zyn002 for the treatment of behavioral symptoms of chromosome 22q11 2 deletion syndrome 22q in children and adolescents zygel was administered to patients with 22q as add on therapy to their standard of care and utilized a variety of efficacy assessments key findings from the trial disclosed today include the total score and all five subscales of the anxiety depression and mood scale adams showed statistically significant improvements at 14 weeks of treatment compared to baseline all five subscales of the aberrant behavior checklist community abc c showed statistically significant improvements at 14 weeks of treatment compared to baseline the pediatric anxiety rating scale pars r

clinical global impression improvement cgi i seventy five percent of patients were rated by the clinicians as improved much improved or very much improved with nearly two thirds 62 5 of the patients being much improved or very much improved zygel was shown to be well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with previously released data from other zygel clinical trials i am encouraged with the results from the inspire trial particularly with the potential for real reductions in general anxiety social withdrawal and social avoidance in children and adolescents with chromosome 22q11 2 deletion syndrome said tony j simon ph d professor emeritus at the university of california davis school of medicine and the uc davis mind institute i m especially encouraged that zyn002 is a unique

management uses these non gaap financial measures when assessing our ongoing performance this press release contains references to non gaap operating income non gaap operating margin and non gaap net income attributable to la z boy incorporated per diluted share and components thereof including non gaap income before income taxes non gaap net income attributable to la z boy incorporated which may exclude as applicable business realignment charges purchase accounting charges benefits from the cares act charges for our supply chain optimization initiative and sale leaseback gains the business

references the non gaap financial measure of non gaap earnings per share for a future period non gaap earnings per share may exclude items such as pre tax purchase accounting charges these and other not presently determinable items could have a material impact on the determination of earnings per share on a gaap basis and due to the probable variability and limited visibility of excluded items therefore we have not provided a reconciliation of non gaap earnings per share for future periods in this press release these non gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for la z boy incorporated s results of operations prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies reconciliations of such non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are set forth in the accompanying tables management believes that presenting certain non gaap financial measures will help investors understand the long term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers management excludes purchase accounting charges because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing size number and nature of the acquisitions consummated and the success with which we operate the businesses acquired while the company has a history of acquisition activity it does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle and the impact of purchase accounting charges is unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition similarly business realignment charges and the charges related to the company s supply chain optimization initiative are dependent on the timing size number and nature of the operations being moved or closed and the charges may not be incurred on a predictable cycle management also excludes benefits from the cares act and sale leasebacks when assessing the company s operating and financial performance due to the one time or infrequent nature of these transactions management believes that exclusion of these items facilitates more consistent comparisons of the company s operating results over time where applicable the accompanying reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financial measures tables present the excluded items net of tax calculated using the effective tax rate from operations for the period in which the adjustment is presented except for the non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge and the

as of the date on which the statements are made vection technologies has no obligation to release publicly any revisions or updates to these forward looking statements to reflect events circumstances or unanticipated events occurring after the date of this release except as required by law or by any appropriate regulatory authority adr frequently asked questions faqs the following faqs and answers in relation to adrs are for information purposes only and may not contain all information that may be important to you what is an american depositary receipt adr an adr is a negotiable us dollar denominated certificate representing ownership of share s in a non us company holders of adrs receive dividends in us dollars if applicable and have the right to vote on shareholders resolutions if applicable the term adr and ads are often used interchangeably adrs were specifically designed to facilitate the purchase holding and sale of non us securities by us investors what is the difference between a sponsored and unsponsored dr dr programmes are either sponsored by an issuing company or unsponsored if a company sponsors a dr programme it enters into a contractual agreement with the depositary bank and in the case of an american depositary receipt programme governed by us law also with the holders of the adrs this contractual agreement is known as the deposit agreement see further below a dr programme may also be unsponsored meaning that it is set up without the company s participation or even its consent a depositary will typically establish an unsponsored dr programme only if it believes that there is sufficient interest in the company s shares to generate adequate fee income or if a broker dealer has requested such a programme and agreed to assist with the expense while unsponsored drs are issued without its co operation the foreign issuer must be a reporting company under the us exchange act of 1934 or have obtained an exemption under rule 12g3 2 b from the reporting requirements of that act typically the depositary will request a letter of non objection from the issuer before establishing the programme furthermore the sec staff takes the position that an unsponsored programme may not coexist with a sponsored programme for the same securities because of resulting market disorder what is the difference between a level i level ii and level iii programme level i a level i sponsored adr program is the easiest and least expensive means for a company to provide for issuance of its shares in adr form in the us a level i program involves the filing of an f 6 registration statement but allows for exemption under rule12g 3 2 b from full sec reporting requirements the issuer has a certain amount of control over the adrs issued under a sponsored level i program since a depositary agreement is executed between the issuer and one selected depositary bank level i adrs can however only be traded over the counter and cannot be listed on a national exchange in the us level ii a sponsored level ii adr must comply with the sec s full registration and reporting requirements in addition to filing an f 6 registration statement the issuer is also required to file sec form 20 f see chapter 6 for details and to comply with the sec s other disclosure rules including submission of its annual report which must be prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap registration allows the issuer to list its adrs on one of the three major national stock exchanges namely the new york stock exchange nyse the american stock exchange amex or the national association of securities dealers automated quotation nasdaq stock market each of which has reporting and disclosure requirements level ii sponsored programs are initiated by non us companies to give us investors access to their stock in the us as with a level i program a depositary agreement is signed between the issuer and a depositary bank level iii level iii sponsored adrs are similar to level ii adrs in that the issuer initiates the program deals with one depositary bank lists on one of the major us exchanges and files form f 6 and 20 f registration statements with the sec the major difference is that a level iii program allows the issuer to raise capital through a public offering of adrs in the us and this requires the issuer to submit a form f 1 to the sec who or what is the custodian the custodian is the foreign correspondent bank of the depositary with whom the company s underlying shares have been deposited the custodian is usually situated in the same country as the company but this is not always the case on receipt of the company s underlying shares from an investor seeking to create drs the custodian will confirm such fact to the depositary and therefore allowing it to issue the equivalent number of drs to the investor delivering the shares what are the benefits of adrs to us investors us investors may prefer to purchase adrs rather than ordinary shares in the company s home market because adrs trade clear and settle according to us market conventions adrs allow us investors to diversify into non us securities relatively easily why is vection technologies seeking to establish an adr program vection technologies is seeking to establish the adr program to make it easier for us investors to invest in the company adrs are easier for us investors for reasons including reduced administrative costs and u s dollar denominated capital gains realisation what effect do you expect the adr program to have on your shareholder base the company expects that the adr program will generate stronger interest from u s investors what types of companies issue adrs adr issuers are typically large corporations with primary listings outside of the us any non us company seeking to raise capital in the us or increase their base of us investor can also issue adrs who is vection technologies depositary for adrs deutsche bank trust company americas is the depositary bank for vection technologies adr program the depositary bank plays a key role in issuance as well as cancellation of adrs it also maintains the adr holder register distributes the dividends in us dollars if applicable and facilitates the exercise by the adrs holders of their voting rights if applicable what is the difference between a registered adr holder and a beneficial adr holder a registered holder is the party whose name appears on the books of the depositary bank the registered holder is considered the owner of record a beneficial holder is the ultimate owner of the security whose holdings are registered in a name other than their own such as in the name of a broker bank or nominee view original content source

automated valuations tested on 50 zip codes in chicago yielded no signs of racial bias even on undervalued properties where disparities most frequently surface according to a new veros real estate solutions study which presents a contrast to other recent findings related to appraisal models we looked at whether the size of the errors is dependent on the racial composition of an area and we found that it is not research economist reena agrawal said in an interview about the report she co authored with the company s chief economist eric fox estimates for median absolute errors when comparing veros avm to purchase prices for properties in areas where the population was primarily comprised of black hispanic and asian households were statistically insignificant at one basis point or less the study also considered housing stock characteristics such as median age number of rooms and the share of homes sold in a region the research contrasts a study by the urban institute that found a greater avm error as a percentage of the property s sale price in neighborhoods where black residents make up the majority than in neighborhoods where white residents do the error rate in the urban institute study was as much as 5 percentage points higher for areas where the population consisted primarily of black households even after controlling for poorer property conditions something historically absent from many avm inputs according to the institute the conflicting reports highlight a challenge mortgage companies could face given proposed rules from the consumer financial protection bureau which would require them to ensure avm compliance with nondiscrimination laws whether the technology is more of a help or a hindrance to equitable lending efforts remains an unresolved question veros which played a key role in the development of an appraisal database used by large government sponsored mortgage buyers fannie mae and freddie mac sees its most recent study as compelling evidence that avm technology could encourage greater fairness if you see that appraisals are coming in much higher or lower than expected you can check it and see if something significant in terms of an overvaluation or undervaluation that is going on said agrawal however the urban institute authors while acknowledging other research indicating avms tend to produce smaller biases than appraisals come away from their study more cautious about endorsing automated valuation models use for this purpose avms may not be a surefire solution to fully closing racial inequities in the home appraisal process michael neal linna zhu judah axelrod and caitlin young wrote in the report neal and zhu are research associates axelrod is a data scientist and young is a policy analyst the institute s analysis of data from cape analytics the american community survey and unnamed major property records provider examines atlanta and memphis suggesting the avm and areas involved are among factors that could account for differences in the two studies i certainly can t comment on their study but i think the reason we could see different results is because we are using different models to determine our outcomes said agrawal veros also acknowledged mixed outcomes in the collective research done to date on appraisal bias and avms it gives a nod to geographic limits of its most recent study noting that it chose chicago for its broad ethnic diversity we plan to look at other metros in the near future to verify that our study does hold agrawal said for its part the urban institute plans to look further into what accounts for the fact that the machine learning driven models it examined are improving in accuracy but still produce disparities continued exploration of new techniques in data and modeling will be necessary to further identify the underlying causes the authors of the institute s study said

on june 16 2022 new york governor hochul signed new york city housing authority nycha public housing preservation trust act a7805d s9409a into law trust act the trust act creates the new york city housing authority public housing preservation trust trust a new public benefit corporation with the power to issue bonds and borrow money to fund the rehabilitation of up to 25 000 nycha apartments through the transfer of a leasehold interest in nycha housing facilities and related property from nycha to the trust nycha and the trust are to review the cap on the number of units annually and make recommendations to the legislature if they believe it should be increased the trust joins other tools in new york city s toolkit including increased capital funding and the permanent affordability commitment together pact program to help address decades of historically underfunded capital improvements in nycha housing which nycha estimates will require approximately 40 billion in major repairs to address while city capital funds now represent approximately one third of all planned city commitments for housing through 2025 alone it is not nearly enough to address the decades of disinvestment in nycha housing stock since 2019 that city capital funding has been supplemented by pact the goal of pact is to convert at least 62 000 public housing units to section 8 assisted housing by the end of 2028 to address approximately 12 8 billion of nycha s approximate 40 billion capital needs under pact nycha enters into long term leases with public private partnerships ppps often non profits and experienced for profit developers who are responsible for rehabilitating and managing the housing to date nycha has converted nearly 15 000 units across 55 developments under pact the trust and pact share certain important similarities both involve converting public housing properties from the traditional federal section 9 public housing capital and operating subsidy program to the section 8 housing choice voucher program providing greater federal subsidies for qualified housing to low income families this is accomplished by the federal government through the department of housing and urban development hud entering into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies phas such as nycha to provide subsidy payments housing assistance payments which can be applied by the pha to make payment under project based voucher housing assistance payment contracts pbv hap contracts between the pha and housing facility owners with respect to specified units in such owner s housing facilities occupied or to be occupied by eligible tenants the pbv hap contracts are permitted to have initial terms of up to 20 years and are renewable upon expiration providing a reliable source of revenue subject to appropriation that together with other funds is applied towards repayment of financing bonds and or loans for rehabilitating the applicable housing under pact conversions have been accomplished using hud s rental assistance demonstration rad program section 18 which provides a greater subsidy and may be blended with rad and other federal programs arentfox schiff has represented fannie mae in connection with certain financings involving section 9 public housing conversions to rad and rad section 18 blended assistance including the pact manhattan bundle involving the substantial rehabilitation of 1 713 housing units in 41 buildings in manhattan new york the trust was created in part to address inefficiencies in the way that nycha must undertake capital improvements restrictions relating to the new york city housing authority s construction process and its inability to utilize innovative project delivery methods have exacerbated its capital needs a new public entity with greater flexibility to leverage capital investment and to manage the rehabilitation of these properties must be established these inefficiencies are addressed under the pact program as development partners bring private sector design construction and property management expertise to their facilities the trust act addresses these inefficiencies by authorizing the trust to enter into alternative project delivery contracts providing for selection of contractors through a two step process first through a request for the qualification process to determine qualified bidders and second requesting proposals from the list of qualified bidders and selecting the team that provides the best value to the trust the trust is authorized to award contracts utilizing i cost plus not to exceed a guaranteed maximum price ii lump sum iii incentive based payments and iv combinations of the above the trust is required to comply with city and federal objectives goals and requirements for disadvantaged minority and women owned businesses non displacement of nycha employees prevailing wage requirements project labor agreement compliance and monitoring and enforcement requirements among other requirements improvements for pact housing facilities have been financed through bonds issued by new york city housing development corporation hdc lender loans mortgage backed securities and credit support provided by fannie mae and freddie mac the trust is authorized to tap into some of the same sources of financing the trust act authorizes the trust to issue up to 10 billion of bonds and if applicable obtain credit enhancement the trust act also authorizes hdc to make loans to the trust and to issue its bonds for such purposes one challenge that pact housing facilities frequently confront is tenant suspicion that having a ppp take control of their housing facility will lead to privatization of public housing and eventual tenant displacement despite tenant protections embedded in the pact program preserving tenant rights and permanent affordability requirements to try to address these concerns the trust act requires the residents of a housing facility to be provided with a choice of modernization strategies to choose from before a plan is implemented for that facility nycha housing facilities will not be converted under pact or be transferred to the trust unless the residents of those facilities have voted to do so residents of nycha housing facilities that are transferred to the trust will retain the same rights and protections they have as nycha residents to the maximum extent permitted by law residents of the trust s housing facilities will be eligible for automatic lease renewals and succession rights with monthly rent capped at 30 of a tenant s income these protections are intended to ensure that nycha apartments transferred to the trust will remain affordable and publicly managed both the pact program and the trust are intended to provide important tools for upgrading nycha housing through ppps the pact program is able to take advantage of market efficiencies available to the private sector that nycha is not able to access on its own the trust provides an alternative public option one that is intended to mimic some of the private sector efficiencies available under the pact program while retaining ultimate public control the success of each option will be judged by the willingness of residents to opt into that approach the ability to deliver on time on budget improvements and then to manage maintain repair and replace those improvements all while maintaining tenant protections and providing a place that residents are proud to call home the need is great having options is good success will be measured over time ultimately the proof will be in the pudding additional research and writing from matt jackson a 2022 summer associate in arentfox schiff s new york office and a law student at fordham university

safe nor does it regulate delta 8 products the fda reports that national poison control centers received nearly 2 500 calls regarding delta 8 products from january 2021 through february 2022 many of these calls were associated with unintentional ingestion but a greater concern is the lack of control over how industrial hemp is processed to create thc concentrations required to achieve the desired effect lawrence pharmacist dustin hothan said he shared this concern which prompted him to research delta 8 before deciding to stock it at his shop cbd of lawrence 4821 w sixth st hothan said he had been studying the benefits of cbd and related products since 2016 but when delta 8 came to lawrence in 2021 he was skeptical about its safety and benefits it worried me for a while hothan said i held off until i saw some studies and reputable companies doing it i talked to local manufacturers and decided let s go down this avenue and see where it leads andrea albright lawrence times cbd of lawrence 4821 w sixth st hothan said that although cbd of lawrence doesn t produce its own delta 8 products he has a stringent set of production criteria including safety content process procedures and testing that must be satisfied before he is willing to carry a product reputable sources for delta 8 products however can be tricky to find hothan recommends that buyers either ask proprietors for certificates of analysis on the products they stock or check online to see if the company producing the product lists the information online hothan said researching producers and distributors including online reviews is also a good idea for example he said reputable producers who provide chemical information should be able to show that it comes from a third party rather than in house analysis they should list the cannabinoid content in the product as well as have testing for residual solvents pesticides heavy metals etc he said via email i won t bring a product in unless i ve seen every bit of lab work he said the store has brought in products before but turned around and dumped them after finding negative reviews ranging anywhere from poor quality control to falsifying lab reports or certificates of analysis so even the best research and apparent labs are not always a sure sign he said that s why we try to be diligent in making sure the companies we bring in are well known and have a proven process advertisement hothan said retailers should be able to identify the sources of their products and if the company producing these products is legitimate they can tell you where your batch came from and have lab results or a certificate of analysis for that specific batch sacred leaf a topeka based franchise with a lawrence store at 810 w 23rd st offers products that are presented online as gmo free organic vegan and naturally sourced from 100 natural hemp the company states that they control their product from seed to source farming their own hemp extracting chemical compounds and bottling and shipping their products andrea albright lawrence times sacred leaf cbd 810 w 23rd st a manager at sacred leaf who asked not to be named said her employer was one of only a few companies in town selling delta 8 products produced by their own manufacturers she said that unlike other stores that sell products from outside sources the additional level of control ensures adequate product regulation and safety she said she was concerned that disreputable distributors who don t follow guidelines could eventually cause lawmakers to crack down on delta 8 businesses one or two of these people are going to ruin it for everyone else she said hothan said that cbd and thc products deserve further consideration as substitutes for pharmaceutical products and that as a pharmacist he has witnessed the success some patients see substituting one for the other although some people may buy or sell delta 8 for the euphoric effect hothan said his goal was to work with individuals to find a product and a dosage tailored to treat their specific need employees at cbd of lawrence are trained to speak with customers on benefits dosing and what symptoms a product is designed to alleviate hothan said he also recommended project cbd as a valuable source for information on studies safety and the science behind cbd and thc as alternative therapies he hopes that once people realize the safety and opportunity in these products public opinion will begin to sway legislators until then the goal is to stay within the rule of law to keep delta 8 available to his customers i would hate to see such a valuable product to be taken away just because of a lack of knowledge hothan said i think we can turn people s minds around eventually i certainly don t want to

daniel neman st louis post dispatch excuse me for a minute while i suck up to my boss not long ago my editor mentioned in passing that her favorite thing to eat is shrimp and grits suddenly and for reasons as mysterious as they are inexplicable i was struck by a consuming desire to write about shrimp and grits fortunately as with practically everyone who has ever had it i happen to like shrimp and grits i still remember the first time i tried it it was at a little neighborhood bistro in richmond virginia perhaps 30 years ago despite living only a few hours from south carolina where the dish originated and was popularized i had not even heard of it at the time i was instantly intrigued soft creamy grits topped with highly spiced perfectly prepared shrimp it sounded amazing and it was it was one of those dishes that you know you are going to be ordering for the rest of your life more banana bread sized for the frugal baker more indulgent carrot cake roll perfect any time of year more for saucy spears take a gentle approach i don t recall ever trying to cook it before but for the sake of my editor more sucking up i decided to make the best richest and creamiest shrimp and grits that i possibly could and then i walked back that idea i had initially planned to use heavy whipping cream in the grits but no one needs that many calories in their lives half and half will be fine i thought it was more than fine it was spectacular frankly the heavy cream would only have gilded the lily and then drowned it in cream making shrimp and grits is a two part process part one is the grits part two as you have already deduced is the shrimp usually grits are made just by pouring hominy treated cornmeal into boiling water and cooking it until the corn has absorbed the liquid and become soft and palatable but soft and palatable is not good enough for the shrimp and grits i wanted to make i wanted my grits to have oomph to have pizzazz i wanted them so good that it would be an insult to call them grits i began with stone ground grits which are to grits what whole grain flour is to all purpose flour it includes the outer part of the kernel the part that gets stuck in your teeth when you eat popcorn this process gives the grits more texture but that is less important than the fact that it also gives them a richer taste of corn more significantly i did not boil them in water good cooks know that grains always taste better when they are cooked in a flavorful stock so i used chicken broth for half of my cooking liquid the other half was half and half that s the part that could have been heavy cream but let s not be ridiculous the half and half made the grits rich and creamy enough especially once i stirred in some sharp cheddar cheese the grits were remarkable on their own but they are only half a dish i wanted the other half the shrimp half to be as good as the grits naturally i started with bacon i rendered a couple of slices of diced thick cut bacon and used the bacon fat to cook minced onion celery and green pepper yes that is a new orleans combination of ingredients not south carolina but they know how to cook shrimp in new orleans too next i tossed some shrimp in my own mixture of celery salt paprika cayenne pepper and black pepper and saute ed them with the bacon scented vegetables i sprinkled it all with a couple of tablespoons of flour and stirred it to make a quick roux all it needed then was more chicken stock to create a thick and ridiculously delicious sauce but don t just take my word for it i gave some to my shrimp and grits loving editor she tasted it and with a big smile on her face said it s perfect shrimp and grits yield 4 servings 2 1 2 cups plus 3 4 cup chicken stock divided 2 1 2 cups half and half 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon salt 1 1 8 teaspoons black pepper divided 1 cup grits preferably stone ground 3 4 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese 2 slices thick cut bacon diced 1 3 cup green pepper diced small 1 3 cup onion diced small 1 2 cup celery diced small 1 2 teaspoon celery salt 1 4 teaspoon paprika 1 8 teaspoon cayenne pepper or to taste 1 pound shrimp shelled and deveined 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 tablespoons all purpose flour in a large saucepan over high heat combine 21 2 cups of the chicken stock and the half and half add butter salt and 1 teaspoon pepper and bring to a boil stir in grits

despite a strong year for the stock market and gdp record charitable giving in 2021 failed to keep pace with inflation prunderground june 21st 2022 the annual report on philanthropy for the year 2021 released on june 21 2022 reports that individuals bequests foundations and corporations gave an estimated 484 85 billion to u s charities in 2021 total charitable giving in 2021 grew 4 0 over the revised total of 466 23 billion contributed in 2020 however while giving increased in current dollars it declined 0 7 after adjusting for inflation in addition it was a positive year for national fundraising consulting firms as well david king president ceo of alexander haas will present the details of the report today at a meeting sponsored in partnership with afp greater atlanta chapter to be attended by the atlanta area fundraising community what we are seeing in this report is a mixed bag of good and bad news one the one hand giving reached its all time high in 2021 but the flip side of that is because of inflation levels that we have not seen in decades that record amount of money had less purchasing power says king so even in a record year for giving the nonprofit sector finds itself with fewer resources this mirrors what many people have experienced personally as they saw gains in income levels wiped away by significant price increases he says giving by individuals continued to be the largest sector of giving with an estimated 326 87 billion rising 4 9 staying flat at 0 2 adjusted for inflation this sector comprised less than 70 of total giving for the fourth time on record and for the fourth consecutive year mega gifts 450 million by some of the wealthiest americans reached a total of nearly 15 billion in 2021 representing about 5 of all individual giving in 2021 and played an important role in lifting individual giving several subsectors that struggled in 2020 experienced a rebound in 2021 giving to the health the arts and yes even religion giving to religion grew by 5 4 flat at 0 7 adjusted for inflation giving to health is estimated to have grown by 7 7 and giving to the arts is estimated to have increased 27 5 the resurgence of giving to arts and culture is a pleasant result these organizations suffered mightily in 2020 when they were forced to close which resulted in a double whammy of lost contributed income and lost earned income from admissions and ticket sales these are largely experience based organizations where being there is the service they provide king says our museums theatres musical venues were all shuttered for over a year so it is easy to see why there were hit with a decline in 2020 it was an out of site out of mind situation it s important that donors returned to these organization in 2021 with significant philanthropy once they were able to resume programming as well as increasing the utilization of fundraising campaign services however several subsectors that experienced strong growth in 2020 did not fare as well in 2021 for instance gifting to education is estimated to have declined 2 8 7 2 adjusted for inflation giving to human service organizations increased 2 2 but declined 2 4 adjusted for inflation david king i think to understand some of this you must look past the numbers to the environment of 2021 i think this is particularly true for giving to education giving to education fell in 2021 for the first time since 2013 i think this is reflective of a widespread dissatisfaction with how educational institutions responded to the pandemic to be fair educational institutions were truly in a no win situation whether they returned to in person learning or continued virtual or whether they maintained or lifted mask mandates either decision was going to meet with disapproval from a significant number of their constituents i think many people may have expressed that dissatisfaction by withholding contributions king surmises the stock market and gdp recovered to pre pandemic levels early in 2021 and continued to grow throughout the year the s p 500 grew 26 9 21 2 adjusted for inflation and the gdp grew 10 1 5 1 adjusted for inflation creating strong conditions for charitable giving what concerns me now is how 2022 is going we are already seeing over 8 inflation this year with much higher rates than that in the energy and food sectors which are items every single person and organization must have higher costs on those items eats into discretionary income in a very real and immediate way which can translate into less discretionary income available for charitable contributions king cautions if 2022 continues to see inflation at this rate or higher and steep stock market declines i don t see any way that giving will be able to keep up i think 20202 could be a struggle as prices increase while philanthropy remains flat or declines again he said about alexander haas fundraising counsel alexander haas a national fundraising consulting firm headquartered in atlanta georgia works with nonprofit organizations of all sizes and shapes including higher education museums schools performing arts human services hospitals and churches and religious congregations for more than 30 years alexander haas has partnered with thousands of organizations and institutions to advance their missions through enhanced fundraising services

for years abortion providers have been gearing up for what america may look like after roe v wade now with the reversal possibly right around the corner there s one woman quickly becoming one of the most important providers in the country even though she lives thousands of miles away we have been helping hundreds of thousands of women all over the world said dr rebecca gomperts founder of aid access for over 20 years dutch doctor rebecca gomperts has been helping women worldwide get abortions in places where it is illegal in 2014 the documentary vessel documented her efforts to provide abortions on ships in offshore waters near countries like ireland poland morocco and guatemala since 2018 she s been assisting tens of thousands of women in the u s too this time through her website aid access using the site americans can order abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol after consulting with a remote physician the delivery system works even in the 19 states that restrict abortion pills by mail also known as telehealth abortion in many of those states aid access is the only provider offering the service dr gomperts shared how the likely reversal of roe would impact her and her organization newsy s ben schamisso don t you think women would be scared to use your services dr rebecca gomperts so most states don t criminalize the women that do the abortions so they cannot be prosecuted that said the other risk is that women will be scared to see a first aid or a doctor in case they might have a complication and that is why aid access always tells women don t say to anybody that you took the abortion pills but just say that you had a miscarriage based in austria and shipping drugs from india aid access is beyond the reach of american law enforcement schamisso you are in the netherlands but do you still feel that your organization is taking a risk and is doing something that in certain states is considered illegal and how do you deal with it gomperts i am a medical doctor and i have an obligation and a medical oath that i will support people that are in medical need and so my conscience is bigger than my fear i guess abortions by pill have grown exponentially over the last 20 years accounting for more than half of pregnancy terminations in the u s in 2020 the two drug procedure is considered safe and effective for women up to 10 weeks pregnant aid access charges between 110 and 150 or less for those who can t afford it i think that it s really important that people even if they don t have money that they can still access an abortion service because it s so important for the future of the women and also the future of their families dr gomperts said that is also what is the problem with these laws it is never affecting the women with money and with resources and with access to education it s always harming and affecting the most vulnerable people out there dr gomperts says abortion pills are the future of reproductive health especially in places where access to surgical abortion is limited because of laws or other factors in ukraine for example dr gomperts says her other organization women on web has been very active women on web has been very involved in making sure that women in ukraine can get access to abortion pills as well because of the rape that has been happening dr gomperts said i think that is why the abortion pills are so important because it makes it possible to take matters in our own hands aid access is the only service openly allowing americans to stock up on abortion pills for the future it s like preventive medicine dr gomperts said it s what people do when they travel you know you bring some antibiotics and painkillers with you to make sure that if you get ill that you can that you have the things that you need to treat yourself in preparation for the possible supreme court reversal dr gomperts urges abortion rights activists worldwide to keep sticking together we re in this together and we fight this together she said all the abortion providers all the women s rights organizations but also friends family partners that are helping women to get access to abortion
