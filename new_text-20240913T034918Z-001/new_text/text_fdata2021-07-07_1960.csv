london president joe biden s administration is working hard to reclaim america s role as a global leader in sustainable development but success will depend on whether it can lay the political foundation for a new relationship between society and the environment activists and policymakers alike are demanding more investment in technologies to reduce the environmental footprint of economic activities limit extraction of finite resources and curb pollution there is a long list of solutions on offer from new energy sources and carbon capture and sequestration to the oldest technology of all trees but the biggest challenge is not the technology it is political institutions despite its flaws america is still the most successful example of self government in recorded history but as a model republic it faces the challenge of accommodating and reconciling the wide diversity of its citizens imagined futures finding common ground between the poles of progressive techno utopianism and reactionary rural romanticism will not be easy the key is to produce a synthesis that can sustain a civic contract strong enough to survive both another industrial revolution and environmental changes on a scale beyond anything human civilisations have experienced since becoming sedentary 10 000 years ago in this quest for a new settlement our relationship with water offers a useful guide ever since the shift from hunter gatherer societies to agricultural settlements when people effectively chose to stand still in a world of moving water human institutions have evolved in a dialectical relationship with the environment while nature brought floods storms and droughts we devised ways to weather those conditions extracting surpluses from parched landscapes and harnessing rivers for transportation and power the modern republican project emerged from this older dialectic between human civilization and nature it has been mediated by medieval jurists reinterpreted by early modern humanists and disrupted by generations of radicals from the eighteenth century revolutionaries to the twentieth century anti imperialists demanding enfranchisement as thomas paine observed a central concern of the newly independent american republic was always going to be its unique territory and physical landscape bestriding an entire continent the united states has had to learn to manage a wide array of geographic conditions all while striking a balance between individual liberty and collective agency in 1784 for example george washington incorporated the potomac company to pursue inland navigation beyond the appalachians thereby preventing those territories from becoming too dependent on the port of spanish controlled new orleans but this response to a geographical problem created a political one shipping on the potomac routed commerce across state lines and thus required freedom of navigation but the deeply libertarian articles of confederation contained no provision to arbitrate commercial disputes to settle the matter washington convened a meeting at his estate on the banks of the potomac where those in attendance produced the eponymous mount vernon compact then james madison organised a similar conference of all the states in annapolis where delegates concluded that a constitutional convention should be held in philadelphia a problem of navigation had turned into one of governance and ultimately of constitutional settlement over time and through judicial review inland navigation became a fully federal matter especially as the young country began to wrestle with its physical features to sustain its economic development in the early nineteenth century countless canal companies emerged along the eastern seaboard most did not have the capital to maintain the hundreds of locks needed to overcome steep gradients but because they connected the country they were too important to lose and thus came to be financed with state bonds by the 1830s these canal and river works accounted for over half of states debt and when the panic of 1837 hit many of these companies went bankrupt dragging state treasuries with them a precursor to the doom loops witnessed in more recent financial crises following these earlier experiments the us federal government s role in regulating financing and developing large water infrastructure grew substantially especially during the twentieth century in the progressive era and then under president franklin d roosevelt s new deal a new modernist republic evolved featuring a greatly expanded role for the state rivers became blueprints for electrification and economic development more broadly offering a counterpoint to the centrally managed industrialisation of the soviet union in the event america s model looked so successful that it convinced most of the rest of the world also to build thousands of dams reservoirs and canals ultimately replumbing the global landscape as a result most of us in wealthy industrialised countries have been able to forget that the planet is subject to extraordinary climate variability after all our daily experience is almost entirely artificial the product of republican institutions that underwrote a vast stock of water infrastructure designed to control nature and bend it to our needs contemporary urbanised technological life would be impossible if people still had to worry about flooding or finding the next bucket of water concerns that still burden billions of people the twentieth century conquest of nature is the legacy of a republican project that adapted to the conditions of industrial modernity what corresponding political project will the age of climate change bring at a time of resurgent authoritarianism around the world it is crucial to show why a democratic republic is still the best vehicle to balance individual agency and collective action in confronting existential challenges much will depend on whether the us is capable of another constitutional moment defined by the yale law professor bruce ackerman as a historical event that elicits elevated and sustained popular attention to the role of the state in a country s economic and social life biden s efforts to transform america in pursuit of a net zero economy may well become a constitutional moment but the task calls for more than supporting new technologies and drawing up clever plans biden must shepherd through a new civic contract that reflects a representative synthesis of the commonwealth s diverse aspirations and values the stakes could not be higher america s great challenge and its opportunity is to usher in the first environmental republic giulio boccaletti an honourary research associate at the smith school of enterprise and

popular with brits and has been expanding fast overseas wise claims to have over 10 million customers who use its service to send 5 billion 7 billion across borders each month wise competes with wire

coinbase have also gone public through direct listings unlike in a traditional ipo companies that list directly don t issue any new shares or raise fresh capital this process also forgoes the need for investment bankers to underwrite the offering however wise is being advised by banks like goldman sachs and morgan stanley tech founders and venture capitalists say direct listings can be a more attractive route to the stock market than an ipo as it avoids paying steep underwriting fees and a potential mispricing of shares wise was last privately valued at 5 billion in a secondary share sale as it is listing directly there is no pricing process like the one firms normally undergo with an ipo and the share price will be determined by the market once it lists why does it matter wise s

london s listings regime and make it more attractive for tech firms to list in the capital it s also a validation for the country s burgeoning fintech sector which has produced multibillion dollar

tehran iran ap almost six years ago iranians poured into the streets to celebrate tehran s nuclear deal with world powers they saw it as a chance for the islamic republic to re enter the world economy and create opportunities like purchasing airplanes and selling its oil on the international market today that dream has faded into a daily grinding nightmare of high inflation an ever weakening national currency and high unemployment worsened by the coronavirus pandemic the west considers iran s nuclear program and mideast tensions as the most important issues facing tehran but those living in the islamic republic repeatedly point to the economy as the major issue facing it ahead of its june 18 presidential election whoever takes the presidency after the relatively moderate president hassan rouhani will face the unenviable task of trying to reform iran s largely state controlled economy efforts to privatize it have seen corruption allegations swirl as many lose their life savings and nationwide protests rage one day they said the nuclear deal was accepted everyone was happy the dollar rate went down over one day said mohammad molaei a 50 year old commodities trader then things start to happen missiles are fired the nuclear deal is bust one tears it apart the other burns it only the people lose iran s economic freefall accelerated when then president donald trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew america from tehran s nuclear deal with world powers that saw crushing sanctions target iran hurting its already ailing economy perhaps nothing illustrates the crisis gripping iran s economy as well as the battering of its currency the rial in july 2015 amid those raucous nuclear deal celebrations 1 bought some 32 000 rials today 1 buys 238 000 rials the weakening of the rial has seen the value of the money iranians hold in the bank collapse as well as the decimation of retiree benefits the price of milk has risen by 90 while the cost of imported foreign goods like mobile phones and electronics has skyrocketed iranians able to exchange their rials for foreign currencies have bought precious metals like gold or invested in real estate those property purchases have fueled a spike in housing values pricing people out of the market in the past buying a place to live in was a dream for the people said salimi a 48 year old man who declined to give his first name in order to speak freely with associated press journalists in tehran s grand bazaar but unfortunately now renting a house has become a dream as well because of the inefficiency of the officials especially the president who gave empty promises and deceived the people salimi added why is that are land housing materials and workers under sanctions the tehran stock exchange became another refuge sought by investors which saw its value shoot up to 2 million points in august 2020 as the government encouraged the public to buy but values dropped by nearly half and now hover around 1 1 million points as some investors remain stuck with stocks they can t sell the biggest challenge for the next president is to restore trust and confidence to the stock market said mahdi samavati a prominent economic analyst who runs his own investment firm restoring confidence to the market is very difficult the people have been seeing their money melting away for nine to 10 months the longer the crash takes the longer it would take to fix things and bring back the trust it s not immediately clear how the next iranian president will handle the economy particularly if hard liners take over and if tehran doesn t reach an agreement on returning to the nuclear deal which limits its atomic program and restores sanctions relief president joe biden says he s willing for the u s to return but weeks of negotiations in vienna have yet to see public progress iranian leaders in the past have relied on populist programs such as cash handouts and subsidized housing without the hard currency of oil sales iran likely would need to print more rials to fund those programs which in turn would lower the rial s value further that would fuel iran s high inflation making goods even more expensive if the next government prints money to fulfil those promises without a doubt we will have an unleashed growth in inflation samavati said during the first televised presidential debate in iran former central bank chief abdolnasser hemmati warned that as an economist he didn t see a way to fund the colorful and fascinating promises of his rivals these friends are not talking about distributing wealth they are talking about distributing poverty he said hemmati viewed as the sole surrogate for the outgoing rouhani in the election came under withering criticism from much of the field the exception was hard line judiciary chief ebrahim raisi the presumed front runner who sought to appear above the fray different classes of people have started shouting about the inefficiencies cruelty poverty discrimination and corruption raisi said former revolutionary guard commander mohsen rezaei discussed iran s dire economy by repeatedly referring to the desperately poor eating out of trash cans but none of the candidates apart from hemmati offered any specific thoughts on economic policy other than to promise more aid for the poor salimi the man in the bazaar said he would still vote for hard liners and would support iran s theocracy no matter the challenges ahead he blamed rouhani for the nation s woes and said he d vote for raisi i have no worries for my children they are the children of the revolution he said they won t bow down to difficulties molaei the commodities trader said he hoped to send his children abroad for a better life as many other iranians have we have been wasted when i opened my eyes after birth there was the revolution and then came the iran iraq war and killing and bloodshed he said i ve been working ever since then ___ follow mehdi fattahi on twitter at

monsanto has been linked to the poison game for a long time all the propaganda in the world can t erase the fact that they first poisoned thousands of vietnamese thai and koreans as well as countless american soldiers with agent orange who only now receive compensation for the effects of monsanto s bio warfare decades later the proof is finally so pervasive that the company can no longer just sweep away evidence of their evil doing from 1962 to 1971 the u s air force sprayed nearly 19 million gallons of herbicides in vietnam of which at least 11 million gallons was agent orange in a military project called operation ranch hand veterans and agent orange health effects of herbicides used in vietnam the legacy of agent orange and monsanto s attempt to defoliate the hiding places of the viet cong is still apparent in modern vietnam but how those chemicals are being used now in the aftermath of war should be even more chilling to the observant individual during the vietnam war agent orange chemicals were sprayed primarily from c 123 twin engine aircraft carriers this was called operation ranch hand the total number of gallons of herbicide sprayed are in the millions one of the primary chemicals used in agent orange named so because the canisters they were transported in were painted with bright orange stripes is 2 4 d but other chemicals were also contained within those canisters aside from hundreds of thousands of birth defects reported by the vietnamese from the spraying of these chemicals war veterans began to notice health problems that they attributed to exposure to agent orange it took nearly 20 years after the vietnam war ended for congress to inquire about the ramifications of using these chemicals in vietnam and the health damage suffered by vietnam vets according to casarett and doull s toxicology 1996 edition tcdd dioxin has been shown to be extremely toxic to a number of animal species mortality does not occur immediately it appears that the animals environment suddenly becomes toxic to them related is monsanto s glyphosate the new agent orange this is likely why many vets did not see symptoms from agent orange exposure until many years after the fact eventually congress asked the institute of medicine iom national academy of sciences nas to perform an in depth study on these chemicals and they did find them highly toxic but at what cost to veterans who showed adverse health symptoms earlier moreover the us military who commissioned monsanto and dow among other chemical companies to create agent orange knew it was highly toxic dr james clary a scientist at the chemical weapons branch eglin air force base who designed the herbicide spray tank and wrote a 1979 report on operation ranch hand told senator daschle in 1988 said when we military scientists initiated the herbicide program in the1960s we were aware of the potential for damage due to dioxin contamination in the herbicide we were even aware that the military formulation had a higher dioxin concentration than the civilian version due to the lower cost and speed of manufacture however because the material was to be used on the enemy none of us were overly concerned we never considered a scenario in which our own personnel would become contaminated with the herbicide quoted by admiral elmo r zumwalt 1990 gmos not used as food but as bioweapons the world population is now the enemy from dicamba to 2 4 d to glyphosate the chemicals being used on our crops are being consumed in mass some claim it s actually part of an over arching plan to control the population on the surface it looks as though these companies are greed motivated which they are but the truth of their great chemical dreams is more subverting case in point many gm companies work with and through agra which is supported by the rockefeller foundation and the bill and melinda gates foundation to feed the starving african children you may have noticed that many gm foods are sent to africa and other poor nations as part of aid packages nevermind that these very same multinational companies have scoured these countries for every natural resource they have and could solve simple diseases with a two cent vitamin not by creating things like genetically modified golden rice to prevent malnourished children who go blind or so they claim instead these companies focus on switching out heirloom viable seed with gm seed for example when asked how agra gets improved seeds that s what they call gm seed to farmers they say there are three ways agra makes grants to farmer organizations public breeding institutes and private start up seed companies farmer organizations and public breeding institutes mainly produce cuttings of vegetatively propagated crops like sweet potato and cassava for these crops once farmers have the improved varieties they can replant it for many years but for seed crops such as maize and sorghum the best method for getting fresh certified seed to farmers is via locally owned and managed seed companies agra fails to mention that companies like monsanto have infiltrated or have fully taken over locally owned and managed seed companies all over the world when asked if resource poor farmers can really afford to purchase new seed every year the agra website offers this missive yes in fact we are finding that seed companies regularly sell out of their stocks every year and still cannot keep up with demand selling seed in small packages and making it available at the village level has greatly increased farmer adoption of improved seed mobile money has likewise boosted sales of seed in remote villages agra also works with farmer organizations that offer group buying opportunities as well as access to credit what we are increasingly seeing is that by adopting improved seed farmers are becoming more prosperous and more able to purchase additional seed as well as other inputs again no mention of farmer suicides all over india due to seed monopolies and herbicide use that forces a farmer ironically the ones who grow food to starve to death because gm seeds aren t as viable as gm companies promised they would be now even us farmers who want to grow organic crops are facing bankruptcy all these gm crops and the chemicals that go with them are warfare clear and simple does the military machine ask for america s permission when they decide to invade a foreign country no add to these unsavory facts the observance that the fda and usda have continually turned a blind eye when it has come to protecting the food supply is glyphosate the new agent orange are we eating america s left over chemical warfare to be used as agricultural poison on our food supply glyphosate residue is now in almost every food we eat from packaged foods sold in the grocery store to eggs and even meat and poultry because the animals that were fed gm bt corn and soy were eating traces of toxic chemicals furthermore 2 4 d resistant crops were just given a rubber stamp even though the public strongly opposed them while it was our own government who did the spraying they colluded with monsanto one of the nine government contractors who made the toxic combination of 2 4 d and 2 4 5 t which came to be called agent orange many people don t know this but after decades of research proving that agent orange is lethal and tens of millions of dollars paid to victims in settlements it is still being used in many asian countries the company has switched to using it s best selling herbicide roundup predominately now yet another innocent product constructed of toxic chemicals roundup kills weeds because glyphosate a salt compound inhibits enzyme pathways preventing plants from synthesizing amino acids necessary for growth it basically stops plants from eating so they die it is probable that monsanto and other companies who use this substance under other names besides roundup are now dumping more than 300 million pounds of this toxic poison into our soil annually it s use has at least tripled since 1990 read stopping resurgence of agent orange in food supply this calls into question some of the arguments posted by anti labeling and pro gmo propagandists who say that the science isn t conclusive that gmo herbicides are dangerous this is why countless people continue to rail against monsanto it s why monsanto and others spend millions of dollars illegally to try to defeat gmo labeling bills the truth is that roundup in the form of glyphosate is just another product of the military industrial complex and an evolution of agent orange as unsuspecting consumers we eat other chemicals as well another clue for this chemical warfare can be found in the products made by food companies like heinz knorr slimfast and best foods just to name a few stanley monteith an expert on world food supply points to the huge amounts of man made chemicals in the food on our local grocery store shelves naming aspartame as an example dr monteith explains aspartame is a chemical made up of aspartic acid and phenylalanine and it breaks down into formaldehyde eventually into wood alcohol it produces all sorts of problems mental problems and it impacts on literally every organ in the body they know this there are extensive animal studies that show this and it never should ve been put into our food chemical additives like sodium fluoride also cause health issues despite official research showing that fluoride is toxic even coming from harvard multinational companies and governments continue to put it in our water supplies at the end of the second world war the united states government sent charles eliot perkins a research worker in chemistry biochemistry physiology and pathology to take charge of the vast farben chemical plants in germany while there he was told by german chemists of a scheme which had been worked out by them during the war and adopted by the german general staff this was to control the population in any given area through mass medication of drinking water in this scheme sodium fluoride occupied a prominent place when you add up the chemicals of monsanto other biotech companies food companies and toxic industrial waste products purposely put in our water along with toxic drugs and medical treatments that kill us instead of cure us what are we left to believe monsanto s legacy was not left in vietnam

by casey harper the center square a new report from the tax foundation found that president joe biden s proposed tax increases would put the u s at much higher rates than many of its economic competitors biden has proposed several tax increases to fund his several trillion dollars in new spending most of which has not yet passed through congress those include taxing long term capital gains as normal income for those making more than 1 million plus an increase in the top marginal tax rate from 37 to 39 6 the report compared the tax rates of the u s with the 37 other countries in the organisation for economic co operation and development oced the international cooperative group s mission is to spur economic growth and trade but the latest report finds the tax hikes may undermine those goals in the u s short term capital gains held for less than one year are taxed as ordinary income the report says long term capital gains held for more than one year are taxed at lower rates ranging from 0 percent to 20 percent plus a 3 8 percent niit depending on an investor s income in addition to these federal taxes states tax capital gains at an average rate of 5 2 percent resulting in the 29 percent top combined rate the top marginal tax rate on long term capital gains in the oecd is 19 1 percent eight oecd countries levy higher rates than the u s while denmark applies the highest top rate of 42 percent currently the u s is ranked 9th just higher than australia and below germany however the report found that the biden administration s proposal would make the u s top capital gains rate an outlier within the oecd at 48 4 percent joining only two other countries with rates at or above 40 percent the report goes on to say that additional taxes on top of the capital gains tax can create a large burden for businesses investment income from corporations can be subject to corporate income tax in addition to capital gains taxes the report says a business must first pay corporate income tax and therefore investors see their gains from after tax profits the integrated tax rate on corporate income reflects both the corporate income tax and the dividends or capital gains tax the total tax levied on corporate income the integrated tax rate on corporate income distributed as dividends would rise from 47 3 percent to 65 1 percent under biden s tax plan which would be highest in the oecd critics say this could cause wealthier americans to flee to other developed nations with lower taxes they also argue the tax would stifle job opportunities and that other nations would find loopholes leaving the u s bearing the brunt of the economic consequences chris edwards a tax expert at the cato institute has warned about the economic impact of these kinds of taxes since biden was on the campaign trail why do countries provide low tax rates for capital gains edwards said for one thing they know that capital is mobile in today s global economy and it will flow abroad if tax rates are unfavorable compared to foreign trading partners the report also points to reduced investment as a result of the increased tax higher tax rates on individual shareholders reduce the return to saving and higher taxes on corporations raise the cost of investment reducing saving and investment the report says lower investment levels and reductions in capital stock translate to lower work productivity reduced wages and lower economic output critics also say corporations will simply pass on their increased costs to consumers if the tax rate is increased many businesses will pass on the costs to consumers through higher prices for products and services wrote matthew dickerson in a heritage foundation report on biden s tax plan one study found that the price increases after a corporate tax hike are larger for lower price items and products purchased by low income households image courtesy of the white house

tightening worldwide supply chain and transportation and logistics issues which delayed the arrival of key components causing both factory downtime and overtime expenses legal expenses related to the

continued but lessening expenses related to covid 19 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 net income was 0 9 million or 0 08 per share comparable to the same period of fiscal year 2020 the lower than anticipated earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 are primarily a result of a tax true up of federal research and development credits of 0 4 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2021 net income was 4 2 million or 0 38 per share up from 3 3 million or 0 30 per share for the same period of fiscal year 2020 during the third quarter the company was awarded a customer program to build consumer products that could provide up to 30 million or more in annual revenue when it reaches full production this new program is expected to commence production in the latter half of fiscal year 2022 and is another example of a customer onshoring an existing program to manage logistic risk the production process is highly automated and involves a high level of partnership with the customer to build out the production equipment in the coming months in support of the new program key tronic expanded its facility footprint at its juarez mexico campus by leasing an additional contiguous building of 145 000 square feet we re pleased with the successful launch of new programs and our rebounding and increasing customer demand in fiscal 2021 said craig gates president and

and new program wins moving into fiscal 2022 the covid 19 crisis component shortages and logistic delays continue to present macroeconomic along with multiple business challenges but we continue to see the favorable trend of contract manufacturing returning to north america we are excited to expand our mexico operations with new program awards and also to see our domestic sites benefiting from customers onshoring initiatives we expect continued strong revenue growth in the coming quarters and continue to invest in new capacity to prepare for long term growth business outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 key tronic expects to report revenue in the range of 120 million to 125 million as delays in the supply of key components for the company s business continue to significantly limit production as a result of additional legal and internal review costs associated with the internal investigation we expect that earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 will be below the previous guidance range provided on may 4 2021 but updated guidance for earnings is not available at this time we expect to release final results for the fourth quarter in the coming weeks conference

numbers would bounce around and a four day run of 35 16 35 18 is testament this was not known yesterday when the asx200 again attempted to rally from the open despite no wall street to be up 30 points in the first half hour before easing slightly ahead of the 11am update it appears the market was unsure about an 18 result tracking sideways for an hour until someone pointed out the dow futures were tumbling the index was down 25 by 2pm before rallying back to flat ahead of the 2 30pm rba statement release the release contained three surprises well two in the release the other was philip lowe holding a press conference a la the fed governor a new initiative the significant two were a tapering of bond purchases qe to 4bn per week from 5bn with a further reassessment to be made in november and the disappearance of at the earliest in the statement in reference to the central bank s 2024 first rate hike expectation the goal remains to see inflation sustainably within the 2 3 band and this will require a stronger labour market to encourage wage growth the bank s central scenario for the economy is that this condition will not be met before 2024 the asx200 had been flat at 2 30pm and closed down 53 the bottom has been seen in ultra loose monetary policy impacting on the yield paying sectors of banks 0 5 industrials 0 9 and telcos 2 0 healthcare was also hit 1 0 on the implication of a stronger aussie although an initial jump up to almost us76c post rba was wiped out last night technology 1 9 suffers from higher bond yields discounting growth while consumer discretionary 1 4 suffers from higher household mortgage costs utilities should by rights be in the yield paying camp but for the oil price factor energy was the only sector to close in the green yesterday 1 5 while utilities closed flat higher oil prices drove energy oil prices have tanked overnight weakness in the dow futures during our session proved accurate as wall street tumbled from the open last night but an afternoon recovery had the s p500 closing down only 0 2 and our futures are similarly down 11 this morning taking the lockdown news into account ring the bell on friday night the dow hit its first new all time high since may while the s p500 posted a seven day winning streak all new highs having had a pb of eight in the last five years the bell was rung not a big bell however more like one you d summon the butler with all three major indices tanked from the open but when the dow had fallen over 400 points it was only back to last wednesday s level wall street had opened lower when two elements accelerated the falls firstly the us services pmi fell to 60 1 in june from 64 0 in may it s a decent drop but anything over 60 still implies very strong growth wall street was already in selling mode so fears that the us economic recovery may now be slowing only spurred things on secondly and with regard to a slowing recovery there is growing concern in the us over the spread of the delta variant news last night from israel was that tests had found the pfizer vaccine showing only 64 efficacy against delta compared to 95 for the original wuhan virus but as stock prices fell bond prices rose the us ten year yield fell 6 basis points to 1 37 lower bond yields are positive for growth stocks and the delta concerns are a reason to move back into covid winners the nasdaq bottomed out mid session and rallied straight back to close in the green dragging the s p off its lows and to a lesser extent the dow the nasdaq was also supercharged by a 4 7 gain for amazon after the us department of defense cancelled its us 10bn jedi contract signed under trump with rival microsoft for its part america s largest company only closed flat on the day in contrast to the fall in bond yields largely driven by the services pmi anecdotal evidence was provided of americans out and about for the july 4 holiday in numbers exceeding pre pandemic levels and of substantially higher prices in restaurants i think they call that inflation but likely of the transitory kind despite the noise what was evident was another case of buy the dip on any stock market pullback with pullbacks being less and less significant in 2021 in other news only days after its ipo chinese ride share company didi dropped 20 to below its listing price after the chinese government suspended didi s app due to national security concerns at least that was the excuse the reality is that chinese companies typically dual list in both new york and the communist stronghold of hong kong while didi listed only in new york thus drawing the ire of the ccp fearing that it s losing control beijing is increasingly interfering in its own capitalist companies in order to rein them in leading to foreign investors questioning whether it s worth the risk all us listed chinese companies took some level of a hit last night on the didi news and we note uber is a 13 shareholder of didi commodities spot metals

halfpoint getty images istockphoto commitment to our readers gobankingrates editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information we use data driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers you can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology 20 years helping you live richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers you ve been dreaming of the day for decades and now it s almost here this year or next you plan to retire but choosing the precise day to call it quits can be a tricky decision make the wrong move and you could pay a hefty financial price fortunately experts can help steer you away from making big retirement mistakes here are some suggestions from financial planners about the ideal time to leave your job in the next couple of years the first day following your original service date employees who work for the government and other employers offering a defined benefit pension should confirm their first date of service with the human resources department before scheduling their last day on the job said jason silverberg financial planner at financial advantage associates in rockville maryland silverberg advises clients to consider retiring on the day after the anniversary of their first day on the job this will give you one more full year of service credit toward your pension calculation without working beyond that date without credits he said some pension plans also factor in an employee s age when calculating eligibility for retirement and the monthly benefit amount so workers should educate themselves on their company s specific retirement rules the very beginning or end of the year if you lack cash reserves to cover your living expenses for a while following retirement the best time to retire might be at the very beginning or very end of the year this way you re not pulling a lot of money out of your retirement accounts during a year where you might be in a higher tax bracket with earned income silverberg said however silverberg recommends having cash reserves to cover three to five years of retirement expenses so you won t have to take money out of investments such as stocks during a downturn another alternative is to work part time from home also be aware of your age before you start withdrawing money from retirement accounts if you turn 59 1 2 years old at any point during then wait to take money from your retirement accounts until that time said silverberg you will avoid a 10 early withdrawal penalty when you can avoid a required minimum distribution the irs requires retirees to take a minimum distribution from retirement accounts such as 401 k plans and traditional individual retirement accounts beginning the year you turn 70 1 2 however if you reach ed 70 1 2 on jan 1 2020 or after you may delay taking your first rmd until april 1 of the year after you reach age 72 then beginning that same year and continuing every subsequent year you must take your annual rmd by dec 31 there is an exception to the rmd rule for individuals who are still employed and have an employer based 401 k through their current workplace as long as you keep working you won t have to take your first rmd until you retire unfortunately this only works for employer based retirement accounts not iras when you can maximize social security benefits for an increasing number of older americans retiring from one career doesn t necessarily mean leaving the workforce some might even choose to stay with their current employers after they begin collecting social security benefits in either case silverberg advises older clients who still earn a paycheck to hold off on claiming social security at least until they turn 67 before that age the current full retirement age under social security administration rules you will be penalized if you earn more than 18 960 in 2021 or 19 560 in 2022 social security will withhold 1 of benefits for every 2 earned above that amount silverberg said according to the social security administration for people born 1943 1954 the full retirement age is 66 and for people born 1955 and beyond the full retirement age increases a bit each year until it reaches age 67 for people born in 1960 or later when you celebrate turning 70 workers can begin claiming social security benefits early at age 62 this will reduce their monthly benefit amounts however with the reduction based on the number of months they receive benefits before reaching full retirement age employees born before 1959 who retire between age 66 and age 67 depending on the exact year of birth are eligible for 100 of their social security benefits but they can earn even more if they hold off on claiming according to the social security administration putting off collecting social security can earn you up to 132 of your monthly benefit however that bonus stops increasing at age 70 if you turn age 70 at any point then claim social security silverberg said you will not receive any monetary benefit for delaying it further the social security administration also recommends looking into signing up for medicare at age 65 even if you decide to delay your social security claim if you are still employed however check how enrolling in medicare might impact your workplace sponsored health coverage when you ve done enough retirement research before retiring have a solid grasp of how much you will spend each year then develop strategies for using investment income and other sources to supplement pension and social security benefits think long and hard about how you will spend your days well before putting in your two weeks notice and leaving the workforce advice anyone considering retirement soon might want to try semi retirement and explore fulfilling activities before calling it quits for good said kim e jones a certified financial planner with jones strategic financial planning in broomfield colorado it s a good time to retire if you feel ready to leave your job and if you have done a thorough financial analysis as to your ability to not outlive your money said jones deciding to retire should not be a wing it decision daria uhlig and cynthia measom contributed to the reporting for this article

these programs are ending start your own small business ideas for a post pandemic world meanwhile there are small businesses still desperately trying to stay afloat with those in rural locations

the pandemic property frenzy has seen buyers stop at nothing to get the keys to their dream home and with demand and prices rocketing as well as huge stamp duty savings up for grabs competition has been fierce but the buying boom has brought out an ugly side of the market gazumping and estate agents have told us that the problem has never been worse than over the past few months estate agents say the problem of gazumping where a seller accepts a higher offer despite already having a verbal agreement with another buyer has never been worse the industry is now calling on the government to outlaw the gazumping cheats who derail sales and cost honest buyers thousands of pounds figures last week revealed that two in five buyers secured a home by putting in a better bid after a sale had been agreed but before contracts were exchanged the practice which is not illegal in england and wales was the leading cause of property deals not going ahead in the past 12 months according to the research from comparison site comparethemarket com gazumping in scotland is much rarer because an agreement becomes binding the moment a written offer is accepted in australia it remains a grey area but queensland has virtually eliminated it with a similar system to scotland iain mckenzie from the guild of property professionals says while the situation in scotland is much better when it comes to gazumping it is by no means perfect most estate agents in scotland are also solicitors and therefore overseen by the law society which considers gazumping a disciplinary offence this means most estate agents in scotland would have to withdraw their services if a client wished to accept a higher offer biggest rise in over 16 years uk house prices rose at the fastest pace since november 2004 of course this means that gazumping can still happen it s just unlikely in practice demand for property exploded in may last year after a seven week buying freeze over lockdown house prices soared 8 9 per cent in the year to april according to the ons as buyers battled to complete purchases after the chancellor announced a stamp duty holiday to save buyers thousands of pounds figures from nationwide show house price up by an even greater amount with annual property inflation to june running at 13 4 per cent and adding 29 000 to the cost of the average home which reached 245 432 and last month a record 37 per cent of properties sold received offers from three or more buyers according to estate agent hamptons this was up from 19 per cent in april this is owing to the fact that there is limited stock on the market because of the reduction in stamp duty thresholds and people are desperate to move zara banday slater heelis yorkshire and the humber remains the most competitive market where more than half of homes sold in june had three or more offers property agents told us that gazumping had become rife in chesterfield and sheffield with outbid viewers returning later to give increased offers directly to the homeowner zara banday head of residential property at law firm slater heelis says gazumping has never been worse in the past decade the practice has increased and more so in the past 18 months this is owing to the fact that there is limited stock on the market because of the reduction in stamp duty thresholds and people are desperate to move to benefit from the stamp duty saving she adds being gazumped can be extremely disappointing for clients and costly because they have often spent money on searches surveys mortgage arrangement fees and incurred legal fees if a client is gazumped then unfortunately there is no obligation on the seller to reimburse the buyer for their loss ms banday says people are crying out for change to the current legislation which allows buyers and sellers to pull out of the sale risking losses of thousands of pounds with no comeback however she says she cannot see changes any time soon she says a new law would need to have caveats to stop punishing buyers who had to pull out of a sale for genuine reasons such as redundancy david hollingworth from mortgage broker l c says most people would support a ban on gazumping so they know where they stand when buying or selling property by making gazumping illegal it would remove the uncertainty craig hedges who works for online estate agency yopa in the west midlands says he had not known a buyer to be gazumped for years until recently he says i have been working on the sale of a property since august last year the sale was agreed at 180 000 and on what was the proposed day of exchange and completion a neighbour walked by and asked the family how much they sold it for this neighbour then went on to offer 15 000 more on the spot the vendors agreed and pulled out of the existing sale i had to find an extra 10 000 shocked by the system abbey robb had to find another 10 000 after a gazumper forced up the price of her dream property therapist abbey robb 42 was forced to find another 10 000 after a gazumper forced up the price of her dream property it had taken 18 months to find the 450 000 four bedroom maisonette with a big back garden in limehouse east london her initial offer of 430 000 was turned down so she increased it to 445 000 which was accepted she wasted no time in instructing a solicitor and booking surveys but a few days later the agent told her to hold fire as someone else had offered a lot more abbey who lives in colliers wood south west london says i was shocked i am from australia where this does not happen offers are binding as soon as they are agreed and if you pull out you face penalties her revised offer of 455 000 was accepted and she is now nervously waiting to exchange contracts she adds it crosses my mind that i could be gazumped again james edge 39 was stung by a gazumper just weeks ago he and partner susan helby 41 offered the asking price of 350 000 on a two bedroom end of terrace cottage near winchester which was accepted he then secured a mortgage with a non refundable fee of 1 000 and instructed a conveyancing firm and surveyor however a week later the agent called him and said a previous viewer had offered 360 000 and asked james to reconsider his price he decided to stick to his initial bid and the seller accepted the higher offer james head of engineering at a consultancy says it felt inappropriate and unethical we had an agreement in writing it was frustrating but the agent told me nobody had done anything wrong david carter and his wife kaya 36 made the decision to sell their home in manchester in september and move to sheffield to be closer to family and good schools for their two children reuben six and phoenix one they had found their dream home a stone fronted three bedroom semi detached house and the seller accepted their offer of 280 000 david 32 moved quickly and even dropped the asking price of their home to speed up the sale but in march when the family were ready to move the estate agent rang to say the seller had sold the house to a buyer who had offered 25 000 more the carters sold their home anyway put their belongings in storage and have now moved in with kaya s parents while they wait to exchange on another property david a technology developer says i do find myself waiting for a call from the estate agent to tell me the property s gone to someone else it is massively unsettling and you end up not trusting anyone another reader who did not want to be named saw her property purchase fall through the day before the contracts were due to be exchanged in january by this point she had spent 4 000 on solicitors fees surveys and other charges and had remortgaged her house to raise 90 000 to put towards buying the 215 000 three bed semi the mother of two who works as a nurse was gazumped by a buyer who offered 30 000 more than she had for the house in taunton somerset she says i cannot believe how unethical this practice is and it has really affected me i have gone through so much agony and this is so wrong how can people get away with ruining someone else s life it needs to stop peter pert was really hoping to move on a year after his 31 year marriage ended and the death of his mother in january he fell in love with a semi detached bungalow in broadstairs kent and put in an offer of 340 000 15 000 above the asking price which was accepted but the next morning the estate agent told him a higher offer had gone through and asked if he could raise his peter who works in property maintenance could not and as a result he lost the sale and the buyers of his own house he says i m deeply deeply upset and my fingers have been badly burnt by this experience a government spokesman says it has been considering introducing reservation agreements since 2019 this would ensure a commitment at the point of agreeing the sale and a penalty if either side pull out it has carried out a first phase of research and is now looking at trials a spokesman says we intend to trial the use of reservation agreements where both buyers and sellers make a commitment to the transaction at the point of offer to reduce the fall through rate while this work paused over the past year owing to the pandemic we are now in discussion with the property industry about how best to restart this work and will announce further details in due course

zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz on may 20 2021 president biden signed an executive order on climate related financial risk which outlines various initiatives to promote policies related to physical and transition risks associated with climate change and to prioritize federal investments in support of those policies in this alert we focus on key aspects of the order that could have implications for private equity funds and areas of consideration for asset managers as a whole the executive order addresses five broad priorities develop a government wide strategy for mitigating climate related financial risk encourage financial regulators to assess climate related financial risk encourage consideration of climate related financial risks related to life savings and pensions modernize federal lending underwriting and procurement practices by incorporating climate related financial risks and reduce the risk of climate change to the federal budget various federal entities are directed to develop strategies and prepare reports in furtherance of these goals while the executive order has no immediate impact on the rules governing financial markets it signals a shift in federal priorities that could create opportunities for private equity in the future implications of the executive order for private equity climate related financial risk strategy the executive order calls for development of a government wide climate risk strategy the strategy must address the measurement assessment mitigation and disclosure of climate related financial risk to federal government programs assets and liabilities the strategy also must identify financing needs associated with achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions for the u s economy by 2050 and opportunities for public and private investments to meet those financing needs the director of the national economic council and the national climate advisor must coordinate with the secretary of the treasury and the director of the office of management and budget to develop the strategy by september 17 2021 120 days after the date of the executive order such a broad based climate risk strategy could present opportunities for private equity to target companies that can contribute to the goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 according to 2019 figures released by the environmental protection agency the totality of united states greenhouse gas emissions can be traced to five sectors transportation electricity generation industry commercial residential and agriculture these five sectors are responsible for 29 25 23 13 and 10 of national greenhouse gas emissions respectively in the industrial sector alone the cement and steel industries each contribute approximately 8 to global greenhouse gas emissions climate related innovation in all five of these sectors is increasing rapidly aided by substantial growth in private equity investment in technology companies that have developed or are in the process of developing carbon neutral or less carbon intensive alternatives to activities that are traditionally carbon intensive for example numerous funds seek to invest specifically in environmental and cleantech companies with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through innovative technologies in addition blackrock and vanguard recently became signatories of the net zero asset managers initiative which unites asset managers around the goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner these investment strategies and commitments are aligned with the goals of a federal climate related financial strategy and private equity funds with similar approaches should be well positioned to take advantage of any new opportunities that arise from the executive order potential impact on pension funds the executive order directs the secretary of labor to take several actions that could facilitate more retirement plan investments in private investment funds and other investment vehicles with strategies that promote or focus on environmental social and governance esg related goals the executive order includes a general directive to identify agency actions that could be taken under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the federal employees retirement system act of 1986 to protect retirement savings and pensions from the threats of climate related financial risk additionally the executive order directs the secretary of labor to consider proposing a rule by september 2021 to suspend revise or rescind two esg related rules adopted by the department of labor dol under the trump administration the 2020 rules the 2020 rules generally require erisa plan fiduciaries to make plan investment and proxy voting decisions based solely on consideration of pecuniary factors and prohibit them from making such decisions based on non pecuniary considerations e g esg type factors except in very limited circumstances in part because the 2020 rules and confusion about the 2020 rules had a chilling effect on the appropriate integration of esg factors in erisa plan investment decisions the dol announced in march that it would not enforce the 2020 rules until further guidance is issued notwithstanding the dol s non enforcement statement the 2020 rules have not actually been rescinded and additional rulemaking could provide some welcome clarity on these issues rescinding or substantially revising the 2020 rules could mitigate confusion and fears surrounding investing based on esg factors and goals and encourage more erisa plan fiduciaries to incorporate esg investments into their portfolios however the nature and impact of any future dol action is unknown at this time the executive order also directs the dol to submit a report to the president on its actions in response to the executive order within 180 days so we may have additional insight into the dol s direction by november of this year assessment of climate related financial risk by financial regulators the executive order directs the financial stability oversight council fsoc to consider taking a number of actions including issuing a report on any efforts by fsoc member agencies to integrate consideration of climate related financial risk into their policies and programs this report would discuss among other things the necessity of any actions to enhance climate related disclosures by regulated entities to reduce climate related financial risk to the financial system and any other recommendations for mitigating such risk through new or revised regulatory standards although the order only directs the fsoc to consider issuing the report we expect to see a report that addresses most if not all of the topics identified in the executive order by november 16 2021 the deadline imposed in the order the emphasis on climate related disclosures is consistent with efforts already underway at the sec to develop proposals for mandatory climate change disclosure requirements that would apply to public companies federal lending underwriting and procurement the executive order includes several directives related to government contracting and lending by federal agencies it seeks recommendations for the integration of climate related financial risk information into federal financial management and financial reporting especially as that risk relates to federal lending programs the order also calls for consideration of changes to federal procurement rules that would i require major federal suppliers to publicly disclose greenhouse gas emissions and climate related financial risk and ii give preference to suppliers with a lower social cost of greenhouse gas emissions additionally federal agencies must integrate climate related financial risk into their own procurement processes with the increase in infrastructure focused private equity funds and the expansion of investment mandates of existing private equity funds asset managers will need to follow these potential regulatory changes in connection with the development of their investment thesis and the assessment of specific investments in the infrastructure vertical distribution and procurement verticals and other ancillary verticals that interact with the federal government on a commercial basis looking ahead the executive order does not create any immediately enforceable rules but it does chart a course for greater emphasis on climate related risk considerations in federal financial policy reports that are required or suggested by the order will shed additional light on the potential longer term impact of this policy shift on the financial markets and regulated entities while many of the priorities covered by the order will not affect the asset management industry we believe that development of a more climate focused federal financial strategy and potential related changes to the erisa rules could create opportunities for private equity firms that are prepared to take advantage of these shifts in policy proskauer will continue to track significant regulatory changes with a focus on the implications and opportunities for private equity funds and we encourage asset managers to monitor developments in this area see white house

as calendar year end companies received shareholder proposals for their 2021 annual meetings they faced a variety of uncertainties and challenges including navigating the covid 19 pandemic addressing the racial inequities brought to the fore by the killings of george floyd and others and steering through a hyper partisan and unprecedented u s presidential transition the shareholder proposals received by companies reflected many of these broad themes unlike in the prior three years the staff of the division of corporation finance staff of the u s securities and exchange commission sec did not issue new guidance regarding companies ability to exclude shareholder proposals from their proxy statements heading into the 2021 season although this may have hinted at some stability in the no action process that was not to be the case the staff issued significantly fewer no action response letters than in previous years opting instead to respond mostly through informal decisions that were included in a chart on the sec s website because these informal responses provided the staff s conclusions without additional explanation the staff s reasoning in a number of decisions was unclear nevertheless whether by response letter or chart entry there were a number of notable no action decisions and trends as in prior years many of these concerned the ability to exclude proposals as relating to a company s ordinary business in addition some related to procedural items that might have seemed fairly straightforward reviewing the guideposts provided by staff decisions from the 2021 proxy season helps in attempting to understand the staff s current approach to shareholder proposals despite increased success of board analyses numbers do not tell the full story building on past experience the number of no action requests containing a board analysis increased slightly year over year and the number of such requests granted increased significantly based on informal responses it appears that companies successfully used board analyses in no action requests under the ordinary business relevance and substantial implementation exclusions during the 2021 proxy season 1 as described below however most of these successful requests followed paths carved in the 2020 proxy season and broke little new ground also as in prior years the staff denied some requests for no action relief despite the presence of a board analysis serving as a reminder that even a well informed board analysis will not always carry the day ordinary business in two instances the staff concurred with a company s view that a proposal could be excluded as ordinary business and while the no action request contained a board analysis it was not obvious that a board analysis was necessary for relief and the staff s charted responses did not indicate whether the board analysis impacted the staff s view in two other instances the staff concurred with ordinary business arguments containing a board analysis to exclude proposals requesting a report on the potential risks associated with omitting the terms viewpoint and ideology from the company s equal employment opportunity policies the staff did not issue no action letters in these instances but the companies arguments aligned with those from a successful no action request in the 2020 proxy season in which the staff issued a no action response letter citing the company s board analysis it may be the case that the staff will not issue formal no action responses when a board analysis included in a request aligns with one it previously found persuasive relevance it continues to be the case that most of the successful board analyses under the relevance grounds for exclusion relate to proposals that may not be widely applicable for instance in the 2020 proxy season one of the successful relevance board analyses related to wild animal displays this proxy season the successful board analysis involved a large insurance company arguing to exclude a proposal requesting a report on how the company could reduce the potential for racist police brutality through its products after demonstrating that the proposal s subject matter was not economically significant to the company the company submitted an analysis from its nominating and corporate governance committee that concluded the proposal was not otherwise significant to the company the committee s analysis noted among other factors that the proposal s significance to the company s business was not apparent on its face and that shareholders had not previously raised the issue in the proposal the staff responded without a letter granting relief under the relevance exclusion in a contrasting example a large financial institution unsuccessfully argued that a proposal seeking disclosure of the company s lobbying payments was not relevant to the company s business as above after explaining that the proposal s subject matter was not economically significant to the company the company submitted an analysis from its nominating and corporate governance committee that concluded the proposal was not otherwise significant to the company noting that shareholder support for similar proposals had declined from approximately 30 of votes cast in 2017 to approximately 15 in 2020 in a previous season the staff denied a relevance argument by the same company for a similar proposal noting at the time that the company s board analysis failed to adequately address prior voting results again the staff denied the request this time without issuing a letter substantial implementation the majority of no action letters granted during the 2021 proxy season that included a board analysis were granted under the substantial implementation exclusion staff guidance on board analyses had not indicated that a board analysis could be helpful outside the ordinary business or relevance grounds for relief but the staff opened the door to this approach in the 2020 season to date all of the successful examples of a board analysis used to support a substantial implementation argument relate to proposals seeking a review of how a company could implement the business roundtable s statement on the purpose of a corporation in the 2020 proxy season the staff issued a response letter granting relief under the substantial implementation basis where the company noted that its nominating and corporate governance committee concluded that no additional actions or assessments were required to implement the proposal while that request also featured a robust ordinary business argument many of the successful no action requests on this proposal topic in the 2021 proxy season skipped the ordinary business argument and only argued for substantial implementation with the board analysis largely following the reasoning of the 2020 letter whether a board analysis can successfully support a substantial implementation argument for any other proposal topic remains to be seen notably the staff denied no action relief where a company sought to exclude a proposal seeking a racial equity audit arguing that it had substantially implemented the proposal and noting the conclusion of its corporate governance and nominating committee that the company had already taken the actions requested by the proposal ordinary business spotlight on significance in staff legal bulletin slb 14k the staff reminded companies and shareholder proponents that it evaluates a proposal s significance under the ordinary business exclusion on a company specific basis and a policy issue that is significant to one company may not be significant to another in doing so the staff explicitly rejected the notion of universally significant topics in a proxy season generating only a small number of no action letters it is notable that the topic of universal significance specifically came up in two response letters this serves as an important reminder to companies that regardless of any notion of the significance of a topic to society at large the relevant analysis is whether the proposal relates to a topic of actual significance to the company in one instance a large retailer successfully argued that a proposal asking for a report on the feasibility of giving paid sick leave as a standard employee benefit not limited to covid 19 related to the company s ordinary business and was not significant to the company the staff issued a response letter noting that proposals related to paid sick leave may raise a significant policy issue but the proposal does not demonstrate how offering paid sick leave as a standard employee benefit is sufficiently significant to company and citing slb 14k the staff does not recognize particular issues or categories of issues as universally significant in another instance a retail pharmacy company successfully argued that a proposal requesting a report on the external public health costs created by the company s retail food business was excludable under the ordinary business exception and was not significant to the company the staff granted the no action request without issuing a letter shortly before deciding the request the staff denied relief for a nearly identical proposal submitted to a large food and beverage manufacturer also without issuing a letter the proponent of the proposal at the retail pharmacy company requested reconsideration noting that the two proposals were nearly identical and related to many of the same products in denying the reconsideration request the staff wrote that while a proposal may raise a significant policy issue that transcends a company s ordinary business operations citing the no action decision at the food and beverage manufacturer the proposal at the retail pharmacy does not demonstrate how external public health costs created by the company s retail food business are sufficiently significant to the company the waning success of the micromanagement prong of ordinary business the micromanagement prong of the ordinary business exclusion experienced a resurgence over the past few years although staff guidance in slb 14k provided a road map for proponents to evade these arguments accordingly the number of successful no action requests premised on micromanagement declined in the 2020 proxy season this downward trend continued in the 2021 season with both the number and success of such requests declining as the staff explained in slb 14k when considering arguments for exclusion based on micromanagement the staff often assesses the level of prescriptiveness with which a proposal addresses a subject examples of proposals excluded on the basis of micromanagement from the 2021 proxy season include a proposal that would have required the company to include diverse candidates in the initial candidate pool for hiring for all positions at the company another that would reduce ceo pay ratio by a specified amount and another to prohibit equity compensation grants to senior executives when the company s common stock fell below a particular price interestingly the staff denied relief for a proposal requesting an energy company set reduction targets for the greenhouse gas emissions of its operations and energy products scope 1 2 and 3 the company argued the proposal impermissibly micromanaged the company by requesting it adopt greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and compared the proposal to past examples where the staff permitted exclusion of proposals seeking greenhouse gas emissions targets aligned with the paris climate agreement the staff denied relief stating in a response letter that the proposal only asks the company to set emission reduction targets it does not impose a specific method for doing so going forward it is not clear where the staff will draw the line between proposals prescriptive enough to qualify as micromanagement and those that are not allowing them to survive a challenge despite the guidance in slb 14k that micromanagement determinations focus on the manner in which a proposal seeks to address an issue rather than the subject matter itself decisions from the 2021 proxy season continue a trend from the 2020 season suggesting that micromanagement arguments may not be viable in the context of corporate governance proposal topics even with apparently prescriptive requests for example the staff rejected an argument that a proposal requesting a company amend its certificate of incorporation to convert from a delaware corporation to a public benefit corporation was overly prescriptive the staff also rejected a micromanagement argument where the proposal would have required a company to implement a policy that the initial list of candidates for new director nominees include nonmanagement employees some surprising procedural decisions although the 2021 proxy season saw an increased percentage of proposals excluded on procedural grounds in two instances with formal response letters the staff denied no action relief due to circumstances relating to covid 19 in one instance a company argued that a proposal could be excluded because the proponent failed to timely respond to a deficiency notice relating to its delegation of authority the proponent had submitted the proposal to the company by ups and email and requested further communications be sent to the proponent by email the company sent a deficiency notice to the proponent s offices by ups and did not receive a response within the 14 day period following delivery because the proponent s offices were closed due to covid 19 after becoming aware of the deficiency notice the proponent responded within two business days in denying the company s request for no action relief due to the lack of a timely response to the deficiency letter the staff wrote that the proponent s failure to timely correct the deficiency related to the covid 19 pandemic and the proponent s representative responded reasonably after discovering the notice the staff specifically noted that the proponent s initial submission requested communications to be directed to a particular email address but the company sent its deficiency notice to the offices of the proponent s representative via ups only and did not otherwise inform the proponent by email of the mailed deficiency notice in another instance the staff did not concur with a company s argument that a proposal was untimely when it was delivered to the company s offices six days after the deadline typically proponents must ensure a proposal s timely submission and delivery even one day past the deadline is sufficient for exclusion in its response letter the staff noted our decision to deny relief is based on the significant and well known delivery delays incurred by the united states postal service due to the pandemic and surge in holiday deliveries which were outside the control of the proponent interestingly the original anticipated delivery date for the proposal was only one day before the deadline whether this decision indicates a more generous approach to timeliness issues by the staff remains to be seen this letter also provided the staff an opportunity to comment on the use of email for proposal submissions the staff noted that while the proponent unsuccessfully attempted to submit the proposal by email the staff based its decision only on the proposal s submission to the physical address provided in the company s proxy statement on using email the staff stated to the extent a proponent faces obstacles to timely delivery to a mailing address beyond its control and seeks to submit the proposal by an alternate means not provided for in the proxy statement the proponent should first contact the company to obtain any approved alternate means for submitting proposals the proponent also should request that a company employee confirm that the company received the proposal given the proponent bears the burden of proving the date of delivery conclusion against the backdrop of the pandemic and social turmoil the 2021 proxy season was by no means ordinary the lack of staff response letters will create continuing uncertainty as companies consider future shareholder proposals nevertheless numerous developments including the success of no action requests containing board analyses the staff responses highlighting that proposal topics are not universally significant and the continuing if decreasing viability of micromanagement arguments confirm that companies should continue scrutinizing shareholder proposals to ascertain whether to include them in proxy materials _______________ 1 as a brief reminder the staff introduced the concept of including a board analysis to support shareholder proposal no action requests in staff legal bulletin no 14i specifically the staff indicated that a board analysis could be helpful to the staff in making determinations to exclude proposals relating to the company s ordinary business under rule 14a 8 i 7 or as lacking relevance to the company under rule 14a 8 i 5 one year later in staff legal bulletin no 14j the staff provided further guidance regarding the types of factors that a well developed board analysis might address in the next year the staff expanded its guidance on two particular factors of a board analysis in staff legal bulletin no 14k the delta analysis and prior voting results download pdf

could you strike black gold or profit from palladium as the oil price climbs and commodities are tipped for a supercycle here s how to invest and the risks after falling into negative figures last year a barrel of oil is back at more than 70 non energy commodities like copper iron ore and palladium have also soared some market watchers predict a supercycle a sustained period of rising prices so what might the future hold for oil and other commodities and for investors as the world economy roars back into action commodity prices are soaring after slumping into negative figures last year a barrel of oil is back at more than 78 its highest price since 2019 meanwhile tensions between big oil exporters including saudi arabia and uae could see prices rise further non energy commodities resources such as copper iron ore and palladium have also rallied since the start of 2021 the trend has led some market watchers to predict a commodity supercycle a sustained period of rising prices many investors will be wondering if this mini boom might provide opportunities to strengthen their portfolio of course the rising oil price has boosted energy stocks all of which had a hellish 2020 shell is now up nearly 14 per cent since january with bp up 27 per cent so what will the future hold for oil and other commodities and for investors we are used to hearing about oil prices but commodity markets are often a bit of a mystery for retail investors but it is simply any type of raw material on which the economy depends in an expanding economy demand for these rises as does their price when you look at what s happening in the world it s not hard to see why many people are expecting that to happen both china which consumes about 50 per cent of many commodities and the u s have seen a rapid return to economic growth when it comes to investing in commodities there is one vital difference from most assets unlike stocks and shares investors rarely own the actual commodities instead they tend to trade contracts which allow them to buy or sell an item say a barrel of oil at a set price in the future should demand keep rising they can sell the contracts to someone who wants oil and make a profit high demand non energy commodities resources such as copper iron ore and palladium have also risen sharply since january this kind of activity is almost entirely carried out by professional traders rather than retail investors but that doesn t mean diy investors can t benefit from rising commodity prices too one way is to purchase commodity based etfs exchange traded funds or etcs exchange traded commodities as with equity funds these essentially buy commodity options and package them as a single asset suitable for retail investors ishares physical gold etc for example is a popular option for investors wanting some exposure to gold in their portfolio and ishares diversified commodity swap etc invests directly in oil gas nickel and aluminium a 10 000 investment five years ago would be worth just 10 062 a reminder of the cyclical nature of commodity markets the fund has risen more than 25 per cent this year but its long term performance is very different a 10 000 investment five years ago would be worth just 10 062 a reminder of the cyclical nature of commodity markets a more common way to make money from commodities is to invest in relevant companies in last year s gold rally for example a clear winner was ftse listed gold miner fresnillo whose share price rose 70 per cent in 2020 while rising oil prices have boosted the likes of shell and bp for now their future isn t so clear cut the major hurdle facing the energy majors is the inexorable trend towards renewable energies says richard hunter head of markets for interactive investor but this doesn t mean the end of energy companies not least as both shell and bp have committed to going emissions net zero but it does create uncertainty black gold after slumping into negative figures last year a barrel of oil is now back at more than 70 its highest price since 2019 before buying into these companies investors want to know how effective and profitable their green transition will be mr hunter says bp s low carbon energy production has grown 1 per cent in a year an encouraging sign for eco conscious investors and fund manager william lough who runs river mercantile s uk dynamic equity fund says there are reasons to be optimistic about shell the company is very cheaply valued against the cash flow it produces even if the oil price drops slightly he says meanwhile their transition strategy is focused less on large capital expenditure and more on getting renewables to market shell plans to be more involved for example in the infrastructure for charging electric cars nevertheless both bp and shell remain significantly below their recent highs with their share price down 40 per cent in two years it s also a mixed picture for mining stocks ftse listed miners rio tinto anglo american and glencore are up 9 per cent 17 per cent and 30 per cent respectively since january their prices have been volatile though often plummeting 4 per cent in one day when commodity markets wobble the low values of energy majors and mining stocks mean they appear in equity funds often those focused on value investing river mercantile uk dynamic equity for example has holdings in shell and anglo american 10 000 invested in the fund five years ago would now be worth 14 800 artemis smartgarp uk equity backs both energy majors as well as three large ftse miners the same 10 000 investment would now be worth 16 900 if oil prices keep up their momentum both stand to benefit

jeff bezos becomes the richest man in history with 211 billion net worth as amazon shares soar after pentagon canceled jedi contract rival microsoft jeff bezos on tuesday gained 8 4 billion in net worth as amazon stock soared it put him above the all time record for wealth held briefly by elon musk bezos with 211 billion has left musk in the dust with just 181 billion amazon stock rose 4 7 after pentagon canceled contract with rival microsoft microsoft won the 10 billion jedi contract under the trump administration amazon cried foul and claimed trump interfered in the bidding process amazon chairman jeff bezos already the world s wealthiest man has set a new record for personal net worth by topping 211 billion bezos 57 gained 8 4 billion in net worth on tuesday alone according to the bloomberg billionaires index as amazon stock soared 4 7 percent on the pentagon s announcement that it is canceling the 10 billion jedi contract with microsoft it vaulted bezos above the previous record of 210 billion held briefly in january by tesla ceo elon musk who has seen his fortunes decline and now holds a mere 181 billion putting him in distance second after bezos while tesla stock has declined nearly 10 percent so far this year amazon shares have continued to soar adding 15 4 percent since january 1 amazon chairman jeff bezos already the world s wealthiest man has set a new record for personal net worth by topping 211 billion amazon stock soared 4 7 percent friday on the pentagon s announcement that it is canceling the 10 billion jedi contract with microsoft amazon s soaring shares have boosted the fortunes of bezos who on monday stepped down as chief executive of amazon handing over the reins to his experienced lieutenant andy jassy world s 10 richest men as of tuesday jeff bezos 211b elon musk 181b bernard arnault 169b bill gates 147b mark zuckerberg 131b larry page 115b sergey brin 111b warren buffett 101b steve ballmer 99 8b larry ellison 96 3b source bloomberg billionaire index advertisement bezos now takes over the role of executive chairman at amazon he still owns about 51 million shares of amazon stock a position that makes up the vast majority of his wealth his gains on tuesday broke the record for wealth since the bloomberg index began tracking billionaire net worth in 2012 making bezos the richest man in modern history adjusted for inflation historical figures such as the 19th century s john d rockefeller worth 350 billion in modern dollars could be considered richer deeper in history some historical leaders controlled wealth that is nearly incalculable mongol warlord genghis khan for example had a peak net worth that is estimated in the hundreds of trillions of dollars amazon stock rose sharply on tuesday after the pentagon canceled a contract with microsoft that was forged under the trump administration the contract has been on hold after amazon filed a lawsuit challenging the decision under then president donald trump alleging that the former president exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from amazon amazon argued that the deal was tainted by politics particularly trump s antagonism toward bezos who owns the washington post amazon said in 2019 the pentagon decision was full of egregious errors which it suggested were a result of improper pressure from trump the company cited a 2019 book that reported trump had directed the defense department to screw amazon out of the jedi contract the contract for cloud computing service could eventually have been worth 10 billion for microsoft instead the pentagon will pursue a deal with both microsoft and amazon and possibly other cloud service providers amazon argued that the pentagon deal was tainted by politics particularly trump s antagonism toward bezos who owns the washington post with the shifting technology environment it has become clear that the jedi cloud contract which has long been delayed no longer meets the requirements to fill the dod s capability gaps the pentagon said in a statement shares of microsoft and amazon both closed at a record high with the online retailer up 4 7 percent and shares of the software firm a penny higher michael pachter an analyst with wedbush securities said the absolute dollars involved 10 billion over a decade are at most a nice to have for the cloud companies with aws alone generating 45 3 billion in sales and 13 5 billion in operating profits for 2020 the real value he said was in showcasing the security of the clouds but it s not going to move the needle for either company ultimately the cancellation and new contract could benefit microsoft moerdler said because the redmond washington based company has had nearly two years during the legal wrangling to invest in its technology if there is now another competition microsoft is going in from a better position moerdler said advertisement as recently as september the defense department re

as the western united states continues to face a months long bout with extreme drought american farmers are feeling catastrophic effects to their livelihoods ron gibson manages 1 500 head of cattle in northern utah but may soon lack the resources to sustain his herd scorching temperatures and the absence of rain have created a depletion in feed supply for cattle farmers like ron with watering rights in his area cut about 70 in efforts to preserve the water supply more farmers are forced to outsource their feed and the high demand has driven up the price four times greater than usual when we look at the amount of impact that this kind of disaster is going to have on the country it s going to equal or surpass the amount of people that that were impacted by hurricane katrina he told fox news but unlike the immediate blow of a hurricane this kind of natural disaster drags throughout prolonged periods of time running its victims through the dirt more than 90 of west threatened by historic drought that may stretch through summer it s a slow moving disaster it s one that s been building gibson said i mean the effects that we re feeling today were pronounced when we didn t get storms this winter seven or eight months ago if farmers cannot feed their stock they may be forced to sell large percentages of their cattle at a reduced price how buy all those cows back gibson retorted at the prospect of selling cattle arguing that it would drive farmers straight out of business when they re out of business they re not coming back as the utah farm bureau president gibson is calling on the usda and congress to enact relief and to do so quickly he noted that it is local family farms that will suffer the most from this ongoing disaster describing them as being at their wits end historic drought in west brings plague of grasshoppers some people are telling us that it s since 1930 since we ve seen anything like this gibson warned john moore a fourth generation crop farmer from kern county california highlighted the misunderstanding lawmakers have toward the agricultural community in his mind heeding to some trump era water policies would ve changed the entire landscape of how farmers face droughts like these we have this incredible infrastructure in california for water conveyance moore told fox news outlining how water is collected from snowmelt in the sierra mountains and transported down into the delta region but according to moore outdated state conservation policies have diminished water reservoir access for farmers below the delta click here to get the fox news app the trump administration came out with new biological opinions which would allow more water to travel south of the delta he said obviously the trump administration and the california administration did not get along i think they like suing each other more than they like to have actual productive conversations and so that trump era decision has not been utilized to the fullest as a result farmers like moore have their water allotment capped at rates lower than many crops require putting several in dire straits when facing a drought of these proportions when asked what the biden administration could do to alleviate the water crisis moore advised that encouraging the state to make commonsense decisions and encouraging our governor to pick the right people to serve on our state water boards to serve as our water commissioner would produce meaningful solutions these government and governor chosen positions are really the levers of power and they re failing the california population specifically the farming population he said

dover del ap after being dealt a stunning setback by an appeals court federal prosecutors in delaware have declined to retry four former executives for the only financial institution to be criminally charged in connection with the federal bank bailout program in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis u s attorney david weiss said in statement issued tuesday that his office has opted not to retry the former wilmington trust executives on fraud and conspiracy charges weiss attributed the decision to the difficulty of obtaining new convictions competing public safety priorities such as violent crime and the opioid epidemic and finite resources the decision came almost six months after an appeals court panel in philadelphia reversed the convictions of the former bank executives for making false statements to federal regulators and ordered that acquittals be entered the court also ordered a retrial of conspiracy and securities fraud charges the january ruling was a blow to the government s case against former wilmington trust president robert harra jr former chief financial officer david gibson former chief credit officer william north and former controller kevyn rakowski the government s pursuit of mr north was misguided from the beginning and we made it clear to the government ten years ago that this case was an atrocious waste of time and resources north s attorney david wilks said in an email tuesday on top of that four innocent people s lives have been destroyed the four officials were convicted in 2018 of fraud conspiracy and making false statements the bank itself also was criminally charged but reached a 60 million settlement with prosecutors just as a trial was set to start wilmington trust s settlement included a civil forfeiture of 44 million and 16 million it previously paid to the securities and exchange commission in a related lawsuit harra and gibson were sentenced to six years in prison north received 4½ years and rakowski was sentenced to three years all four remained free on bail pending appeal prosecutors alleged that in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis the executives misled regulators and investors about wilmington trust s massive amount of past due commercial real estate loans before the bank was hastily sold in 2011 while bordering on collapse founded by members of the dupont family in 1903 the bank imploded despite receiving 330 million from the federal troubled asset relief program prosecutors said bank officials waived millions of dollars in matured loans from reporting requirements if they were designated as current for interest and in the process of being extended to ensure that loans well past their repayment dates were purportedly exempt from reporting requirements the bank lent even more money to struggling developers just to make the interest payments in the fourth quarter of 2009 bank officials reported only 10 8 million in commercial loans as 90 days or more past due concealing more than 316 million in past due loans subject to the waiver practice prosecutors said after a meeting to discuss matured loans and how to make them go away by year s end bank officials went beyond the waiver practice and decided on a mass extension that involved temporarily extending more than 800 commercial loans worth 1 3 billion prosecutors said in an email to harra north referred to certain loans as credit turds before its 2011 fire sale to m t bank wilmington trust raised 287 million in a 2010 stock offering intended partly to help repay the tarp funds while hiding the truth about its shaky financial condition from investors prosecutors said defense attorneys argued that the waiver practice had been in place for decades and was no secret they also maintained that instructions for filing reports with the federal reserve and for disclosing financial information in securities exchange commission filings were ambiguous and that the term past due was not clearly defined the appeals court agreed in ruling for the defendants that the reporting requirements were ambiguous in a separate civil action wilmington trust agreed to pay 200 million cash to settle a shareholder lawsuit alleging fraudulent concealment of billions of dollars in bad loans auditing firm kpmg agreed to pay an additional 10 million as part of the settlement separately a federal judge last year rejected a request by harra and north to dismiss a civil suit filed by securities regulators gibson and rakowski finalized settlements with the sec in 2019 agreeing to pay more than 70 000 and 44 000 respectively to the sec copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

of a regional cross border real time payments ecosystem real time payments are now as popular as cash as a payment method for consumers in southeast asia according to new research from aci worldwide

categories including digital wallets requiring cash or card top ups 56 and credit cards 30 this shift towards real time payments has been dramatically accelerated by changing payment necessities and preferences caused by the covid 19 pandemic almost a third 30 of consumers in southeast asia have reduced usage of traditional payment methods such as cash credit cards and debit cards since the onset of covid 19 as a result over half 53 are now using real time payments more frequently than they were prior to the pandemic due to rapid technological change consumers now expect mobile first and real time experiences however payments have often lagged the development of real time payment systems enables consumers merchants and financial institutions to pay friends and customers settle bills and

looking for further guarantees about payments to encourage them to do so more in the future almost a quarter 23 of consumers are shopping more at merchants based in other southeast asia countries since the start of the pandemic while a similar number 22 are shopping more in stores outside of southeast asia the most popular factors that encourage these shoppers to purchase products and services

the company planning to build the byhalia connection pipeline on friday announced that it is abandoning the project bringing a sudden end to one of the biggest environmental controversies in recent memphis history the project which would have put a crude oil pipeline through mostly black south memphis neighborhoods sparked a complex legal and public relations battle that was fought in multiple venues from the memphis city council to the court of national public opinion local opponents and celebrities such as al gore danny glover and jane fonda voiced opposition the former vice president visited memphis and called the project a reckless racist rip off opponents also raised concerns about oil spills and threats to the area s drinking water which is drawn from wells deep underground from the memphis sand aquifer the companies plains all american pipeline and valero energy corp had formed a joint venture byhalia connection llc to build the pipeline the pipeline was to have started at the valero refinery in south memphis on west mallory avenue traveled south across the mississippi state line and swung to the east before terminating in marshall county mississippi it was to connect two existing crude oil pipelines company representatives had argued for months that the pipeline could operate safely but the opposition was organized and in may the company had told city council representatives that it was putting the project on pause opinion why memphis black and brown communities have most to lose from byhalia pipeline environmental activists elated by news sarah houston is an executive with the environmental group protect our aquifer she said her first reaction to friday s news was that it was incredible we don t know if they ll come back or not but right now it feels like a fourth of july birthday present ward archer founder of protect our aquifer said he got an alert from a stock trading website that plains all american sent the sec a notice mentioning that they were abandoning the byhalia connection pipeline after confirming with a few colleagues he said he let out a sigh of relief the stars aligned for this fight he said sometimes the good guys win and this is one of those times kathy robinson co founder of memphis community against the pipeline said she was shocked that the fight did not last as long as expected i anticipated this to last as long as the keystone xl pipeline if i m honest robinson said a fight over construction of the 1 200 mile keystone xl pipeline had lasted for years and ended in june but i m happy when i reflect on my family history and future there will be one less industry in southwest memphis today there will not be a new entity poisoning us more not today justin pearson another environmental activist and a key leader in the pipeline fight spoke about the decision on facebook live we ve shown them that we aren t the path of least resistance we are the path of resilience the statement released by the company didn t mention the opposition byhalia connection llc announced today that it is no longer pursuing the byhalia connection construction project primarily due to lower us oil production resulting from the covid 19 pandemic spokesman brad leone said in a statement posted on a company web site national attention pete buttigieg said u s dot won t intervene in byhalia pipeline construction in case you missed it what s underway to try to stop the byhalia connection pipeline in memphis here s a guide u s crude oil production dropped from an estimated 12 25 million barrels per day in 2019 to 11 31 million barrels per day in 2020 according to the u s energy information administration oil production has dropped to an estimated 11 08 million barrels per day so far in 2021 but was projected to increase to 11 79 million barrels in 2022 the company statement continued we value the relationships we ve built through the development of this project and appreciate those that supported the project and would have shared in its ongoing benefits including our customers communities energy consumers landowners area contractors and suppliers pipelines continue to play a critical role in safely transporting energy products from where energy is produced to where it is refined and turned into consumer goods that benefit our lives as part of any shift to lower carbon energy hydrocarbons will continue to be a critical part of meeting increasing global need for affordable reliable energy legal fight will likely end it s a huge relief for our clients said amanda garcia an attorney with the southern environmental law center the center represented several of the grassroots organizations including memphis community against the pipeline garcia said she did not expect the company to abandon the plans but also acknowledged that community organizations and some elected officials have pushed back against the pipeline plans on multiple fronts even while garcia is relieved to see the plans for the byhalia connection scrapped she cautions that memphis still needs protections for the city s drinking water source further she said there is still a question mark over the usage of the collierville connection pipeline a crude oil pipeline that already connects the diamond pipeline and the capline pipeline for both of these reasons garcia is encouraging memphians and grassroots organizations to remain vigilant and keep pushing for stronger protections of the memphis sand aquifer we don t know what else is coming but i hope the message and the lesson that memphis takes from this experience is that they need better protection for their drinking water source garcia said the coming ordinance through city council remains important we need protection at the local level and memphians can do a lot to protect their drinking water source pipeline ordinance memphis city councilman jeff warren called the move to abandon the project a welcome one plains all american has my personal thanks warren said i am very pleased they made this decision it s going to benefit the future of our groundwater warren is a primary driver behind the city council effort to introduce a regulatory mechanism to control underground infrastructure that could potentially harm the overall health of the aquifer warren said he plans to push forward with what people are calling the pipeline ordinance we do need to proceed with our groundwater protection ordinance warren said the health of the aquifer depends on it investigative reporter daniel connolly welcomes tips and comments

randall chase associated press dover del ap after being dealt a stunning setback by an appeals court federal prosecutors in delaware have declined to retry four former executives for the only financial institution to be criminally charged in connection with the federal bank bailout program in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis u s attorney david weiss said in a statement issued tuesday that his office has opted not to retry the former wilmington trust executives on fraud and conspiracy charges weiss attributed the decision to the difficulty of obtaining new convictions competing public safety priorities such as violent crime and the opioid epidemic and finite resources the decision came almost six months after an appeals court panel in philadelphia reversed the convictions of the former bank executives for making false statements to federal regulators and ordered that acquittals be entered the court also ordered a retrial of conspiracy and securities fraud charges the january ruling was a blow to the government s case against former wilmington trust president robert harra jr former chief financial officer david gibson former chief credit officer william north and former controller kevyn rakowski the government s pursuit of mr north was misguided from the beginning and we made it clear to the government ten years ago that this case was an atrocious waste of time and resources north s attorney david wilks said in an email tuesday on top of that four innocent people s lives have been destroyed the four officials were convicted in 2018 of fraud conspiracy and making false statements the bank itself also was criminally charged but reached a 60 million settlement with prosecutors just as a trial was set to start wilmington trust s settlement included a civil forfeiture of 44 million and 16 million it previously paid to the securities and exchange commission in a related lawsuit harra and gibson were sentenced to six years in prison north received 4½ years and rakowski was sentenced to three years all four remained free on bail pending appeal prosecutors alleged that in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis the executives misled regulators and investors about wilmington trust s massive amount of past due commercial real estate loans before the bank was hastily sold in 2011 while bordering on collapse founded by members of the dupont family in 1903 the bank imploded despite receiving 330 million from the federal troubled asset relief program prosecutors said bank officials waived millions of dollars in matured loans from reporting requirements if they were designated as current for interest and in the process of being extended to ensure that loans well past their repayment dates were purportedly exempt from reporting requirements the bank lent even more money to struggling developers just to make the interest payments in the fourth quarter of 2009 bank officials reported only 10 8 million in commercial loans as 90 days or more past due concealing more than 316 million in past due loans subject to the waiver practice prosecutors said after a meeting to discuss matured loans and how to make them go away by year s end bank officials went beyond the waiver practice and decided on a mass extension that involved temporarily extending more than 800 commercial loans worth 1 3 billion prosecutors said in an email to harra north referred to certain loans as credit turds before its 2011 fire sale to m t bank wilmington trust raised 287 million in a 2010 stock offering intended partly to help repay the tarp funds while hiding the truth about its shaky financial condition from investors prosecutors said defense attorneys argued that the waiver practice had been in place for decades and was no secret they also maintained that instructions for filing reports with the federal reserve and for disclosing financial information in securities exchange commission filings were ambiguous and that the term past due was not clearly defined the appeals court agreed in ruling for the defendants that the reporting requirements were ambiguous in a separate civil action wilmington trust agreed to pay 200 million cash to settle a shareholder lawsuit alleging fraudulent concealment of billions of dollars in bad loans auditing firm kpmg agreed to pay an additional 10 million as part of the settlement separately a federal judge last year rejected a request by harra and north to dismiss a civil suit filed by securities regulators gibson and rakowski finalized settlements with the sec in 2019 agreeing to pay more than 70 000 and 44 000 respectively to the sec
