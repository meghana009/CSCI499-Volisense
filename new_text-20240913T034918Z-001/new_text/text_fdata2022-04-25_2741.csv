recognized as leaders in the field individually and our firm is both feared and respected among the defense bar and the insurance bar we are proud to have recovered billions of dollars for our clients and the classes of shareholders we represent abbvie s alleged misconduct abbvie is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies the company s revenues will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda would require additional safety warnings for rinvoq and would delay the approval of additional treatment indications for rinvoq and 3 therefore defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis as a result of the defendants wrongful acts and omissions and the significant decline in the market value of abbvie s securities abbvie investors have suffered significant damages what can i do abbvie investors may no later than june 6 2022 seek to be

aganorsa leaf has come a long way since it was founded in 1978 back then the company was known as tropical tobacco but that name was eventually changed to casa fernandez which it used until 2018 when the company was rebranded as aganorsa leaf the aganorsa in the name stands for agricola norteña s a an entity owned by eduardo fernández pujals that includes livestock tobacco growing and cigar rolling no matter what you call it one of the company s most popular releases has been supreme leaf which debuted in january 2020 at the tobacco plus expo 2020 trade show in a single 5 x 52 box pressed robusto vitola a second size was added to the line in july 2020 a 6 x 54 toro but it took another seven months for the third vitola to appear specifically a 6 x 46 corona gorda that shipped in february 2021 six months after that aganorsa leaf released a 6 x 54 box pressed torpedo during the 2021 pca convention trade show in august in february the company began shipping the fifth vitola in the supreme leaf line a 5 x 54 vitola that is somewhat confusingly also named robusto as is the case with the rest of the line the newest supreme leaf robusto is made up of a nicaraguan corojo 99 wrapper covering all nicaraguan tobacco in the binder and filler demand for supreme leaf continues to grow said terence reilly vp of sales and marketing for aganorsa leaf in a press release we selected a robusto vitola just as we did for the original release however we changed the ring gauge to 54 from 52 it s always interesting to see how subtle changes create different nuances in flavor and aroma we re excited to see how consumers react to this incredible expression of the blend the supreme leaf robusto has an msrp of 11 50 per cigar and is packaged in 10 count boxes that began shipping to retailers on feb 22 cigar reviewed supreme leaf robusto 2022 supreme leaf robusto 2022 country of origin nicaragua nicaragua factory tabacos valle de jalapa s a tabacos valle de jalapa s a

115 11 50 box of 10 115 release date feb 22 2022 feb 22 2022 number of cigars released regular production regular production number of cigars smoked for review 3 like the other supreme leaf cigars i have smoked the newest vitola is covered in a cinnamon brown wrapper that features a hint of red although quite a bit of mottling is present as well in addition there is a touch of oil all three samples are quite hard when squeezed and the box press and covered feet are nice visual touches the aroma from the wrapper is fairly light with a combination of dark chocolate generic wood nuts manure hay earth and soy sauce emanating from two of the three samples while the third adds both cedar and a floral note the foot brings consistent notes of orange peel leather barnyard nutmeg and peanut shells with some maple sweetness after a straight cut flavors on the cold draw are very distinct and include creamy cedar white pepper earth peanuts vegetal and dark chocolate with vanilla sweetness and touch of spice on tongue a blast of spice greets me as i take the first few puffs of the supreme leaf while an aromatic cedar flavor makes itself known early on as well while the spice begins to recede a bit almost immediately the cedar note continues to strengthen and is joined by a distinct peanut shell flavor both of which continue to top the profile during the first third additional notes of leather tack toast hay earth iced coffee and bitter dark chocolate flit in and out while the finish features some slight cinnamon and the retrohale includes both black pepper and maple sweetness in relatively equal amounts flavor is just over medium body is a solid medium and the strength hits a point just under medium but is obviously still increasing there are no issues with either smoke production which is massive off of the foot or the draw after straight cuts but two of the samples need corrections with my lighter one needs two in quick succession to stay on track the profile of the cigar becomes significantly creamier on the palate in the second third while the cedar and peanut flavors continue to be the main flavors the cinnamon on the finish increases noticeably secondary notes include not only more earth hay dark chocolate and leather but also new flavors of sourdough bread and citrus peel while black pepper and maple sweetness continue to dominate the retrohale albeit in about the same amounts as the first third flavor is now at medium full body is just slightly above medium and the strength has increased to medium plus construction wise both the draw and smoke production continue on their excellent paths and while two of the cigars two of the samples need minor attention from my lighter just about every aspect of the robusto in the final third is a continuation of the preceding third something i am absolutely fine with since i am enjoying it so much peanuts and cedar continue to reign supreme no pun intended i assure you on top of the profile followed closely behind by a combination of sourdough bread citrus peel leather tack toast hay earth roasted coffee beans and powdery cocoa nibs in addition there is still more cinnamon on the finish as well which combines nicely with an increased amount of both black pepper and maple sweetness on the retrohale flavor is medium full and the body is medium plus but the strength remains at medium plus finally while i am forced to touch up one sample twice to keep things from getting out of control incidentally the same cigar that had issues in the first third the other two samples burned fine and all three featured excellent draws and plenty of smoke until the end final notes it just so happens that i smoked the torpedo vitola in this same blend a few days before the first cigar for this review as a comparison the robusto is noticeably spicer on the palate in the first third while the torpedo is creamier and more complex overall in addition i found the newest robusto to be a bit stronger than the torpedo vitola albeit not by much i find it a bit odd that there are two vitolas in this line that are virtually identical with the only difference being one is a 52 ring gauge and the other is a 54 however even odder is that there is no indication on the boxes which both have robusto printed on them or the bands to differentiate the two releases printed on the end of the band are the words max y los cubanos which translates to max and the cubans according to reilly the max refers to max fernandez who helped blend the cigars although the burn was far from perfect on any of the samples each one needed at least one correction at some point there was never a point that i came close to thinking that things were getting out of control aganorsa leaf advertises on halfwheel the cigars for this review were purchased by halfwheel final smoking time was one hour and 51 minutes on average if you would like to purchase any of the supreme leaf robusto 2022 site sponsors atlantic cigar co cigar hustler and famous smoke shop all have them in stock on their respective websites 89 overall score i have enjoyed every size of the supreme leaf blend i have smoked and the new robusto only continues that trend main flavors of creamy cedar and peanuts are balanced excellently with a combination of ever present maple sweetness and black pepper on the retrohale interestingly there is a total lack of red pepper that i have noted in many of the other vitolas and the cinnamon on the finish was a brand new addition in the end the new supreme leaf robusto is not only an excellent cigar in its own right but also one of the best vitolas in the line

the fishing market globally was worth 253 billion in 2021 and despite the controversy that swirls around the industry that figure continues to grow today a startup that has built a platform to make the business of fishing more efficient and thus the process overall more traceable and less prone to waste is announcing a round of funding to ride that wave rooser which provides a marketplace for sourcing fish aimed both at those fishing and those buying for wholesale trade or retail has raised 23 million funding that it will be using both to expand into more markets and to continue building more functionality into its platform today the company s focus is on stock management providing tools to help suppliers manage this as well as to handle and track sales and assess the wider marketplace for their products soon the plan will be to incorporate more quality control tools supply chain finance personalization for buyers and sellers to connect more likely trades and further down the line the startup will also bring more business intelligence and analytics into the mix for its customers it currently has some 45 species on sale totaling more than 71 000 kilograms but does not disclose specific customer numbers apart from noting that it has more than 300 active users and has enabled some 50 000 transactions to date its business model is to take a commission on each transaction index ventures is leading this round with participation also from gv formerly google ventures and point nine capital as well as figma ceo and co founder dylan field and david nothacker co founder and ceo of freight and cargo startup sennder previous to this series a point nine and eos advisory a scottish firm based out of st andrews had funded edinburgh based rooser with just over 3 million bringing the total raised to around 26 million valuation is not being disclosed the crux of the problem that rooser is aiming to fix is that fishing is a huge and growing industry but it s been built on the back of major inefficiencies inefficiencies that have time and again proven to be disastrous for more than just businesses but for wider economic and ecological ecosystems joel watt the ceo who co founded the company with chief commercial officer nicolas desormeaux coo erez mathan and cto thomas quiroga saw this situation firsthand when he was running his own fishing business originally an accountant by training watt hails from the north of scotland with an accent my american ear sometimes found hard to penetrate to match and after years working for a big firm he returned to his roots and hometown to start a fishing business not a tech based marketplace and budding big data analytics play but an actual wet floors cold rooms and yellow boots fishing operation following in his family s footsteps with both his father and grandfather having also worked in fishing in nearly 10 years of operations he scaled that business to 50 people and 10 million in turnover and it was then that we started to see just how inefficient it was he said fishing business s greatest problem he said is uncertainty you have the boats and fisheries those turning the products into things you can eat wholesalers and distributors and then restaurants and fishmongers all of those need one to one communication but there are in reality many actors and many price points he said the market is massive 140 000 related business entities just in europe but typically those working without leaning on any platform to access wider customer bases and manage those relationships can only handle 20 contracts at a time no matter how much fish they have to sell on the subject of fish to sell that too is an issue there are 250 types of fish typically sold in the fishing trade but when you add in the range of sizes and other variables it comes out to what watt said was 35 000 skus and there is little consistency in pricing across that landscape no one knows how much anything costs add to that the many layers of people in the chain and stages that they each manage and the delays that brings into what is a highly perishable product and you have a messy situation for every two fish or other seafood items pulled out from the water only one gets eaten so watt did what any accountant who pivots into building and running a fishing business might do he started to look into software that could help manage the business aspects of his operation rooser is a word from the doric dialect used in watt s region of scotland and it means watering can a team member in my fishing business made a comment about how we seemed to always be fighting a fire somewhere watt said the idea is that rooser the software is now helping to fight those fires indeed that software called sea store was effective and others started asking to use it too buyers on the platform can source seafood from 13 countries although iceland watt said is the biggest sourcing country at the moment as for buyers france currently accounts for 95 of all sales france indeed is a very big market for seafood but it s not the only one boosting it as the main buyer was intentional on rooser s part he said we wanted to get fit in one market and then develop a supply side he said now we can easily move into other countries as we spread across europe georgia stevenson the index partner who led the investment said that part of the interest for index here was how successful rooser has been so far in addressing this particular vertical s needs and building a marketplace to match that it s enabling less wastage but it s also just empowering seafood traders to do their jobs better she said and while there have been plenty of critics lambasting the fishing industry for overreaching in their activities

regularly recognized as leaders in the field individually and our firm is both feared and respected among the defense bar and the insurance bar we are proud to have recovered billions of dollars for our clients and the classes of shareholders we represent abbvie s alleged misconduct abbvie is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies the company s revenues will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda would require additional safety warnings for rinvoq and would delay the approval of additional treatment indications for rinvoq and 3 therefore defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis as a result of the defendants wrongful acts and omissions and the significant decline in the market value of abbvie s securities abbvie investors have suffered significant damages what can i do abbvie investors may no

what has happened at disney is moral failure walt disney had a vision for wholesome family entertainment he was committed to the family the morals of the corporate leadership of disney today are in the gutter and they want to redefine family counter to god s original design and flaunt sin the son of late celebrity evangelist billy graham continued lgbtq activists are using corporations to force their agenda on the public and companies may want to take another look at what they are allowing to happen disney has gone too far the people of florida have revolted and it s going to cost disney big time disney had a special tax status in the state which they benefitted from in a huge way but because they came out against the parents of florida the governor and legislators have revoked that status franklin graham excoriated disney in this post shared to his facebook feed sunday graham also shared a snap of disney pride memorabilia in a facebook post which took aim at homosexuality graham shared a snap of himself in orlando and urged visitors to take in the city s other attractions while avoiding disney thank god for governor ron desantis who is willing to take a bold stand we need

further controversy after it was revealed he was drawing two salaries totaling 1 2 million from the billy graham organization and samaritan s purse on friday governor desantis signed a new measure into law that ends disney s special governing power over its huge walt disney world resort in orlando it had previously been allowed to run the area known as reedy creek largely free from government oversight on issues such as building regulations the rule could come into effect from june 2023 although there is still room for negotiation and one conservative lawyer says she believes disney could successfully sue desantis for violating its first amendment right to free speech disney found its power curtailed after it came out against desantis s so called don t say gay bill whose official title is the parental rights in education bill it prohibits public school instruction on gender and sexuality between kindergarten and third grade supporters say the bill which was signed into law in march stops teachers from pushing inappropriate content on children which they believe students may be too young to understand florida governor ron desantis has clashed with disney over its public opposition to his parental rights in education bill also known as the don t say gay law florida lawmakers have now voted to strip walt disney world pictured of its special self governing status which gives it carte blanche to build what it likes within its resort opponents say the bill is homophobic and that the vagueness of its wording could see a teacher reported to authorities for something as minor as mentioning their same sex partner in class disney initially stayed quiet on the bill but the firm which has long had a good track record on supporting its lgbt staff is said to have waded into the issue after being pressured by woke in house diversity factions now said to exert growing influence over bosses there ceo bob chapek later spoke out after walkouts by a small number of disney staffers and angered desantis by openly suggesting that his firm would apply pressure on lawmakers after blasting the bill he said as i wrote to our employees earlier this week we are committed to supporting community organizations like these so they are equipped to take on these fights meanwhile we are also reassessing our approach to advocacy including political giving in florida and beyond the controversy has hit disney s share price hard too as parents who back the bill or who were angered at the firm s sudden outspoken stance vowed to boycott it advertisement stocks have tanked by around a third in recent weeks and now sit at just 118 27 per share
real world evidence from more than 850 000 hospitalized patients provides clinical insights on the use of veklury remdesivir as stand of care covid 19 treatment new post hoc analysis of non hospitalized covid 19 patients in the phase 3 pinetree study demonstrates veklury treatment initiated within 5 days of symptoms reduced risk for hospitalization by 90 foster city calif business wire gilead sciences inc nasdaq gild today announced findings from two studies which provide further insights on the use of veklury remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalized and non hospitalized patients with covid 19 the first study is a retrospective observational analysis of the real world treatment data from the premier healthcare database consisting of 853 219 patients hospitalized with covid 19 across the united states this analysis found that more than 50 of hospitalized covid 19 patients received veklury predominantly in combination with other therapies an oral presentation of this real world data analysis will be given on april 25 at 11 a m western european summer time in hall p at the european congress of clinical microbiology infectious diseases eccmid 2022 a separate study which is a new post hoc analysis of data from the phase 3 pinetree study demonstrated that use of veklury within five days of symptom onset or between 5 to 7 days of symptom onset reduced hospitalizations in patients at high risk for severe covid 19 disease this post hoc analysis was presented as a poster l0447 at eccmid the observational analysis of real world data also found that as the pandemic progressed initiation of veklury within two days of hospitalization increased from 41 to 91 between may 2020 and december 2021 during this period as new variants arose and disease severity fluctuated median hospital length of stay los decreased from seven to six days with the greatest benefit in invasive mechanical ventilation ecmo patients 15 to 11 days while icu use decreased from 34 to 27 with the greatest benefit in high flow oxygen non invasive ventilation 66 to 52 overall icu los remained the same overall mortality rates remained stable at 16 with the greatest decline over time in patients on low flow supplemental oxygen 15 to 12 these results confirm veklury s position as a foundational treatment for hospitalized patients with covid 19 and signify the need to treat patients early before they become more severely ill with covid 19 in a pandemic real world analysis has a particularly important role in helping us understand how treatment choices are evolving over time as we work to discover the most effective treatment options for patients we ve long understood that antivirals work optimally for respiratory viruses when they are given as early as possible without delay this data confirms that antiviral treatment is now initiated sooner in hospitalizations and that throughout the pandemic remdesivir has remained the foundation for hospitalized patients with covid 19 said robert l gottlieb md phd baylor university medical center and baylor scott white research institute additionally as healthcare providers experience and confidence in covid 19 therapeutic options has increased so too has the use of therapeutic combinations reflecting the incremental incorporation of evidence based therapies the new post hoc analysis from a phase 3 double blind placebo controlled trial pinetree demonstrating that a three day course of veklury treatment significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization was also presented at eccmid the analysis assessed the variability of treatment effect with veklury by time of symptom onset and number of baseline risk factors the study concluded that veklury reduced hospitalizations in patients at high risk for severe covid 19 disease when initiated anytime within a 7 day window from symptom onset as expected with antiviral therapy the benefit was modestly greater the sooner veklury was administered patients treated with veklury within five days of symptom onset had a 90 reduced risk for hospitalization additionally patients who received veklury after five 5 days of symptom onset experienced an 81 reduction in risk of hospitalization this new analysis builds on the previously presented primary endpoint analysis in which veklury demonstrated a statistically significant 87 reduction in risk for the composite primary endpoint of covid 19 related hospitalization or all cause death by day 28 0 7 compared with placebo 5 3 p 0 008 no deaths occurred in either arm of the study through the primary endpoint the data presented at eccmid not only underscore veklury as the antiviral standard of care for covid 19 treatment in hospitalized patients but they also further emphasize that patients can benefit from veklury when it s given up to seven days after the onset of symptoms and that the benefit is greater the sooner it is administered said frank duff senior vice president virology therapeutic head gilead sciences as the pandemic has progressed and the utility of other treatments against new variants has shifted we are proud that veklury has remained the foundation for patients hospitalized with covid 19 gilead presented two additional studies from the company s covid 19 clinical and real world evidence programs at the conference data from the caravan study evaluated safety pharmacokinetic virologic and clinical outcomes of veklury treatment in pediatric patients who were 28 days of age and older the interim analysis of veklury in pediatric patients hospitalized with covid 19 with ages ranging from 28 days to less than 18 years demonstrated that veklury was generally well tolerated with a high proportion of participants showing clinical improvement and recovery overall no new safety findings for veklury were noted in the study 75 and 85 showed clinical improvement 2 point increase on the ordinal scale at day 10 and last assessment respectively while 60 and 83 were discharged by day 10 and day 30 respectively overall 38 patients 72 experienced aes with 11 patients 21 experiencing serious adverse events saes that were determined not to be study drug related including 3 participant deaths which were consistent with the patients underlying medical condition prior to study entry or with covid 19 disease during hospitalization a real world evidence analysis evaluated data from 2 310 patients hospitalized with covid 19 who had previously undergone kidney transplantation the analysis found that in this patient population overall mortality was comparable to the general population hospitalized with covid 19 but markedly increased for those with diminished renal function comorbidities and higher oxygen requirements upon admission insights from this study help inform clinical decision making in the context of management of kidney transplant patients and other solid organ transplant recipients alike about veklury veklury remdesivir is a nucleotide analog invented by gilead building on more than a decade of the company s antiviral research veklury is a foundation for the treatment of hospitalized patients with covid 19 and is a recommended treatment for reducing disease progression in non hospitalized patients at high risk of disease progression veklury has an established safety profile and minimal drug interactions in diverse populations at this time more than half of patients hospitalized with covid 19 in the united states are treated with veklury it can help reduce disease progression across a spectrum of disease severity and enable patients to recover faster freeing up limited hospital resources and saving healthcare systems money veklury was approved by the fda in october 2020 for adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg for the treatment of covid 19 requiring hospitalization in january 2022 the fda approved a supplemental nda to expand the indication to

least 40 kg with positive results of direct sars cov 2 viral testing who are hospitalized or not hospitalized and have mild to moderate covid 19 and are at high risk for progression to severe covid 19 including hospitalization or death veklury should only be administered in settings in which health care providers have immediate access to medications to treat a severe infusion or hypersensitivity reaction such as anaphylaxis and the ability to activate the emergency medical system ems as necessary veklury must be administered by intravenous infusion veklury is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to veklury or any of its components for more information please see the u s full prescribing information available at www gilead com u s important safety information for veklury contraindication veklury is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions to veklury or any of its components warnings and precautions hypersensitivity including infusion related and anaphylactic reactions hypersensitivity including infusion related and anaphylactic reactions has been observed during and following administration of veklury most occurred within one hour monitor patients during infusion and observe for at least one hour after infusion is complete for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity as clinically appropriate symptoms may include hypotension hypertension tachycardia bradycardia hypoxia fever dyspnea wheezing angioedema rash nausea diaphoresis and shivering slower infusion rates maximum infusion time up to 120 minutes can potentially prevent these reactions if a severe infusion related hypersensitivity reaction occurs immediately discontinue veklury and initiate appropriate treatment see contraindications increased risk of transaminase elevations transaminase elevations have been observed in healthy volunteers and in patients with covid 19 who received veklury these elevations have also been reported as a clinical feature of covid 19 perform hepatic laboratory testing in all patients see dosage and administration consider discontinuing veklury if alt levels increase to 10x uln

houses in huntington beach orange county is the first southern california county to have a median home price of 1 million the median home price in orange county reached 1 million last month becoming the first southern california county to ever hit that pricey mark and underscoring just how expensive the region has become the threshold was crossed when the orange county median sales price for new and existing houses condos and townhomes rose from 985 000 in february to 1 020 000 in march according to data released this week by researcher dqnews it constitutes a 22 jump in median price from a year prior million dollar homes spread rapidly throughout southern california during the pandemic becoming commonplace in communities once thought to be relatively affordable like highland park and west adams in los angeles county the median price in los angeles county rose to 840 000 in march up 12 from a year earlier advertisement the orange county milestone marks a momentous rise in wealth at least on paper for local homeowners but it comes as a regionwide lack of affordable housing has pushed people into homelessness and caused others to leave the state in search of shelter they can afford according to a recent survey from the public policy institute of california 64 of california adults view housing affordability as a big problem with more than half of adults saying they are concerned they won t have enough money to pay their rent or mortgage the 1 million home boom has been driven by several factors an intense shortage of housing has sparked brutal bidding wars that push prices far above asking investors are also gobbling up more homes to flip or rent out accounting for roughly a quarter of southern california home sales another major reason for the swift rise in 1 million homes is the fact that more people can afford such a high price rising incomes a booming stock market and mortgage interest rates that fell below 3 during the pandemic opened up the 1 million possibility to a wider pool of buyers if borrowers put 20 down and had minimal debts they had a very good shot at getting a loan for a 1 million house if they made at least 150 000 annually in orange county home to many high paying technology healthcare and finance jobs the median household income in 2020 was 94 441 and nearly 30 of households made at least 150 000 according to a beacon economics analysis of u s census data business the great socal house hunt buying a home for the first time is one of life s sweet milestones though home prices were lower during the early 2000s housing bubble more orange county residents can afford a purchase today a reflection of rising incomes and lower mortgage rates back in the second quarter of 2006 the median price of an existing single family house in orange county was in the 700 000s a price only 10 of households in the county could afford according to the california assn of realtors by the fourth quarter of 2021 the median price of an existing single family house had already surpassed 1 million according to the association s calculations and 17 of orange county households could afford it the decadelong run up in home values means many homeowners are sitting on piles of equity enabling them to sell at a profit and buy a much more expensive house even if their incomes didn t rise it kind of feeds back onto itself said christopher thornberg founding partner with beacon economics equity gets traded into equity debbie felix an agent with seven gables real estate said many parents are also gifting their adult children down payments just a few years ago she said a three bedroom house in fountain valley went for about 900 000 but it s now common for such starter homes to go for above 1 million she is getting ready to list a three bedroom 1 633 square foot house in fountain valley at nearly 1 15 million it s crazy she said that house will probably go 100 000 over asking whether home prices in orange county and elsewhere surge from here is an open question mortgage interest rates are rising rapidly making the 1 million home a harder buy than a few months ago march data from dqnews represent closed sales meaning many buyers opened escrow and locked in their rates in february rates were rising then but were still more than 1 percentage point below today the average rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage hit 5 11 this week up from 3 55 in the beginning of february according to freddie mac in november rates were under 3 assuming a buyer put down 20 to buy a 1 million house the monthly mortgage payment including property tax and insurance would be 4 840 if the interest rate was 3 55 the average at the beginning of february at this week s average mortgage rate of 5 11 that monthly payment would be 5 574 an increase of 734 a month according to a redfin mortgage calculator the change will knock some people out of the 1 million price point and multiple real estate experts say they expect home prices across the market to rise at smaller increments now that borrowing costs are higher but analysts said they don t expect prices to fall citing rising incomes low inventory and the hesitancy for homeowners to sell for less than their neighbors did thornberg said orange county and the rest of southern california are relatively inexpensive compared with other major metropolises around the world given the area is home to major industries entertainment and beautiful weather home prices are going to continue to go up it s not a bubble thornberg said everyone has got to get used to it
existing economic analysis uses conventional open macro models to gauge the effect of exchange rate changes on the real economy but these models often ignore the role of the financial system empirical evidence has shown however that the exposure of firms and financial institutions to foreign currency assets and liabilities can also play an important role in the effect of exchange rate movements on the real economy bruno and shin 2021 calomiris et al 2022 how do banks foreign currency exposure affect their lending their borrowers investment and economic growth in recent work beck et al 2022 we exploit the euro depreciation of 2014 to gauge how this unexpected and exogenous exchange rate movement affected the lending behaviour of german banks the role of interbank markets firms investment behaviour and regional growth performance we conjecture that exchange rate shocks should affect bank loan supply when banks have foreign currency exposure on their balance sheets that is not perfectly hedged specifically a european bank with higher volumes of foreign currency assets than liabilities experiences an increase in net worth because of the us dollar appreciation corresponding to the euro depreciation and is therefore likely to expand credit supply policymakers therefore must carefully consider both the foreign currency exposure of the banking system and the distribution across banks when assessing the impact of exchange rate changes on the real economy the setting the federal reserve s tapering induced a sharp depreciation of the euro against the us dollar specifically between 2014 q2 and 2015 q1 the euro lost slightly more than 20 in value relative to the dollar see figure 1 this depreciation was largely unexpected for financial market participants as the difference in short term interest rate forecasts between the euro area and the us were relatively stable while it is impossible to attribute this exchange rate movement to just one single factor many currency dealers explained it by a rise in the dollar driven at least to a large extent by the gradual reversal of the quantitative easing policy in the us known as the federal reserve s tapering while the ecb continued its purchases of financial assets while german bank lending behaviour is highly unlikely to affect the stance of monetary policy in the us for obvious reasons the ecb s decision to expand its lax monetary policy was less driven by the german economic situation than macroeconomic fundamentals in southern europe iletzki et al 2020 germany is an interesting laboratory for studying the impact of this exchange rate movement on the real economy via the banking sector because the german banking sector had accumulated significant amounts of net foreign currency assets in the aggregate but with pronounced cross bank variation at the same time germany is an export intensive economy with one of the largest net export to gdp ratios in the world therefore exchange rate changes are likely to have significant real effects figure 1 the euro us dollar exchange rate over time note this figure shows the monthly dynamics of the eur usd exchange rate and of the trade weighted nominal effective exchange rate 1999 q1 100 around the depreciation episode of 2014 q2 2015 q1 data sources federal reserve bank of st louis and ecb data and empirical strategy we use two unique datasets one at the bank firm loan level and one at the region level the bank firm loan level dataset is at quarterly frequency and combines deutsche bundesbank s credit registry with firm level data from amadeus and bank level data from the bundesbank the latter also contains detailed data about banks foreign currency asset holdings the regional dataset combines data from the inkar database which comprises data on all 401 administrative regions in germany at annual frequency with balance sheet characteristics of local banks we estimate difference in difference regressions around the depreciation episode of 2014 q2 2015 q1 comparing the pre depreciation period 2013 q2 2014 q1 to the post depreciation period 2015 q2 2016 q1 our empirical strategy relies on the differential pre shock exposure of german banks to net us dollar assets scaled by total assets with banks having higher foreign currency assets being more exposed when studying the cross firm differences in credit allocation identification also hinges on the heterogeneity of firms pre depreciation balance sheet characteristics following the standard approach in the credit registry literature we further restrict our sample to firms with multiple bank relationships and include firm fixed effects to thus control for loan demand and isolate supply effects khwaja and mian 2008 we also distinguish between bank lending to firms and to other banks to isolate the effect of the exchange rate depreciation on the interbank market to examine whether the additional loan supply following the depreciation spills over to the real economy we complement these regressions with firm level estimations of credit growth investment and employment as well as region level estimations of gdp growth our region level regressions rely on a unique feature of the german banking system in that savings banks the largest of the three pillars of the german banking system are constrained to specific geographic areas and we can thus map their lending to growth in 401 administrative regions in germany results our analysis provides three main results first the euro depreciation encourages larger banks with significant net foreign currency asset exposure to expand their credit supply depending on the bank size definition we find a large bank with a one percentage point higher net foreign currency asset share than the median large bank has a 4 5 5 5 percentage point higher credit growth this compares to median credit growth of 7 1 between 2013 14 and 2015 16 second this increase can be explained by growth in loan supply to export intensive firms not to riskier firms and even more important by an increase in interbank market activity in particular large banks with significant net foreign currency assets raise their interbank lending to small banks without significant foreign currency asset exposure but with a higher share of exporting firms in their credit portfolio which in turn also allows small banks to expand their credit supply this is evidence that the exchange rate depreciation by increasing the liquidity of distinct tiers of the domestic banking sector can have sizeable economic effects even when local banks have low foreign currency asset exposure and are therefore not affected directly by the exchange rate shock third we show that exporting firms borrowing from smaller banks with higher interbank market dependence increase their investment following the exchange rate depreciation and that regions with local banks benefiting from this increase in interbank borrowing experience significantly higher gdp growth than less exposed regions in economic terms we show that more exposed regions grow by 1 3 1 4 percentage points more than less exposed regions cumulatively in the two years after the depreciation relative to the two pre depreciation years which compares to a median growth rate of 11 9 therefore exchange rate movements by shifting the composition of bank loan supply and increasing interbank liquidity can have sizeable aggregate implications in sum large banks whose net worth increased because they held higher net foreign currency assets increased lending including through interbank markets to smaller banks with a higher share of exporting firm borrowers this in turn resulted in higher investment by such firms and in regions smaller banks receiving more interbank loans contribution and policy implications our results speak to the literature on the impact of exchange rate changes on the real economy while there is abundant evidence showing that exchange rate depreciations can reduce firm investment and real economic growth when firms have foreign currency debt e g aguiar 2005 kearns and patel 2016 du and schreger 2022 kalemli ozcan et al 2021 only one study at least to the best of our knowledge looks at how the growth effects of exchange rate movements are affected by banks foreign currency exposure specifically agarwal 2019 shows that exchange rate depreciations appreciations can lead to an increase decrease in domestic credit and higher lower aggregate growth when the domestic banking sector has high net foreign currency asset exposure our contribution to the literature is that with the use of granular bank firm loan level data we can provide evidence for specific mechanisms through which exchange rate changes can affect loan supply i e through direct lending and interbank lending and link these mechanisms to real economic effects the policy implications of our research are that the effects of exchange rate changes are not limited to those predicted by standard models of open macroeconomics but are critically impacted not only by the aggregate balance sheet structure of a country s banking system but the efficiency of its interbank market policymakers must take into account these additional channels when assessing the impact of exchange rate changes on banking systems and real economy references agarwal i 2019 banks

top us officials visit kyiv as war casts pall over orthodox easter cookies with the us and ukrainian flags are set on a table before a meeting between ukraine s prime minister denys shmyhal and us secretary of defense lloyd austin at the pentagon april 21 2022 in washington dc kyiv ukraine the united states top diplomat and defence chief were in kyiv sunday ukraine s presidency said making the first high level visit by us officials since russia invaded its neighbour two months ago as fierce fighting cast a shadow over orthodox easter the trip by secretary of state antony blinken and defence secretary lloyd austin comes as the war enters its third month with thousands dead and millions displaced and as kyiv desperately sought relief for ukrainians trapped in the battered city of mariupol presidential advisor oleksiy arestovych said ukrainian leader volodymyr zelensky met with the us officials sunday as mariupol s defences were already on the brink of collapse and ukraine was in dire need of offensive weapons as long as there are no offensives there will be a new bucha every day he said in an interview on a russian former lawyer s popular youtube channel referring to the town where un officials said they had documented the unlawful killings of around 50 civilians maybe they can help arestovych added of the us envoys they wouldn t come here if they weren t ready to give weapons while the visit remained unconfirmed by washington and details were kept under wraps zelensky tweeted later sunday that the ukraine us friendship and partnership are stronger than ever the united states has been a leading donor of finance and weaponry to ukraine and a key sponsor of sanctions targeting russia but had not sent any top officials to kyiv while several european leaders had travelled there to underscore their support fierce hatred the highly sensitive trip by two of president joe biden s top cabinet members coincided with easter celebrations in the largely orthodox country our souls are filled with fierce hatred for the invaders and all that they have done zelensky said in a statement marking the holiday don t let rage destroy us from within as ukrainians marked a sombre easter with many braving bombardment for blessings russian forces showed no sign of easing their attacks five civilians were killed and another five wounded in donetsk on sunday the besieged eastern region s governor pavlo kyrylenko said authorities also reported a death in northeastern kharkiv the day before a missile strike on the southern city of odessa left eight dead and at least 18 wounded according to zelensky who said five missiles hit the historic city among those killed was a three month old baby girl zelensky said how did she threaten russia it seems that killing children is just a new national idea of the russian federation russia s defence ministry said it had targeted a major depot stocking foreign weapons near odessa attacks that upended the relative calm the city has enjoyed since the war began zelensky accused russia of being a terrorist state one that has devastated the port city of mariupol with weeks of unrelenting bombardment yet with thousands of ukrainian fighters and civilians in mariupol facing increasingly dire conditions kyiv invited moscow to talks near the sprawling azovstal steel plant where ukrainian fighters are still holding out

share facebook twitter linkedin pinterest with wheat prices already hitting a 14 year high this year more ohio farmers are now planning to plant more of the grain the war in ukraine and its impact on wheat exports is driving wheat to record prices leading more farmers statewide to consider planting more wheat as a result that s according to laura lindsey a field crops expert with the ohio state university college of food agricultural and environmental sciences cfaes lindsey a soybean and small grains specialist with ohio state university extension said she s already fielded numerous calls emails and twitter messages from farmers statewide wanting to know the feasibility of planting wheat this year and what they can do to take advantage of the record prices for the grain the main question ohio farmers have lindsey said is whether they can get wheat planted this spring to harvest this year and take advantage of the high wheat prices now or if they must wait for fall planted varieties while spring wheat can be planted in ohio lindsey said it doesn t grow as well as winter wheat is spring wheat an option for ohio farmers she asked yes we can grow spring wheat in ohio but spring wheat yield will be significantly lower than winter wheat yield while in ohio we usually plant winter wheat with the commodities market the way it is more farmers are saying they want to try and capitalize on the record prices however although wheat prices are high spring wheat is probably not the best option in 2022 due to the low yields high input costs and uncertainty surrounding selling the grain and its quality wheat prices are surging globally in the wake of the conflict between russia and ukraine prompting farmers nationwide to consider planting more wheat about 14 of the global wheat supply is produced in ukraine and russia according to gro intelligence the two countries supply nearly 30 of all wheat exports according to the agricultural data analytics firm wheat prices are surging even higher as the conflict is raising significant questions about the ability of russia and ukraine to continue exporting according to the u s department of agriculture s wheat outlook for march the price of wheat as of april 11 is 10 81 per bushel wheat prices reached a 14 year high last month at 12 09 a bushel and futures are over 14 u s prices have been particularly underpinned by this development with quotes for hard red winter wheat and soft red winter wheat commanding the largest price increases up more than 80 from last year as these classes are the most directly in competition with russian and ukrainian wheat the usda said in a written statement with russia blockading ports on the black sea 16 million tons of grain are currently stranded in ukraine according to a brief written by ian sheldon a cfaes professor and the andersons endowed chair in agricultural marketing trade and policy and chris zoller a cfaes associate professor and an osu extension agriculture and natural resources educator the usda is forecasting ukrainian russian wheat exports to fall by 7 million tons in 2021 22 with australian and indian exports only partially filling the gap sheldon and zoller wrote in the short run the expectation is that there are real limitations on the ability of the united states to meet the shortfall winter wheat is already in the ground stocks are low drought conditions are likely to impact yields in states such as kansas and farmers face an input price squeeze as it stands now ohio farmers are on track to harvest 610 000 acres of winter wheat this year up 5 from the previous year according to cheryl turner state statistician with the usda national agricultural statistics service s ohio field office nationally all wheat planted for 2022 is estimated at 47 4 million acres up 1 from 2021 despite the potential for lower yields some farmers may still be interested in planting spring wheat lindsey said ukraine is the breadbasket of europe but due to the ongoing conflict with russia and the instability in the region farmers are interested in capturing some of that market she said what i ve been telling farmers is if they are interested in wheat wait until the fall to plant winter wheat lindsey said to prepare for that now farmers can plant early maturing soybeans in early to mid may which are then harvested in late september to early october at that point they can then plant winter wheat this growing season will be a mixed bag she said corn soybeans and wheat prices are high across the board but input prices including nitrogen herbicides and fungicides are high due to the invasion which created further uncertainty for fertilizer costs and there likely will be shortages in supplies of these inputs all of which are needed for farmers to produce good crops with strong yields also you never know what the spring weather will be lindsey said ohio can be very wet in spring so there could be challenges there too she said however i think there will still be strong interest in growing those small grains for sure

investors are seeking high quality buildings in denver institutional investors still like denver but are pickier about what they buy than they were before the coronavirus seeking quality buildings and high credit tenants to entice them to part with their money in a recovering capital markets environment rife with uncertainty office and industrial sales in metro denver topped more than 1b in the first quarter of 2022 a marked improvement over the past two years according to data from cbre there are pockets of strength and pockets of weakness said john jugl vice chairman of the western region for newmark and regional lead of the denver office s institutional investment platform across all asset classes buyers are looking for high quality buildings particularly new ones as the flight to quality continues jugl said these buildings generally don t require upgrades right away allowing owners to hang onto more of their cash flow a crucial aspect in today s market where rents have stagnated in some segments keeping profits lower however longstanding creditworthy tenants can also attract buyers even in an older building that is what happened in the trade of 9151 east panorama circle in centennial which makes up a portion of the headquarters of arrow electronics the 223k sf building sold to san francisco based drawbridge realty for 106m or about 474 per sf tech and electronics giant arrow is one of colorado s largest employers and has a 10 year lease on the entire building we re laser focused on buildings typically leased to high quality tenants and which are strategically important to their operations in high growth innovation markets usually in suburban locations said mark whiting co founder chairman and ceo of drawbridge drawbridge s philosophy focuses on cities with population growth and research based economies whiting said meaning heavy concentrations of tech electronics defense and life sciences metro denver is one of a dozen or so markets around the country where we see the type of growth in human capital and the research based innovation economies that foster fast growing high quality companies he said the denver area s population growth has slowed in recent years when compared to the mid 2010s but is still moving upward at a rapid clip the metro area has gained more than 819 000 new residents in the last 10 years according to data from the colorado state demography office bisnow archive margaret jackson denver skyline this is the same strategy that drawbridge employed before covid 19 whiting said but it has become more important as the pandemic s aftershocks have jolted markets around the globe before covid investing in suburban assets wasn t getting much attention but now most capital sources will say they have a suburban strategy and fortunately that s where we re seeing most large corporate tenant demand today he said the denver area suburbs are certainly seeing their share of action said charley will first vice president with the capital markets team at cbre s denver office however he pointed out that the suburbs have three times more office space than downtown denver creating more opportunities for acquisition because of sheer inventory will has also seen a tendency toward newly built high quality buildings especially those that are well located with walkable access to retail hotels and light rail among other amenities there s not a big portion of office stock that checks all those boxes will told bisnow additionally investors are increasingly looking for buildings that fit into their environmental social and governmental standards still there are challenges in the marketplace with inflation ranking near the top of the list inflation typically benefits assets jugl said but the pandemic changed that this time around covid has decoupled inflation from asset values in an inflationary environment rents usually go up but that isn t happening he told bisnow the coronavirus s impact on real estate especially offices has tamped down rent growth in most markets so while it is more expensive to operate buildings than it was a year ago landlords can t charge more to make up the difference in their yields additionally inflation is slowly bringing an end to the period of record low interest rates that freed up capital during the worst parts of the pandemic the federal reserve has already initiated one hike of the base interest rate this year and is expected to continue raising rates in an effort to slow the country s record inflation the capital markets are well aware of the changes coming to the cost of borrowing jugl said and are expecting future rate hikes which gives them a chance to prepare and make decisions accordingly it s not like it s this hidden secret he said we know what s going to take place with the fed and it s going to be on the more aggressive side it s the environment we re living in still there s still a ton of liquidity in the market according to will who noted that real estate is still seen as a safe investment

a decade within two years heppner predicts as many as 50 companies eager to operate as a teffi could open an office in the town about 40 minutes north of wichita a teffi is different from other financial institutions because it only deals in alternative assets the kind that hold value but don t produce a regular cash flow and the legislation requires the bank commissioner to grant a company an operating charter without undergoing the usual examination to determine whether it is safe to do business with the company there are no deposits in a teffi so it is not fdic insured rep stephen owens a republican from hesston touted the new program in an interview with kake tv during an april 2021 news conference the sky is the limit when you re talking about anywhere from 10 to 100 million or up to a billion dollars over the next 10 years flowing directly into rural kansas owens said and folks this is not kansans money this is money coming from california florida hong kong russia anywhere beneficient announced in january it had facilitated 15 million for rural development in kansas by setting aside 2 5 of teffi transactions as required by law so far less than 1 million in cash has made its way into a charity heppner created to serve hesston another 2 7 million was delivered thursday to the department of commerce the rest of the funding may not be available for years senate president ty masterson a republican from andover and sen jeff longbine a republican from emporia who serves as chairman of the senate finance committee insisted in an april 7 letter to the bank commissioner that allegations made in the lawsuits are inconsequential they demanded the bank commissioner allow beneficient and the teffi program to proceed as intended a three month kansas reflector investigation explored heppner s business and the prospects of rural development through interviews with beneficient leaders financial experts hesston residents texas authorities attorneys and kansas officials a review of legislative hearings and records financial documents obtained through open records requests and public sec filings and documents from lawsuits filed in federal courts and the chancery of delaware i ve had many companies bought and sold heppner said in a jan 26 interview i ve sold my companies to the biggest banks in the world and there s always potholes in business as every business person knows and so while we don t see any now there s going to be setbacks there s going to be you know turns and twists and everything as you go along what is the catch in a jan 26 2022 interview with kansas reflector brad heppner describes the wild west of alternative asset transactions as a pawn shop for the rich you re haggling over how much is my asset worth heppner says screen capture by sherman smith kansas reflector the way heppner tells the story a phone call from his octogenarian mother convinced him kansas was the best place to launch his idea for a trust company that deals exclusively with alternative assets heppner 56 said he spent six years developing the framework for his business by negotiating with texas regulators the texas legislature however was too focused on politically charged issues like abortion and voting to consider granting him legal clearance for a novel venture he said south dakota looked like a promising alternative heppner frequently mentions how the state s lax regulations served as a beacon for credit card companies that now base their operations in sioux falls recounting a saturday morning phone conversation with his mother near the end of 2020 heppner said he told her he would need to move one third of his staff from dallas to sioux falls instead of shepherding 2 5 of transactions into a research fund for texas universities he would move the charitable contributions to south dakota parks mom said i gotta hang up because i got about an hour or two round trip drive it s icy outside i got to drive to newton to get groceries the grocery store the last one just closed down can t you get me a little bit of that money to reopen the grocery store here in town heppner said and that is when the lightbulb went off and i asked her right there on the call i said mom can you figure out and get me some meetings set up with legislators to talk about an idea i have and the next step was i actually flew up to hesston the next day the dillons grocery store in newton is 9 miles from his mother s house near downtown hesston kansas officials were thrilled by heppner s proposal to boost rural development by setting aside a slice of the action from wealthy out of state investors through a mechanism that posed no financial risk to the state heppner presented legislation that would allow him to operate a trust company that only deals within a volatile market providing immediate cash as a loan for high value assets that aren t traded publicly and can t be easily sold these assets are typically holdings in private equity or venture capital but also could be investments in private real estate natural resources or theoretically expensive art antiques and wine house bill 2074 requires a teffi to have at least three employees and 2 000 square feet of office space in hesston or any town with fewer than 5 000 people in one of 78 rural opportunity zone counties a teffi must designate 2 5 of transactions for charitable contributions one fifth of that figure goes to the department of commerce while the rest goes to a charity of the teffi s choosing there is no maximum interest rate for the loans a teffi provides in exchange for alternative assets and the transactions are kept secret the banking industry in kansas didn t want heppner to refer to his venture as a bank or trust so heppner settled on technology enabled fiduciary financial institution even though there appears to be nothing special about the technology involved profitability is not a factor in evaluating the safety and soundness of a teffi as long as it has enough money to conduct transactions there is no regulatory authority over it heppner said in the interview with kansas reflector it s like the wild west it is kind of like and i hate to use the term because institutions would not like it it s like a pawn shop you re haggling over how much is my asset worth individuals and institutions who need cash for their assets could avoid having to worry about paying accountants lawyers tax preparers and investment consultants to orchestrate the transaction heppner said they could instead count on the teffi to look out for their financial interests the small percentage they have to surrender for rural development would represent a cost savings he would only deal with individuals who have a net worth of at least 5 million heppner made his pitch to legislators in a march 22 2021 hearing before a house committee and again on march 29 2021 before a senate committee heppner presented himself as a sixth generation kansan and joked that he had to leave hesston to find a wife because everybody s related there he talked about his mother s struggle to get groceries calling hesston a food desert we think we ve thought of everything heppner told senators the regulator would not need to step in ever and oversee a failing institution lt gov david toland who also serves as commerce secretary told senators he had the same reaction to heppner s pitch as they did sounds amazing but what is the catch after meeting with beneficent and others to try to identify a liability to the state toland said we could not find one swallowed up a federal class action lawsuit claims heppner secured cash for beneficient by defrauding investors heppner s extensive resume in the finance world includes jobs at goldman sachs the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation and bain and company he has launched numerous businesses of his own including some based in bermuda heppner bought crossroads group which managed private equity and venture capital investments in the mid 1990s according to a 2018 story in the dallas morning news about his niche of providing fast cash for the ultra wealthy when heppner sold crossroads group to lehman brothers in 2003 five years before the banking titan collapsed the company managed about 2 billion worth of capital advertisement heppner founded beneficient management group in 2003 and beneficient holdings in 2010 the new enterprise intersected with paul capital advisors or pca after fortune magazine criticized pca for charging investors millions per year in management fees despite eliminating staff and closing offices while winding down its portfolio the magazine placed pca in its fee hog hall of shame heppner offered a solution he agreed to find a buyer who would pay 550 million in cash for pca assets valued at 500 million that buyer would be gwg holdings a minneapolis based company that bought life insurance policies from senior citizens a federal lawsuit filed on dec 23 2021 against gwg holdings describes a scheme in which the company gambled on when people would die the idea was to give seniors instant cash and take over their premium payments in exchange for later collecting on the policy according to legal documents heppner placed pca holdings in a trust managed by one of his employees the trust manager held a fiduciary responsibility to represent pca s best interests but instead the lawsuit claims repeatedly altered the terms of the sale pca only received about 150 million in cash after years of wrangling in the meantime gwg holdings agreed to purchase a majority stake in beneficient the 800 million deal coincided with the unexplained resignation of the entire gwg holdings board leaving heppner in charge of both companies kenneth kriz director of the institute for illinois public finance and a distinguished professor of public administration at the university of illinois at springfield described the takeover as a reverse merger gwg might have known that they had some upcoming legal issues to deal with and so one of the ways to inoculate yourself is to have your board go away and you basically get swallowed up kriz said so maybe beneficient was their shield from litigation the maneuver attracted the attention of the sec which issued a flurry of subpoenas beginning in october 2020 a class action federal lawsuit filed feb 18 accuses heppner of unloading 350 million worth of bonds secured by gwg holdings and sweeping the cash to beneficient before disclosing the sec investigation in november 2021 by then the kansas legislature had already passed the teffi legislation heppner also severed ties between the two companies leaving gwg holdings insolvent and investors holding worthless bonds gwg holdings filed for bankruptcy on wednesday a separate lawsuit filed march 4 by pca in the chancery of delaware accuses heppner of failing to deliver all of the cash he promised beneficient declined to answer questions about the litigation he who has the money david herndon the kansas bank commissioner appears jan 12 2022 before the house financial institutions and rural development committee where he expressed concerns about the fbi s refusal to conduct a background check on beneficient executives sherman smith kansas reflector kansas bank commissioner david herndon appeared before the senate financial institutions and insurance committee on march 30 2021 a day after heppner testified to outline unresolved concerns neither our office nor others in the bank and trust regulatory industry that we have consulted fully understand the business model used here herndon said the legislation blocks regulators from examining a teffi s profitability heppner s company wouldn t have to operate under typical rules for conflicts of interest or use standard accounting practices additionally herndon had discovered beneficient s parent company gwg holdings had an f rating from charles schwab there were questions about corporate structure and whether beneficient could provide an audited financial statement it wasn t clear herndon said whether he would have the authority to close the business as he does with other financial institutions to us this approach indicates an experimental concept which raises concerns for any financial regulator where conservative prudent measures are generally followed and it most certainly accents the reputational risk to kansas herndon told senators much of the discussion among legislators that followed herndon s testimony focused on whose constituents would be eligible to receive a portion of the charitable contributions from heppner s enterprise and other companies that would surely follow the committee then passed the legislation when longbine the finance committee chairman explained the teffi program in a march 31 2021 meeting of senate republicans which a kansas reflector reporter attended and recorded his colleagues wanted to know why the pilot program would be based in hesston longbine s simple explanation was met with laughter that s where mom lives it s kind of one of those deals he who has the money makes the rules longbine said in the final days of the session the house and senate gutted an unrelated bill replaced it with the contents of the teffi bill and forced a vote amid a torrent of other last minute legislation that was up for consideration the teffi bill passed the senate by a 39 0 vote but met some resistance in the house rep jim kelly a republican from independence and chairman of the house financial institutions and rural development committee tried to ease the concerns of lawmakers who were confused by the legislation i ve spent 50 years working for financial institutions and when i read the bill i did not understand it kelly said as he urged others to vote in favor of the bill rep rui xu a democrat from westwood said this was a rare chance for kansas to be the first state in the country to do something i ve spent the last two months trying to find a reason to hate this bill but really it represents very little financial risk to the state of kansas xu said and again this is cutting edge that comes with a certain degree of uncertainty i get that the only lawmaker who strongly objected to the legislation was rep john carmichael a wichita democrat who scoffed at the beautifully printed glossy heavy stock paper brochure he found on his desk that morning prepared by something called ben he pointed out that the 2 5 contribution to rural development could be written off as a tax break by the asset holders carmichael also recalled a lesson instilled by his father don t put yourself in the position to be the guinea pig these ideas go south more often than they come to fruition carmichael said we are taking a big risk with taxpayer money handing out tax credits and having the whole show run by a single company the house passed the bill by a 103 20 vote heppner in the january interview with kansas reflector said the texas bank commissioner learned about the teffi legislation on the day the kansas governor signed the bill the commissioner expressed his disappointment for missing out on such a lucrative opportunity heppner said i m not sure that s a correct statement said dan frasier director of bank and trust supervision for the texas department of banking in an interview with kansas reflector texas records show heppner submitted and withdrew a series of applications for a trust company between sept 25 2018 and nov 25 2020 frasier said the ability to provide audited financial statements is certainly one of the things that we look at and consider as part of the chartering process full speed ahead brad heppner says it is up to the community of hesston to roll up the sleeves and work with his beneficient heartland foundation to facilitate economic development he asked the community to dream big and contribute 4 million and secure a 12 million grant from federal pandemic aid sherman smith kansas reflector herndon renewed his concerns in a four page letter on april 10 2022 to members of a joint legislative committee established to provide oversight of the teffi program the letter said the bank commissioner still hasn t received audited financial records from beneficient the location of charitable contributions appears to be a mystery allegations in lawsuits of fraud and misrepresentation are alarming and the exact relationship between beneficient and gwg holdings has never been made clear in a separate email to sen tom holland a democrat from baldwin city who has called for an end to the teffi program herndon said the legislation doesn t allow him to suspend operations it appears to me the ball remains in the legislature s court herndon said in the email advertisement holland in an interview pointed to a dec 7 meeting of the oversight committee where republican legislators insisted herndon grant a full charter to beneficient without further delay in that meeting herndon objected to authorizing transactions before reviewing audited financial records from beneficient heppner described it as a chicken and egg scenario beneficient couldn t close the books until teffi transactions were processed and those transactions were contingent upon having a charter from the bank commissioner heppner said it would just take a couple of footnotes to finalize the financial records masterson the senate president and owens the representative from hesston balked at herndon s concerns about damaging the reputation of the bank commission or the state of kansas owens accused herndon of standing in the way of a potentially 9 trillion industry anybody that has done anything great in the history of this world has taken risk in most cases much more than just reputational risk in moving first in being ahead of the competition owens said they re taking much more enormous risk in the decisions they re making well above and beyond simply reputational risk and i m incredibly comfortable staking my reputation on the line in taking that risk herndon s office authorized the teffi s operations on dec 31 complying with a directive from the oversight committee to take action before the end of the calendar year the legislature should have known better when he told them on dec 7 that he still had not received audited financial statements holland said they should have said whoa time out stop the presses but no that wasn t good enough for heppner and masterson was like full speed ahead and owens was the same way beneficient handled 357 million in transactions for assets on dec 31 heppner said in the interview with kansas reflector stand by and watch hesston city manager gary emry says he is confident teffi funds will provide a grocery store in hesston within the next two years sherman smith kansas reflector hesston city manager gary emry said he doesn t even know what an alternative asset is and that he isn t interested in reading about the lawsuits involving heppner and his companies he just wants the grocery store in an april 7 interview in his office in downtown hesston emry said he has a fairly good pulse on the community fabric and residents of the town only have good things to say about their native son stand by and watch emry said there s been an awful lot of talk about a grocery store ok and i believe it s going to happen and i believe it s going to happen within the next 18 to 24 months maybe sooner but there are some components that have to be put together first at the time of the interview the beneficient heartland foundation hadn t received any money from the teffi beneficient responded to questions about the funding by providing a bank statement showing a 748 339 44 transfer was made to the foundation on april 8 legislators who touted the rural development aspect of the teffi never mentioned that beneficient s charitable donations could be designated for heppner s own nonprofit and they never explained the way transactions would actually make their way to the foundation or the department of commerce beneficient initially placed 2 7 million in cash into a trust for the department of commerce which couldn t access the funds then transferred the money to the agency after questions were raised for this story the company also provided financial statements that show the teffi has designated a sliver of mostly illiquid assets for rural development in 117 separate trusts managed by john stahl a gwg holdings associate heppner in his january interview said the assets in the trusts could be monetized over four to seven years there is no guarantee they will produce cash a year or two in people will be asking where s the grocery store these great big plans don t require them to show anything for a very long time said shane van dalsem an associate professor of finance business at washburn university in topeka who also serves on the asset management committee for topeka community foundation the issue here is beneficient is different from other financial institutions and so they re not regulated in the same way van dalsem said so that might be a blind spot for the legislature and for the governor because they probably historically relied on regulators to oversee the financial institutions and it doesn t look like that s taking place herndon the kansas bank commissioner has sole regulatory authority which is limited over the teffi herndon emphasized in an interview that he raised red flags about beneficient from the start including the sec investigation and absence of audited financial records no other entity has expressed interest in operating a teffi in kansas herndon said i still have unanswered questions herndon said the same things i expressed through my testimony and obviously even though the lawsuits have not made their way through the court there are some allegations in those lawsuits that are concerning and we will pay particular attention as it processes through the court system derek fletcher president and chief financial officer for beneficient said in an email that the company hired an accountant in march and will have the books in order by july fletcher also said the company hasn t conducted any transactions since dec 31 but that it has a billion dollars worth of potential deals in our pipeline the company doesn t finance assets from russia or hong kong as owens claimed last year fletcher said a spokesman for beneficient responding to questions for this story mistakenly sent kansas reflector an undated letter from the company to its clients marked privileged and confidential the letter s stated purpose to verify the status of different accounts based on inquiries we ve received the letter says the company is working to finalize agreements and establish accounts before transferring cash and assets marked for economic growth to the department of commerce and beneficient heartland foundation heppner in the january interview with kansas reflector said his goal in launching the teffi trade was to carve this out for kansas and do it right don t do it with snake oil salesmen heppner said do it right and we ll see that benefit float little towns like mine across the state kansas reflector is part of states newsroom a network of news bureaus

said many people want the bbc to be more like the american podcast giant joe rogan and be willing to explore more roads of debate the interview with bbc s ros atkins also saw him talk about his departure from good morning britain cancel culture and go on to say that the bbc has its own problems when it came to reporting the facts and he said he would love to have j k rowling on as a guest on his new talk show morgan told the bbc s media show that a lot of people would criticise the bbc for refusing to ever go down the roads of debate joe rogan sometimes does because they believe they have the truth the us stand up comedian and ufc commentator has been accused of spreading misinformation during the covid 19 pandemic however morgan said we know in the pandemic that scientists have changed their own minds many times whether it be about the efficacy of masks whether it be about the ability of vaccines to prevent transmission i myself have changed my view about coronavirus many times the comments come ahead of the launch of his new show piers morgan uncensored for rupert murdoch s new talktv channel he told the media show s ross atkins it s a show that defends free speech it s a show that i think will uphold the pillars of democracy in a time when society is i think under more threat to free speech and freedom of expression than i have known it in my lifetime regarding his time on good morning britain he said i felt the show was on fire saying it created a national debate about whatever the issues may be the sadness to me was itv had always been unbelievably strong in protecting my right to express my honestly held opinions to the end and then suddenly they lost their bottle on leaving the show he claimed the duchess of sussex had written to itv s chief executive dame carolyn mccall demanding my head on a plate i was told either you issue a public apology for effectively disbelieving meghan markle because i had disbelieved what she had told oprah winfrey or i had to give up the show that i loved if they itv had defended my right to free speech then i wouldn t have been asked to apologise or leave my job ofcom later came back and defended my right to free speech when questioned about concerns raised by ofcom and mind about dismissing meghan s claims she was having suicidal thoughts morgan doubled down and said there was not a shred of evidence that meghan had asked the royal family for help or to support her over either of the two racism claims on cancel culture he said he d love to get j k rowling on his new show and said the author has been appallingly vilified and there has been a massive attempt to cancel her it s been unsuccessful because she s extremely wealthy the abuse that has been meted out to her for effectively defending women s rights has been a complete disgrace added morgan discussing kathleen stock a university professor whose views on trans issues sparked anger among some students at the university of sussex he said do people like kathleen stock lose their jobs for having an honestly held opinion and is that right in a democratic society do want to see university professors driven out of their jobs by a bunch of students atkins asked morgan if he would have on a guest on who suggested vaccines against covid didn t work morgan replied yes because i d want to expose that thought process which i think has been extremely dangerous i d want to expose them with facts there are a lot of people who think this and they ve been encouraged to think it by a lot of nonsense on the internet i would let them set out their stall tell me where they ve heard this why they believe this and then damn them with facts asked would he put someone on air to challenge unproven claims that the drug ivermectin can be used to treat covid morgan said joe rogan did that on his show and it was very interesting he discussed it at length with dr sanjay gupta from cnn and it was a really interesting debate about which of these theories which have got a huge following now around the world during the pandemic which of them have any merit or not i think a lot of people would criticise the bbc for refusing to ever go down these roads of debate because they believe they have the truth and yet we know in the pandemic that scientists have changed their own minds many times whether it be about the efficacy of masks whether it be about the ability of vaccines to prevent transmission i myself have changed my view about coronavirus many times and he was quick to defend fox when a bbc presenter said it was a network with a long track record of saying things that are not rooted in fact morgan responded do you feel as uncomfortable about the time i ve spent at cnn given the way that cnn has gone in the last few years given their obsession for example with russian collusion cnn is the bbc of the states in many ways it s a network people look at and say everything they say must be truthful and factual for two years they spun a load of old baloney about donald trump being in cahoots with the russians to fix the 216 election it turned out to be nonsense the bbc has its own problems as much as you all like to put your halos on and say oh piers how can you work with these ghastly people i look around the bbc sometimes and think hmmm martin bashir it s a bit awkward for everybody isn t it he also said he thought the editorial standards at fox news were pretty high and he was very happy to work there the interview can be watched here on iplayer for more stories from where you live visit

sen gerald allen introduced senate bill 2 sb2 on jan 11 the law prohibits any official officer employee or agent of the state or a political subdivision of the state from enforcing or administering any executive order issued by the president that limits or restricts the ownership use or possession of firearms ammunition or firearm accessories by law abiding residents of the state the bill also bans the expenditure of state or local funds for the enforcement of the same in effect the enactment of sb2 should ban state enforcement of president trump s bump stock ban along with two atf regulations from executive orders issued by joe biden to criminalize pistol braces and to require registration of popular 80 percent lowers homemade firearms it would also bar state and local enforcement of any other future gun control schemes implemented by executive order the bill went through several changes as it moved through the legislature as introduced and passed by the senate judiciary committee the legislation would have broadly banned state and local agents from enforcing federal gun control past present and future a senate version would have only prohibited enforcement of gun control executive orders by president joe biden the house amended the bill to its final form the house passed the final version of sb2 by a 68 28 vote the senate concurred with the house amendment by a 23 5 vote with gov ivey s signature the law goes into effect july 1 potential loopholes while the legislation directly bans gun control measures by executive order how it will play out in practice remains uncertain there are two potential loopholes in sb2 first the legislation does not define law abiding residents this could potentially create a problem because one could argue a person in possession of a firearm accessory banned by the federal government is not law abiding this is why the missouri second amendment preservation act passed last year specifically defined a law abiding citizen as a person who is not otherwise precluded under state law from possessing a firearm there is also the possibility that state and local law enforcement agents will claim they didn t know that a given federal firearm regulation was implemented by executive order in practice the president generally signs an order instructing the atf to make a certain rule or interpret a particular act in a specific way for instance the eo may say the atf is directed to make rules prohibiting the possession of x under the authority of the national firearms act of 1934 the atf then draws up the specific rule a corrupt or even uninformed law enforcement officer could argue he didn t know the regulation was initiated by an eo he ll simply say it s an atf rule under the nfa of 1934 this is why it s important that laws banning enforcement are as specific as possible in describing the actions being banned however if sb2 is implemented under the intent of the text as noted throughout the legislative process in hearings and debates it can set the foundation to bring enforcement of some federal gun control to an end in alabama effective the federal government relies heavily on state cooperation to implement and enforce almost all of its laws regulations and acts including gun control by simply withdrawing this necessary cooperation states and localities can nullify many federal actions in effect as noted by the national governors association during the partial government shutdown of 2013 states are partners with the federal government on most federal programs based on james madison s advice for states and individuals in federalist 46 a refusal to cooperate with officers of the union represents an extremely effective method to bring down federal gun control measures because most enforcement actions rely on help support and leadership from state and local governments judge andrew napolitano agreed in a televised discussion on the issue he noted that a single state taking this step would make federal gun laws nearly impossible to enforce partnerships don t work too well when half the team quits said michael boldin of the tenth amendment center by withdrawing all resources and participation in federal gun control states and even local governments can help bring these unconstitutional acts to their much needed end legal basis the montgomery advisor reported that democrats opposed the measure saying supporters have no conception of the supremacy clause in the u s constitution making federal laws superior to state laws you all know what the supremacy clause says you learned it in law school sen rodger smitherman d birmingham said you and i know there is nothing we can say or do in this state that s going to supersede whatever the federal government does smitherman s convoluted understanding of the supremacy clause notwithstanding sb2 doesn t even call it into play the state of alabama can legally bar state agents from enforcing federal gun control refusal to cooperate with federal enforcement rests on a well established legal principle known as the anti commandeering doctrine simply put the federal government cannot force states to help implement or enforce any federal act or program the anti commandeering doctrine is based primarily on five supreme court cases dating back to 1842 printz v u s serves as the cornerstone we held in new york that congress cannot compel the states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program today we hold that congress cannot circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the states officers directly the federal government may neither issue directives requiring the states to address particular problems nor command the states officers or those of their political subdivisions to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program it matters not whether policy making is involved and no case by case weighing of the burdens or benefits is necessary such commands are fundamentally incompatible with our constitutional system of dual sovereignty no determination of constitutionality is necessary to invoke the anti commandeering doctrine state and local governments can refuse to enforce federal laws or implement federal programs whether they are constitutional or not

similar to a february 16 2022 media report where economic experts urged the federal government to seek a debt moratorium and reduce the cost of governance to reduce funds expended on debt servicing as it stands as the best available option this will enable the government to suspend payment for now and re strategise particularly the government cannot continue to service its rising debt profile at the expense of meeting the competing needs of the people a similar expert warning was recently handed by economic analysts that the federal government s soaring borrowings could eventually suffocate the country if not mitigated speaking in akure ondo state capital at the 32nd annual seminar for finance correspondents and business editors themed exchange rate management and economic diversification in nigeria the pave option the experts hinted that going by government s borrowing plans a fresh n6 3 trillion debt may be added to the current debt stock of n39 556 trillion 95 779 billion as at december 31 2021 to ultimately push the country s total debt stock to n45 86 trillion by december 2022 notwithstanding this unhealthy trend they argued it was high time the country invested more in boosting local production and export oriented infrastructure before the huge debt burden sinks the country thirdly it was in the news that pricewaterhousecoopers a multinational professional services network of firms operating as partnerships under the pwc brand in a report entitled nigeria economic alert assessing the 2021 fgn budget warned that the increasing cost of servicing debt will continue to weigh on the federal government s revenue profile it said actual debt servicing cost in 2020 stood at n3 27tn and represented about 10 per cent over the budgeted amount of n2 95tn this puts the debt to revenue ratio at approximately 83 per cent nearly double the 46 per cent that was budgeted this implies that about n83 out of every n100 the federal government earned was used to settle interest payments for outstanding domestic and foreign debts within the reference period in 2021 the fg plans to spend n3 32tn to service its outstanding debt this is slightly higher than the n2 95tn budgeted in 2020 the present administration as part of its campaign promise in 2015 agreed to ensure a better deal for nigerians six years after such demand was made and jonathan gone the three government owned refineries in the country have not been able to function at full capacity as promised by the present administration today if there is anything that nigerians wish that the fg should accomplish quickly it is getting the refineries to function optimally as well as make the nnpc more accountable to the people as what happened under president jonathan has become a child s play when compared with the present happenings in nigeria s oil gas and electricity sectors what the above tells us as a country is that more work needs to be done more reforms to be made that as a nation we are poor not because of our geographical location or due to absence of mineral natural resources but because our leaders fail to take decisions that engineer prosperity and we cannot solve our socio economic challenges with the same thinking we used when we created it definitely this piece may not unfold completely the answers to these challenges but there are a few sectors that a nation desirous of development can start from the first that comes to mind is the urgent need for diversification of the nation s revenue sources revenue diversification from what development experts are saying will provide options for the nation to reduce financial risks and increase national economic stability as a decline in particular revenue source might be offset by increase in other revenue sources finally within this period of economic vulnerability new awareness that must not be allowed to go with political winds is the expert warning that accumulated debt can hinder a country s development especially when most of the revenue generated is used to service debt jerome mario is the programme coordinator media and public policy social and economic justice advocacy seja he could be reached via jeromeutomi yahoo com 08032725374

twitter inc kicked off deal negotiations with elon musk on sunday after he wooed many of the social media company s shareholders with financing details on his 4 billion acquisition offer people familiar with the matter said the company s decision to engage with musk taken earlier on sunday does not mean that it will accept his 54 20 per share bid the sources said it signifies however that twitter is now exploring whether a sale of the company to musk is possible on attractive terms the sources added also read twitter board reveals plan to defeat elon musk prepares for poison pill musk chief executive of electric car giant tesla inc has been meeting with twitter shareholders in the last few days seeking support for his bid he has said twitter needs to be taken private to grow and become a genuine platform for free speech many twitter shareholders reached out to the company after musk outlined a detailed financing plan for his bid on thursday and urged it not to let the opportunity for a deal slip away reuters reported earlier on sunday musk s insistence that his bid for twitter is his best and final has emerged as a hurdle in the deal negotiations the sources said nevertheless twitter s board has decided to engage with musk to gather more information on his ability to complete the deal and potentially get better terms the sources added twitter has not yet decided if it will explore a sale to put pressure on musk to raise his bid according to the sources the people with knowledge of the matter declined to be identified because the deal discussions are confidential twitter wants to know more about any active investigations by regulators into musk including by the u s securities and exchange commission sec that would present a risk to the deal being completed one of the sources said securities lawyers say that musk who settled charges that he misled investors by suggesting four years ago he had secured funding to take tesla private may have breached sec disclosure rules as he amassed a stake in twitter earlier this year also read after hostile takeover bid elon musk now attacks twitter s saudi arabia link twitter is also looking into whether regulators in any of the major markets it operates would object to musk owning the company the source added were twitter to establish that a sale to musk would be risky it could ask for a sizeable break up fee according to the sources the social media company adopted a poison pill after musk made his offer to prevent him from raising his more than 9 stake in the company above 15 without negotiating a deal with its board in response musk has threatened to launch a tender offer that he could use to register twitter shareholder support for his bid a concern that twitter s board weighed was that unless it sought to negotiate a deal with musk many shareholders could back him in a tender offer the sources said while the poison pill would prevent twitter shareholders from tendering their shares the company is worried that its negotiating hand would weaken considerably if it was shown to be going against the will of many of its investors the sources added also read elon musk loses position as twitter top shareholder while board evaluates his 43 billion takeover bid representatives for twitter and musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment the wall street journal reported earlier on sunday that musk and twitter would meet to discuss the acquisition offer the price expectations among twitter shareholders for the deal diverge largely based on their investment strategy the sources said active long term shareholders who together with index funds hold the biggest chunk of twitter shares have higher price expectations some in the 60s per share the sources said they are also more inclined to give parag agrawal who became twitter s chief executive in november more time to boost the value of the company s stock the sources added i don t believe that the proposed offer by elon musk 54 20 per share comes close to the intrinsic value of twitter given its growth prospects saudi arabia s prince alwaleed bin talal a twitter shareholder tweeted on april 14 also read twitter ceo tells employees the board is still evaluating elon musk s 43 billion dollar offer short term minded investors such as hedge funds want twitter to accept musk s offer or ask for only a small increase the sources said some of these are fretting that a recent plunge in the value of technology stocks amid concerns over inflation and an economic slowdown makes it unlikely twitter will be able to deliver more value for itself anytime soon the sources added i would say take the 54 20 a share and be done with it said sahm adrangi portfolio manager at kerrisdale capital management a hedge fund that owns 1 13 million shares in twitter or 0 15 of the company and has been an investor since early 2020 one silver lining for twitter s board is that musk s offer did not appear to convert much of his army of 83 million twitter followers into new shareholders in the san francisco based company who could back his bid the sources said twitter s retail investor base has increased from about 20 before musk unveiled his stake on april 4 to some 22 according to the sources advertisement reporting by svea herbst bayliss in boston and greg roumeliotis in

reading or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story salt lake city stefani kemp never got to go wedding dress shopping she used to picture walking into a wedding dress shop and having an iconic montage of stunning dress after stunning dress until she found the perfect one but when she was preparing for her wedding five years ago she knew that was not going to be a reality even in a state with so many wedding dress shops and bridal boutiques she knew it would be impossible to find a dress above maybe a size 14 or 16 at these stores instead she found a dress at a thrift store and her mother tailored it to fit i missed out on an entire experience that you only get once in a lifetime the model and influencer said it should not have been that hard the problem should have been having way too many choices especially in a world where there are so many different companies that make clothing now with the rise of inclusive sizing spreading nationwide and because of people like kemp a plus size woman might have a chance of finding a wedding dress even at a utah boutique according to a widely cited study from 2016 the average american woman is a size 16 but most retailers start plus sizing at size 12 or 14 and in high fashion even sizes 6 to 10 can be considered plus size so even though plus size means larger than standard sizing the average american woman has long been outside of these standard sizes in short the majority of clothing made for american women doesn t actually fit american women but that has been rapidly changing there s been a movement of plus size women that are making noise and saying we ve had enough said lindsay shields a plus size woman and founder of kervology a utah based size inclusive online clothing store kervology a utah company offers inclusive sizing for patrons photo screenshot after decades of not being seen dissatisfied women have started a nationwide movement against the fashion industry that has resulted in a dramatic increase in options for women like kemp more and more retailers small and large have begun offering extended sizes some big companies like target walmart forever 21 and h m offer plus size clothing in plus size specific sections both online and in stores similar to a maternity section other companies like old navy and universal standard offer inclusive sizes and choose not to separate or increase the price based on size although kemp is excited to see how many local brands and boutiques are stepping up to the plate she also knows that this inclusivity can t just be a trend there is so much work left to do and it has to be a work rooted in love she said boutique critique during june 2020 the black lives matter protests around the country rekindled social media discussions about representation and inclusion including the world of utah boutiques some of the top utah boutiques posted support of people of color without including people of color in their campaigns some online critics pointed out that the women modeling these products were almost all thin and white and most of the boutiques did not carry above a size xl the response from those boutiques that were called out was that it was too difficult to find a diverse group of models in a largely homogenous state now two years later kemp said the majority of utah boutiques have made an effort to widen their range of sizes and representation of models in campaigns and it s about dang time she added what sparked it there s a demand for it davila said the majority of us women are considered plus size but the fashion industry has only focused on straight sizes which leaves out a huge market when you look at the numbers it makes sense beyond clothing growing up in utah kemp said she felt an immense pressure to look and be perfect a task that became more difficult when the only clothes in her size were low quality and generally hideous featuring cheap rhinestones shoulders cut out of sleeves and repellent busy prints this kind of clothing remains most of what is offered for plus size women today i remember literally feeling like a grown woman in my seventh grade pictures because the plus size clothing was just so tragic she said kemp started her fashion and travel instagram account and blog about five years ago when she saw the impacts of the body positive movement on social media i had never heard anyone who looked like me celebrate their body before other women like me were heavily invested in diet culture but these women were really working on loving themselves where they were at she said she wanted to create a safe space for women of all sizes where they could visit her page and escape from the heaviness of the world and the critical side of social media and find joy but kemp often sees a darker side of social media she said she regularly receives hateful unsolicited messages and comments in reaction to her posting about her life most frequently people will message her and inform her that she is fat as if they re doing me a service she said fat people existing pisses people off it s really unfortunate kemp continued i don t think people really understand that they re not talking to a robot they re talking to a human you have no business sharing negative opinions about other people i already know i m fat i live in my body thank you for telling me but instead of focusing on the negative messages she holds onto the belief that imperfections are what make life beautiful she goes against the discrimination and hate and shows the world that people like her can travel and dress well and work hard and enjoy life i wasted so much time thinking that i had to be skinny to be loved she said but we don t say those things about ourselves anymore we ve got so many better things to do we re going to go make memories in this swimming suit getting it right kemp mentioned that through modeling she has noticed certain local companies like jessakae q noor and kervology have really done the work to be as inclusive as possible and are examples of getting it right jessakae maddocks who owns and founded jessakae with her husband jordan grew up watching her plus size grandmother scour catalogs for pieces that fit because stores didn t carry her size often her grandmother would have to return the clothing because it didn t fit well i remember her wearing about five outfits my entire childhood maddocks said when maddocks started getting into the fashion industry she went to trade shows and realized that out of the thousands of brands available the largest sizes she could find were large or extra large after she launched jessakae with traditional sizing she was inspired by the number of women who commented wishing they could find the same dresses in their size although she is thin and can easily find her size in stores she remembered her grandmother and the division and isolation that comes with exclusion and she made it her personal mission to do her part to change the industry i wasted so much time thinking that i had to be skinny to be loved stefani kemp every retailer and designer spoken to for this article told a similar story when they decided that they wanted to be inclusive they quickly ran into major issues most boutiques get their products from wholesale vendors and vendors featured at trade shows that simply do not offer a wide range of sizes each of the business owners came to the same conclusion they would have to start designing their own pieces this solution also came with certain issues like a higher upfront cost not knowing how much to order having to stock three times as much product to include all the sizes and the uncertainty about whether the pieces would sell designing dresses for a plus size body too was a huge learning curve maddocks explained because she wanted to accommodate the variety of body types that exist beyond straight standard sizing but she didn t let the hard work stop her i heard all the excuses but they just weren t valid for me she said i spent so many sleepless nights trying to perfect our plus size designs she started with a classic rose maxi dress with inclusive sizing and it made jessakae go viral just as she suspected this was what people wanted maddocks started offering her products up to size 3x and soon expanded to 4x and 5x now she is in the process of adding size 6x this year she made an effort to include plus size models front and center in her campaigns so a wide variety of people could see what the product looks like on someone like them jessakae has also made videos featuring plus size models combatting common stereotypes about plus size people now the shop offers more plus size clothing than straight size clothing jessakae another utah fashion company offers sizes up to 6x photo screenshot we re selling out so fast it s a blessing and a curse said jordan maddocks co owner and jessakae s husband kemp who has been prominently featured in jessakae s recent campaigns said that the maddockses are some of a select few local brands who have been busting their butts to do the work kemp is not only a model for jessakae but she is also a fit consultant she comes in and tries on the extended sizes and gives honest feedback about fit and quality worthy to model erin burrise a filipino and black model and entrepreneur began modeling in los angeles when she was 16 and a size 3 when she got older and her body changed she didn t think she would be able to get back into that world as a size 16 18 i settled for what i could find and wear a lot of my style changed just because of necessity it s starting to feel like the situation s getting better now but it s still sometimes hard burrise said the models she saw didn t look like her the plus size models she saw were mostly white only marginally bigger than standard size and still had flat stomachs and perfect proportions erin burrise a curve model based in sacramento calif on instagram photo screenshot we ve grown up seeing this kind of body in everything we know what that looks like burrise said for most plus size people that s not their body that s not how we look if you are finding different ages and races and body types to model the range of clothes that you have i guarantee you you are 100 getting more customers and followers i m excited at the opportunity to be representative of those bodies and to see more of a variety she explained now she s part of an agency and has started modeling for jessakae a company she has loved for years modeling has helped her accept herself in the body she has right now more than anything else in her life i never saw myself in this body as being worthy of being able to do this maybe if i had big curves with a big bust and big butt and a flat stomach i could but i ve learned that in this body as it is i could and i can she said representation beyond size taby davila was scrolling through instagram and kept seeing what looked like the same model for every local store or boutique a thin toned white blonde woman she kept scrolling and scrolling hoping to see anyone who looked like her a short curvy latina woman she couldn t find a single one davila started a brick and mortar boutique in utah when she was only 16 and ran it for eight years before closing it down to shift careers when she decided to go back to her first love her boutique she knew from the start that she wanted the shop to be two things online and inclusive when davila started shop taby she knew right away that she not only wanted models of all sizes she also wanted to have truly intersectional diverse representation so other people wouldn t have to experience what she did as they scroll through social media her latest swimsuit campaign includes a model in each size from xs to 5x utah based online clothier shop taby boasts all inclusive sizing as well photo screenshot we ve been doing this since day one it s not just the trendy thing to do i personally know that representation is important and matters and not just at a size level she said to get around the lack of diversity within the state she took on models with little to no experience and even approaches people at grocery stores and movie theaters to see if they would model then when people of diverse backgrounds saw the representation they reached out to her to see if they could model because they loved the inclusivity of the brand those models in turn recommended their friends reach out to those communities and you ll be surprised by what you can find davila said true representation goes beyond sizing fashion is global people outside of utah look different there are people in utah who look different who we don t see on social media but that doesn t mean that they don t exist getting it wrong shields owner at kervology said while there has been a sharp increase in availability of plus size products from vendors and trade shows have almost 10 times as much plus size clothing as they did five years ago not everyone is doing it right part of me is like finally we can come into your shop and maybe find plus size clothing she said there s another side of me that s like you re just barely starting to see me shields explained that some boutique owners will only bring in extended sizes for their best selling items some will simply size up a standard item by adding inches without taking into consideration increased bust sizes or arm sizes and some will slap a 3x label on a 1x product without having someone that size actually try on the product and then sometimes they offer extended sizes but they only offer them online and not in stores hearkening back to maddocks grandmother ordering from catalogs and returning almost everything kemp said that women on the larger end of plus sizes experience a lot more of these issues than someone in a size 16 or 18 i feel like being in the 3x to 6x range so many women just feel like they ll never be able to dress the way they want to dress because companies don t know what they re doing as far as manufacturing kemp said sometimes she will show up for a shoot or a consultation and only half of the products are actually the size they say they are there s a piece of you that kind of dies inside like not again it s 2022 we have been here a long time these places should really be better at making plus sizes overall a lot of boutiques are working on it but some are really missing the mark customer for life davila explained that another big reason for the rise of inclusive sizing is that people have finally recognized an untapped market full of loyal customers i get emails saying that they had never seen this caliber of clothing for a plus size woman and that we have a customer for life davila said more and more women are feeling represented and empowered it s silly because it s just clothes but i believe that when we feel good we are more likely to do good everyone benefits family community everyone she added for lindsay gardner amanda hart and alyson harper co founders at modest molly the loyal customer base is what brings them the most joy they spoke about the added difficulty of finding modest clothing in plus sizes something that many utah women experience at orem based modest molly vendors are asked to first make a sample then the three women try it on their own bodies take pictures recut it make another sample and continue this process until it actually fits plus size bodies they talked about how one woman came in and said that she hadn t worn jeans in 15 years we started out wanting to be inclusive if we had just focused on our small to large clients we wouldn t be in business right now amanda hart co owner at modest molly the founders had done the work to find jeans that actually fit curvy women by trying them on their own bodies and requesting sample after sample until it worked they convinced the customer to just try the jeans on the woman left with three pair because she felt so confident it s so great to meet somebody new and bring tears to their eyes because they actually feel good about themselves in an outfit harper said most of the shop s revenue comes from that loyal customer base hart explained that s the reason why we re successful we started out wanting to be inclusive if we had just focused on our small to large clients we wouldn t be in business right now she said and once these customers find high quality clothing that looks good and fits well they buy a lot and they keep coming back it s honestly the smartest business move anyone can make because when women like me find a brand that works they get every color of everything kemp said she explained that the fashion industry hasn t created quality luxury pieces for plus size women because they think that those women will always be trying to lose weight i feel like that s such a cop out kemp said plus size women will always be around and we re ready to spend our freaking money we work hard we want to feel beautiful we want to dress up as princesses there s a whole emotion around it plus size people have been waiting forever so far to go even though more and more retailers are moving toward inclusive sizing the work is far from over kemp explained she still will see something that looks cute on the rack but doesn t actually work for the body size it claims to fit or if it does fit it generally sells out faster because the shop didn t order the same amount of product in extended sizing i m not necessarily happy with how much work has been done she said i should be able to walk into any store with my mother and be able to shop with her hart explained that even though youth are becoming more accepting of so many differences size is one thing where we still haven t reached a place of acceptance i feel like i have seen a little bit of change more boutiques are offering more inclusive sizing people have more options i just hope that continues to happen gardner said the majority of us women are considered plus size but the fashion industry has only focused on straight sizes which leaves out a huge market when you look at the numbers it makes sense taby davila owner at shop taby overall there s a feeling of wary optimism in the air and these women are hoping to leave the state more inclusive than they found it one day we ll be able to look back and just think holy cow we ve come so far and that s going to be the day when we can all celebrate kemp said correction in an earlier version some references to maddocks were incorrectly spelled as maddox

by saikat chatterjee london reuters following is market reaction to french president emmanuel macron s victory over rival marine le pen in sunday s election with 97 of votes counted macron was on course for 57 4 of the vote interior ministry figures showed market reaction the euro opened higher on monday at 1 0852 compared with friday s close of 1 08095 it then reversed course and was trading 0 2 lower at 1 788 by 0330 gmt it climbed 0 1 against sterling and briefly hit a one month high pan region fell 1 7 alongside falls in u s futures and asian shares eurozone bond yields particularly yields on french government debt are likely to dip later in the day on market relief about macron s win yields on benchmark 10 year debt which hit more than seven year highs last week may dip by 5 7 bps in european trading on monday a widely watched spread between french and german government bonds a gauge for french political risks is likely to tighten it hit an april 2020 high of 54 bps earlier this month here is a summary of analyst comments felix huefner senior european economist ubs we expect a modest bounce in closer to 1 10 in the immediate aftermath of president macron s re election the euro s medium term recovery depends on ecb policy tightening catch up with the fed and other g10 central banks which we expect to begin in earnest in h2 as for oat bund spreads we see a very modest market reaction as the market had already given up the risk premium following the round 1 vote and the debate on 20th april sim moh siong currency strategist bank of singapore the euro has been dragged a bit lower against the dollar this morning because with the french election out of the way the market is starting to focus on other worries like about chinese growth stock markets are in the red this morning and that risk aversion has generally benefited the dollar vincent mortier cio amundi victory will lead macron to strengthen the franco german couple and more generally the european institutions the absence of a change of course will reassure not only the other eu countries but also the nato but the increasing fragmentation of the political landscape makes it doubtful that macron s party has an absolute majority this time in parliament the recomposition of the french political landscape is not over the majority that emerges from the parliamentary elections will be decisive for economic policy ivan morozov sovereign credit analyst t rowe price london we believe macron s victory was expected by the market so market implications are likely to be very limited we could see some marginal spread tightening for french government bonds and marginal euro strengthening but longer term performance of both depends more on the european central bank decisions to come in the next several months domestically macron will continue to push for some moderate reforms and some spending restraints albeit keeping fiscal policy relatively accommodative internationally it is likely to see acceleration of sanctioning russia kenneth broux currency strategist societe generale london the markets should be relieved on the macron win we should see a modest tightening in french and german bond yield spreads french stocks should open marginally higher but the euro will be buffeted by the surge in dollar rates last week the big news from europe in the coming days is the growing likelihood of a russian oil embargo holger schmieding chief economist berenberg london based on the exit polls we can t say how big his margin will be but the polls suggest a convincing win and that gives him momentum for the parliamentary elections he has a chance of winning those elections and getting close to a majority so he should be able to install a government that is friendly even it has to rely on support for markets this is probably only a modest sigh of relief as the latest opinion polls had already suggested a win for macron but what we can say is that we have been spared the nightmare scenario kaspar hense senior portfolio manager bluebay asset management london we had thought the markets were a bit complacent going into the elections and we had gone short on italian debt as a result while over the medium term there will be some pressure on peripheral bonds the immediate market reaction will be one of relief on the macron news we could see oat bond yields move 10 bps tighter and german bund swaps spreads also narrow 5 bps the euro should move a bit higher but in the medium term as the short term risk implication has ebbed macron now has some more time to put together more eu reforms namely on energy and more cohesiveness on key sectors such as energy and defence marchel alexandrovich european economist saltmarsh economics london what we have learned form the last couple of years is that the polls are good but not completely reliable so we are likely to get a relief rally there would have been such a big upset if le pen had won on the economy i think it is interesting as macron cannot run again so his legacy will be set in the next five years so he is likely to push for more reforms as he won t be standing in five years time there is an opportunity for him to push his agenda so perhaps he can be braver the scale of the victory is likely to be lower than in 2017 but it is a convincing win for an incumbent seema shah chief strategist principle global investors london there s going to be a bit of relief there has been a lot of trust in the polls so i don t expect a huge reaction but the alternative would have been a huge reaction across france and europe too for french stocks we could see a small relief rally too but after the knee jerk reaction the focus will turn to the ecb and the rate outlook and that will be key driver for european stocks and bonds marlene laruelle director institute for european russian and eurasian studies george washington university washington macron s victory is good news for europe as macron is a big defender of european unity the need for a unified eu foreign policy and defence and is playing a key role in europe s diplomacy in the war in ukraine le pen s election would have created a collision course with the eu and triggered a political crisis in france and potentially in europe where she would have had few supporters except victor orban yet macron s victory should be read with caveats le pen got her best score ever and the level of abstention of young people is at more than 40 so the distrust toward macron s governing is high frederic leroux member of investment team carmignac macron s clear victory is likely to reassure the markets that the european dynamic will continue in the short term the main logical beneficiary of this election could be the euro which was still flirting last friday with two year lows against the dollar as the european equity market has rather outperformed the u s market in the last few days there is not necessarily a reason to expect a massive outperformance of french or european equities against the u s the negative aspect for the markets of this rather comfortable election could however come from a quick decision in favour of a russian oil embargo which would exacerbate inflationary pressures and economic slowdown stagflation scenario in europe

stay on top of the headlines from belfast and beyond by signing up for free email alerts stay on top of the headlines from belfast and beyond by signing up for free email alerts piers morgan has said many people want the bbc to be more like the american podcast giant joe rogan and be willing to explore more roads of debate the interview with bbc s ros atkins also saw him talk about his departure from good morning britain cancel culture and go on to say that the bbc has its own problems when it came to reporting the facts and he said he would love to have j k rowling on as a guest on his new talk show morgan told the bbc s media show that a lot of people would criticise the bbc for refusing to ever go down the roads of debate joe rogan sometimes does because they believe they have the truth the us stand up comedian and ufc commentator has been accused of spreading misinformation during the covid 19 pandemic however morgan said we know in the pandemic that scientists have changed their own minds many times whether it be about the efficacy of masks whether it be about the ability of vaccines to prevent transmission i myself have changed my view about coronavirus many times the comments come ahead of the launch of his new show piers morgan uncensored for rupert murdoch s new talktv channel he told the media show s ross atkins it s a show that defends free speech it s a show that i think will uphold the pillars of democracy in a time when society is i think under more threat to free speech and freedom of expression than i have known it in my lifetime regarding his time on good morning britain he said i felt the show was on fire saying it created a national debate about whatever the issues may be the sadness to me was itv had always been unbelievably strong in protecting my right to express my honestly held opinions to the end and then suddenly they lost their bottle on leaving the show he claimed the duchess of sussex had written to itv s chief executive dame carolyn mccall demanding my head on a plate i was told either you issue a public apology for effectively disbelieving meghan markle because i had disbelieved what she had told oprah winfrey or i had to give up the show that i loved if they itv had defended my right to free speech then i wouldn t have been asked to apologise or leave my job ofcom later came back and defended my right to free speech when questioned about concerns raised by ofcom and mind about dismissing meghan s claims she was having suicidal thoughts morgan doubled down and said there was not a shred of evidence that meghan had asked the royal family for help or to support her over either of the two racism claims on cancel culture he said he d love to get j k rowling on his new show and said the author has been appallingly vilified and there has been a massive attempt to cancel her it s been unsuccessful because she s extremely wealthy the abuse that has been meted out to her for effectively defending women s rights has been a complete disgrace added morgan discussing kathleen stock a university professor whose views on trans issues sparked anger among some students at the university of sussex he said do people like kathleen stock lose their jobs for having an honestly held opinion and is that right in a democratic society do want to see university professors driven out of their jobs by a bunch of students atkins asked morgan if he would have on a guest on who suggested vaccines against covid didn t work morgan replied yes because i d want to expose that thought process which i think has been extremely dangerous i d want to expose them with facts there are a lot of people who think this and they ve been encouraged to think it by a lot of nonsense on the internet i would let them set out their stall tell me where they ve heard this why they believe this and then damn them with facts asked would he put someone on air to challenge unproven claims that the drug ivermectin can be used to treat covid morgan said joe rogan did that on his show and it was very interesting he discussed it at length with dr sanjay gupta from cnn and it was a really interesting debate about which of these theories which have got a huge following now around the world during the pandemic which of them have any merit or not i think a lot of people would criticise the bbc for refusing to ever go down these roads of debate because they believe they have the truth and yet we know in the pandemic that scientists have changed their own minds many times whether it be about the efficacy of masks whether it be about the ability of vaccines to prevent transmission i myself have changed my view about coronavirus many times and he was quick to defend fox when a bbc presenter said it was a network with a long track record of saying things that are not rooted in fact morgan responded do you feel as uncomfortable about the time i ve spent at cnn given the way that cnn has gone in the last few years given their obsession for example with russian collusion cnn is the bbc of the states in many ways it s a network people look at and say everything they say must be truthful and factual for two years they spun a load of old baloney about donald trump being in cahoots with the russians to fix the 216 election it turned out to be nonsense the bbc has its own problems as much as you all like to put your halos on and say oh piers how can you work with these ghastly people i look around the bbc sometimes and think hmmm martin bashir it s a bit awkward for everybody isn t it he also said he thought the editorial standards at fox news were pretty high and he was very happy to work there the interview can be watched here on iplayer for more stories from where you live visit inyourarea

everyone can see that something really strange appears to be happening and now even tucker carlson is talking about it on television for months unusual fires have been erupting at important food industry facilities all over america last thursday i put together a list of 16 major fires that have occurred just since the start of the year unfortunately since i wrote that article a couple more mysterious incidents have taken place very early on saturday firefighters were called out to battle a fire at a general mills facility in cedar rapids iowa an early morning fire at general mills led first responders to the roof of the company to attack the flames from above the call came in around 3 45am on saturday at the plant located at 4800 edgewood road sw first responders discovered hot spots where a vent stack makes contact with the roof steam and smoke were already visible crews reached the roof and confirmed the location of the fire below them with the help of thermal imaging firefighters removed roofing material and found the flames working their way through the ceiling and traveling with the vent stack oddly this fire erupted less than 48 hours after a plane crashed at a general mills facility in covington georgia investigators spent friday at the general mills plant in covington combing through the wreckage of a deadly plane crash that happened the previous evening a twin engine cessna crashed into several semi trailers at remote part of the cereal plant on thursday evening killing two people the covington police department said is it just a coincidence that there were two major disasters at general mills facilities within 48 hours of one another that is what some would have us believe of course there have been a whole bunch of other coincidences happening lately too less than a week ago the headquarters of azure standard burned to the ground in a massive fire ceo david stelzer is admitting that all azure market liquid products will be out of stock for the foreseeable future as a result he also added for our customers three primary product groups are affected due to the destroyed automated liquid pour facility fruit packing facilities and carob products facilities he continued because of this we will experience out of stock status for azure market oils honey and vinegars basically any azure market liquid product as well as our carob products for the short term we are not yet at fruit harvest so no immediate impact will be experienced from the loss of our fruit packing facility none of the products we distribute for our vendors will be affected he concluded and just a few days before that a four alarm fire destroyed a very important food processing facility in salinas california authorities thursday lifted all evacuation and shelter in place orders in an area of salinas where a four alarm fire sparked a day earlier at a food processing plant prompting fears of a possible explosion and hazardous plume of ammonia city officials said the fire was initially reported at about 7 15 p m wednesday at the taylor farms processing facility on abbott street and prompted an order early thursday for evacuations affecting an estimated 2 700 people and a shelter in place order affecting an estimated 35 000 people if these were isolated incidents perhaps we never would have even taken notice of them but they aren t isolated incidents in fact fires have been mysteriously erupting at america s food processing facilities for many months this is absolutely not coincidental pic twitter com 6pjsoegijd kween josienn kweenjosie april 23 2022 strangely the latest fires happened during the same week that the fbi admitted that america s farmers are now being specifically targeted by ransomware attacks a new warning right now for local farmers the fbi says you need to be on alert for ransomware attacks as kdka money editor jon delano explains those attacks on farmers could impact the rest of us at the grocery store whether it s a dairy or poultry farm a cattle farm or a farm that grows grain farming is a key part of pennsylvania s economy could there be some relation between these two stories for now the fbi is not saying and most of the talking heads on television are assuring us that there is nothing to be concerned about and that everything will be just fine meanwhile more fires continue to make the news on sunday it was being reported that nearly a dozen wildfires had just roared through key agricultural areas of nebraska sunday was far from a day of rest for firefighters across much of the state as they continued to mop up nearly a dozen wildfires and remained alert for more by sunday morning the road 702 fire in the cambridge area covered 50 000 acres a much larger area than the 33 000 acres burned in the april 7 9 fire in gosper and furnas counties a management team from the rocky mountain area took command of the battle at 7 a m sunday morning and a total of 20 wildfires are ripping across new mexico as i write this article new mexico gov michelle lujan grisham has signed emergency declarations as 20 wildfires continued to burn sunday in nearly half of the state s drought stricken 33 counties i don t know how all of the things that i have discussed in this article tie together but what i do know is that all of them will have an impact on our food supply as i have discussed previously un officials are warning that we are heading into the worst global food crisis since world war ii do you remember when millions of people died of starvation in the 1980s and there were endless appeals on television asking us to give to the hungry well authorities are telling us that what is coming is going to be much worse than that a perfect storm of factors is combining to create the greatest stress on global food supplies that we have seen in modern times but most of the talking heads on television want you to believe that everything is under control and that better times are just around the corner you can believe them if you want but my recommendation is to get prepared for this crisis while you still can it is finally here michael s new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now available in paperback and for the kindle on amazon about the author my name is michael and my brand new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now available on amazon com in addition to my new book i

regularly recognized as leaders in the field individually and our firm is both feared and respected among the defense bar and the insurance bar we are proud to have recovered billions of dollars for our clients and the classes of shareholders we represent abbvie s alleged misconduct abbvie is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies the company s revenues will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda would require additional safety warnings for rinvoq and would delay

by jayadeva uyangoda april 16 2022 links international journal of socialist renewal reposted from social scientists association after 31st march 2022 sri lanka s politics is no longer what it has been it seems to have entered a qualitatively new phase it is still too early to say anything definite about the true magnitude and future directions of this newness its basic character and dimensions however are quite clear the direct democratic action of the group of citizens who protested in front of president gotabaya rajapaksa s residence in pengiriwatte mirihana has given rise to outcomes even they would not have quite anticipated it has shaken the very foundations of an autocratic authoritarian regime that was up until now perceived to be as strong as an immovable rock with that spontaneous action of citizen protest a new people s movement has emerged openly demanding some fundamental changes in the existing political order in a flash it has brought into direct and passionate political action a hitherto silent and politically passive body of citizens from a wide range of social backgrounds they are reclaiming their lost political agency as citizens shaking the foundations of the rajapaksa government is something that the country s political parties could not do for nearly three years yet through their voluntary spontaneous and direct political action sri lanka s citizens have now done that while insisting on the resignation of the president and the prime minister and all the mps in parliament it also demands some fundamental changes and transformations in the overall system of government in sri lanka thus this is a rare moment of sri lankan citizens political awakening they are now asserting their public duty to the common good of the larger political community young citizens in large numbers are spearheading this new movement of resistance and political hope this is sri lanka s long awaited moment of democracy this marks an extremely important milestone of a process geared towards reviving and preserving democratic politics in sri lanka against a backdrop of the quality of sri lanka s representative democracy in steady decline the direct entry of citizens into active politics in an important intervention it marks the inauguration of a new politics of critique resistance and democratic rebuilding in sri lanka this is all the more significant at a time when traditional institutions of democracy such as parliament and the judiciary have been mere onlookers of a steady decline of the country s political life it is therefore essential to assess the importance of this movement in order to appreciate its political potential and strengthen its constructive outcomes political dimensions the first positive dimension of the protest movement is that it has brought to an end one institutional consequence of sri lanka s representative democracy the notion of passive citizenship i have heard many of our political activists lamenting that sri lanka s democracy has produced voters but not citizens according to this complaint the sri lankan voters would fall prey to the false promises and blatant propaganda of politicians around times of elections cast their votes come back home and then fall into a long political sleep what we see now is that the citizens have shed this habit of political passivity to come forward and reclaim their role as politically active and responsible citizens politically alert and vocal citizens have begun to congregate at public gatherings and chant slogans of protest and resistance in unison to expose the misrule and misdeeds of a regime that has been showing an incredible degree of insensitivity to hardships that the people in the country have been undergoing for months this collective and direct political action of citizens amounts to the opening up of a social space for direct democracy and the inauguration of a new tradition of vigilant active and assertive democratic citizenship in sri lanka a second positive dimension has to do with the weakening and perhaps dismantling of the ideological hegemony so far maintained by the rajapaksa government and their sinhala nationalist cronies this owes largely to heightened political consciousness on the part of citizens the communalist ideological control that the rajapaksas had established over the sinhalese society has close parallels with india under narendra modi and the bharatiya janata party bjp sri lanka s citizens have set an example for the indian citizens too to return to their democratic secular and multi cultural roots breaking up the ideological straitjacket of ethno religious communalism the morning following the mirihana protests the president s media office attempted to arouse sinhalese communalism by making direct parallels with the arab spring it failed not only do citizens at the protests not use communally divisive slogans they also denounce the deployment of such reactionary ideologies thus the present protest movement is not only multi class but also multi ethnic multi cultural and diverse in its social bases and ideological orientation this signals another important feature of the present moment the economic and political crisis has opened up new space for building a democratic public with a political consciousness transcending ethnic and religious communalism the demos of sri lanka have returned reclaiming their place in the country s politics challenging the corrupt political oligarchs fourthly the protests highlight the message that the decaying political system including the specific form of democracy we have needs far reaching reform and the country s government and political structures as well as institutions need refashioning citizens have also lost trust in the undemocratic political institutions as well as the greedy corrupt inept and unreformable authoritarian political elites the present wave of protests by the citizens embodies a mixture of political reactions to this state of affairs disillusionment despair loss of trust anger and of course political hope for a fresh beginning that is why sri lanka s citizens have now decided to take democracy into their own hands through direct political action fifthly the citizens protests that spontaneously began to erupt throughout march 2022 should not be viewed as an isolated development despite their suddenness they are the culmination of a series of protests against the government that broke out throughout last year tamil citizens of the north seeking justice rural farmers expressing anger against the president s fertilizer policy and the public sector teachers and plantation workers demanding higher wages inaugurated different phases of this wave of citizen resistance hen came sporadic protests evening candle light vigils by urban middle class citizens at road intersections in kohuwala ratmalana rajagiriya pita kotte and in a few towns outside colombo what seems to have really tested the patience of sri lankan citizens during the past few weeks is the absolute failure of sri lanka s president and his government to ensure the basic everyday survival needs of the people electricity cooking gas diesel and petrol food and essential commodities regularly and at reasonable prices the rajapaksa administration s failure to govern is also its failure to run the state an elementary duty of an elected ruling class it pushed the rajapaksa regime into an unprecedented crisis of legitimacy seriously damaging its moral right to rule despite the veneer of constitutional legality it still commands the inability of the rulers to empathise with the suffering of the people caused by their own misrule is obviously what transformed people s sense of despair and torment into collective political anger and direct action in fact the month of march led to a moment in which the people of sri lanka saw an irreparable breach of the symbolic social contact between the rulers and the ruled finally the citizens direct action is not merely a protest movement slogans and demands of the protestors carry alternative visions and ideas of politics democracy and governance they call for re inventing sri lanka s parliamentary democracy in such a way that the parliament the electoral process and cabinet government are freed from the debilitating control exercised by the corrupt political class and their bureaucratic business and nepotistic cronies they are also demanding political parties to begin to represent the interests of the sri lankan people and not their financiers political brokers corporate allies or family members they seek a parliament and a new generation of parliamentarians who will honour the people s expectations for a genuinely democratic political order in which politicians are accountable to the people and directly answerable to their electors thus the call for such fundamental reforms to be affected to sri lanka s decayed system of politics and governance is no longer confined to radical left wing or civil society groups who traditionally raised such issues in the public domain it is now part of a powerful democratic call by young citizens too the people rejecting those parties and leaders that do not meet their reform expectations the citizens of our society are demanding that political parties and leaders abandon the old cultures of electoral politics sustained on false promises ideological manipulation patronage networks and ethno religious communalism unless political parties reform and reinvent themselves it would now be difficult for them to regain credibility legitimacy and even relevance in short the doors have been opened to re invent democratic politics in sri lanka to usher in a qualitatively new stage of political development the old order and its custodians are under severe pressure to give way to a new one this is the most important message of the citizens political activism with the youth at its core that emerged on the evening of march 31st in the past too sri lanka s youth have spoken politically but not in the language of democracy this time around the youth are speaking politically in the language of democracy peace and pluralism silently they seem to have inherited and internalised and saved for the appropriate moment the finest legacies of sri lanka s democracy and democratic modernity the challenge now is to continue to keep those doors open nourishing the citizens struggle and work to ensure that a process of political transformation is set in motion this is a serious affair and one that urgently requires discussion and debate the remainder of this essay is devoted to laying some groundwork for such a discussion to take off agency to resolve the crisis as we have already seen citizens are no longer satisfied with band aid solutions or fake promises the capacity of the established political parties to deliver anything else is under serious questioning particularly by the young citizens what their critique tells us is that finding solutions to sri lanka s present crisis is beyond the capacity of the political class and political parties that have been part of the problem this is the political essence of the slogan we don t want all 225 it is true that those who were part of the problem cannot be part of the solution yet the question remains who has the agency to provide and champion solutions through a reform programme can the protesting public do it on their own without an organisational arm or some form of minimum institutionalisation of their campaign shouldn t a broad coalition of citizens and citizens associations emerge to take the struggle forward these are questions that cannot be ignored by the citizens who participate in the campaigns and its well wishers as well the signs at present are that the protest campaign will intensify in the coming days and weeks with increasing numbers of citizens joining it power cuts shortages of gas diesel petrol kerosene food and medicine rising inflation falling living standards and arrested education of children will continue to haunt public life in the months to come solutions to the current economic crisis which the government is likely to implement in partnership with the international monetary fund will most likely have the potential to further hurt sri lanka s poor the working people and the middle classes no easy resolution of sri lanka s grave economic crisis is even conceivable moreover while the government is incapable of resolving the political crisis not much can be expected from the other political parties either this will lead to renewed frustration and anger on the part of the public more aggressive protests and greater potential of the protests spreading to other cities in other words it is inevitable that there will occur in the coming weeks a sharp polarisation of forces with an angered and politically fired up public on one side and an isolated government with diminished legitimacy to rule on the other there is also an on going political deadlock marked by a protracted contestation between a regime which has lost its legitimacy to rule and a parliamentary opposition with no parliamentary strength to replace the regime the main opposition parties samagi jana balavegaya sjb the united national party unp and the sri lanka freedom party slfp and tamil national alliance tna hardly have anything new or imaginative to contribute to finding a way out of the deadlock they equally lack credibility or legitimacy among the protesting citizens can these opposition parties in the political mainstream do anything different from their parliamentary politics as usual in order to initiate a dialogue with the protesting citizens it is indeed quite difficult for the protesting citizens and the mainstream opposition parties to build trust and discover a language of dialogue what is likely to happen is the shifting of the sympathies and loyalties of many rank and file members and voters of these parties to the emerging citizens force among the parties in parliament the one with at least a slight chance of winning public trust is the janatha vimukthi peramuna jvp however if the jvp leadership continues to play it safe without deciding on a politically strategic stance at this juncture they too might find themselves isolated from the protesting public they have to make sure that their support for the citizens struggle is not linked to their electoral agenda thus there is some measure of discomfort and tension in the relationship between the citizens protest movement and the opposition political parties it is due to the fact that the new movement has sprung up totally independent of the parties and is even rejecting the kind of politics that the latter have been identified with this is not surprising in view of the fact that during the past year or so there has been a sustained conversation among some sections of the sri lankan citizens on the need for a broad non party and inclusive democratic movement of citizens to take the sporadic people s struggles for social and economic justice forward that movement has now emerged with no prior warning the opposition political parties will be under pressure to reform or perish in the face of a new democratic challenge for which they have not been prepared the jvp seems to be feeling this pressure quite intensely a conundrum to overcome in this background the conundrum faced by the public as well as political parties is this can a voluntary citizens struggle under decentralised leadership without an organisational network with other citizens associations and movements and still awaiting a long term strategic vision continue to make sustained political interventions can it transform itself into a force with enough agency to deliver the kind of radical political change encompassing structural institutional and personnel aspects as articulated by its spokespersons and envisioned in the key slogans used in the protest the same question re emerges as follows whether the president prime minister and the cabinet resign or not a political vacuum will certainly emerge in the coming days because there are now two centres of power in the country a the president cabinet and parliament and the security apparatus on one hand and b citizens in protest occupying the galle face and demanding the resignation of the president prime minister and members of the ruling family on the other does a presently voluntary and spontaneous citizens movement have the capacity to step in to fill the inevitable political void is it necessary to think of a new kind of transitional interim arrangement until a new political order is born democratically and peacefully the point here is that the question of political power is certain to pose itself sooner or later in his public address the other day prime minister mahinda rajapaksa hinted at the question of political power a few times being a leading member of sri lanka s ruling class for a long time prime minister rajapaksa has sensed that what is at stake at present is political power the protesting citizens have also been raising that question indirectly and unintentionally and perhaps not as part of a conscious political strategy the choice before the citizens movement now is the classic conundrum faced by social movements seeking political change to remain an unconscious tool of history or to be a self conscious agency of political and social change the jvp s dilemma these questions are pertinent not only to the young leaderships at the forefront of the protest movement of citizens they are also difficult questions that the jvp needs to ask of itself the jvp also finds itself facing a dilemma in the face of on going protests the protests started independently of the jvp and perhaps without even the jvp s knowledge the party has publicly claimed on a number of occasions that it had no affiliation with the protests and protestors it is clear that the jvp has been over cautious about the possibility of agents provocateurs engineering violence amidst protest action in order to pin all blame on the jvp and justify a crackdown by the state such an acts or acts would eliminate the dual threat of both an angry citizens movement and a rising jvp however standing aloof from the protests will be politically costly for the jvp one option before them is to positively respond to the critique of the dominant political order that the protesting citizens have been advancing and reform their politics programme and vision accordingly the jvp now has the exciting option of learning the art of solidarity politics with movements that emerge outside their own template of radical politics and forming transformative political alliances this suggestion applies to the frontline socialist party fsp as well which has of late adopted a policy of openness towards alliances with other left parties the fsp seems to have worked out a flexible strategy to work in solidarity with the protesting youth constituencies the fact that the protesting public is rejecting all 225 in parliament has difficult implications for the jvp it should accept the political symbolism of that call it denotes the frustration sense of betrayal and the anger the citizens have been expressing towards the political elites parliamentarians parliamentary democracy institutions of representative democracy and the decadent political institutions and political class all parties including the jvp need to listen to the public critique of them and reform accordingly anyone who does not might have a rough future ahead the citizens movement on the other hand should ask itself two further questions the first is whether it can singlehandedly resolve the political crisis it has exposed so powerfully the class social basis of the movement is the middle class it is true that this class has become politically active and influential however it needs to ask itself a second related question of how it can link with the majority of the politically active people s groups in the country farmers associations workers unions professional groups women s groups student movements and the people of the north and east all of which are organised entities for social political action if the movement rejects established political parties a very constructive option available is to work together with movements that have a long history of struggle against injustice and for citizens rights obviously the time is now ripe for a broad coalition of progressive and democratic citizens movements and communities in sri lanka its core constituency will certainly be the protest movement of citizens such a coalition will be able to address the question of political power which has begun to enter the on going political contestation between the government and the citizens the citizens movement will have to confront these difficult questions in the coming weeks they are unavoidable they require deep reflection and discussion leading to solutions as well as alternatives this will invariably enable the citizens movement to move forward with greater conceptual and ideological clarity about its goals directions and strategies jayadeva uyangoda is emeritus professor of political science at the department of political science and public policy university of colombo sri lanka no agreement with the imf eric toussaint interviewed by sushovan dhar april 15 2022 links international journal of socialist renewal reposted from cadtm a sri lankan delegation will travel to washington next week to try to secure up to 4 billion from the international monetary fund and other lenders to help the island nation pay for food and fuel imports as well as stem defaults on its debt the last time the imf provided loan to sri lanka in 2016 the loan was capped at 1 5 billion and the program ended prematurely after disbursing 1 3 billion this was at a time when the economy was growing at about 5 percent and tourism contributed a similar percentage of gross domestic product however imf and world bank loans have always been surrounded by serious controversy critics believe that the world bank and imf have systematically lent to states to influence their policies external debt has been and continues to be used as an instrument to subordinate borrowers since their creation the imf and the world bank have violated international human rights covenants and have not hesitated to support dictatorships in an interview with sushovan dhar eric toussaint highlights the potential risks of an imf bailout sushovan dhar as you know the sri lankan government has announced a default on its debt what do you think about this eric toussaint the sri lankan government s decision to suspend the payment of the foreign debt from tuesday april 12 2022 shows how far it has stumbled the sri lankan working people have been on the streets for more than a week protesting against rising prices and anti social measures all members of the government resigned except the fact that the prime minister and the president remained in office it is important to note that the prime minister and the president are brothers which is an important factor in understanding how the political system works in sri lanka it is an ultra neoliberal government completely in favour of the interests of big business both domestic and foreign it is in an attempt to placate the population and also because there is not enough money left in the state coffers and in the foreign exchange reserves that the government has been forced to suspend payments in reality since at least the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic the debt payments should have been suspended in order to reallocate government spending to tackle the effects of the pandemic protect the population from the virus and invest in the economy in order to deal with the global economic crisis accelerated by the pandemic on the contrary since the beginning of the pandemic the government has been determined to continue paying off the debt the debt has continued to mount because the government has financed with new debt a series of measures it was taking to deal with the crisis it has also used new debt to repay old debts when as i have just said it should have suspended the payment of the debt a people s government would have suspended debt payments on the grounds that the decision was prompted by external shocks that required the country to protect its citizens in doing so the government would have used arguments under international law to avoid paying interest on arrears such a people s government would have had to combine the suspension of debt repayment with an audit of the debts reclaimed to sri lanka and the policies pursued by the sri lankan political ruling classes an audit with citizens participation to identify illegitimate debts and the responsibilities of senior officials and leaders in the accrual of illegitimate and unsustainable debt on the basis of the audit of the debt linked to a suspension of payments a policy of repudiation of the debt should have been pursued this should have been done i repeat within the framework of a new government since it is the current government that by following the neoliberal logic is responsible for the continued accumulation of illegitimate debt sushovan dhar in the current circumstances where foreign exchange reserves are extremely low the government says it has no choice but to borrow from the imf what are we to make of this eric toussaint let s return to the decision made on tuesday april 12 and analyze it in a very critical way why well firstly it was taken in consultation with the international monetary fund imf and large private creditors like blackrock that is it was in the interest of the creditors that the government suspended the payment secondly it announced that it would agree to pay the interest in full and that its desire was to resume payment of the debt as soon as possible thirdly the government in negotiating with creditors including the imf will seek an emergency credit to be able to guarantee the resumption of debt repayment to the imf to private creditors and to other creditors so sri lanka will take on new debts to pay off old ones many of which are illegitimate the fourth point of my criticism is that once the government enters into an agreement with the imf the imf will demand fiscal austerity measures that will inevitably make the working classes pay for the adjustment effort and the budgetary austerity effort the government with the support of the imf will try to obtain a reduction in the stock of debt owed to private creditors this is usually what happens in these circumstances and it is what has happened over the last three years in argentina with the help of the imf the argentine government renegotiated the debt with private creditors and obtained a very small reduction in the payments to be made in doing so it tried to re legitimize the debt that was illegitimate and should not have been paid this is what the current sri lankan government is about to do and therefore one can only disagree strongly with its strategy sushovan dhar if sri lanka suspends payment of its debt wouldn t that be illegal under international law eric toussaint i have explained what should have been done at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic now let me turn to what should be done today instead of what the government is doing yes we need to suspend the debt payments we must use a series of arguments based on international law and the justification must not be limited to saying that we do not have enough money to pay a government that really wants to act in the interest of the population should announce that it is suspending the payment of the debt because there are external shocks that do not depend on sri lanka that reduce the income to the state coffers external shocks force the country to suspend the payment of the debt in such circumstances this suspension cannot lead to an accumulation of interest on arrears contrary to what the government says a country like sri lanka has the right to suspend debt payments if there are good reasons to do so including a fundamental change in circumstances international law allows a country to declare itself in the suspension of payment without its creditors being able to demand the payment of interest on arrears afterwards secondly an audit of the debts should absolutely be carried out we must audit the debts issued on the international markets the holders of these debts must be forced to come forward by a sovereign decision of sri lanka therefore the secrecy of the identity of the holders of securities should not be accepted the audit must also cover the debts claimed by the international monetary fund and the world bank here it is absolutely clear that the policies recommended by these two institutions are largely responsible for the accumulation of illegitimate debts and the application of an economic model that has led the country and the people to disaster it is very clear that the imf and other international bodies support the country s corrupt authoritarian authorities which are in place because they serve the interests of domestic and foreign big business china india and washington are so far in favour of keeping this regime in place because it serves the interests of foreign capital and big foreign powers the local ruling class which is largely parasitic also wants the regime to remain in place this regime does not respect democratic rules implements anti social policies and faces clear popular discontent the debt audit must be carried out with the participation of social movements it must result in determining which part of the debt is illegitimate and should not be paid generally the commentators of the sri lankan situation the mainstream press say that the situation is dramatic because the value of sri lankan securities is falling very sharply on the secondary debt market the secondary debt market is where the holders of sri lankan sovereign debt which could be blackrock and other investment funds but also banks are selling or buying them back sri lankan securities are currently selling at a discount if i am well informed of around 60 contrary to the idea that the mainstream media is trying to convey the fact that there is a very large discount on sri lankan securities is not at all bad news for the sri lankan people or for the working classes what it does show is that bondholders are worried they are not sure whether the government will be able to continue to repay the debt and so this is a good time to cause an even greater fall in the value of the bonds because it would allow a new government to buy back these bonds on the secondary market at a very low price while the payment is suspended this is what the government of ecuador did in 2008 2009 and it was beneficial for the country and for the people sushovan dhar what is the way out of this debt trap for sri lanka or any other country eric toussaint what i have just said is in contradiction to the strategy of the government the government wants to get a loan from the imf to resume debt payments to the bondholders and sit down at the negotiating table with them and ask them to reduce the value of the bonds by 10 to 20 per cent when it could be reduced by 80 per cent which would be much better for the country if sri lanka resumes payments with the money that the imf will lend it the bondholders will be in a strong position whereas if sri lanka does not take the imf money and remains sovereign if it refuses the austerity policies that the imf is about to mandate if it continues the suspension of debt payments it would be in a strong position to demand the bondholders to sell their bonds back to the government at an 80 discount this is the kind of policy that was followed by ecuador in 2008 and that resulted in a victory for ecuador in 2009 there ecuador had bought back these securities with a 70 discount but they had bought back on the secondary market part of the securities with an 80 discount so the discount had been very important given the severity of sri lanka s situation with this suspension of payment they could get a very large write off on the securities but i don t think that s possible with the current president and prime minister they are not at all ready to apply this kind of measure so the question is not just what measures to take it s who can take these measures it is a question of popular mobilization the popular classes should give themselves a new legitimate government and this new government should apply a policy that is totally in line with the interests of the overwhelming majority of society if this does not happen in the short to medium term sri lanka will be faced with a debt burden that will increase because of the new loan from the imf and other loans that sri lanka is taking from india china or other creditors so sri lanka following the policy of the prime minister and the president of the republic is going to sink into a permanent and vicious cycle of indebtedness the adverse effects of the neo liberal policy will further deepen the fragility of its economy and worsen the living conditions of the majority of the people sushovan dhar what do you think of the position taken by around a dozen sri lankan economists who claim to be independent eric toussaint this group of around a dozen economists who call themselves independent have published an op ed in the sri lankan press explaining their vision of what should be done and all the points that are indicated correspond exactly to the type of policies demanded by the international monetary fund and the world bank one can take their proposals point by point analyze the agreements made with the various countries including sri lanka with the imf and observe that the measures proposed by these so called independent economists are precisely in line with the nefarious policies that the international monetary fund wants what these economists propose is also perfectly in line with the interests of the big private creditors moreover they suggest calling upon private firms specialized in debt restructuring these private firms work on behalf of large private creditors and are not at all in the interest of the people who live in the countries forced to pay illegitimate debts thus these private firms offer no safeguards in defending the interests of the people of sri lanka

consumers with accumulated savings look determined to spend them on trips they missed during the height of the pandemic normally we would see an impact on travel but there is a lot of pent up demand

full impact is only just starting to be felt although pandemic savings will cushion some wealthier consumers for a time those on lower incomes will be the first to feel the squeeze as staples account

danone and procter gamble all said last week they had increased prices by about 5 per cent in the three months to march without pushing down sales but as the pressure grows households may switch to

piers morgan has said many people want the bbc to be more like the american podcast giant joe rogan and be willing to explore more roads of debate the interview with bbc s ros atkins also saw him talk about his departure from good morning britain cancel culture and go on to say that the bbc has its own problems when it came to reporting the facts and he said he would love to have j k rowling on as a guest on his new talk show morgan told the bbc s media show that a lot of people would criticise the bbc for refusing to ever go down the roads of debate joe rogan sometimes does because they believe they have the truth the us stand up comedian and ufc commentator has been accused of spreading misinformation during the covid 19 pandemic however morgan said we know in the pandemic that scientists have changed their own minds many times whether it be about the efficacy of masks whether it be about the ability of vaccines to prevent transmission i myself have changed my view about coronavirus many times the comments come ahead of the launch of his new show piers morgan uncensored for rupert murdoch s new talktv channel he told the media show s ross atkins it s a show that defends free speech it s a show that i think will uphold the pillars of democracy in a time when society is i think under more threat to free speech and freedom of expression than i have known it in my lifetime regarding his time on good morning britain he said i felt the show was on fire saying it created a national debate about whatever the issues may be the sadness to me was itv had always been unbelievably strong in protecting my right to express my honestly held opinions to the end and then suddenly they lost their bottle on leaving the show he claimed the duchess of sussex had written to itv s chief executive dame carolyn mccall demanding my head on a plate i was told either you issue a public apology for effectively disbelieving meghan markle because i had disbelieved what she had told oprah winfrey or i had to give up the show that i loved if they itv had defended my right to free speech then i wouldn t have been asked to apologise or leave my job ofcom later came back and defended my right to free speech when questioned about concerns raised by ofcom and mind about dismissing meghan s claims she was having suicidal thoughts morgan doubled down and said there was not a shred of evidence that meghan had asked the royal family for help or to support her over either of the two racism claims on cancel culture he said he d love to get j k rowling on his new show and said the author has been appallingly vilified and there has been a massive attempt to cancel her it s been unsuccessful because she s extremely wealthy the abuse that has been meted out to her for effectively defending women s rights has been a complete disgrace added morgan discussing kathleen stock a university professor whose views on trans issues sparked anger among some students at the university of sussex he said do people like kathleen stock lose their jobs for having an honestly held opinion and is that right in a democratic society do want to see university professors driven out of their jobs by a bunch of students atkins asked morgan if he would have on a guest on who suggested vaccines against covid didn t work morgan replied yes because i d want to expose that thought process which i think has been extremely dangerous i d want to expose them with facts there are a lot of people who think this and they ve been encouraged to think it by a lot of nonsense on the internet i would let them set out their stall tell me where they ve heard this why they believe this and then damn them with facts asked would he put someone on air to challenge unproven claims that the drug ivermectin can be used to treat covid morgan said joe rogan did that on his show and it was very interesting he discussed it at length with dr sanjay gupta from cnn and it was a really interesting debate about which of these theories which have got a huge following now around the world during the pandemic which of them have any merit or not i think a lot of people would criticise the bbc for refusing to ever go down these roads of debate because they believe they have the truth and yet we know in the pandemic that scientists have changed their own minds many times whether it be about the efficacy of masks whether it be about the ability of vaccines to prevent transmission i myself have changed my view about coronavirus many times and he was quick to defend fox when the bbc presenter said it was a network with a long track record of saying things that are not rooted in fact morgan responded do you feel as uncomfortable about the time i ve spent at cnn given the way that cnn has gone in the last few years given their obsession for example with russian collusion cnn is the bbc of the states in many ways it s a network people look at and say everything they say must be truthful and factual for two years they spun a load of old baloney about donald trump being in cahoots with the russians to fix the 216 election it turned out to be nonsense the bbc has its own problems as much as you all like to put your halos on and say oh piers how can you work with these ghastly people i look around the bbc sometimes and think hmmm martin bashir it s a bit awkward for everybody isn t it he also said he thought the editorial standards at fox news were pretty high and he was very happy to work there the interview can be watched here on iplayer for more stories

in poland near the border with ukraine secretary of state antony blinken and defense secretary lloyd austin on the heels of a trip to kyiv pledged ongoing american support to ukraine as it faces the prospect of a protracted war against russia speaking in a hangar in poland filled with crates of humanitarian aid including diapers destined for ukraine the two top biden administration officials said ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky had expressed deep appreciation to the united states our support for ukraine going forward will continue until we see final success blinken said after the first high level u s visit to the ukrainian capital since russia s invasion began the bottom line is this we don t know how the rest of this war will unfold but we do know that a sovereign independent ukraine will be around a lot longer than vladimir putin is on the scene advertisement officials described the three hour visit in kyiv following stops there in recent weeks by a number of european leaders as a symbolic show of support for ukraine s leaders and a message of western resolve to the kremlin the officials who traveled from poland by train said they informed zelensky of new military aid and the administration s intent to resume diplomatic operations in ukraine this week marking the return of u s diplomats for the first time since russia s feb 24 invasion diplomats will begin by making day trips from poland to ukraine s western city of lviv where ukrainians and foreigners have sought shelter from the violence raging elsewhere in the country a first step to reopening the u s embassy that was shuttered before the invasion officials said ahead of blinken s remarks other nations including britain have announced a resumption of embassy operations in kyiv and blinken said the u s embassy would probably reopen there within weeks the two u s leaders said their visit to the ukrainian capital which russian forces were unable to capture despite an attempt in the initial weeks of the war highlighted the failure of putin s aims in ukraine advertisement officials outlined additional steps that blinken and austin relayed to ukrainian officials during their brief stay in the capital where they also met with ukraine s foreign and interior ministers they asked reporters to withhold the name of the location in poland that blinken and austin used as the jumping off point for their visit because of security reasons the biden administration will announce the nomination of bridget brink a career diplomat who serves as ambassador to slovakia as ambassador to ukraine blinken said there has been no confirmed u s ambassador to ukraine since marie yovanovitch was ousted in 2019 the officials also brought with them promises of additional security aid including more than 300 million in military financing for ukraine allowing it to buy more sophisticated air defense systems and stockpile arms compatible with those used by nato nations instead of soviet designed weapons about 400 million more goes to help other countries purchase new weapons to boost their stocks or in some cases replenish arms provided to ukraine advertisement the new pledge brings the amount the biden administration has given ukraine in security assistance since the beginning of the war to about 3 7 billion austin said the united states would respond to ukraine s military needs as the war evolves with the fight shifting to eastern and southern ukraine where russia is seeking to cement control of areas around crimea and in regions where russian backed separatists have been fighting kyiv since 2014 austin said ukrainian forces would now need more tanks and long range munitions we re going to push as hard as quickly as we can to get them what they need he said another senior state department official said the depletion of russian hardware and forces in the war in combination with sanctions and commercial restrictions was hurting russia s ability to resupply itself in ukraine and maintain military readiness at home advertisement they re starting to get into a trade off between what they can put into ukraine and what they need to hold in reserve as something to match up against nato the official said share this article share he noted that some nonmember states in europe including finland now appear to be moving toward joining the alliance which he described as another element russia would see as a threat this is a strategic debacle for putin the united states and other nato nations have expanded the flow of weaponry to ukraine in recent weeks but have stopped short of providing fighter jets or as zelensky demanded in the first weeks of the war a nato enforced no fly zone a senior u s defense official said austin would update zelensky on the promised deliveries of howitzers and the ongoing training of ukrainian troops on u s artillery systems part of a previously announced set of u s allocations officials declined to identify where the training is being conducted advertisement the biden administration will also sell ukraine up to 165 million in nonstandard ammunition it can use for its existing weapons systems the first step in winning is believing you can win they believe that can win we believe that they can win if they have the right equipment the right support austin said we re going to continue to do everything we can to ensure that that gets secretary of state antony blinken and secretary of defense lloyd austin held a joint news conference in poland on april 25 after their kyiv visit video the washington post after his kyiv visit austin will travel to germany for a meeting on tuesday with defense officials from a number of countries including ukraine gen mark a milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff is also traveling in the region and will join austin on tuesday for the meeting with more than 40 nato and non nato defense leaders at ramstein air base in germany the conference s aim milley said is to solicit new military aid and to coordinate synchronize our efforts over the next several weeks advertisement i think it s accurate that the next several weeks will be very very critical for the outcome of this battle that s shaping up down in the south the southeast of ukraine milley told reporters at ramstein where he arrived sunday night what we want to do is make sure the right type of aid is getting to the right location at the right time in the right quantities and make sure it s all properly synchronized to achieve the desired effect and outcome on the battlefield he said officials said reestablishing the diplomatic presence within ukraine will allow embassy staffers to coordinate more closely with ukrainian officials and eventually provide more consular services this is the first step and we expect to be able to accelerate that in the coming days and weeks the state department official said advertisement the defense official said the pentagon still views ukraine s port of mariupol as contested despite russian statements about having completed a prolonged campaign to seize the city which is on the sea of azov for all the russian claims that they ve got it is certainly not acting like an army that thinks they ve got it because they continue to hit mariupol he said he said moscow had assigned about a dozen russian tactical groups to the key southern port mariupol a major russian objective could help russia secure a land bridge to crimea which moscow annexed in 2014 and could be used as a jumping off point for attempts to push north into other parts of ukraine the official said fighting in the greater donbas region which includes mariupol and areas held by russian backed separatists remained inconclusive

boost your passive income stream with these industry leading companies during a stock market sell off strong fundamentals and a reasonable valuation matter more than ever no one knows what will happen in the short term but profitable businesses that can support stable and growing dividends give investors a passive income stream that compensates them for their patience 3m mmm 0 01 caterpillar cat 0 47 and starbucks sbux 0 29 are three excellent dividend stocks that also happen to have inexpensive valuations here s what makes each a great buy now 3m is too cheap to ignore 3m has many of the same problems as other industrial conglomerates right now it s struggling to offset higher costs caused by inflation plus it s dealing with the lingering supply chain bottlenecks and pandemic induced challenges 3m is also still in the process of a restructuring that is meant to streamline its operations and boost growth but at least in the short term 3m s growth prospects are paltry in its strategic update and 2022 outlook from feb 14 3m said it expects 1 to 4 year over year sales growth 2 to 5 organic sales growth earnings per share between 10 15 and 10 65 compared to 10 12 in 2021 and operating cash flow of 7 3 billion to 7 9 billion compared to 7 5 billion in 2021 however the inflation situation has escalated since 3m reported its forecast which could mean the company will lower its full year guidance when it reports its first quarter 2022 results on april 26 what 3m has going for it is a dirt cheap valuation a strong balance sheet and a high dividend yield 3m has a price to earnings p e ratio of 14 6 and a forward p e ratio of 14 2 3m also has net total long term debt of just 12 6 billion a debt to capital ratio of 53 6 and a financial debt to equity ratio of 0 17 all of which indicate the company s balance sheet remains healthy despite 3m s lackluster performance in recent years 3m is also a dividend king which is an s p 500 component that has paid and raised its dividend for at least 50 years 3m has a dividend yield of 4 caterpillar stock isn t expensive despite being near an all time high unlike 3m which is more of an income stock value stock combo right now caterpillar is a great dividend stock with tons of upside potential but with a forward p e ratio of just 18 7 caterpillar is also not an expensive stock caterpillar s upside comes from its exposure to oil and gas marine transportation rail transportation agriculture and mining all of which are industries that could be in for a multiyear up cycle oil and gas had a banner year in 2021 and might very well eclipse it in 2022 as the u s energy information administration is guiding for west texas intermediate crude oil prices to average 97 96 in 2022 and 88 57 per barrel in 2023 compared to 68 21 in 2021 and 39 17 in 2020 what s more supply demand imbalances with commodities and food are leading to higher prices which boosts margins for caterpillar s customers and incentivizes them to consider purchasing new equipment to top it all off caterpillar is a dividend aristocrat which is an s p 500 component that has paid and raised its dividend for at least 25 years caterpillar has a dividend yield of 2 1 starbucks dividend yield has risen as its stock price has fallen starbucks isn t typically top of mind when it comes to dividend stocks but with a dividend yield of 2 4 starbucks has a higher yield than many classic dividend stocks like procter gamble or johnson johnson and arguably much better growth prospects starbucks stock has come under pressure as investors grapple with a leadership change inflation unionization and the company s decision to suspend share buybacks coming off its highest revenue year in company history there s reason to believe that starbucks results could suffer in fiscal 2022 however the company has plenty of positives going for it too its rewards program is stronger than ever more and more people are mobile ordering and using its drive thrus which improves efficiency and starbucks can focus more on grab and go ordering by building smaller stores that focus specifically on takeout orders starbucks stock is down 40 from its all time high and hovering right around a 52 week low and although the company has suspended share repurchases in favor of allocating capital toward the business it hasn t shown any signs that is it going to stop raising the dividend starbucks began paying its dividend in 2010 and raised it every year from 2011 to 2021 like 3m and caterpillar starbucks rakes in plenty of free cash flow fcf to support its dividend free cash flow yield is simply the fcf of a business divided by its market cap or fcf per share over the share price whereas a dividend yield is the dividend per share divided by the share price as you can see in the chart all three companies have an fcf yield that is higher than their dividend yield put another way each company earns more fcf than it pays in dividends this is a good sign that they can support future dividend raises in starbucks case it only uses about half of its fcf to pay its dividend which means it has plenty of extra cash to reinvest in the business and support future raises starbucks also has a p e ratio of just 21 5 dividend stocks at a good value investing in equal parts of 3m caterpillar and starbucks gives an investor an average dividend yield of 2 8 3m has the slowest growth and the bulkiest business but it also is the least expensive stock of the three caterpillar stock has crushed the market so far in 2022 but it still looks cheap however investors should keep in mind that caterpillar is coming off a record year and as a cyclical stock its valuation is going to look a lot cheaper in boom years and wildly expensive during down years starbucks is a nice blend of income value and growth that is likely to face a lot of short term headaches but its long term investment thesis remains intact
piers morgan has said many people want the bbc to be more like the american podcast giant joe rogan and be willing to explore more roads of debate the interview with bbc s ros atkins also saw him talk about his departure from good morning britain cancel culture and go on to say that the bbc has its own problems when it came to reporting the facts and he said he would love to have j k rowling on as a guest on his new talk show morgan told the bbc s media show that a lot of people would criticise the bbc for refusing to ever go down the roads of debate joe rogan sometimes does because they believe they have the truth the us stand up comedian and ufc commentator has been accused of spreading misinformation during the covid 19 pandemic however morgan said we know in the pandemic that scientists have changed their own minds many times whether it be about the efficacy of masks whether it be about the ability of vaccines to prevent transmission i myself have changed my view about coronavirus many times the comments come ahead of the launch of his new show piers morgan uncensored for rupert murdoch s new talktv channel he told the media show s ross atkins it s a show that defends free speech it s a show that i think will uphold the pillars of democracy in a time when society is i think under more threat to free speech and freedom of expression than i have known it in my lifetime regarding his time on good morning britain he said i felt the show was on fire saying it created a national debate about whatever the issues may be the sadness to me was itv had always been unbelievably strong in protecting my right to express my honestly held opinions to the end and then suddenly they lost their bottle on leaving the show he claimed the duchess of sussex had written to itv s chief executive dame carolyn mccall demanding my head on a plate i was told either you issue a public apology for effectively disbelieving meghan markle because i had disbelieved what she had told oprah winfrey or i had to give up the show that i loved if they itv had defended my right to free speech then i wouldn t have been asked to apologise or leave my job ofcom later came back and defended my right to free speech when questioned about concerns raised by ofcom and mind about dismissing meghan s claims she was having suicidal thoughts morgan doubled down and said there was not a shred of evidence that meghan had asked the royal family for help or to support her over either of the two racism claims on cancel culture he said he d love to get j k rowling on his new show and said the author has been appallingly vilified and there has been a massive attempt to cancel her it s been unsuccessful because she s extremely wealthy the abuse that has been meted out to her for effectively defending women s rights has been a complete disgrace added morgan discussing kathleen stock a university professor whose views on trans issues sparked anger among some students at the university of sussex he said do people like kathleen stock lose their jobs for having an honestly held opinion and is that right in a democratic society do want to see university professors driven out of their jobs by a bunch of students atkins asked morgan if he would have on a guest on who suggested vaccines against covid didn t work morgan replied yes because i d want to expose that thought process which i think has been extremely dangerous i d want to expose them with facts there are a lot of people who think this and they ve been encouraged to think it by a lot of nonsense on the internet i would let them set out their stall tell me where they ve heard this why they believe this and then damn them with facts asked would he put someone on air to challenge unproven claims that the drug ivermectin can be used to treat covid morgan said joe rogan did that on his show and it was very interesting he discussed it at length with dr sanjay gupta from cnn and it was a really interesting debate about which of these theories which have got a huge following now around the world during the pandemic which of them have any merit or not i think a lot of people would criticise the bbc for refusing to ever go down these roads of debate because they believe they have the truth and yet we know in the pandemic that scientists have changed their own minds many times whether it be about the efficacy of masks whether it be about the ability of vaccines to prevent transmission i myself have changed my view about coronavirus many times and he was quick to defend fox when the bbc presenter said it was a network with a long track record of saying things that are not rooted in fact morgan responded do you feel as uncomfortable about the time i ve spent at cnn given the way that cnn has gone in the last few years given their obsession for example with russian collusion cnn is the bbc of the states in many ways it s a network people look at and say everything they say must be truthful and factual for two years they spun a load of old baloney about donald trump being in cahoots with the russians to fix the 216 election it turned out to be nonsense the bbc has its own problems as much as you all like to put your halos on and say oh piers how can you work with these ghastly people i look around the bbc sometimes and think hmmm martin bashir it s a bit awkward for everybody isn t it he also said he thought the editorial standards at fox news were pretty high and he was very happy to work there the interview can be watched here on iplayer for more stories

piers morgan has said many people want the bbc to be more like the american podcast giant joe rogan and be willing to explore more roads of debate the interview with bbc s ros atkins also saw him talk about his departure from good morning britain cancel culture and go on to say that the bbc has its own problems when it came to reporting the facts and he said he would love to have j k rowling on as a guest on his new talk show morgan told the bbc s media show that a lot of people would criticise the bbc for refusing to ever go down the roads of debate joe rogan sometimes does because they believe they have the truth the us stand up comedian and ufc commentator has been accused of spreading misinformation during the covid 19 pandemic however morgan said we know in the pandemic that scientists have changed their own minds many times whether it be about the efficacy of masks whether it be about the ability of vaccines to prevent transmission i myself have changed my view about coronavirus many times the comments come ahead of the launch of his new show piers morgan uncensored for rupert murdoch s new talktv channel he told the media show s ross atkins it s a show that defends free speech it s a show that i think will uphold the pillars of democracy in a time when society is i think under more threat to free speech and freedom of expression than i have known it in my lifetime regarding his time on good morning britain he said i felt the show was on fire saying it created a national debate about whatever the issues may be the sadness to me was itv had always been unbelievably strong in protecting my right to express my honestly held opinions to the end and then suddenly they lost their bottle on leaving the show he claimed the duchess of sussex had written to itv s chief executive dame carolyn mccall demanding my head on a plate i was told either you issue a public apology for effectively disbelieving meghan markle because i had disbelieved what she had told oprah winfrey or i had to give up the show that i loved if they itv had defended my right to free speech then i wouldn t have been asked to apologise or leave my job ofcom later came back and defended my right to free speech when questioned about concerns raised by ofcom and mind about dismissing meghan s claims she was having suicidal thoughts morgan doubled down and said there was not a shred of evidence that meghan had asked the royal family for help or to support her over either of the two racism claims on cancel culture he said he d love to get j k rowling on his new show and said the author has been appallingly vilified and there has been a massive attempt to cancel her it s been unsuccessful because she s extremely wealthy the abuse that has been meted out to her for effectively defending women s rights has been a complete disgrace added morgan discussing kathleen stock a university professor whose views on trans issues sparked anger among some students at the university of sussex he said do people like kathleen stock lose their jobs for having an honestly held opinion and is that right in a democratic society do want to see university professors driven out of their jobs by a bunch of students atkins asked morgan if he would have on a guest on who suggested vaccines against covid didn t work morgan replied yes because i d want to expose that thought process which i think has been extremely dangerous i d want to expose them with facts there are a lot of people who think this and they ve been encouraged to think it by a lot of nonsense on the internet i would let them set out their stall tell me where they ve heard this why they believe this and then damn them with facts asked would he put someone on air to challenge unproven claims that the drug ivermectin can be used to treat covid morgan said joe rogan did that on his show and it was very interesting he discussed it at length with dr sanjay gupta from cnn and it was a really interesting debate about which of these theories which have got a huge following now around the world during the pandemic which of them have any merit or not i think a lot of people would criticise the bbc for refusing to ever go down these roads of debate because they believe they have the truth and yet we know in the pandemic that scientists have changed their own minds many times whether it be about the efficacy of masks whether it be about the ability of vaccines to prevent transmission i myself have changed my view about coronavirus many times and he was quick to defend fox when the bbc presenter said it was a network with a long track record of saying things that are not rooted in fact morgan responded do you feel as uncomfortable about the time i ve spent at cnn given the way that cnn has gone in the last few years given their obsession for example with russian collusion cnn is the bbc of the states in many ways it s a network people look at and say everything they say must be truthful and factual for two years they spun a load of old baloney about donald trump being in cahoots with the russians to fix the 216 election it turned out to be nonsense the bbc has its own problems as much as you all like to put your halos on and say oh piers how can you work with these ghastly people i look around the bbc sometimes and think hmmm martin bashir it s a bit awkward for everybody isn t it he also said he thought the editorial standards at fox news were pretty high and he was very happy to work there the interview can be watched here on iplayer for more stories
