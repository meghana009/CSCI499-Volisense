discussing private information a pension fund for pennsylvania state employees hasn t committed new cash to chinese private equity funds in the past 12 months while florida s pension system has halted new investments in china as it assesses the risks such reluctance meant that u s dollar denominated fund that invest in china raised 1 4 billion in the first quarter a third consecutive quarter of declines and the lowest amount for the same period since 2018 according to research firm preqin the pullback is hitting even high profile china names ex goldman sachs group inc rainmaker fred hu s fund is still 500 million to 1 billion shy of its maximum raise with time running short firms in previous years had little problem reaching the so called hard cap china s investment landscape is in turmoil with some top investors shunning the nation after president xi jinping unleashed a broad crackdown on the private sector reining in technology giants such as tencent holdings ltd and alibaba group holding ltd the u s has also slapped sanctions on chinese firms and delisted some companies from markets in new york now china s close relationship with russia and continuing travel restrictions in mainland china and hong kong are adding to risks as chinese stocks tank and public listings stall exits by private equity firms have been subdued industry watchers say a shakeout is coming after years of breakneck growth the number of active china private equity managers in 2019 2021 reached about 1 200 up 25 from previous three year period according to bain co newer and smaller funds without solid track records are now being hardest hit and the sector is set for a consolidation if the caution continues the people said even established names are taking longer to pull in investors hu s primavera capital group was able to close on its 4 billion target but now has just two months left to reach its hard cap of 4 5 billion to 5 billion the people said the firm has yet to decide if it will need an extension before its deadline expires end of may they said founded by goldman sachs group inc alumni frank tang fountainvest partners is also short of its hard cap target after starting fundraising in late 2020 the people said a spokesman at primavera declined to comment text messages and emails to fountainvest s tang weren t answered a successful fundraising typically takes less than 18 months to exceed the hard cap the maximum size that s stipulated in limited partnership agreements tapped out thomas derr a spokesman for the 40 billion pennsylvania state employees retirement system said it hasn t debated or taken a position with regard to reducing investments in china it has about 2 of exposure to china harvard declined to provide information about its share of investments in china given the uncertainties in emerging markets florida s state board of administration has for now stopped funding new investment strategies in china as it continues to assess the attendant risks according to kent perez deputy executive director the pension fund reported this at a public meeting in march outlining action taken following the completion of a survey on its china holdings earlier in 2022 perez said the fund had less than 3 of its 253 billion in assets as of january which includes the florida retirement system invested in china the washington state investment board which has 3 5 of its 156 billion invested in chinese assets is conducting a periodic analysis of risk including china as geopolitical issues are getting a high degree of attention staff will present findings later this month said chris phillips a spokesman emerging markets are often a natural part of the risk report phillips said we spend a lot of time analyzing risk but it rarely results in any short term change in investment strategy the reduced overall allocations come after many u s pension funds are actually tapped out in terms of capital capacity for new managers one of the people said still some endowments and family office funds might still want to over allocate to china hunting for venture capital managers focused on health care due to their outsized returns the people said michigan state university isn t changing strategy when it comes to china which accounts for about 2 of its 4 billion endowment it invested 50 million in china long short hedge fund at the end of 2021 we re not looking to pull back anything said phil zecher chief investment officer we re always concerned about governance issues anywhere we invest whether it s corporate governance in the u s or the countries that we have exposure to but alternative investors are shifting their preferences to other asian markets at least in the short term a survey by preqin showed half of the 350 respondents viewed southeast asia as the best opportunity within emerging markets at the end of last year up from 37 a year earlier the shift reflects some investors delaying planned capital commitments into china the research firm said many global investors in 2021 were focused on re ups allocating to the same manager in previous rounds and focusing on those with geographical spread in asia rather than country specific mandate the people said blackstone inc in january raised 6 4 billion in asia with almost 100 of the investors in its first fund taking part in the second pool of capital so called exits or when private equity firms cash in on their investments dropped by more 30 in the second half of the year from the first six months of 2021 according to bain just 35 of chinese investment managers were confident in the country s outlook a sharply divergent view that may signal a fundamental change in china s performance in 2022 bain said that compares with more than

there has been an unspoken assumption that the west knows what it s doing because it has been doing it longer than the east almost all developed economies are in western europe and north america yet recently the tables have turned in one vital respect energy policy during the last few years the eu has doubled down on its ambition to become the world s first net zero region it has built up massive amounts of renewable energy has slated huge investments in green hydrogen and has been adopting policy after policy to discourage the consumption of fossil fuels in the u s the big push into renewables started two years ago as president joe biden took office the transition from a fossil fuel based economy to one based on and fueled by renewable energy was a central tenet in his campaign and he got to work from day one banning the keystone xl pipeline from canada and soon after temporarily banning oil and gas drilling on federal lands meanwhile far far away in the east opec was formed to include two of the world s largest oil producers russia and saudi arabia as well as the central asian oil producers from the former soviet union including kazakhstan and azerbaijan the expanded cartel hasn t always seen eye to eye and just before the pandemic really blew up the russians and the saudis engaged in a brief price war yet since then opec has worked like a well oiled machine the eu the uk and the united states have raced to install more wind turbines more solar panels and more storage and carmakers almost all based in either europe or the u s have equally raced to commit tens of billions of dollars to the electrification of transport those races are both based on the paris agreement and the goal of reducing the rise in global average temperatures by 1 5 or 2 degrees celsius from pre industrial levels related jp morgan commodities could surge by another 40 while the west has been busy with that opec headed by russia and saudi arabia has been pumping as much oil as it has seen fit at any given moment in addition to that russia has kept its metals and uranium industry going and has continued to forge closer ties with the far east with a focus on china saudi arabia meanwhile has staked a claim in the mining world and has allocated tens of billions on renewable energy and smart tech investment what this means basically is while the west has enthusiastically focused on the final section of the energy supply chain the wind turbines the panels and the evs the east in the face of russia and saudi arabia has focused on the start and the middle of the process on the raw materials without which no energy transition would be possible while doing that they have also continued what they have done for decades supply the world including transition happy economies with fossil fuels right now the west is discovering how important the raw materials part is for the energy industry as a whole u s shale drillers cannot boost production as fast as the biden administration would like because it has been plagued by shortages the eu is struggling under a growing electricity cost burden because renewables have under delivered while the eu has been trying to reduce its consumption of fossil fuels now this consumption is on the rise but it s also a lot more expensive than it was because of the tight supply ironically emissions are also on the rise related outlook for china oil demand darkens the biden administration wants to bring in more canadian oil into the u s but the keystone xl pipeline that could ve done that has been killed by that very same administration the administration also wants more local critical mineral production but appears to not want the mines that would be necessary to do that what it doesn t want apparently is russian oil and fuels amid the ukraine war but it will only suspend these imports beginning on april 22 so it can stock up before that in europe politicians have been equally active in punishing russia for ukraine with so far five rounds of sanctions that many have joked have hurt the eu more than they have hurt russia there is some truth in these jokes eu energy prices have skyrocketed and stayed in the sky industries are warning they might have to close if the eu sanctions russian gas or if russia decides to turn the tap off in retaliation and people are beginning to protest even so brussels officials are talking about oil and gas sanctions and they just this week voted for a ban on russian coal imports to take effect in august that last part is a sliver of common sense russia supplies 45 percent of europe s thermal coal used for electricity and heat generation the eu is now scrambling to find a replacement while the world s biggest coal exporter indonesia is hiking its prices massively and australia another coal giant is warning it will not have enough for europe the west is beginning its painful awakening to one very simple fact this fact is that whoever controls the raw materials controls everything and if those who control the raw materials play their cards right they are likely to remain in control while the consumers of these raw materials deepen their dependence on these external suppliers advertisement by irina slav for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

roundabout theatre company s new york premiere of birthday candles by noah haidle starring emmy award winner debra messing directed by vivienne benesch officially opens tonight april 10 2022 this is a limited engagement through sunday may 29 2022 at the american airlines theatre on broadway 227 west 42nd street the cast stars debra messing as ernestine enrico colantoni as kenneth tony award nominee john earl jelks as matt william with crystal finn as joan alex beth susannah flood as alice madeline ernie and christopher livingston as billy john let s see what the critics had to say maya phillips new york times repetition can make magic happen repeat a word or a phrase enough times and it breathes new life fresh meaning or repetition can strip language until all that s left are empty rhythms and sounds words are funny like that noah haidle s birthday candles which opened on broadway sunday night at the american airlines theater tries to build poignancy and depth through moments that repeat like a record needle stuck in a groove instead this roundabout theater company production gets caught in a superficial cycle of wannabe profundities and emotional pantomimes dave quinn entertainment weekly if only the play gave messing time to settle we might have been allowed to experience more of the actress range the action moves so fast that emotional moments pop up out of nowhere and ernestine s responses ring hollow when she s betrayed by her husband the bell tolls to the next year before the audience has had enough time to grasp onto what just happened to our heroine and how she feels still judging by the sniffs in the audience by the play s conclusion it s clear birthday candles landed with some personally i was more upset about the cake s fate than ernestine s greg evans deadline what the play doesn t quite manage is balance of a more stylistic bent moving fitfully between naturalism and a more fabulist approach the latter marked by some rather twee flourishes a goldfish or rather a 100 year series of goldfishes all named atman which we re told is a sanskrit word for the divinity within yourself despite whatever missteps though messing and the rest of the cast nicely convey the spectrum of emotions that a life s sweep encompasses from happy times to sad at the reviewed performance audience sobs and sniffles were as audible as the laughter not even a tacked on final birthday scene that strains credulity can sour the simple icing sweet pleasures of birthday candles tim teeman the daily beast the stolen moments of the play messing letting ernestine silently imbibe the world and events around her make the most impact as well as its affecting denouement in which finn again is a standout when ernestine attempts to finally finish the cake and my how you will panic over her lifting a container of flour as it confronts the big and small questions of existence and time itself birthday candles itself proves simultaneously over baked and under baked but its performers ensure it is served warm chris jones chicago tribune there are times when director vivienne benesch s production staged on a single setting from christine jones does not fully exploit the epic metaphysical sense of the writing transitions are marked by annoying sound cues when we d be fully aware of what transpires without them some moments are rushed others too broad but those really are minor quibbles in a truly must see show that is fully successful when it comes to everything that really matters messing didn t pick some revival or obvious showcase for her comedic chops she strives mightily and beautifully to find her way through a wise and sad drama just like the character she plays adam feldman time out in noah haidle s thin and drippy birthday candles the earnest ernestine debra messing prepares and bakes a cake in 90 minutes of real time as 90 years of her life pass by a smell of baking thus wafts through the theatre providing one of the production s few whiffs of reality haidle means to suggest that the specific is universal christine jones s set is a kitchen that floats in the vastness of the cosmos with household objects hanging over it like stars but he forgets to be specific it s thornton wilder without the wildness or the thorns johnny oleksinski new york post haidle s plays his better smokefall did not receive the production it deserved when it played new york back in 2016 have a way of convincing every audience member they ve been written just for them birthday candles at its best bubbles up our own cherished and difficult memories of the people in our lives who ve come and gone ayanna prescod variety the impressive acting practical set and tailored direction blend well to tell a story that could easily feel flat and predictable vivienne benesch s direction readily elevates haidle s script exploring the emotional and unpredictable time lapse tale of ernestine s birthdays over the course of 90 years helen shaw vulture too much rests on messing s shoulders and it s simply the wrong play for her gifts she has some odd ideas about playing young her 17 year old ernestine has the physicality of a stomping kindergartner and during the play s long middle she s inert unable to strike sparks from her family even in moments of heightened emotion messing seems disconnected from those around her twinkling at her children but not quite meeting their eyes she s strongest when ernestine gets into her nineties because messing s faraway gaze and abstracted air begin to take on poignancy what is she seeing what can she hear maybe there s some other life clamoring for her attention or maybe her mind is finally up there amid the constellation of lifetime things perhaps she s finding her place in the expanding universe traveling farther and faster away robert hofler the wrap haidle is big on concepts for his play smokefall he told the story of four generations of one family and even took us inside the womb to explore the development of two characters in birthday candles he visits the character of ernestine messing on several of her birthdays from age 17 to well into old age since birthday candles is a one act play clocking in at around 100 minutes haidle s writing involves major compression of time some of those birthdays last 10 minutes others are covered in seconds naveen kumar broadway news despite the play s universe skimming ambitions there s also a narrowness to its imagination of what life can and could be ernestine follows a path of least resistance though she has regrets birthday candles isn t a critique of conformity or the broader social forces that led her there she is a woman happily baking a cake year after year for more than half a century after all the play rather reinforces the heteronormative fantasy that fulfillment comes in recognizable forms just be careful which man you choose it s a bitter if obvious pill served with enough sugar to rot a full mouth of teeth jonathan mandell new york theater noah haidle is no thornton wilder birthday candles has its warmhearted and amusing moments but it s essentially a middle brow entertainment that tries too hard to be ethereal poignant and poetic if haidle s script isn t as impressive as it s trying to be director vivienne benesh makes the best of it with an appealing production that is beautifully designed and wonderfully acted by a nimble six member cast who take an appropriately understated approach the heart of the production is the performance by debra messing who never leaves the stage neither changing costume nor applying makeup as she credibly ages 90 years over 90 minutes using a shift in voice and posture frank scheck new york stage review for many birthday candles will no doubt prove deeply moving especially since it inevitably deals with so many relatable issues for both young and old and if i m being honest there were moments that got to me as well proving that there s still something resembling a heart beneath this curmudgeonly exterior but then i ve always found cheap music extraordinarily potent melissa rose bernardo new york stage review there might be life beyond the walls of ernestine s expansive grand rapids michigan kitchen but birthday candles isn t interested in it your first clue that birthday candles doesn t take place in the real world as we know it comes from christine jones fantastical set pots and pans musical instruments stuffed animals and assorted bric a brac hanging from above a lifetime of memories scattered across the sky like stardust ernestine only grows older she doesn t really grow juan a ramirez theatrely did you hear the one about the woman who lived a life she had ups downs outlived some around her was survived by others in case you forgot the basic trajectory of human existence a self satisfied little play called birthday candles opened tonight at the american airlines theatre the broadway debut of playwright noah haidle it has almost nothing to say about the grand existential themes it barks throughout its brisk 90 minutes it s hard to imagine why messing took on this role which only plays into her strengths as an actor a handful of times when the script offers up sitcom style setups howard miller talkin broadway still much of the play consists of a ticking off of biographical events by necessity or by design it is incumbent on members of the audience to find a personal connection to the ups and downs of ernestine s life debra messing generally has too little to work with only coming into her own as ernestine herself comes into her own the rest of the cast playing multiple roles all do what they can with their parts but mostly they are stuck with one dimensional attributes and neither they nor director vivienne benesch are able bring them fully to life
washington april 10 2022 the war against ukraine and sanctions on russia are hitting economies around the globe with the emerging market and developing countries in the europe and central asia region expected to bear the brunt says the world bank s latest economic update for the region released today the region s economy is now forecast to shrink by 4 1 percent this year compared with the pre war forecast of 3 percent growth as the economic shocks from the war compound the ongoing impacts of the covid 19 pandemic this would be the second contraction in as many years and twice as large as the pandemic induced contraction in 2020 ukraine s economy is expected to shrink by an estimated 45 1 percent although the magnitude of the contraction will depend on the duration and intensity of the war hit by unprecedented sanctions russia s economy has already plunged into a deep recession with output projected to contract by 11 2 percent in 2022 the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis unleashed by the war is staggering the russian invasion is delivering a massive blow to ukraine s economy and it has inflicted enormous damage to infrastructure said anna bjerde world bank vice president for the europe and central asia region ukraine needs massive financial support immediately as it struggles to keep its economy going and the government running to support ukrainian citizens who are suffering and coping with an extreme situation the war in ukraine is likely to also adversely impact the georgian economy through reductions in trade tourism and remittances as well as elevated commodity prices oil and food prices have increased sharply since the beginning of the war due to uncertainty and disrupted supplies from russia and ukraine these impacts will cause a slowdown in growth with growth initially forecast at 5 5 percent for 2022 expected to drop to 2 5 percent the baseline outlook envisions growth recovering from 2023 onward as easing monetary policy recovery of tourism and the restoration of economic links are partly offset by the gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus while we foresee a slowdown in growth for 2022 georgia is well placed to manage the economic fallout of the war due to reasonable fiscal and external buffers and a credible macro financial framework the banking sector is entering the crisis in relatively strong shape government deposits are sizeable and debt is likely to remain sustainable said sebastian molineus world bank regional director for the south caucasus what is needed now is to continue with prudent economic management provide support to affected businesses and households while reinvigorating the structural reforms to improve productivity improve human capital and address consequences of climate change the war has added to mounting concerns of a sharp global slowdown surging inflation and debt and a spike in poverty levels the economic impact has reverberated through multiple channels including commodity and financial markets trade and migration links and adverse impact on confidence the deep humanitarian crisis sparked by the war has been the most pronounced of the initial global shockwaves and will likely be among the most enduring legacies of the conflict the wave of refugees from ukraine to neighboring countries is anticipated to dwarf previous crises as a result support to host countries and refugee communities will be critical and the world bank is preparing operational support programs to neighboring countries to meet the increased financing needs from the refugee flows the war triggered spike in global oil prices also serves to underscore the need for energy security by boosting energy supply from renewable sources and stepping up the design and implementation of large scale energy efficiency measures world bank group response to the ukraine war the world bank group is taking fast action to support the people of ukraine since the start of russia s invasion of ukraine on february 24 the bank group has mobilized an emergency financing package of 925 million in support for ukraine this fast disbursing support will go to help pay wages for hospital workers pensions for the elderly and social programs for the vulnerable the rapid financing is part of a 3 billion package of support that the bank group is preparing for ukraine over the coming months the invasion has already caused the largest refugee crisis in europe since world war ii the bank group is looking at how to support refugees in host countries

by nicole goodkind cnn business banks have pledged to go green yet they can t seem to ditch coal coal the highest carbon emitting and dirtiest energy source is the single biggest contributor to human created climate change global power generation from coal grew 9 last year to an all time high over the last three years commercial banks have funneled 1 5 trillion into the industry according to a recent report by green campaign groups urgewald and reclaim finance along with more than two dozen other ngos the biggest lenders to coal the study found include japan s mizuho financial group barclays citi and jpmorgan chase all four banks are members of the un net zero banking alliance and have committed to aligning their portfolios with net zero carbon emissions by 2050 institutional investors hold a combined 1 2 trillion in coal industry assets as of november 2021 numbers that appear to be on par with holdings in 2020 at the top of the list was blackrock which held 9 of global coal stock holdings about 110 billion of its equity is in coal producing companies and 34 billion is invested in companies building new coal plants the report found blackrock s holdings represent a small percentage of its 10 trillion in total assets under management but the coal developers in blackrock s portfolio have plans for new projects equivalent to the power capacity of all the coal in russia japan indonesia poland and germany combined blackrock declined to comment there s a massive disconnect between the green rhetoric of the largest financial institutions their climate commitments and net zero pledges and their actual financing practices when it comes to new fossil fuel development said ben cushing manager of the sierra club s fossil free finance campaign citi jpmorgan chase bank of america and wells fargo all increased their financing of the 30 top coal companies between 2016 and 2021 a report released last week by the rainforest action network and six other ngos said top banks lent 742 billion to the fossil fuel industry in 2021 down just a smidge from 750 billion in 2020 it said jpmorgan chase citi wells fargo and bank of america are the top four fossil fuel funders in the world according to the report with morgan stanley and goldman sachs rounding out the top 14 together these six us banks have provided 31 of all fossil fuel funding since the 2015 paris agreement and 29 of all financing identified in 2021 all six banks are part of the net zero alliance some investors have had enough all six of the largest us banks will face investor resolutions around funding of fossil fuel companies during their annual shareholder meetings this spring squishy policy bank policies around coal funding typically have loopholes that allow financing to continue through multiple channels banks can restrict financing for specific projects involving coal but won t rule out general purpose loans or deals for a whole company some banks won t finance a company that derives more than 25 of its revenue or output from coal but some of the largest coal developers in the world are massive diversified organizations glencore one of the world s largest producers and exporters of coal made just 24 of its industrial revenue from the fossil fuel in 2021 the rest came from copper zinc and other metal mining and marketing many banks produce interim targets based on carbon intensity metrics measured as total carbon emissions divided by total units of production or economic activity that s a cunning trick and doesn t mean that their total emissions are going down said cushing if you fill up your car with a lower emitting form of gas but drive twice as far the intensity of your emissions will be lower but your net emissions will remain the same companies often say they need time to evaluate clients portfolios and determine how to continue to work with them it s not rocket science said ted nace founder and executive director of global energy monitor an ngo that catalogs fossil fuel and renewable energy projects worldwide the energy sector is capable of taking quick and decisive action when pressured even when it s costly exhibit a western oil and gas companies cut their ties with russia almost immediately after the invasion of ukraine proving that even the biggest firms can quickly dump toxic assets give us time a spokesperson from the united nations net zero banking alliance nzba said that comprehensive transitional plans will require years to plan and execute many members of the alliance are only months into their net zero pledges in 2021 the spokesperson said an immediate divestment from existing fossil fuel positions could lead to extreme market shocks that could profoundly impact the world s most vulnerable people the spokesperson added the other financial institutions cnn business reached out to asked to speak on background didn t respond or simply sent links to their publicly available coal and net zero policies blackrock has divested from all companies that derive a quarter or more of profits from thermal coal in its 2 6 trillion in actively managed strategies the majority of the company s 10 trillion under management is held in passive funds to which the coal policy does not apply but time is running out this week the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change issued a stark warning the world must cut its coal use by 95 within the next 28 years to avoid climate chaos if carbon emissions don t fall significantly over the next few years and the planet continues to warm at current rates expect to see major cities under water unprecedented heatwaves terrifying storms widespread water shortages the extinction of a million species of plants and animals said united nations secretary general antónio guterres it s not all about money just mostly a recent report from london based energy and climate think tank influencemap found that the world s 30 largest financial institutions all belong to industry associations that have consistently lobbied to weaken key sustainable finance policies in the european union britain and the united states coal retains political power in the united states the us is the world s third largest coal consumer when 40 countries signed a pledge to phase out coal in the coming decades at international climate talks in scotland in 2021 the us did not sign global power generation from coal grew 9 last year to an all time high and us based peabody energy the world s largest private sector producer of coal had its most profitable q1 ever this year russia s invasion of ukraine and a potential ban on russian coal in the european union has also made coal an extremely profitable commodity this week us coal prices topped 100 per ton for the first time in 13 years in response to supply shortage fears the cost per ton was about 54 at this time in 2020 when russian coal accounted for about 18 of all global exports this could be a decisive moment

the company will present the preclinical data of five novel drug candidates at aacr 2022 on april 8 13 focus on atg 037 atg 018 atg 022 atg 012 and atg 008 shanghai and hong kong april 10 2022 prnewswire antengene corporation limited antengene sehk 6996 hk a leading innovative global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering developing and commercializing first in class and or best in class medicines for cancer today announced the publication of five posters that will be presented during the upcoming 2022 american association for cancer research annual meeting aacr 2022 taking place from april 8th to april 13th in new orleans in person or via virtual attendance the preclinical studies that we are presenting at aacr 2022 provide a window into five innovative programs in antengene s pipeline said bo shan ph d chief scientific officer of antengene these programs target areas that we believe are very important in cancer drug development tumor microenvironment tme regulators atg 037 pathway inhibitors atg 018 atg 022 and atg 008 and adcs atg 022 these studies have been instrumental in guiding our clinical development plans for each program including selection of combination partners and biomarkers that could be used to predict efficacy or improve the proportion of patients who respond to treatment we are very pleased to share these results with the oncology community details of the posters and corresponding abstracts are shown below atg 037 a highly potent small molecule cd73 inhibitor has superior activity of reversing immunosuppression in higher amp environments compared with anti cd73 antibodies abstract 2576 session cell cycle replication inhibitors and immunotherapy agents date and time 9 00 am 12 30 pm cst april 12 2022 venue poster section 21 this study was designed to compare the t cell rescue activity of atg 037 a highly potent and selective oral small molecule inhibitor of cd73 and two cd73 blocking antibodies cd73 is an enzyme that is highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment and enables the degradation of amp into adenosine resulting in immunosuppression and cancer progression in vitro assays were used to assess each compound s ability to inhibit cd73 enzyme activity and reverse amp adenosine mediated t cell suppression atg 037 demonstrated more potent and complete inhibitory activity of cell surface cd73 in this study as shown in figure the authors found that atg 037 had a stronger ability to restore t cell function in higher amp environments compared with other clinical anti cd73 antibodies these data highlight the potential therapeutic advantages of small molecule inhibitors of cd73 over blocking antibodies atg 037 is being evaluated by antengene in a phase i trial as monotherapy and in combination with anti pd 1 antibody in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors the novel atr inhibitor atg 018 is efficacious in preclinical cancer models abstract 2604 session dna damage response and repair date and time 9 00 am 12 30 pm cst april 12 2022 venue poster section 22 in this study the preclinical pharmacology data set supporting the development of atg 018 a small molecule atr inhibitor was reviewed inhibiting atr kinase ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related kinase leads to increased accumulation of double strand breaks particularly meaningful for tumor cells which rely on dna damage response ddr atg 018 was tested in a panel of 142 tumor cell lines and three cdx mouse models to assess anti tumor efficacy and to identify potential predictive biomarkers atg 018 was a potent inhibitor of in vitro atr activity inhibition and cell proliferation without significant impact on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cell pbmcs viability in addition a series of genetic alterations were discovered that correlated with atg 018 sensitivity and could be potential predictive biomarkers as shown in figure the authors found that atg 018 demonstrated potent in vivo efficacy in solid tumor hematologic cancer models with certain ddr related mutations these data showed the potential of atg 018 in synthetic lethality with homologous recombination deficiencies and promising application in a wide range of indications with single agent activity and no impact on pbmcs viability atg 018 may be well positioned for use in mono or combination therapy in a wide range of tumors that rely on ddr development of a set of predictive biomarkers could enable its use as a precision medicine antengene intends to file the first ind for atg 018 in 2022 atg 022 an antibody drug conjugate targeting claudin 18 2 demonstrated potent in vivo efficacy in gastric cancer patient derived xenografts abstract 1143 session preclinical and clinical pharmacology date and time 9 00 am 12 30 pm cst april 11 2022 venue poster section 25 in this preclinical study atg 022 an antibody drug conjugate targeting claudin18 2 cldn18 2 was evaluated in several gastric cancer patient derived xenograft pdx models to assess whether it had potential across a range of cldn18 2 expression levels human cldn18 2 is ectopically expressed in a large number of gastric and pancreatic cancers monoclonal antibody targeting cldn18 2 demonstrated a promising clinical benefit when used in combination with chemotherapy however it showed suboptimal efficacy in patients with low cldn18 2 levels in this study presented in the aacr atg 022 is reported to show high affinity sub nanomolar grade against cldn18 2 and demonstrated potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects with in vivo efficacy observed in cldn18 2 low expression pdx models as shown in figure atg 022 demonstrated much better in vivo efficacy compared with benchmark adc in addition atg 022 was highly specific for cldn18 2 with virtually no effect on cells expressing cldn18 1 in addition atg 022 has almost no impact on body weight a proxy for safety the authors concluded that atg 022 shows promise for treating gastric cancer patients with a broad range of cldn18 2 expression levels a significant unmet need antengene is conducting preclinical studies for atg 022 synergistic effects of the combination of kras g12c with shp2 erk 1 2 mtorc1 2 or xpo1 inhibition for the treatment of kras g12c mutated cancer abstract 2679 session signaling pathway inhibitors date and time 9 00 am 12 30 pm cst april 12 2022 venue poster section 25 this preclinical study was conducted to identify combination therapy regimen that could overcome the short progression free survival that is a characteristic of kras g12c inhibitors linked to acquired resistance the study evaluated the anti tumor activity of atg 012 a kras g12c inhibitor with four other agents that are involved in the multiple pathways impacted by rasi i an shp2 inhibitor et0038 ii an erk 1 2 kinase inhibitor atg 017 iii an mtorc1 2 kinase inhibitor atg 008 or iv the xpo 1 inhibitor selinexor in preclinical solid tumor cdx models while atg 012 monotherapy induced dose dependent tumor growth inhibition at day 27 as shown in figure the authors also found strong in vivo synergism in 2 agent combinations in particular atg 012 and clinical stage erk inhibitor atg 017 demonstrate strong in vitro and in vivo synergism suggesting potential clinical application which may overcome the rapid resistance of kras inhibitors these data open the door to a range of combination partners for atg 012 that could be fine tuned to address drug resistance and potentially improve progression free survival by matching tumor type histology and combination partner for patients with the kras g12c mutation antengene is conducting preclinical studies for atg 012 identification of muc5b mutation as a positive predictive biomarker for mtorc1 2 inhibition by atg 008 in lung cancer abstract 4032 session molecular pharmacology date and time 9 00 am 12 30 pm cst april 13 2022 venue poster section 26 this study was designed to evaluate whether muc5b could serve as a positive predictive biomarker for mtorc1 2 inhibition by atg 008 onatasertib in lung cancer atg 008 is a dual mtor complex 1 2 kinase inhibitor the mtor complex regulates cell growth metabolism proliferation and survival while the mtor pathway is frequently deregulated in cancers efficacy of mtor inhibitors in lung cancer has been modest in the study 31 lung cancer cell lines were treated with atg 008 to determine dose response and to correlate the gene mutation amplification and expression with sensitivity to atg 008 as shown in figure the authors found that the presence of the muc5b mutation correlates with more potent anti tumor efficacy of atg 008 in vitro and in vivo in lung cancer cdx models the mucin muc5b has a critical protective role in normal lung and has been identified as prognostic marker in multiple tumor types one observation highlighted in the poster is that muc5b is also mutated in melanoma endometrial colorectal esophogastric and cervical cancers vastly expanding the potential clinical utility of muc5b mutation as the predictive biomarker for atg 008 atg 008 is being evaluated by antengene in multiple phase i and ii clinical trials about antengene

seeking to put a positive spin on a relationship that never quite produced the hoped for benefits chinese leader xi jinping told outgoing philippine president rodrigo duterte on friday that the two nations have properly handled the sensitive issue of the disputed south china sea xi made his remarks in a phone conversation with duterte who nurtured closer ties with beijing after taking office in 2016 despite cozier relations however sporadic territorial spats have persisted and beijing has had limited success separating the philippines from its treaty ally the united states xi made no mention of disputes saying the sides have adhered to the important consensus reached adhered to good neighborly and friendly cooperation insisted on properly handling differences and insisted on working together for common development the proper handling of the south china sea issue by both sides has provided an important foundation for china philippines friendly cooperation benefited the two peoples and effectively safeguarded regional peace and stability xi was quoted as saying by the official xinhua news agency china s policy toward the philippines maintains continuity and stability and china is willing to work with the philippines to promote the continuous and sound development of china philippines relations and continuously advance to a new level xi said xi also took a swipe at manila s security pact with washington saying that recent developments showed that regional security cannot be achieved by strengthening military alliances china is willing to work with the philippines and regional countries to adhere to the concept of common comprehensive cooperative and sustainable security and firmly hold regional security leadership in their own hands xi said duterte is limited to one term and the philippines holds presidential elections on may 9 china claims virtually the entire south china sea along with its rich fishing stocks and undersea mineral resources that has locked it into an increasingly tense territorial standoff in the busy waterway with rival claimants the philippines vietnam taiwan malaysia and brunei china s seizure of scarborough shoal prompted the philippines to bring the disputes to international arbitration before duterte took office in 2016 a u n backed tribunal invalidated most of china s claims and said it has violated the right of filipinos to fish at the shoal china dismissed the ruling as a sham and continues to defy it but allowed filipino fishermen to return to the shoal under duterte in march u s indo pacific commander adm john c aquilino told the associated press on board a u s navy reconnaissance aircraft that china has fully militarized three of the seven islands it built in the disputed spratlys archipelago in the south china sea despite a promise by xi not to do so chinese weapon systems on the human built islands include anti ship and anti aircraft missile systems laser and jamming equipment and military aircraft china responded by saying that its deployment of necessary national defense facilities on its own territory is a right entitled to every sovereign country and is in line with international law which is beyond reproach credit associated press ap photo credit ap

hey there time traveller this article was published 09 04 2022 736 days ago so information in it may no longer be current halifax for many summer in the maritimes would not be complete without fresh lobster but locals and tourists alike could have to shell out more for the crustaceans as prices reach historic highs our lobsters are gold plated now prices have been the highest in commercial history says stewart lamont managing director of tangier lobster co ltd a live lobster exporter on nova scotia s eastern shore an employee weighs lobster in shediac n b on wednesday september 22 2021 for many summer in the maritimes would not be complete without fresh lobster but locals and tourists alike will have to shell out more than usual for the crustaceans as prices reach historic highs the canadian press christopher katsarov when the pandemic hit export and restaurant industry demand plummeted the shore price of lobster the amount fishers get at the wharf from buyers sunk as low as 4 dollars a pound there was an initial glut of lobsters on the market at the start of the lockdown but then it spun back the other way says colin sproul president of the bay of fundy inshore fishermen s association sales of live and processed lobster rebounded following the first wave of covid 19 prices started to go up with demand and have continued climbing since canadian lobster exports reached a staggering 3 26 billion last year beating the previous record of 2 59 billion set in 2019 by more than 25 per cent with many consumers saving money during the pandemic and limited travel or restaurant dining the crustacean long considered a luxury item for special occasions became a top seller in the u s americans bought lobster during the pandemic like they never did before and that drove up demand and price says geoff irvine executive director of the lobster council of canada while processed lobster meat and tails was in high demand in the u s sales of live lobster increased in asia there is unlimited demand in asia for canadian lobster sproul says it s a top quality product and we have a good trade relationship strong demand coupled with smaller catches in winter months sent shore prices spiralling as high as 19 50 a pound the highest wharf price that i ve ever heard of for lobster in my life was a few weeks ago at 19 50 a pound sproul says prices have since dropped to around 14 50 this week and could ease further during the spring lobster fishery the opening of several lobster fishing areas across atlantic canada in the coming weeks is expected to boost supply thousands of extra fishing boats will hit the water setting traps also landings the catch or total weight of lobsters trapped and sold increase in warmer spring weather as well the added supply should rein in prices lamont says we re playing with fire when we pay prices that cannot be passed on to the market he says of the record lobster prices if prices climb again to 20 a pound and stay there some restaurants and grocery stores may stop selling the crustaceans altogether lamont says we have visitors come to nova scotia from all over the world to experience our seafood but at the current prices it s really not accessible he says we could start to see lobster taken off menus irvine with the lobster council says strong lobster prices and exports benefit the region s economy still he admits it can be pricier for locals to pick up a boiled lobster at sobeys for supper it is challenging for people in atlantic canada if they want to buy lobster because we re exporting so much at high prices irvine says it may be tough for local people here to be able to afford it but our goal is to maximize the economic value but lamont says shore prices that approach 20 a pound are unsustainable we have this concept of the poor fisherman from 50 years ago but fishermen today are earning incomes that are extraordinary he says tales of lobster fishers drawing half million dollar incomes and fishing towns inundated with shiny new trucks abound but the reality is fishers are also facing crushingly high inflation on top of hefty debt many take on to join the lucrative industry experts say mounting fuel and labour costs big loans on boats licences and other equipment and ongoing maintenance all eat into high shore prices they say for a lobster boat that holds about 10 000 litres of fuel you re looking at a fill up as high as 18 000 sproul says wages are also high because it s a very demanding job and there s a component of danger high operating costs are in addition to the upfront cost of joining the fishery which can hit as much as 5 million once a licence boat and lobster traps are tallied he says meanwhile the cost of bait used in lobster traps is expected to increase after fisheries and oceans canada announced the closure of the atlantic mackerel and commercial bait fisheries on the east coast citing concerns that dwindling stocks have entered a critical zone the biggest source of bait has just been eliminated from the industry sproul says we ll have to import bait and it will cost us more higher bait costs is just one of several factors could affect prices irvine says inflation uncertainty with spiking covid 19 cases and the potential impact of the russian invasion of ukraine on shipping and demand could all influence lobster prices he says the big question on everyone s mind is what s going to happen when all the seasons open up here in the next month we expect the market to stay good but there s a lot of variables this report by the canadian press was first published april 10 2022
offal as webby so obligingly points out below is off fall the english etymology for the word leaves little doubt as to how english speaking countries regard these extraneous parts of the animal basically as discards with a few notable exceptions such as liver brains and kidneys people from these countries are at best hesitant and at worst horrified by the thought of eating anything but the prime cuts of meat it is therefore lucky in one manner that people from non english speaking backgrounds were sometimes not so fortunate as the g7 nations they often could not afford the choice cuts of meat we cherish and were loath to let anything go to waste more importantly they refused to eat poorly in those unimaginable days long before red hat linux releases long before global economies and long before xbox ps2 and gamecube vied for our wallets there were people much like us sans the technology and money they had no refrigeration and no supermarkets if they wanted meat they had better damn well hoped that a neighbor had killed a beast recently this is the charm of offal even if the thought of eating liver or kidneys turns you green you really should appreciate not only the willingness of previous cultures to eat this stuff but to prepare and eat it well and develop cuisines that survive to this day based on what was once so disparagingly called off fall so what exactly is offal anyway the most succinct definition is any meat that is not considered prime muscle this includes any internal organs as well as any extremities such as tails feet ears and heads many countries have divergent and long established cuisines based around offal but the one constant is the treatment different parts of the beast requires consider this list an overview an introduction to how these euphemistically phrased variety meats are cooked do not however treat this list as gospel there are many different types of offal and many more types of preparation search out regional recipes if you want an authoritative view on how to deal with a certain cut common offal this is the stuff that you will most likely be familiar with even if you have never eaten it and even if you never intend to you can most likely find this stuff at your local butcher even if you need to order it in advance liver the liver of pigs sheep cows and poultry are a common item on the dinner table for some this would most likely be the cut that most non offal eaters are familiar with liver is not only eaten whole but it is also often incorporated into other dishes such as pâté if you thought that offal was poor man s fare don t forget the extortionately priced and barbaric french delicacy foie gras this is artificially fattened goose liver and chefs around the world clamor to pay big dollars to get their hands on some the chinese revere pig s liver along with most cuts of pork while anglo cooks generally choose livers from lamb or veal whatever beast the liver came from it should be cooked in one of two fashions either quickly so that the liver remains a little pink in the centre or for an extended period of time such as in duck liver parfait kidneys kidneys are generally taken from one of three beasts cow sheep or pig this favourite food of leopold bloom gave rise to the quaint celebration of bloomsday along with liver kidneys would have to be one of the most accepted offal meats in english speaking countries as a blood purifier kidneys deal with a great deal of liquid waste this sometimes leaves kidneys smelling of you guessed it urine the larger the animal the more pungent the aroma generally ox and pork kidneys have the most forthright smell just like liver kidneys should be cooked either very rapidly or slowly and for a longer period anything in between will result in a rubbery inedible mess sweetbreads if ever a marketing person earned their keep this would have to be it imagine the scene ok we got these thymus glands but nobody is buying them why not just give them two re assuring and homely names sweet and bread the combined thymus and pancreas of sheep and calves are most often used although pork sweetbreads can sometimes be found they are usually blanched in boiling water then the outer skin removed after this preparation they are generally fried or grilled tongue the internal mouth organ of oxen young calves sheep and pigs are a delicacy cooked according to the beast from which they came generally the larger and older the beast as in ox tongue a longer cooking time is required more tender tongues such as from lamb will be ready in a shorter period of time often the preparation of tongue will require two steps firstly the tongue is simmered in a flavoursome broth once taken out of the liquid and cooled the skin is removed allowing the tongue to be sliced and cooked quickly such as pan frying or grilling brains once again another form of offal that is acceptable in many english speaking countries the most common type used is lamb s brains although veal and ox brains have their adherents such as the french brains need to be washed thoroughly to remove any blood and membranes surrounding the lobes they are usually then poached then cooled before proceeding with a recipe most often this will be crumbed and fried brains cheek the cheek of pigs and ox are considered to be a gelatinous delicacy both require delicate preparation and long slow cooking after quite a few hours of gentle braising cheeks end up tender and quite sticky due to the high gelatin content of the muscle tail the most common form of tail available is oxtail this highly gelatinous cut is generally cooked in slowly braised dishes reminiscent of osso buco oxtails need to be cut into short lengths by your butcher and tend to give off a great deal of fat while cooking because of this many oxtail dishes are cooked in two steps the first cooking to make the tail tender followed by a cooling period to let the fat rise to the surface after skimming the fat the tail sections are then re heated trotters and shin trotters refer to the feet hooves or shanks of cows pigs or sheep they are generally sold on the bone and require long slow cooking if you have ever eaten osso buco you have for all intents and purposes eaten trotters as they are basically the shin of veal well it s close enough to the foot anyway lamb and veal shanks are normally browned by firstly frying then set in a flavoursome liquid to braise slowly for several hours there is a famous parisienne bistro dish of crumbed pig s trotters the pork feet are first simmered in stock until tender once cooled the larger bones are removed and the whole foot is coated in breadcrumbs this is then set under an overhead grill broiler until crisp and served with tartare sauce resulting in a sticky and delicious classic not so common offal this is the stuff that you will most likely never see at your local butcher these meats are either too bizarre for western palates or simply illegal as bladder is in nsw heart the most important and hard working muscle in most mammals bodies and therefore the toughest hearts of oxen heifers pigs sheep and poultry can be used and are always cooked for a fair amount of time to tenderize the tough muscles in europe hearts are often braised or stewed until tender while in the carnivorous wonderland that is south america cubes of heart are set on brochettes and grilled over coals head the whole head of certain beasts are used in traditional european cookery but none is prized as much as calf s head which is prepared and served whole in classic french cuisine the head of pork and lamb is common in rustic french country cookery such as pâté de tete and museau de porc ever eaten brawn then you have eaten head brawn is simmered down pig s head the meat flavoured with herbs and set in its own gelatinous aspic ears the ears of pigs and calves are considered a great delicacy in france and several other nations they need to be singed over an open flame to remove any excess hair soaked to removed any blood then simmered to make them tender once these steps have been followed ears are simply fried or grilled or perhaps coated in breadcrumbs before cooking lungs here is another one for the marketing people can t sell your lungs why not call them lights yeah that s right the culinary term for lungs is lights generally calves lungs are used they must be beaten to expel any lingering air and again as with any tough muscular offal they are cooked slowly in dishes such as civet bladder the bladder itself is not eaten but it is a vessel in which to cook other meats and poultry most often pigs bladders are used and this french technique is given the phrase en vessie there is a semi infamous case of a young sydney based chef that wanted to cook an arcane and intricate french dish for a food competition the dish involved placing slices of black truffle under the skin of a hen which was then placed in a bladder for slow baking could he get a pig s bladder not easily in a display of bureaucratic bumbling the young chef had to get food department clearance then gather the bladder himself from an abattoir while the bemused workers looked on spinal cord
equity markets remain choppy with a lack of clear momentum next week s start of the earnings season should at least give us some trend financial stocks to open earnings season as per usual the first earnings season under the super sized inflation conditions gets underway next week and will demonstrate just how well or poorly companies are able to deal with inflation history shows us that for the most part equities are actually a pretty good hedge against inflation as companies push up prices in response to rising input costs the early stage of an inflationary cycle is where equities tend to do best after time consumer sentiment sours demand falls as prices rise and so company revenues and margins suffer but currently we are at the early stage of this inflationary cycle so we expect earnings to hold up next week kicks off with financials who would usually benefit from rising yields anyway as this increases their net interest margin the energy sector also should report huge numbers on the back of surging energy prices so for now we remain in the moderately bullish camp albeit with some serious buffeting along the way headwinds to buffet include some familiar themes from last year supply chains and semiconductor issues and now include energy costs also unemployment is now below the long term trend for the us and indicates that the us economy has now peaked again taking to the history books once inflation tracks below the long run average a recession is usually about 12 to 18 months away again this is looking more likely and indeed deutsche bank nudged its forecasts of the us economy to recession before 2023 is out the oft cited yield curve inversion also usually indicates a recession within a year this would be consistent with the fed raising rates at probably one of the fastest paces in living memory and inflation running riot inflation is usually not contained by fed policy but by recessions markets are forward looking by nature and the macro investors are certainly worried but for now corporate earnings and corporate buybacks at record levels should just about be enough to avoid a bear market in 2022 2023 however is a different case sector performance defensive and value orientated names led the way as investors increasingly took a cautious tone consumer staples xlp was the strongest sector of the week closely followed by healthcare xlv and utilities xlu tech was the biggest loser xlk dropping 3 on the week momentum names mtum once again lagged value stocks vlue as wannabe buffets continued to catch up and indeed surpass pandemic era gains from momentum sentiment readings and financial conditions the latest readings show financial conditions tightening somewhat no surprise given the hawkish commentary from fed officials and rising yields the usual and oft cited measures of sentiment have turned more bearish in the past week the cnn fear and greed index has moved moderately but the aaii american association of individual investors has shown a strong rise in bearish sentiment this is despite a reasonable week for equity performance yes the main indices will close lower on the week but moves were far from dramatic but we did notice a strong move in the move index excuse the pun this is the bond market volatility index akin to vix bond markets are nervous over how the us economy is going to react to markedly higher rates the hawkish minutes and commentary from brainard and daly during the week only added to already stressed bond markets yields again were marked higher source aaii com source cnn com the various financial condition indices show financial conditions tightening across the country the goldman sachs and chicago fed financial conditions indices both rose to the highest levels since 2010 s p 500 spy price prediction the s p 500 spy has retraced to the value area at 448 and is now choppy around this level with a serious lack of direction the fact though that the double top at 458 was broken indicated that the market may be ready to progress earnings season could and should be this stimulus in our view nasdaq qqq price prediction choppy range trading is also the order of the day here but the index is technically weaker than the spy above the last rally failed to break 370 and qqq remains in a choppy directionless range this is unlikely to be resolved before big tech earnings in a few weeks the underperformance versus the spy is likely to continue early into the earnings season with financials and energy earnings likely to continue the outperformance for the spy ultimately we expect earnings season to see 370 finally broken but again volatility will be a feature this will be a harder trend to establish that in 2021 the nasdaq is often cited as the yield sensitive index it is correct of course that high growth stocks will suffer more from higher rates but real rates are more important as we have discussed companies can raise prices more easily at the start of an inflationary cycle than at the end real interest rates the prevailing interest rate inflation are running at all time historical lows and are lower than after the 2008 crisis and have recently gone below the 1980 oil crisis rate see the chart below us 10 y yield us inflation yearly there is a strong correlation between the nasdaq performance and real yields as shown below the blue line is the inverse of the nasdaq so when real yields go lower so does the inverse of the nasdaq ie stocks go higher the com bubble in 2000 sees the blue line soar this is the nasdaq bubble collapse real yields were also moving higher and partially caused the panic currently as mentioned real yields are at multi decade lows and despite everything the nasdaq and s p remain close to all time highs real yields us 10y inflation overlapped with a correlated nasdaq inverse earnings week ahead the week ahead will finally see some clarity for equity markets with earnings season kicking off as ever financial stocks lead the way and one expects these to normally benefit from a rising yield environment source benzinga pro economic releases the highlights here will be the cpi data on tuesday expectations are for another shocking rise in prices and this will then feed through to the michigan consumer sentiment survey on friday higher prices will eventually lead to a retraction in consumer activity so it is just a matter of when the author is long ggpi and baba and short tesla

we are far closer to a potential global cataclysm than most people would dare to imagine right now leaders from all across the political spectrum are openly warning us that a worldwide food crisis is coming but when people in the western world hear of such warnings most of them assume that it will just be something that affects poor people in africa or asia unfortunately that will not be the case this time around we truly are in unprecedented territory and we are going to see things happen in the months ahead that once would have been absolutely unthinkable global hunger had already been steadily rising for the past couple of years due to the covid pandemic and now a confluence of events here in 2022 threatens to create a true global nightmare at this moment we are still eating food that was previously grown but it is the food that will not be grown in the months ahead that will be the real problem because the truth is that we do not have much of a buffer to work with at all david friedberg is an early google executive who started the farming insurance company climate corporation and he just told the all in podcast that the earth operates on a 90 day food supply the whole planet earth operates a 90 day food supply that means that once we stop making food humans run out of food in 90 days it is estimated that approximately 7 9 billion people currently live on the planet and feeding everyone is a real challenge even if everything goes perfectly unfortunately global conditions have been much less than perfect for the past couple of years and friedberg says that the new global energy crisis has pushed the cost of key fertilizer components to levels that are absolutely insane the price of nitrogen has gone from 200 to 1 000 the price in potassium has gone from 200 to 700 and the price of phosphorus has gone from 250 to 700 so now it is so expensive to grow a crop that a lot of farmers around the world are pulling acres out of production so they re going to grow less this year than they would have otherwise because it is so expensive and they can not access fertilizer he explained food supplies are going to go down and it is going to be catastrophic many farmers all over the world will try to grow food without fertilizer this year but that will result in a whole lot less food being grown in one of his latest videos chris martenson compared rice plants that were grown with phosphorus to rice plants that were not given any phosphorus i was absolutely blown away by the difference as global food production drops precipitously there simply will not be enough food for everyone in the months ahead of course the wealthy nations will buy up what is available driving up prices in the process and the poorer nations will be left out in the cold in fact this is already starting to happen in march the global price of food rose at the fastest monthly pace ever recorded march s food price index from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao printed 159 3 points in march up 19 15 points from february when it had already reached record highs the index was up 33 6 from the same time last year the march rise in food prices is a stunning 12 64 mom almost double the previous record monthly surge if you are looking for red flags you just found one food riots have already begun in some parts of the globe for example you can see a clip from the rioting in peru right here in the months ahead it is only going to get worse thanks to the war in ukraine the price of wheat was up almost 20 percent last month alone the war has helped push cereal prices up 17 over the past month with the closure of ports throttling wheat and maize exports from ukraine russian exports have also been slowed by financial and shipping problems world wheat prices soared by 19 7 during march while maize prices posted a 19 1 month on month increase hitting a record high along with those of barley and sorghum as i have discussed perviously russia and ukraine normally export enormous amounts of food to the rest of the planet but that won t be the case this year sadly it is being projected that corn production in ukraine will be cut by more than half in 2022 ukraine is one of the world s top exporters of corn sunflower oil and wheat disruptions stemming from russia s invasion of ukraine have stoked fears the war torn country could experience a 50 decline in crop output this year according to bloomberg forecast data from ag expert ukragroconsult show ukraine s corn output could be as low as 19 million tons about half of last year s 41 million tons and the ukrainians have already announced that they won t be exporting any of their production at all this year because they need it to feed their own population during the war here in the united states the bird flu pandemic continues to escalate and as a result the price of eggs has more than doubled in recent weeks a deadly and highly infectious avian flu is forcing us farmers to kill millions of egg laying hens reducing the country s egg supply and driving up prices on thursday retailers paid between 2 80 and 2 89 for a dozen large grade a white eggs in the midwest according to the usda s daily midwest regional egg report that s more than double the roughly 1 25 they cost in march according to data compiled by brian earnest lead protein industry analyst at cobank which provides financial services to agribusiness that is extremely alarming so what is going to happen if this pandemic continues to wipe out millions of chickens every month meanwhile certain shortages that have been simmering for a long time are now reaching critical levels for example walgreens has announced that it is going to start rationing baby formula a national shortage of baby formula brought on by pandemic related supply chain issues has forced us retailers such as walgreens to ration the all important product the company the second largest pharmacy store chain in the united states behind cvs said friday that amid the supply chain crunch it is limiting customers to three infant and toddler formula product purchases at a time at its 9 021 us locations this wasn t supposed to happen according to the optimists things were supposed to be getting back to normal by this point but instead things are getting even worse according to the daily mail 29 percent of all top selling formulas are out of stock at stores across the nation right now unfortunately this is just the beginning everyone agrees that the global food crisis is going to intensify in the months ahead and david friedberg is trying to warn us about what could happen if widespread panic sets in i don t know about death there will be famine famine is to be short of calories there will be strategic reserves released but it won t be enough we won t have enough the way supply chains are set up there will not be enough he said as you know with any market when there is scarcity people come in and buy at a faster pace so this is a market dynamic it is not like people are physically hoarding loaves of bread but commodity traders countries strategic reserves start buying up what they can get to prepare for the famine prices go even higher and it kicks other people out of the market the whole thing gets ugly fast we have been warned over and over again that this was coming and now it is here you may have noticed that my articles have been longer than usual lately and that is because there is so much more information that i need to share with you each day we truly are entering a full blown planetary emergency and i am trying to do my best to sound the alarm unfortunately most of the population is still not taking this crisis seriously so many people out there are fully convinced that they will always be able to rely on the system and a lot of them will continue to believe that even as the system literally collapses all around them it is finally here michael s new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now available in paperback and for the kindle on amazon about the author my name is michael and my brand new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now available on

statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain consequently there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product further preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans the complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly or sometimes even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future even when clinical trials are successful regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected we develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations partnerships and joint ventures product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship also we or others could identify safety side effects or manufacturing problems with our products including our devices after they are on the market our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products sales growth of recently launched products competition from other products including biosimilars difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions in addition sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third party payers including governments private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment furthermore our research testing pricing marketing and other operations are subject to

applications may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by our competitors or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation we perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities including in puerto rico and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development an outbreak of disease or similar public health threat such as covid 19 and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities the distribution of our products the commercialization of our product candidates and our clinical trial operations and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development product sales business and results of operations we rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products in addition we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products further some raw materials medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third party suppliers certain of our distributors customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us the discovery of significant problems with a

by nicole goodkind cnn business banks have pledged to go green yet they can t seem to ditch coal coal the highest carbon emitting and dirtiest energy source is the single biggest contributor to human created climate change global power generation from coal grew 9 last year to an all time high over the last three years commercial banks have funneled 1 5 trillion into the industry according to a recent report by green campaign groups urgewald and reclaim finance along with more than two dozen other ngos the biggest lenders to coal the study found include japan s mizuho financial group barclays citi and jpmorgan chase all four banks are members of the un net zero banking alliance and have committed to aligning their portfolios with net zero carbon emissions by 2050 institutional investors hold a combined 1 2 trillion in coal industry assets as of november 2021 numbers that appear to be on par with holdings in 2020 at the top of the list was blackrock which held 9 of global coal stock holdings about 110 billion of its equity is in coal producing companies and 34 billion is invested in companies building new coal plants the report found blackrock s holdings represent a small percentage of its 10 trillion in total assets under management but the coal developers in blackrock s portfolio have plans for new projects equivalent to the power capacity of all the coal in russia japan indonesia poland and germany combined blackrock declined to comment there s a massive disconnect between the green rhetoric of the largest financial institutions their climate commitments and net zero pledges and their actual financing practices when it comes to new fossil fuel development said ben cushing manager of the sierra club s fossil free finance campaign citi jpmorgan chase bank of america and wells fargo all increased their financing of the 30 top coal companies between 2016 and 2021 a report released last week by the rainforest action network and six other ngos said top banks lent 742 billion to the fossil fuel industry in 2021 down just a smidge from 750 billion in 2020 it said jpmorgan chase citi wells fargo and bank of america are the top four fossil fuel funders in the world according to the report with morgan stanley and goldman sachs rounding out the top 14 together these six us banks have provided 31 of all fossil fuel funding since the 2015 paris agreement and 29 of all financing identified in 2021 all six banks are part of the net zero alliance some investors have had enough all six of the largest us banks will face investor resolutions around funding of fossil fuel companies during their annual shareholder meetings this spring squishy policy bank policies around coal funding typically have loopholes that allow financing to continue through multiple channels banks can restrict financing for specific projects involving coal but won t rule out general purpose loans or deals for a whole company some banks won t finance a company that derives more than 25 of its revenue or output from coal but some of the largest coal developers in the world are massive diversified organizations glencore one of the world s largest producers and exporters of coal made just 24 of its industrial revenue from the fossil fuel in 2021 the rest came from copper zinc and other metal mining and marketing many banks produce interim targets based on carbon intensity metrics measured as total carbon emissions divided by total units of production or economic activity that s a cunning trick and doesn t mean that their total emissions are going down said cushing if you fill up your car with a lower emitting form of gas but drive twice as far the intensity of your emissions will be lower but your net emissions will remain the same companies often say they need time to evaluate clients portfolios and determine how to continue to work with them it s not rocket science said ted nace founder and executive director of global energy monitor an ngo that catalogs fossil fuel and renewable energy projects worldwide the energy sector is capable of taking quick and decisive action when pressured even when it s costly exhibit a western oil and gas companies cut their ties with russia almost immediately after the invasion of ukraine proving that even the biggest firms can quickly dump toxic assets give us time a spokesperson from the united nations net zero banking alliance nzba said that comprehensive transitional plans will require years to plan and execute many members of the alliance are only months into their net zero pledges in 2021 the spokesperson said an immediate divestment from existing fossil fuel positions could lead to extreme market shocks that could profoundly impact the world s most vulnerable people the spokesperson added the other financial institutions cnn business reached out to asked to speak on background didn t respond or simply sent links to their publicly available coal and net zero policies blackrock has divested from all companies that derive a quarter or more of profits from thermal coal in its 2 6 trillion in actively managed strategies the majority of the company s 10 trillion under management is held in passive funds to which the coal policy does not apply but time is running out this week the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change issued a stark warning the world must cut its coal use by 95 within the next 28 years to avoid climate chaos if carbon emissions don t fall significantly over the next few years and the planet continues to warm at current rates expect to see major cities under water unprecedented heatwaves terrifying storms widespread water shortages the extinction of a million species of plants and animals said united nations secretary general antónio guterres it s not all about money just mostly a recent report from london based energy and climate think tank influencemap found that the world s 30 largest financial institutions all belong to industry associations that have consistently lobbied to weaken key sustainable finance policies in the european union britain and the united states coal retains political power in the united states the us is the world s third largest coal consumer when 40 countries signed a pledge to phase out coal in the coming decades at international climate talks in scotland in 2021 the us did not sign global power generation from coal grew 9 last year to an all time high and us based peabody energy the world s largest private sector producer of coal had its most profitable q1 ever this year russia s invasion of ukraine and a potential ban on russian coal in the european union has also made coal an extremely profitable commodity this week us coal prices topped 100 per ton for the first time in 13 years in response to supply shortage fears the cost per ton was about 54 at this time in 2020 when russian coal accounted for about 18 of all global exports this could be a decisive moment for the world said natasha ion climate campaigner at banktrack an ngo focused on tracking banks and the activities they finance we are already seeing markets shift in response to russia i urge banks

editor s note the us federal reserve makes decisions with the sole aim of boosting the us economy by doing so the fed disrupts the international financial systems and causes immense harm to developing countries including asia s emerging economies three experts share their views on the issue with china daily the fight against the covid 19 pandemic has left a large imprint on the us federal reserve s balance sheet since the outbreak of the pandemic in early 2020 the fed has purchased a wide range of assets and pumped liquidity into the us financial system to cushion the impact of the pandemic and fiscal stimulus on interest rates as a result its balance sheet ballooned to nearly 9 trillion compared with the pre pandemic level of 4 trillion to put this number in perspective the added 5 trillion in the fed s assets is roughly the same size of total overseas claims by asian banking systems with the extraordinary fiscal and monetary policy support the us economy has staged a strong recovery since the third quarter of 2020 the economy grew 5 7 percent in 2021 which is the highest annual growth since 1984 domestic demand has been rising even faster by any measure the us economy now runs on its full capacity the unemployment rate has fallen below 4 percent and inflation climbed to 7 9 percent besides despite the russia ukraine military conflict creating considerable economic uncertainty the fed raised its policy rate on march 16 the first time since 2018 to curb inflation unfortunately the fed s tightening cycle has often preceded economic slowdown and financial instability in the united states and emerging market economies between 1980 and 1982 monetary tightening led to a recession interest rate hikes between 1986 and 1989 triggered the savings and loan crisis and later combined with the subsequent oil price shock in 1990 led to a brief recession in the us the fed embarked on tightening in 1993 leading to significant rises in long term rates and companies borrowing costs while the us avoided a recession during this tightening cycle in 1993 94 a sudden reversal in capital flows and the collapse of the mexican peso in december 1994 led to a series of financial crises in several latin american countries in 1994 95 and asian economies in 1997 98 worse monetary tightening between 2004 and 2007 pricked the bubble in the us housing market and pushed the global economy into a financial crisis and an economic recession in 2008 09 the last tightening cycle of the us fed during 2015 18 was cut short as quantitative tightening led to negative market reactions soon afterward the world was hit by the covid 19 pandemic interest rate hikes in the us have significant impacts on asian economies through trade exchange rate and financial market channels for example higher interest rates curb aggregate demand and hence reduce external demand for asian exports also higher yields on us assets attract international investment and create strong demand for dollars this increases the dollar funding cost for asian economies who need to borrow from overseas for their investment while the impact of the dollar s appreciation on asia s trade remains ambiguous given the weakening global demand and the transmission of higher us interest rates through international capital markets would exert downward pressure on local investment and consumption in fact empirical evidence shows that local interest rates in asian developing economies respond to short term us rates in a strongly positive manner regardless of existing exchange rate regimes although emerging market economies are expected to navigate increasingly turbulent waters an immediate challenge for the asian region is to strengthen macro prudential surveillance and preempt new sources of financial instability first while still manageable inflation has picked up in many economies in the region driven by high food and energy prices increased shipping costs and depreciating currencies so monetary authorities in the asian region need to carefully monitor the risks of higher inflation and take measures to rein in inflation expectations with the fed raising interest rates local currency depreciation driven by widening interest differentials could further complicate the inflation battle second an extended period of very low interest rates has created a legacy of record high debt in both corporate and household sectors as the authorities lift regulatory relief and forbearance measures while monetary policy support wanes there will be lagged effects of covid 19 on corporate defaults and loan losses nonperforming loan ratios have already risen in a number of regional economies albeit from a low base hence financial authorities should closely monitor the risks and take early actions to prevent the buildup of systemic risks for instance preventive debt restructuring can offer companies a second chance at rehabilitating debts and help banks assess the debt risks with more certainty third thanks to the expansionary fiscal policy in response to the pandemic governments in many regional economies increased their debt issuance so the risk of debt vulnerability runs high especially for economies facing high external debt service burden while sustaining large structural current account deficits and holding insufficient foreign exchange reserves in order to mitigate external vulnerabilities more proactive public debt management is needed for example by lengthening the maturity structure and building a more sustainable debt service profile the asian region also needs to accelerate local currency bond and capital market development to reduce its reliance on external debt financing and improve financial resilience fourth massive and at times highly volatile global capital flows can disrupt the region s macroeconomic and financial stability with the imminent changes in the us monetary policy stance capital flows to the region could reverse with the risk of sudden stops although the region s strong growth outlook and healthy external positions mitigate the risk the authorities need to remain vigilant and prepare for a sudden change in international investors sentiment in this regard effective capital flow management including foreign exchange and capital control measures are key to that preparation fifth emerging market and developing economies in the region would benefit from strengthening the global and regional safety net arrangements to support crisis prevention and management past financial crises show that macroeconomic stabilization policies alone are not enough to safeguard financial stability globalized finance requires a solid global defense against financial crises so effective financial safety nets should have multiple layers of both crisis prevention and crisis management which must begin with sound macroeconomic policies at the national level more flexible and targeted assistance at the regional level and eventually backstopped by global cooperation and sixth strong economic recovery is the only way out of the crisis asia needs to seize the opportunities arising from rapid digital transformation to further boost productivity and capture potential gains in economic growth and employment as such the region s policymakers must promote broader and more equal access to digital opportunities by enhancing digital infrastructure and expanding human capacities especially for the poor and disadvantaged through investments and policy reforms in education health and public

lower pig numbers expected for canada this year canada s swine sector will see slaughter levels recover in 2022 even as diseases may result in slightly smaller pig numbers amid high losses this year s piglet numbers is forecast lower than 2021 due to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and processing issues additionally concerns about global supplies and access to feed and fertiliser coupled with the ongoing impacts from last year s drought could see precarious feed conditions persist for some time exports of live hogs are revised upwards as a result of ongoing processing disruptions in eastern canada olymel is proceeding with cessation of a slaughter line at its princeville facility which will displace an estimated 702 000 head per year additionally the company will reportedly be ceasing a second slaughter shift at its yamachiche plant in april 2022 as it focuses on increasing its value added output by repurposing workers to fabrication shifts ultimately this leads to olymel purchasing 1 2 million fewer hogs per year in the interim this will impact ontario and quebec producers early reports suggested that some hogs will end up in manitoba and others in ontario and quebec plants however producers will be looking to the united states for exports and depending on the market reductions in production could eventually occur the united states department of agriculture usda forecast that 2022 feeder exports to the us will remain stable for 2021 feeder exports manitoba will continue as the main supplier of feeder hogs but additional animals in eastern canada will be exported as a result of the olymel slaughter reduction manitoba will keep a larger number of feeders as a result of a net gain in finishing spaces but weanling production will still outpace slaughter capacity and longstanding relationships between canadian producers and us finishers will support continued movement of weanlings for finishing in the us slaughter ready exports are forecast down 13 from 2021 on the expectation that the quebec backlog of slaughter ready hogs will be cleared by the end of q1 2022 but that higher slaughter exports will still be supported as quebec and ontario hogs are displaced by slaughter reductions at olymel carcass weights for 2022 are forecast to decline by 3 as carcass weights were heavier due to issues such as labor shortages supply chain issues and a plant strike however 1 growth in slaughter is forecast for 2022 as capacity utilisation improves at some plants despite olymel s cutback pork exports are expected to reach 1 485 million tonnes in 2022 canada has seen significant declines in export volume to china due to covid 19 restrictions and the recovery of the chinese herd as olymel looks to focus more on value added product it will be seeking to increase exports of those products in 2022 canada will continue to look to asian markets for increased export activity and value pork imports are forecast to decline by 1 in 2022 as domestic demand is stagnant and storage stocks are at historic highs however imports continue to be supported by consumer preference for specific cuts the us will remain the dominant source market for imports usda
why every church needs a garden do you have any fresh produce asked the homeless young woman hellen the leader of our church s food bank program replied sorry we are all out we don t get that kind of stuff in stock very often how about canned fruit the young woman inquired no said hellen that is usually the first thing we are out of the young woman left looking a bit disappointed i asked hellen why we didn t provide more fresh food at our community food bank she told me people don t often donate that kind of food because it is more expensive than canned or dried goods she also explained that canned fruits and vegetables are immensely popular so they are often the first items to run out the cdc has found that roughly 90 percent of americans do not eat the recommended servings of fruits and vegetables for a healthy diet that is shocking considering we live in the wealthiest country in the world of course for many people that is due to unhealthy choices but for the poor it is more often a result of unaffordable prices and accessibility the simple fact is that prepackaged junk food often offers the highest number of calories for the least cost and when you are pinching pennies calories are often the number one factor a bag of 8 apples may cost 5 whereas a dozen donuts may cost only 3 while that seems close one apple offers a mere 55 calories while one donut can be 300 450 calories one donut can offer the same calories as that whole bag of apples another big issue is accessibility for those who do not own a car getting to a grocery store or produce shop can be extremely difficult major grocery stores and super centers like walmart are the norm now these large stores are often centralized to serve several communities it s not a big deal to drive 5 or 10 miles if you have a car more than 50 years ago grocery stores tended to be smaller and within walking distance of the community they served large box stores have put these small stores out of business for those without a car or driver s license getting groceries is a significant challenge population areas where a high concentration of residents without cars live more than one mile from grocery retailers have been designated food deserts a food desert is an area where access to healthy food is extra difficult fast food restaurants and convenience stores may be present but these do not offer healthy food choices at a reasonable price the usda found that about 19 million americans or 6 2 percent of the population lived in such locations in 2015 the covid 19 pandemic has only made things worse as many small grocery businesses did not survive mandated closures food banks and other nonprofit community food programs help to fill this gap but as i discovered providing fresh or canned fruits and vegetables is challenging for them what can be done about this food deserts have been a recognized problem for a few decades one of the best solutions that has arisen are community gardens churches and nonprofits have helped communities hard hit by loss of local food stores to take initiative and supply their own fresh foods by growing them independently abandoned lots spare space in church yards and community centers have become the grounds for a local farming revolution people who have never grown a plant in their life are being taught to grow their own food this movement is taking place in large and small towns across the country a community garden is one where the land and farming supplies are provided by a nonprofit and community members tend a small plot of the garden with voluntary labor they get to keep a portion of the produce from their plot usually their plot produces much more than they need so the extra is given to other community members this is not a new concept it is one that adventists promoted heavily in the 1890s and early 19th century when similar food deserts plagued sprawling urban centers in the united states they were very popular during the great depression a community garden is a ministry every adventist church should operate the benefits of gardening and agriculture has been understood by our church since its inception it has been a key part of our school philosophy and considered a necessary part of a well rounded education community gardens have been growing in popularity again at adventist churches in north america and globally over the past 15 years see recent articles in the adventist review even if your church is not located in a food desert there are poor in your community that could benefit my own church operates a food bank and even though we are not in a food desert there are homeless and poor people who depend on it so what benefits would a church community garden ministry provide a big outreach opportunity for little cost all that is needed to begin a community garden are a few dozen square feet of land many beginner community gardens are only 10 feet by 10 feet a large size is 20 feet by 30 feet nearly every church has that amount of land sitting idle in fact most church yards are costing money to mow and maintain grass that the vast majority of the time sits unused why not make better use of that land for the gospel a small community garden can be started for as little as 1 500 if some hand tools and supplies can be donated by church members or acquired used this can keep startup costs low if you seek to keep costs low pray for god s blessing to help your endeavor become a success additionally brothers and sisters with a talent for growing things are sitting idle in many congregations let their talents work for the gospel cause speaking teaching and music are often viewed as necessary skills for the lord s work not so if you have a talent for gardening go to your church leaders and ask them to support you in starting a garden based mission if you are a pastor or church leader call for those with gardening talents to lead this ministry all the labor can be provided on a voluntary basis prepare children and adults for the soon return of jesus sister white repeatedly encouraged adventist families to live where they could own enough land to raise their own food she repeatedly emphasized the spiritual and physical benefits of gardening especially to children again and again the lord has instructed that our people are to take their families away from the cities into the country where they can raise their own provisions for in the future the problem of buying and selling will be a very serious one let them each have a piece of ground of their own and as you teach them how to make a garden how to prepare the soil for seed and the importance of keeping all the weeds pulled out teach them also how important it is to keep unsightly injurious practices out of the life teach them to keep down wrong habits as they keep down the weeds in their gardens in this time of fast food and ready to eat snacks the skill of gardening has mostly been lost a church garden offers the perfect teaching space for training church members in gardening techniques it will provide seeds from which they can begin their own garden at home the tools could even be loaned temporarily to help families till the ground for their home garden the great recession of 2008 and the covid 19 pandemic have demonstrated that even in the 21st century we cannot depend on modern society to reliably provide all our eating needs local gardens are still a vital resource for god s people in these last days as we approach the end of times the skill of providing your own food will become ever more important a church community garden can provide a place for church members without necessary land to grow their own nutritious food more important than this a community garden is a key part of the health message improve your church s outreach efforts one of our primary outreach tools is health education one missionary gardener called gardening an entering wedge that should be paired with the broader health message it will invite interest and open doors for people to not only hear more about health but also to hear the gospel message how many opportunities a church garden would provide for outreach when you speak to members of your community are they familiar with the location of your church if you had a community garden out front it would be a fantastic public relations opportunity it would enable your church to meet a physical need for community members this will lead to opportunities to share the love of jesus with them not only could produce be provided for those in need but garden classes could be offered to all community members also excess produce from your garden could provide a means of relationship evangelism what neighbor would say no to garden fresh tomatoes or cucumbers any produce that is not used to serve the needy could be placed in attractive baskets and given to church members to take to their unchurched neighbor and co workers this creates an opportunity for dialogue with hardly any effort and can be the basis of forming a deeper relationship that may lead to sharing the gospel build a stronger church congregation and promote inter generational relationships a church garden project is beneficial for building a stronger local church congregation church congregations are often fragmented by generation sabbath schools and other church activities like vacation bible school senior groups singles groups and couples groups all encourage church members to associate with their own peers primarily people are naturally more comfortable with similar aged peers churches must promote inter generational interaction the wisdom of older church members needs to be passed to young adults and especially the youth division and disconnect between generations have led some congregations to split churches should regularly provide activities that foster inter generational relationships a community garden is the perfect activity younger generations often lack gardening skills the older generations can share their knowledge in this area grandmas and grandpas in the church can become mentors to all the children and youth as they instruct them the youth and young adults can carry out the heavy labor while the seniors plan and coordinate gardening is naturally inter generational additionally a church garden provides for endless spiritual edification to all church members who participate the spiritual benefits were the biggest advantage sister white saw in gardening she was not the only one in 1897 j h kellogg wrote in the indicator the spare hours spent in the cultivation of such a crop may be as truly hours of communion with god as a church service or a prayer meeting 5 all these benefits are awaiting anyone who will work in concert with the creator to grow food as he intended that is why there is a revived movement within our church to grow garden ministry the adventist agriculture association was formed in 2012 with a vision to help churches and schools build thriving garden missions their website adventistag org provides numerous books and references to help you learn the deep knowledge of gardening their free video library contains a wealth of in depth how to instruction for every aspect of gardening to get your church garden ministry started i recommend referring to this

25 years ago italian troops land in albania on april 14 1997 italian troops crossed the adriatic sea and landed in albania for the first time since mussolini s invasion 50 years prior ostensibly to bring stability to europe s poorest country which had been devastated by the restoration of capitalism in the early 1990s the bulk of the 6 000 strong european operation alba intervention force operating under a united nations mandate was drawn from italy which ruled albania as a conquered territory from 1939 to 1943 during world war ii in the preceding months protests and looting had led to the near dissolution of the albanian state demonstrations had erupted after many workers had been swindled out of their life savings through government backed pyramid schemes the protests escalated into a full scale uprising in which armed rebels had taken control of approximately one third of the country italian prime minister romano prodi arrived at the albanian port city of vlore on april 13 after a short helicopter ride across the adriatic he was accompanied by king lena i son of the late king zog who lived in exile in south africa throughout his life and was welcomed by albanian president sali ram berisha prodi addressed a crowd of 10 000 albanians many of whom cheered his claim that the intervention would bring peace to the country italian defense minister beniamino andreatta warned that if the troops were attacked during peace keeping operations they would open fire the first major overseas military intervention undertaken by italy since the defeat of fascism was politically enabled by the two factions of the former communist party pci which provided the bulk of the olive tree coalition the parliamentary supporters of the prodi government in a key parliamentary test of the decision to send the troops the party of the democratic left by far the largest of the two stalinist factions voted with the government the rifondazione comunista the lesser faction voted against sending troops but only after rc leader fausto bertinotti was sure that prodi would still obtain a majority from the votes of right wing opposition parties like the forza italia of billionaire silvio berlusconi the pseudo left groups in italy for the most part joined the rc and shared responsibility for its decision to prop up the prodi government which had carried out right wing austerity policies 50 years ago quebec general strike shakes canada on april 11 1972 over 210 000 public sector workers in quebec began a general strike against the government bringing much of the province to a standstill strike organizers demanded that the government provide a 100 a week minimum wage an 8 percent raise to match the inflation rate job security guarantees and equal treatment of male and female workers the strike involved workers from three unions the quebec teachers corporation the quebec federation of labor and the confederation of national trade unions that had recently formed an alliance called the common front the organizations began holding joint meetings of the various public services workers in 1971 when a strike at the la presse newspaper was suppressed by police this as well as the police killing of 28 year old student protester michèle gauthier in october 1971 galvanized workers especially the youthful rank and file which had been radicalized by the vietnam war and the may 1968 general strike in france the unions had hoped that they could reach an agreement with the government without a strike however the quebec government of liberal prime minister robert bourassa who had put the province under martial law during the crisis of 1970 refused to give any response even after a limited 24 hour strike on march 28 and an announcement that the union would be willing to negotiate the wage demand bourassa s government still refused to meet the government responded to the strike by arresting militant workers and passing a bill making strikes by public sector workers illegal despite massive working class support the union heads laid down and accepted defeat ordering workers to end the strike after 11 days bourassa s government took this as an opportunity to destroy the common front movement and on may 9 he had arrested the heads each of the three unions outraged workers responded with a second and even more explosive general strike involving hundreds of thousands street fighting with police was common and the homes of some government officials were firebombed in some small towns workers drove out local government officials and took control of radio stations broadcasting news and calls of support for the strike on may 20 the government came to an agreement with the common front establishing the 100 per week minimum wage but providing only a 5 5 percent general wage increase an actual pay cut given inflation with no language for job security or equal pay for equal work 75 years ago texas ammonium nitrate explosion triggers worst industrial accident in us history on april 16 1947 a fire onboard the ss grandcamp a cargo ship docked in the texas city port ignited ammonium nitrate stocks that it was carrying the ensuing series of explosions and massive fire claimed the lives of at least 581 people the deadliest industrial accident in the history of the united states the grandcamp had served as a us navy cargo ship during world war ii after having been mothballed it was given to france to help in that country s post war reconstruction though it was carrying american cargo its load included 2 300 tons of ammonium nitrate used for both fertilizer and explosives for mining the highly explosive material was transported and stored at a high temperature increasing its chemical activity at around 8 a m on april 16 smoke was spotted in the vessel s cargo hold attempts to extinguish it with water failed the captain then ordered all hatches to be shut while the cargo area was filled with steam this likely exacerbated the crisis by increasing the heat in the cargo hold and potentially converting the ammonium nitrate to nitrous oxide at 9 12 a m the entire ship exploded the blast triggered a 15 foot wave and destroyed approximately 1 000 nearby buildings ships also docked in the port were also ignited among them was the high flyer another cargo ship carrying ammonium nitrate it later exploded destroying two more vessels close by a number of chemical plants manufacturing facilities industrial warehouses and an oil hold were also set ablaze on land triggering widespread fires the disaster was of a scale that can only be compared with war of those killed 63 bodies were never identified another 113 of the victims were listed as missing because no remains were ever found the accident decimated the texas city fire department with all but one of its frontline members perishing many of them in the fires on land over 5 000 people were injured with 1 784 admitted to 21 hospitals in the area the seaport was destroyed together with more than 500 houses leaving an estimated 2 000 people homeless none of the corporations or government agencies involved were held legally responsible for the disaster 100 years ago two leading figures in armenian genocide assassinated on april 17 1922 two members of the nationalist armenian revolutionary federation arf arshavir shirakian and aram

condemned to death in a turkish military court martial for his role in the genocide shakir was also a founding member of the cup and its paramilitary special organization which played a key role in conducting the armenian genocide in march 1915 he wrote in a letter that the cup intended to annihilate all of the armenians living within turkey not to allow a single one to remain on the question of how this killing and massacring will be carried out the government will give the necessary instructions to the provincial governors and army commanders because there were no international extradition treaties for war crimes at the time in europe both shakir and azmi were able to live openly in berlin in 1919 the arf also known as the dashnaks one of the oldest armenian political parties and a bourgeois nationalist organization that opposed the establishment of soviet armenia in 1920 decided to conduct operation nemesis in which perpetrators of the genocide would be assassinated arshavir

editor s note the us federal reserve makes decisions with the sole aim of boosting the us economy by doing so the fed disrupts the international financial systems and causes immense harm to developing countries including asia s emerging economies three experts share their views on the issue with china daily the fight against the covid 19 pandemic has left a large imprint on the us federal reserve s balance sheet since the outbreak of the pandemic in early 2020 the fed has purchased a wide range of assets and pumped liquidity into the us financial system to cushion the impact of the pandemic and fiscal stimulus on interest rates as a result its balance sheet ballooned to nearly 9 trillion compared with the pre pandemic level of 4 trillion to put this number in perspective the added 5 trillion in the fed s assets is roughly the same size of total overseas claims by asian banking systems with the extraordinary fiscal and monetary policy support the us economy has staged a strong recovery since the third quarter of 2020 the economy grew 5 7 percent in 2021 which is the highest annual growth since 1984 domestic demand has been rising even faster by any measure the us economy now runs on its full capacity the unemployment rate has fallen below 4 percent and inflation climbed to 7 9 percent besides despite the russia ukraine military conflict creating considerable economic uncertainty the fed raised its policy rate on march 16 the first time since 2018 to curb inflation unfortunately the fed s tightening cycle has often preceded economic slowdown and financial instability in the united states and emerging market economies between 1980 and 1982 monetary tightening led to a recession interest rate hikes between 1986 and 1989 triggered the savings and loan crisis and later combined with the subsequent oil price shock in 1990 led to a brief recession in the us the fed embarked on tightening in 1993 leading to significant rises in long term rates and companies borrowing costs while the us avoided a recession during this tightening cycle in 1993 94 a sudden reversal in capital flows and the collapse of the mexican peso in december 1994 led to a series of financial crises in several latin american countries in 1994 95 and asian economies in 1997 98 worse monetary tightening between 2004 and 2007 pricked the bubble in the us housing market and pushed the global economy into a financial crisis and an economic recession in 2008 09 the last tightening cycle of the us fed during 2015 18 was cut short as quantitative tightening led to negative market reactions soon afterward the world was hit by the covid 19 pandemic interest rate hikes in the us have significant impacts on asian economies through trade exchange rate and financial market channels for example higher interest rates curb aggregate demand and hence reduce external demand for asian exports also higher yields on us assets attract international investment and create strong demand for dollars this increases the dollar funding cost for asian economies who need to borrow from overseas for their investment while the impact of the dollar s appreciation on asia s trade remains ambiguous given the weakening global demand and the transmission of higher us interest rates through international capital markets would exert downward pressure on local investment and consumption in fact empirical evidence shows that local interest rates in asian developing economies respond to short term us rates in a strongly positive manner regardless of existing exchange rate regimes although emerging market economies are expected to navigate increasingly turbulent waters an immediate challenge for the asian region is to strengthen macro prudential surveillance and preempt new sources of financial instability first while still manageable inflation has picked up in many economies in the region driven by high food and energy prices increased shipping costs and depreciating currencies so monetary authorities in the asian region need to carefully monitor the risks of higher inflation and take measures to rein in inflation expectations with the fed raising interest rates local currency depreciation driven by widening interest differentials could further complicate the inflation battle second an extended period of very low interest rates has created a legacy of record high debt in both corporate and household sectors as the authorities lift regulatory relief and forbearance measures while monetary policy support wanes there will be lagged effects of covid 19 on corporate defaults and loan losses nonperforming loan ratios have already risen in a number of regional economies albeit from a low base hence financial authorities should closely monitor the risks and take early actions to prevent the buildup of systemic risks for instance preventive debt restructuring can offer companies a second chance at rehabilitating debts and help banks assess the debt risks with more certainty third thanks to the expansionary fiscal policy in response to the pandemic governments in many regional economies increased their debt issuance so the risk of debt vulnerability runs high especially for economies facing high external debt service burden while sustaining large structural current account deficits and holding insufficient foreign exchange reserves in order to mitigate external vulnerabilities more proactive public debt management is needed for example by lengthening the maturity structure and building a more sustainable debt service profile the asian region also needs to accelerate local currency bond and capital market development to reduce its reliance on external debt financing and improve financial resilience fourth massive and at times highly volatile global capital flows can disrupt the region s macroeconomic and financial stability with the imminent changes in the us monetary policy stance capital flows to the region could reverse with the risk of sudden stops although the region s strong growth outlook and healthy external positions mitigate the risk the authorities need to remain vigilant and prepare for a sudden change in international investors sentiment in this regard effective capital flow management including foreign exchange and capital control measures are key to that preparation fifth emerging market and developing economies in the region would benefit from strengthening the global and regional safety net arrangements to support crisis prevention and management past financial crises show that macroeconomic stabilization policies alone are not enough to safeguard financial stability globalized finance requires a solid global defense against financial crises so effective financial safety nets should have multiple layers of both crisis prevention and crisis management which must begin with sound macroeconomic policies at the national level more flexible and targeted assistance at the regional level and eventually backstopped by global cooperation and sixth strong economic recovery is the only way out of the crisis asia needs to seize the opportunities arising from rapid digital transformation to further boost productivity and capture potential gains in economic growth and employment as such the region s policymakers must promote broader and more equal access to digital opportunities by enhancing digital infrastructure and expanding human capacities especially for the poor and disadvantaged through investments and policy reforms in education health and public

developing economies in the region would benefit from strengthening the global and regional safety net arrangements to support crisis prevention and management past financial crises show that macroeconomic stabilization policies alone are not enough to safeguard financial stability globalized finance requires a solid global defense against financial crises so effective financial safety nets should have multiple layers of both crisis prevention and crisis management which must begin with sound macroeconomic policies at the national level more flexible and targeted assistance at the regional level and eventually backstopped by global cooperation and sixth strong economic recovery is the only way out of the crisis asia needs to seize the opportunities arising from rapid digital transformation to further boost productivity and capture potential gains in economic growth and employment as such the region s policymakers must promote broader and more equal access to digital opportunities by enhancing digital infrastructure and expanding human capacities especially for the poor and disadvantaged through investments and policy reforms in education health and public

by michael we are far closer to a potential global cataclysm than most people would dare to imagine right now leaders from all across the political spectrum are openly warning us that a worldwide food crisis is coming but when people in the western world hear of such warnings most of them assume that it will just be something that affects poor people in africa or asia unfortunately that will not be the case this time around we truly are in unprecedented territory and we are going to see things happen in the months ahead that once would have been absolutely unthinkable global hunger had already been steadily rising for the past couple of years due to the covid pandemic and now a confluence of events here in 2022 threatens to create a true global nightmare at this moment we are still eating food that was previously grown but it is the food that will not be grown in the months ahead that will be the real problem because the truth is that we do not have much of a buffer to work with at all david friedberg is an early google executive who started the farming insurance company climate corporation and he just told the all in podcast that the earth operates on a 90 day food supply the whole planet earth operates a 90 day food supply that means that once we stop making food humans run out of food in 90 days it is estimated that approximately 7 9 billion people currently live on the planet and feeding everyone is a real challenge even if everything goes perfectly unfortunately global conditions have been much less than perfect for the past couple of years and friedberg says that the new global energy crisis has pushed the cost of key fertilizer components to levels that are absolutely insane the price of nitrogen has gone from 200 to 1 000 the price in potassium has gone from 200 to 700 and the price of phosphorus has gone from 250 to 700 so now it is so expensive to grow a crop that a lot of farmers around the world are pulling acres out of production so they re going to grow less this year than they would have otherwise because it is so expensive and they can not access fertilizer he explained food supplies are going to go down and it is going to be catastrophic many farmers all over the world will try to grow food without fertilizer this year but that will result in a whole lot less food being grown in one of his latest videos chris martenson compared rice plants that were grown with phosphorus to rice plants that were not given any phosphorus i was absolutely blown away by the difference as global food production drops precipitously there simply will not be enough food for everyone in the months ahead of course the wealthy nations will buy up what is available driving up prices in the process and the poorer nations will be left out in the cold in fact this is already starting to happen in march the global price of food rose at the fastest monthly pace ever recorded march s food price index from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao printed 159 3 points in march up 19 15 points from february when it had already reached record highs the index was up 33 6 from the same time last year the march rise in food prices is a stunning 12 64 mom almost double the previous record monthly surge if you are looking for red flags you just found one food riots have already begun in some parts of the globe for example you can see a clip from the rioting in peru right here in the months ahead it is only going to get worse thanks to the war in ukraine the price of wheat was up almost 20 percent last month alone the war has helped push cereal prices up 17 over the past month with the closure of ports throttling wheat and maize exports from ukraine russian exports have also been slowed by financial and shipping problems world wheat prices soared by 19 7 during march while maize prices posted a 19 1 month on month increase hitting a record high along with those of barley and sorghum as i have discussed perviously russia and ukraine normally export enormous amounts of food to the rest of the planet we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us but that won t be the case this year sadly it is being projected that corn production in ukraine will be cut by more than half in 2022 ukraine is one of the world s top exporters of corn sunflower oil and wheat disruptions stemming from russia s invasion of ukraine have stoked fears the war torn country could experience a 50 decline in crop output this year according to bloomberg forecast data from ag expert ukragroconsult show ukraine s corn output could be as low as 19 million tons about half of last year s 41 million tons and the ukrainians have already announced that they won t be exporting any of their production at all this year because they need it to feed their own population during the war here in the united states the bird flu pandemic continues to escalate and as a result the price of eggs has more than doubled in recent weeks a deadly and highly infectious avian flu is forcing us farmers to kill millions of egg laying hens reducing the country s egg supply and driving up prices on thursday retailers paid between 2 80 and 2 89 for a dozen large grade a white eggs in the midwest according to the usda s daily midwest regional egg report that s more than double the roughly 1 25 they cost in march according to data compiled by brian earnest lead protein industry analyst at cobank which provides financial services to agribusiness that is extremely alarming so what is going to happen if this pandemic continues to wipe out millions of chickens every month meanwhile certain shortages that have been simmering for a long time are now reaching critical levels for example walgreens has announced that it is going to start rationing baby formula a national shortage of baby formula brought on by pandemic related supply chain issues has forced us retailers such as walgreens to ration the all important product the company the second largest pharmacy store chain in the united states behind cvs said friday that amid the supply chain crunch it is limiting customers to three infant and toddler formula product purchases at a time at its 9 021 us locations this wasn t supposed to happen according to the optimists things were supposed to be getting back to normal by this point but instead things are getting even worse according to the daily mail 29 percent of all top selling formulas are out of stock at stores across the nation right now unfortunately this is just the beginning everyone agrees that the global food crisis is going to intensify in the months ahead and david friedberg is trying to warn us about what could happen if widespread panic sets in i don t know about death there will be famine famine is to be short of calories there will be strategic reserves released but it won t be enough we won t have enough the way supply chains are set up there will not be enough he said as you know with any market when there is scarcity people come in and buy at a faster pace so this is a market dynamic it is not like people are physically hoarding loaves of bread but commodity traders countries strategic reserves start buying up what they can get to prepare for the famine prices go even higher and it kicks other people out of the market the whole thing gets ugly fast we have been warned over and over again that this was coming and now it is here you may have noticed that my articles have been longer than usual lately and that is because there is so much more information that i need to share with you each day we truly are entering a full blown planetary emergency and i am trying to do my best to sound the alarm unfortunately most of the population is still not taking this crisis seriously so many people out there are fully convinced that they will always be able to rely on the system and a lot of them will continue to believe that even as the system literally collapses all around them
elon musk has raised speculation that he may he launch a hostile take over bid of twitter after he filed paperwork with the securities and exchange commission sec indicating he will keep criticizing the platform and demanding change musk who is the company s largest shareholder signed the new filing monday indicating he may express his views about twitter s policies and services to the board or on social media the form also said musk may engage in discussions with the board and or members potential business combinations and strategic alternatives the business operations capital structure governance management strategy of the issuer and other matters concerning the issuer the reporting person may express his views to the board and or members of the issuer s management team and or the public through social media or other channels with respect to the issuer s business products and service offerings the filing added musk had originally filed sec form 13g indicating he planned to be a passive investor but soon amended the filing to a 13d form commonly associated with activist investors who want to signal their intentions to create change or even take over a company entirely monday s amendment has analysts concerned musk could be seeking to stage a hostile takeover at twitter which would require him to own at least 50 percent of the company s stock notably this week s filing indicates that musk has no present plans or intentions to stage such a takeover though it also states that he reserves the right to change his plans at any time this weekend s changeup spares the company from having to deal with a renegade director tweeting about board level discussions that would have been untenable don bilson of gordon haskett research advisors told cnbc monday the flip side to this is twitter must deal with a wildcard investor that already owns 9 percent of the company and has the resources to buy the remaining 91 percent as volatile as musk is we could see a move like that made shortly or we could never see it all he added i don t think anything is off the menu with this guy this is clearly going to be an unfriendly situation wedbush securities analyst dan ives echoed instead of musk in the board room in the corner just saying nay or agreeing on certain board candidates i think now it really goes to the point that in the coming days i think we ll start to see if he s going to go more hostile more active that s what the street s focused on other analysts allege musk s promise to be vocal about the company could impact the value of twitter stock which recovered quickly after falling more than 8 percent in premarket trading monday after news emerged that musk was refusing to take a seat on the company s board of directors the social media giant s share price was up more than 1 as of midday monday to 46 77 after closing at 46 23 friday twitter stock recovered quickly after falling more than 8 percent in premarket trading monday the volatile morning came after elon musk refused to take a seat on the company s board of directors analysts allege that agrawal s statement coupled with musk rejection of board membership suggests the billionaire may be seeking more control over the company elon musk left has raised speculation that he may he launch a hostile take over bid of twitter after he filed paperwork with the sec monday indicating he will keep criticizing the platform and demanding change the latest filing comes just hours after twitter ceo parag agrawal right announced sunday night that musk had declined his invitation to join the platform s board board of directors how much would it cost elon musk to take over twitter in order for elon musk to takeover twitter he would need to purchase a majority stake in the firm or enough shares to override 50 percent of the vote the tesla ceo who is twitter s largest shareholder currently holds a 9 2 percent stake in the social media platform he owns 73 4 million shares valued at approximately 3 4billion twitter currently has 800 64 million outstanding shares according to yahoo finance musk would need to obtain at least an additional 40 8 percent stake in the company to become the majority shareholder the spacex ceo the world s richest person with a 302billion net worth would need to purchase roughly 400 32 million additional shares valued around 15 3billion to own 50 percent of the company musk began purchasing twitter stock on january 31 and continued to buy shares during every trading session through april 1 according to a sec filing obtained by dailymail com last week his largest purchase occurred on february 7 when he acquired more than 4 8 million shares worth approximately 176million twitter closed at its 2022 low point on march 7 when shares were trading at 32 42 each the shares had ended january at 37 51 and have significantly surged in the wake of the news surrounding musk s involvement with the platform on monday twitter stock recovered quickly after falling more than 8 percent in premarket trading as news emerged that musk was refusing to take a seat on the company s board of directors the social media giant s share price was up more than 2 8 percent as of monday afternoon to 47 51 after closing at 46 23 friday advertisement the tesla ceo s latest filing came just hours after twitter ceo parag agrawal announced sunday night that musk had declined his invitation to join the platform s board board of directors agrawal said the board would still remain open to musk s input while also warning there will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged analysts allege that agrawal s statement coupled with musk rejection of board membership which eliminated the agreement that he would not own more than 14 9 percent on twitter shares suggests the billionaire may be seeking more control over the company while it remains unclear what mr musk s priorities are we do expect his tweets will receive increased attention which could drive share price volatility keybanc analysts told cnbc monday elon switched his paperwork last week from passive to activist investor he s no longer bound by the agreement that caps the amount of twitter he can own he seems mad longtime technology reporter and author alex kantrowitz argued only getting more interesting from here jason miller former trump spokesman and ceo of rival social media platform gettr told dailymail com musk probably realized that the culture is so embedded in twitter that it can t be changed it is like getting a rental car from a driver who smoked you can t get rid of the smell the entire culture is fundamentally broken miller said and criticized their constant political discrimination censoring of conservative voices including jake posobiec and juanita brodderick and continually choosing winners and losers in the free speech he did admit however that there is no predicting what musk might do next and whether he will be hands off when it comes to twitter loup ventures managing partner gene munster however said he believes he majority of the drama is over arguing it would ve been a smarter decision for musk to go for a takeover immediately if he planned to do so the analyst also claimed he doesn t believe musk wants to dedicate his time to a twitter takeover understand that there is something that is important to him around free speech and i think he wants to move that forward understand that he sees that as an opportunity as big as electrification and as big as space travel munster said but ultimately i think that this just it s just one too many things on the plate for him to take over on monday musk filed an amendment to his previous 13d sec filing which declared his intentions to be an active investor the new filing allows him the acquire additional shares of the company or sell all or a portion of his shares if he pleases however the document states musk has no present plans or intentions to do so musk would need to purchase roughly 400 32 million additional shares valued around 15 3billion to own 50 percent of twitter musk who disclosed a 9 2 percent stake in twitter just a few days ago was offered a board seat on tuesday and his appointment was to become effective on saturday but chief executive parag agrawal announced sunday evening that the tesla ceo had decided to decline the offer elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board agrawal said on twitter adding that he thought it was for the best on monday musk filed an amendment to his previous 13d sec filing which declared his intentions to be an active investor the new filing allows him the acquire additional shares of the company or sell all or a portion of his shares if he pleases however the document states musk has no present plans or intentions to do so this is clearly going to be an unfriendly situation wedbush securities analyst dan ives pictured argued during a squawkbox interview on monday instead of musk in the board room in the corner just saying nay or agreeing on certain board candidates i think now it really goes to the point that in the coming days i think we ll start to see if he s going to go more hostile more active he may also participate in active conversations with twitter s board or leadership concerning including without limitation potential business combinations and strategic alternatives the business operations capital structure governance management strategy of the issuer and other matters the filing reads musk is permitted to share his opinions with the board company leadership and online or in any other capacity news of billionaire s involvement in the company had caused twitter stock prices to skyrocket over the last week reaching a high of 53 84 per share on april 5 analysts argue it is likely that his refusal to join the board of directors influenced monday s decline musk s board appointment would have started on saturday contingent on a background check and formal acceptance agrawal previously said the board and i had many discussions about elon joining the board and with elon directly wrote agrawal we were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks we also believed that having elon as a fiduciary of the company where he like all board members has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders was the best path forward the board offered him a seat twitter stock fell 8 percent in premarket trading monday after the social media giant revealed largest shareholder elon musk pictured last month in germany had refused his seat on the company s board of directors twitter stock briefly dropped 8 percent in premarket trade monday trading at less than 43 per share however the drop recovered slightly and by 7 30 am et was at 45 20 per share an only 2 23 percent decline from closing on friday yet musk then changed his mind amid days spent posting a flurry of tweets suggesting changes to twitter and conducting online polls some serious some seemingly in jest the usually vocal musk 50 has not commented on his decision but early monday morning he tweeted an emoji of a smiling face with a hand over its mouth supposedly an expression of rapture a smirk a shy smile or indicating happiness he then deleted it several twitter employees posted their reactions to agrawal s announcement seemingly agitated by the roller coaster surrounding musk s involvement in the company with one researcher calling it the drama that keeps on giving my drafts folder deserves agency representation at this point global head of partners lara cohen said a twitter staff researcher called the situation surrounding musk a drama that just keeps giving ej samson who works in the company s marketing department appeared eager to discuss the situation with his coworkers global head of partners lara cohen made a seemingly snarky remark about the situation saying my drafts folder deserves agency representation at this point twitter researcher matt demichiel simply shared an image of cartoon character spongebob squarepants face planting in the sand can t wait to discuss this with my passionate hard working and dedicated colleagues that show up to work every day even if it s not in an office ej samson who works in the company s marketing department wrote twitter researcher matt demichiel simply shared an image of cartoon character spongebob squarepants face planting in the sand had he taken a board seat the spacex ceo would have been limited in how much of the company s shares he could own with a 14 9 percent cap musk could now remain a passive investor or plan a hostile takeover of the company some on social media also wondered whether the south africa born businessman s complex network of business interests could have raised issues during the background check twitter s ceo did not reveal the reason behind musk s surprising decision musk 50 is pictured on thursday at the official opening of tesla s factory in texas the second tweet about deleting w saw musk give two options without no as an answer with 55 8 percent saying yes and 44 2 percent of course of 445 158 votes to date parag agrawal s statement in full team elon musk has decided not to join our board here s what i can share about what happened the board and i had many discussions about elon joining the board and with elon directly we were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks we also believed that having elon as a fiduciary of the company where he like all board

musk was also due to give a ted talk on thursday morning in vancouver and it is now uncertain whether that will proceed as planned musk on saturday continued a week of radical suggestions about changes to the company s policies everyone who signs up for twitter blue ie pays 3 month should get an authentication checkmark he tweeted one respondent asked for the cost to be made cheaper claiming that 3 feeds an entire family in the south american nation that prompted musk to respond again writing maybe even an option to pay in doge musk has long enjoyed teasing his more than 81 million followers with the cryptocurrency whose logo is a shiba inu dog which is widely regarded as a joke unlike bitcoin the most valuable form of crypto which is worth around 43 320 as of april 10 dogecoin is currently worth 0 16 agrawal is pictured with his wife and daughter the 37 year old ceo said he felt it was for the best that musk does not join the board twitter s new largest shareholder suggested letting users pay for the premium twitter blue with dogecoins on saturday it is unclear if the tweet was sent before or after he told the board he would not be joining them elon musk previously suggested using joke cryptocurrency dogecoin as a payment method for twitter s premium blue service dogecoin is widely seen as a joke cryptocurrency with one dogecoin worth 0 16 as of april 10 dogecoin is widely regarded as a joke cryptocurrency with one of the coins worth just 0 16 usd as of april 10 compared to one bitcoin being worth more than 43 300 on the same date the tesla ceo was named to twitter s board of directors after tweeting several polls on hot button issues within the company including a question about whether it should implement an edit button agrawal announced musk s board membership on the social media on tuesday saying the billionaire brings great value to the company i m excited to share that we re appointing elonmusk to our board through conversations with elon in recent weeks it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our board agrawal wrote he s both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on twitter and in the boardroom to make us stronger in the long term welcome elon musk responded to the ceo saying looking forward to working with parag twitter board to make significant improvements to twitter in coming months other board members seemed receptive to musk who has 80 million twitter followers joining their ranks with several issuing welcome messages online including platform founder

inc ceo david rosenblatt and egon durban co ceo of silver lake did not publicly comment on musk s appointment to the board twitter stocks have surged since mid march when musk purchased his stake in the first post musk seemingly took aim at the company s lax remote working policies saying he came up with the plan since no one shows up anyway so far 91 1 percent of 923 459 respondents voted in favor of the plan twitter blue launched in june 2021 is twitter s first subscription service and offers exclusive access to premium features on a monthly subscription basis twitter says it is available in the united states canada australia and new zealand the features include bookmarks and a preview option which lets subscribers see what a tweet will look like and undo any errors for 30 seconds before it goes live the social media network confirmed it is finally working on a long requested edit button last week after musk suggested that too musk also suggested that users who sign up for twitter blue should pay significantly less than the current 2 99 a month and should get an authentication checkmark as well as an option to pay in local currency price should probably be 2 month but paid 12 months up front account doesn t get checkmark for 60 days watch for credit card chargebacks suspended with no refund if used for scam spam musk said in a tweet and no ads musk suggested the power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if twitter depends on advertising money to survive musks musings came after he tweeted several polls to his millions of followers on the social media platform on saturday the outspoken tesla ceo known for his social media antics initially asked if he should transform the company s silicon valley headquarters into a homeless shelter before suggesting the removal of the letter w in twitter in the first post musk seemingly took aim at the company s lax remote working policies saying he came up with the plan since no one shows up anyway the result suggests overwhelming support for the prospective undertaking with 91 1 percent of more than 923 459 respondents voting in favor of the plan the second tweet about deleting w saw musk give two options without no as an answer it resulted in 55 8 percent saying yes and 44 2 percent of course it comes weeks after twitter executives who offered staffers the option of working from home forever during the pandemic reopened the offices on march 15 with remote work remaining an option for staffers it s been almost two years since we closed our offices and travel and i m excited to announce that we re ready to fully open up business travel and all our offices around the world agrawal wrote in a note to employees posted to twitter on march 3 business travel is back effective immediately and office openings will start on march 15 he wrote in the statement agrawal who was promoted to ceo of the san francisco based company in november said that he would be honoring a policy put in place by former head jack dorsey during the early days of the pandemic that said staffers could work remotely forever if they wanted to in the statement agrawal who was promoted to ceo of the san francisco based company in november said he would be honoring a policy put in place by former head exec jack dorsey during the early days of the pandemic that allowed staffers to work remotely indefinitely our top priority since the beginning of the pandemic has been to keep you all safe and this will continue agrawal wrote now we are returning to a stage where you re living your lives adjusting to local health guidelines and deciding what works best for you so the decisions about where you work whether you feel safe traveling for business and what events you attend should be yours he added in a sentence set in bold as we open back up our approach remains the same wherever you feel most productive and creative is where you will work and that include working from home full time forever the ceo wrote in another bolded sentence office every day that works too some days in the office some days from home of course staffers at the san francisco headquarter company now have the option to come into the office a policy musk seemingly took aim at with the saturday poll pictured is twitters san francisco office last summer prior to posting the poll musk also suggested further changes to twitter s business models in a series of tweets suggesting tweaks to the platform s premium blue service including a cheaper subscription price banning ads and offering the option to pay in cryptocurrency agrawal however warned that distributed working will be much much harder and said there will be lots of challenges amid the new policy agrawal went on to tout the advantages of having staffers in the same physical space where they can experience the company culture and said that visits to the office will bring that culture to life in such a powerful way the ceo then signed off expressing hope that many would indeed return to their office desks i look forward to seeing you all back at the office or perhaps at an event somewhere in your home city or mine can t wait parag more than a month later as silicon valley s tech workers are starting to filter back to the office as covid 19 cases plummet it looks as if the ceo s faith in staffers desire to return to work in person was misplaced many tech companies are now forcing staff back to the office rather than simply giving them the option google for instance told employees last month that it would begin requiring employees to return in person at least three days a week a policy that went into effect this past week apple similarly announced that by april 11 employees will have to work from the office at least one day a week

year s elections unicamp economics professor guilherme mello said brazil s triple fiscal law long considered a stabilizing pillar for many in financial markets is outdated at best and at worst out of

flexible it must be countercyclical it must contribute to long term debt stabilization it must contribute to state planned spending let s make fiscal rules that match the world s experience said mello who coordinates the economic policy team at pt s official think tank brazilian government spending is governed by three rules the fiscal responsibility act which sets budget transparency rules the golden rule which prohibits the government from borrowing to pay for recurring expenditures and the spending cap which limits budget increases to inflation for 20 years of the three the spending cap known locally as roof is the most divisive for investors it s the fiscal backbone to prevent runaway spending in emerging economies whose combined debt reached nearly 90 of gdp in 2020 but mello said the spending cap is not only outdated it s out of this world no country in the world has it no economist sees this and says it s a good idea to freeze spending for 20 years he added roof given that it has been circumvented many times under the bolsonaro government it has lost credibility under lula s leadership the pt s tenure in government has been marked by increased spending on social assistance programmes such as the bolsa familia cash transfer scheme and major infrastructure projects particularly in transport energy and water much of that money came from record taxes thanks to the commodity boom admired however the direction of policymaking changed after lula s successor dilma rousseff endured a deep years long recession with a subsequent right wing government opting for fiscal investment attracts latin america s largest economy mello called the approach a huge failure noting that economic growth has largely stagnated since then and that there is now more poverty more misery more inflation and more hunger the direction from 2016 to 2021 is to shrink the country and expect the private sector to do everything this strategy cannot continue he said brazil is not public expenditure is important for creating conditions for growth reducing inequality and creating infrastructure when you do that it s an investment that helps increase gdp and reduce debt in the long run such remarks are likely to cause panic among investors who have largely praised bolsonaro s government s more restrained approach to spending but mello believes spending is an effective tool when used properly brazil can spend more money if it spends right you have to choose public programs that have certain characteristics they have to have a high fiscal multiplier in the sense of generating more income and jobs they have to generate social impact and must create the conditions for the future he said adding that investments in energy infrastructure for example will reduce electricity costs and support the wider economy sergio vale chief economist at mb associados said it was inevitable that the pt would attack brazil s fiscal rules if it returned to power given changing global attitudes towards spending the problem is that the fiscal position today is worse than the one lula inherited in 2003 we will end the year with a debt of 84 of gdp a primary deficit of over 1 of gdp and very high interest rates if there is no room the government it s no use trying to spend money vale said he added that it would be fine if spending caps were replaced with better rules but that was unlikely to happen their idea appears to be to lift the rules and increase public and social investment but without a strong adjustment to the rest of spending that would mean a bigger deficit and a worse situation for mello the clearest validation of his approach came in the first year of the pandemic when the bolsonaro government rolled out a stimulus worth 8 of gdp which included monthly payments 600 reais 130 in cash for nine months to millions of brazil s poorest people the plan is believed to reduce the economic contraction in 2020 to minus 4 much better than the original forecast of minus 9 or 10 we proved in 2020 that social transfers work they work for gdp they work for poverty and hunger additional reporting by carolina ingizza

it s been a couple of weeks since my last photo a day post for a variety of reasons first we were in florida then emmy died then i had some disk space issues that kept me from getting photos off my camera that s all sorted at last just in time for me to leave town again in an effort to catch up a bit i m going to dump several photos at a time into a couple of posts this one will be a total of eight days worth of pictures covering our trip and a few days after i ve got several gigabytes of trip pictures but almost all of those include the kids and again i m trying not to have this be the cute kid photo of the day so with one exception i ll keep it to things that aren t them 101 366 the one exception is this shot as we got on the plane to florida steelykid and the pip in their seats on the plane to florida i like the way this basically captures their approach steelykid waiting calmly for the point when she could pull out her tablet and watch cartoons and the pip so fired up i couldn t keep him in focus 102 366 the first day we were in florida we went up to the zoo in tampa where they do a special christmas light show in the evenings in december the manatee fountain and christmas lights at the zoo in tampa i like the combination of the very floridian manatee fountain and the incongruous lighted reindeer i don t quite know what i think they ought to do instead but i always find the winter based christmas iconography kind of weird in florida 103 366 the next day we went to the beach a gull soaring over a beach on the gulf coast of florida this was a little less of a contrast than in some past years it was in the 60 s at home but still nice to be at the beach in december 104 366 the next day we went on a cruise around the harbor in port charlotte looking for dolphins we didn t manage to find dolphins but did see somebody flying a biplane of all things a biplane in flight in florida you don t see that every day 105 366 on our last day we went and played a little miniature golf the course was home to a substantial number of lizards like this black and red guy spotted sunning himself a lizard on a rock at the miniature golf course 106 366 on our return steelykid had to finish her homework from the previous week making a cardboard building to contribute to the model city her class was making steelykid s toy factory she drew the windows and doors and so on while in florida on bits of card stock that i had cut to fit a couple of shoe boxes we colored these at home before school on the first morning back then taped them to the boxes i think it came out pretty well considering all the constraints we were working under 107 366 the next day was the unveiling of the city in steelykid s second grade classroom i got a whole bunch of pictures but they mostly include other people s kids and i make a point of not posting photos of other people s kids if i can avoid it so here s the vote tally from when they decided on the name for their city rejected names for friendship city in steelykid s second grade class 108 366 this was the thursday after emmy died on tuesday night and what with one thing and another i didn t take any photos that day i could maybe fish something out of the extras from the others but i did engage in a bit of visual art that day so i ll post these instead some holiday silliness i was in a weird place okay anyway that gets me a week closer to being caught up which i ll promptly squander by going away for several days of christmas festivities but you know you take what you can get
elon musk the world s wealthiest man and the largest shareholder of twitter will no longer be joining the social media firm s board ceo parag agrawal said late sunday in a surprising reversal following last week s announcement that the tesla and spacex chief executive had been appointed to the panel the sunday disclosure from agrawal who said last week that he had been engaging with musk for a few weeks before announcing his appointment to the board follows a series of unusual tweets from the spacex executive over the weekend in which he wondered aloud to his over 80 million followers if twitter was dying citing low frequency of tweets from some of the most popular personalities on the social network musk also asked his followers if twitter should convert its san francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter prompting a discussion that saw participation from a wide range of industry figures including amazon and blue origin founder jeff bezos the weekend tweets from musk who identified his investment in twitter as passive and according to the timeline shared by agrawal had already decided to not join twitter s board however seemed to suggest that he is actively thinking about twitter and leading conversations about the major steps the firm should undertake we announced on tuesday that elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance elon s appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4 9 but elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board agrawal said in a tweet sunday night we have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our board or not elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to his input in what appears to be his official comment on the development musk offered a statement in a since deleted tweet an emoji whose popular interpretations include surprised shocked and yikes according to urban dictionary joining twitter s board would have required musk to cap his overall ownership of the social network at a maximum of 14 9 while he remained on the board and 90 days after the departure according to terms of the agreement twitter disclosed in the regulatory filing twitter said it planned to appoint musk to its board for a term that ends in 2024 i m really happy elon is joining the twitter board he cares deeply about our world and twitter s role in it jack dorsey co founder and former chief executive of twitter said on the news of musk joining the twitter board parag and elon both lead with their hearts and they will be an incredible team dorsey has yet to comment on the new development musk has purchased 9 2 of twitter stock according to a filing he made earlier this month twitter shares soared as much as 30 on the news of musk buying shares and another 10 when his appointment to the board was announced the following day the board and i had many discussions about elon joining the board and with elon directly agrawal said in a tweet sunday night we were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks we also believed that having elon as a fiduciary of the company where he like all board members has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders was the best path forward the twitter board previously believed it was for the best if elon joined now they believe it s for the best that he withdrew so it s the twitter board that changed their minds not elon is this why they mention the background check which would normally be a trivial detail françois chollet fchollet april 11 2022 twitter has 11 board members including dorsey agrawal salesforce co chief executive bret taylor and silver lake co chief executive egon durban musk did not say why he was investing in the company but the timing of the revelation followed him expressing concern about free speech and censorship on twitter analysts at bernstein however believed that musk s interest in twitter was mainly personal he joins 15 other billionaires in media ownership including bezos with wapo we view the interest as a potential distraction for musk and tsla shareholders given that musk is arguably already over committed and his fervor for the topic of censorship free speech is high they wrote in a note over the weekend musk also suggested that twitter should consider giving an authentication checkmark to anyone who subscribes to the company s 3 monthly subscription service twitter blue and no ads musk said outlining the features of twitter blue the power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if twitter depends on advertising money to survive some employees were concerned about musk getting involved with the company reports said to calm their concerns agrawal had reportedly announced internally that musk had agreed to a question and answer session with them

the smartest guys in the room were the last to know as usual starting with goldman which is still fighting it with elevated inflation the fed tightening cycle accelerating and the us yield curve inverting investors are increasingly worried about the risk of a recession while rising inflation and rates have pushed investors to higher strategic allocations to real assets including equities a recession could change that playbook materially on a tactical basis forecasting recessions is difficult while the yield curve has historically inverted ahead of recessions it has been less useful for timing them current high inflation might drive an earlier and deeper inversion looking at a broader range of market indicators including cyclicals vs defensives valuations credit spreads and fed funds pricing might help gauge future recession risk currently they send a mixed message with cyclicals vs defensives valuations and the yield curve more bearish and other indicators less so low inflation and gradual monetary policy tightening since the great moderation has resulted in cycles becoming longer and lower macro volatility in fact often imbalances in the economy that grew due to lack of macro volatility drove recession risk before then recessions were more frequent and often related to sharply higher rates and oil price shocks similar to now most recessions triggered or occurred around equity bear markets but not all of them some equity drawdowns were smaller broadly cross asset performance during recessions since ww2 has been mixed with poor returns in equities credit and cyclicals vs defensives the most consistent pattern in part this is as recessions differed materially in terms of macro and market conditions in particular in function of inflation timing bear markets is even more difficult than forecasting recessions often equities perform well into bear markets correct sharply early on and can recover quickly if macro conditions improve and timing the market competes with time in the market in many cases it was better to stay invested in the early stages of an equity drawdown and manage risks on the way down with more equity drawdown risk we look for safe assets to diversify portfolios better and option overlays to reduce portfolio risk in the coming months goldman is so long commodities that any recession will cause serious dyspepsia nuff said

beauty influencer is just one example of how meta s content policies and enforcement mechanisms have enabled pro russian propaganda during the ukraine invasion the moderators told reuters russian officialdom seized on the images setting them side by side against her glossy instagram photos in an effort to persuade viewers that the attack had been faked on state television and social media and in the chamber of the u n security council moscow alleged falsely that vishegirskaya had donned make up and multiple outfits in an elaborately staged hoax orchestrated by ukrainian forces swarms of comments accusing the influencer of duplicity and being an actress appeared underneath old instagram posts of her posed with tubes of makeup the moderators said at the height of the onslaught comments containing false allegations about the woman accounted for most of the material in one moderator s content queue which normally would have contained a mix of posts suspected of violating meta s myriad policies the person recalled the posts were vile and appeared to be orchestrated the moderator told reuters but many were within the company s rules the person said because they did not directly mention the attack i couldn t do anything about them the moderator said reuters was unable to contact vishegirskaya meta declined to comment on its handling of the activity involving vishegirskaya but said in a statement to reuters that multiple teams are addressing the issue we have separate expert teams and outside partners that review misinformation and inauthentic behavior and we have been applying our policies to counter that activity forcefully throughout the war the statement said meta policy chief nick clegg separately told reporters on wednesday that the company was considering new steps to address misinformation and hoaxes from russian government pages without elaborating russia s ministry of digital development communications and mass media and the kremlin did not respond to requests for comment representatives of ukraine did not respond to a request for comment spirit of the policy based at a moderation hub of several hundred people reviewing content from eastern europe the two contractors are foot soldiers in meta s battle to police content from the conflict they are among tens of thousands of low paid workers at outsourcing firms around the world that meta contracts to enforce its rules the tech giant has sought to position itself as a responsible steward of online speech during the invasion which russia calls a special operation to disarm and denazify its neighbor just a few days into the war meta imposed restrictions on russian state media and took down a small network of coordinated fake accounts that it said were trying to undermine trust in the ukrainian government it later said it had pulled down another russia based network that was falsely reporting people for violations like hate speech or bullying while beating back attempts by previously disabled networks to return to the platform meanwhile the company attempted to carve out space for users in the region to express their anger over russia s invasion and to issue calls to arms in ways meta normally would not permit in ukraine and 11 other countries across eastern europe and the caucasus it created a series of temporary spirit of the policy exemptions to its rules barring hate speech violent threats and more the changes were intended to honor the general principles of those policies rather than their literal wording according to meta instructions to moderators seen by reuters for example it permitted dehumanizing speech against russian soldiers and calls for death to russian president vladimir putin and his ally belarusian president alexander lukashenko unless those calls were considered credible or contained additional targets according to the instructions viewed by reuters the changes became a flashpoint for meta as it navigated pressures both inside the company and from moscow which opened a criminal case into the firm after a march 10 reuters report made the carve outs public russia also banned facebook and instagram inside its borders with a court accusing meta of extremist activity meta walked back elements of the exceptions after the reuters report it first limited them to ukraine alone and then canceled one altogether according to documents reviewed by reuters meta s public statements and interviews with two meta staffers the two moderators in europe and a third moderator who handles english language content in another region who had seen the advisories the documents offer a rare lens into how meta interprets its policies called community standards the company says its system is neutral and rule based critics say it is often reactive driven as much by business considerations and news cycles as by principle it s a complaint that has dogged meta in other global conflicts including myanmar syria and ethiopia social media researchers say the approach allows the company to escape accountability for how its policies affect the 3 6 billion users of its services the shifting guidance over ukraine has generated confusion and frustration for moderators who say they have 90 seconds on average to decide whether a given post violates policy as first reported by the new york times reuters independently confirmed such frustrations with three moderators after reuters reported the exemptions on march 10 meta policy chief nick clegg said in a statement the next day that meta would allow such speech only in ukraine two days later clegg told employees the company was reversing altogether the exemption that had allowed users to call for the deaths of putin and lukashenko according to a march 13 internal company post seen by reuters at the end of march the company extended the remaining ukraine only exemptions through april 30 the documents show reuters is the first to report this extension which allows ukrainians to continue engaging in certain types of violent and dehumanizing speech that normally would be off limits inside the company writing on an internal social platform some meta employees expressed frustration that facebook was allowing ukrainians to make statements that would have been deemed out of bounds for users posting about previous conflicts in the middle east and other parts of the world according to copies of the messages viewed by reuters seems this policy is saying hate speech and violence is ok if it is targeting the right people one employee wrote one of 900 comments on a post about the changes meanwhile meta gave moderators no guidance to enhance their ability to disable posts promoting false narratives about russia s invasion like denials that civilian deaths have occurred the people told reuters the company declined to comment on its guidance to moderators denying violent tragedies in theory meta did have a rule that should have enabled moderators to address the mobs of commenters directing baseless vitriol at vishegirskaya the pregnant beauty influencer she survived the mariupol hospital bombing and delivered her baby the associated press reported meta s harassment policy prohibits users from posting content about a violent tragedy or victims of violent tragedies that include claims that a violent tragedy did not occur according to the community standards published on its website it cited that rule when it removed posts by the russian embassy in london that had pushed false claims about the mariupol bombing following the march 9 attack but because the rule is narrowly defined two of the moderators said it could be used only sparingly to battle the online hate campaign against the beauty influencer that followed posts that explicitly alleged that the bombing was staged were eligible for removal but comments such as you re such a good actress were considered too vague and had to stay up even when the subtext was clear they said guidance from meta enabling commenters to consider context and enforce the spirit of that policy could have helped they added meta declined to comment on whether the rule applied to the comments on vishegirskaya s account at the same time even explicit posts proved elusive to meta s enforcement systems a week after the bombing versions of the russian embassy posts were still circulating on at least eight official russian accounts on facebook including its embassies in denmark mexico and japan according to an israeli watchdog organization fakereporter one showed a red fake label laid over the associated press photos of mariupol with text claiming the attack on vishegirskaya was a hoax and pointing readers to more than 500 comments from real users on her instagram account condemning her for participating in the alleged ruse meta removed those posts on march 16 hours after reuters asked the company about them a spokesperson confirmed meta declined to comment on why the posts had evaded its own detection systems the following day on march 17 meta designated vishegirskaya an involuntary public person which meant moderators could finally start deleting the comments under the company s bullying and harassment policy they told reuters but the change they said came too late the flow of posts related to the woman had already slowed to a trickle

credit winc the post wrestlemania 38 edition of wwe smackdown on fox opens up with a video package of highlights from wrestlemania 38 we re live from the fiserv forum in milwaukee wisconsin as michael cole welcomes us he s joined at ringside by pat mcafee we go right to the ring and kayla braxton is waiting with a mic she introduces ronda rousey and here she comes to a pop kayla says everyone can agree rousey was in a very physical match on wrestlemania saturday and she kept her word when she said she d make smackdown women s champion charlotte flair tap out we see video of flair tapping while the referee was down kayla says flair definitely felt the pressure rousey says she did make flair tap and she will again but what matters is she lost and she didn t come here to make excuses she mentions how the best needs to beat the one on top twice and she beat flair once not twice making her tap not when it counted and that s on her braxton asks what s next rousey says she wants a rematch but not a regular match she doesn t want flair to be able to get herself disqualified or counted out she challenges flair to an i quit match at wrestlemania backlash flair appears on the big screen laughing fans boo her flair says rousey couldn t beat her at checkers let alone an i quit match flair says quitting isn t in her dna but winning it flair goes on and says she s starting to think the baddest woman on the planet is a myth because rousey can t win flair says no to the challenge and tells rousey to get to the back of the line b h she laughs some more as rousey looks on rousey has some news for flair the match will happen and flair won t say she quits she ll scream it when rousey snaps her arm backwards rousey drops the mic and looks on as her music hits we see how sheamus and ridge holland defeated the new day at wrestlemania 38 and how butch was hard to control butch is set to wrestle his first smackdown match tonight we see butch sheamus and holland backstage getting riled up sheamus says tonight they will finally let butch loose xavier woods vs butch woods wins with a small package winner xavier woods after the match butch throws a temper tantrum and attacks sheamus and ridge before sitting on the top rope in the corner as he s berated by sheamus after the match woods quickly retreats to celebrate with kofi at ringside as butch seethes we go to replays as the music hits sheamus and holland try to hold butch back as he snaps slapping them both and then punching holland sheamus and holland yell at butch and back him into the corner finally calming him down still to come a look at sami zayn s wrestlemania 38 loss back to commercial back from the break and we see stills from wrestlemania 38 still to come roman reigns is here to reveal what s next on the island of relevancy cole and mcafee send us to the doordash highlight of the night which shows sami zayn s anything goes loss to johnny knoxville at wrestlemania 38 zayn is backstage ranting to adam pearce now asking how he let that happen to him zayn was supposed to get his revenge on knoxville but instead had to deal with party boy and wee man and a giant hand zayn goes on and says he s been reduced to a laughing stock now zayn wants his respect back zayn says the next person who walks through the door he wants them in the ring pearce agrees the door opens and it s drew mcintyre he stops and acknowledges them then walks off zayn tells pearce he wants the next person but pearce says no the match with mcintyre is official for tonight zayn says that s perfect because drew is one of the toughest on the roster and when he beats drew he will get his respect back a wwe crew member bring a letter to pearce and he reads it apparently ronda rousey wants to meet with pearce but pearce tells the crew member to tell rousey he s unable to see her right now gunther vs joe alonzo gunther man handles joe in the corner joe tries to fight back but he just angers gunther gunther with a big chop he puts a boot to joe s mouth in the corner then levels him with a big boot to the face in the middle of the ring gunther takes his time with alonzo delivering big chops as kaiser looks on gunther keeps control and stops to yell out at the crowd fans apparently chant walter while cole and mcafee say they are chanting gunther instead gunther goes on and dominates alonzo finishing him off with the powerbomb in the middle of the ring winner gunther after the match gunther stands tall as the music hits we go to replays gunther and kaiser look on from the ring to end the segment kayla braxton is backstage with raquel rodriguez the former raquel gonzalez of nxt gonzalez says smackdown has one of the most impressive female locker rooms in all of wwe but she guarantees they ve never seen anything like her los lotharios interrupt and introduce themselves angel and humberto they welcome her to smackdown and she thanks them they want to give her the double kiss on each cheek but she tells them not a chance they say it s her loss then they walk off rodriguez asks kayla if los lotharios are always this annoying we get a look at how madcap moss won the andre the giant memorial battle royal at wrestlemania smackdown last week and how happy baron corbin took a loss to drew mcintyre at wrestlemania 38 they will host happy talk next back to commercial back from the break and the ring is set up for a must see edition of happy talk madcap moss and happy baron corbin have the mic corbin says this was supposed to be the happiest happy talk with a celebration for his win over drew mcintyre but that didn t happen he s done a lot of self reflecting on his yacht this week thinking about what kind of man he is and has become corbin goes on and says there s only one man to blame for the loss moss corbin says never in a million years would he have lost to drew if it weren t for moss getting on the apron moss says he s sorry he just felt so excited for corbin corbin says it wasn t about moss feelings but somehow he managed to take wrestlemania weekend and make it about himself about him winning the andre the giant memorial battle royal corbin mocks moss but fans chant for him corbin says moss is getting too big for his suspenders and he thinks moss has forgotten that his place is to tell corbin jokes corbin tells moss to tell him jokes and he tells two but corbin says they suck corbin says he brought moss to smackdown to tell jokes but lately they have not been good he gives moss one more chance and tells him to tell a good joke like his job depends on it because it does this time moss starts taking shots at corbin with the joke he laughs and fans pop corbin isn t laughing and he asks the crowd why they think it s funny corbin drops moss from behind and stomps away moss fights back to a pop corbin gets tossed around stumbling over the happy talk set moss unloads and sends corbin to the floor retreating moss comes out and follows but corbin knees him then launches him into the barrier corbin taunts moss with the andre battle royal statue and goes to slam him face first into the announce table but moss counters and slams corbin s face over and over into the table as fans cheer him on moss brings it back into the ring for more punches then a clothesline to the floor moss music hits as he tosses some of the set out and stomps on corbin s hat corbin seethes on the ramp with his back turned to the ring jinder mahal is backstage with shanky and he s yelling at adam pearce about not getting a wwe intercontinental title shot pearce says it s nothing personal jinder tells pearce to bring ricochet out of witness protection and get him in the ring pearce is explaining himself when ronda rousey walks in a scared jinder leaves rousey asks pearce if she has her i quit match at wrestlemania backlash pearce says it s not official yet but it should be tomorrow rousey doesn t like that answer but she ll take it for now still to come sasha banks vs liv morgan drew mcintyre vs sami zayn zayn escapes through the crowd and mcintyre retains by countout winner by countout drew mcintyre after the match drew looks on from the corner as the music hits and he s announced the winner drew poses with angela and points it up at sami who is looking on from the crowd stairs still to come we will see what happened with pat mcafee at wrestlemania 38 back to commercial back from the break and we see a wrestlemania 38 video package on pat mcafee austin theory wwe chairman ceo vince mcmahon and wwe hall of famer steve austin cole sends us to a new vignette what he calls the first chapter in the story of lacey evans we go to a pre recorded promo from evans who has been away since announcing her second pregnancy in february of last year evans talks about coming from a small town in georgia her father worked construction her mom was a young mother of five kids her life beginning was rough because her father had mental health issues and addiction issues with drugs and alcohol her mom was caught in the middle of it trying to be the best mom she could be then the physical emotional and mental abuse got to be too much and before she could start elementary school evans was taken away from everything she knew she says her mother loaded their belongings up in black trash bags threw them in a car and picked the kids all up from school then left without their dad knowing evans goes on and says they drove from state to state staying in women s shelters and at campgrounds for the rest of her life she says moving around as much as she had to do made her learn that she could either adapt and overcome accept the way things were and learn to roll with it or completely give up and she refuses to give up evans says she may not have the same straight shot to stardom that others in wwe have been blessed with but that s ok because it makes her different than all the rest she says what she s had to go through has made her into the woman she is today motivated ready for anything confident mother wife sister daughter u s marine and a wwe superstar evans says this doesn t make her better than any other wwe superstar but they damn sure ain t better than her liv morgan vs sasha banks banks hits a top rope superplex but morgan quickly cradles her for the win winner liv morgan banks and liv slowly recover now banks blocks a shot but liv blocks the backstabber liv with two big kicks to the head to send banks down on one knee banks dodges liv in the corner and then hits running double knees liv follows banks and hits a high knee in the opposite corner banks takes liv to the top and knees her banks with a superplex from the second rope but liv hooks the leg on the come back and holds her down for the pin to win winner liv morgan after the match the music hits as liv stands tall and heads to the floor to celebrate with fans at ringside naomi says that win means nothing liv makes her exit as banks and naomi look on the announcers talk about rick boogs suffering an injury we see his instagram post and mcafee says he can t wait to see boogs back on smackdown we go back to the ring and out comes the bloodline new undisputed wwe universal champion roman reigns smackdown tag team champions the usos and paul heyman they stop and pose raising the gold in the air to a pop and pyro cole shows us footage from the wrestlemania 38 main event when reigns defeated brock lesnar the bloodline goes on to the ring as we go back to commercial back from the break and announced for next week is drew mcintyre vs sami zayn plus jinder mahal vs wwe intercontinental champion ricochet the bloodline is in the ring now reigns finally speaks and calls on milwaukee to acknowledge him reigns wants to let everyone in on something private something he and his wise man discuss rather frequently reigns says it pains him to say that smackdown and the wwe universal title wasn t enough so he went to wrestlemania smashed cowboy brock took monday night raw and took the wwe title fans pop for reigns reigns brings up the next step for the tribal chief he doesn t think he can really do much more he s done did it all you know but there s plenty left for the bloodline to achieve reigns says there was so many historical pictures and videos taken of them this week and he couldn t but think that he saw his two titles but he only saw his cousins with their one title each reigns says that s not enough he recalls how he told jey uso a while ago that they d elevate him to new levels of greatness and there s only one way to do that reigns says it s time to unify the tag team titles reigns wants the usos to go to raw and bring him the raw tag team titles get them for yourselves because when you do that you do it for the bloodline reigns asks if that s a deal and the usos are fired up reigns says there you have it the bloodline will have all the gold soon the music interrupts and out comes shinsuke nakamura to a pop reigns and the usos look annoyed as nakamura struts to the ring fans sing nakamura s theme after it stops reigns says nakamura doesn t have to say anything reigns understands how he feels because he lost his partner you know the guy rick boogs says the crowd reigns says they lost jimmy uso to an injury for a year so they know how nakamura feels reigns is a compassionate tribal chief and now that they have all the gold the island of relevancy is full of love reigns wants to help nakamura he hugs nakamura in the middle of the ring and whispers something

the most important factor to pay attention to here is that this is despite seeing overall strength in the dollar index this week because of the ultra hawkish stance by the us federal reserve the fed

march the rate setting body raised interest for the first time since 2018 the minutes of that meeting released earlier this week showed that most officials had agreed that one or more 50 basis point

hikes futures markets have now priced in could be enough for now it is the fed s battle to lose not win added halley the fomc also said it will soon scale back its 9 trillion balance sheet sending out

lowered its main interest rate to 17 00 today following its massive emergency rate hike to 20 at the end of february following the invasion of ukraine the decision came as a surprise as no official meeting had been scheduled until late april there is a steady inflow of funds to fixed term deposits the cbr said and recent economic data point to a noticeable slowdown in current price growth rates the cbr seems confident that the most acute phase of the economic crisis has now passed said liam peach at capital economics further interest rate cuts are likely over the course of this year but it is likely to be a gradual process as the central bank attempts to bring inflation back to target with the press statement pointing to the inflow of funds to fixed term deposits this suggests that the cbr has become confident that it its emergency rate hike at the end of february alongside capital controls and other measures prevented a major and destabilising bank run on the data pointing to slowing price growth he said although figures due later today are likely to show that consumer prices rose by around 8 m m in march price growth measured in w w terms slowed sharply towards the end of the month and inflation may have slowed to 2 3 m m in april owing at least in part to the appreciation of the ruble in recent weeks 9 57am financial leaders financial stocks are leading the way for

rise in permanent salaries came amid a persisting imbalance of labour supply and demand with vacancies up for the fourteenth consecutive month in march and at the quickest rate since september the survey implied a softer pace of hiring in march with the index reflecting permanent places edging down to its softest in a year while the respective index for temporary billings stood at an eleven month low but still remained at a historically high level the report made for familiar reading with the ongoing demand supply imbalance for labour continuing to add upwards pressures on wages said

three friends born and raised in adams massachusetts began building their future one tiny house at a time and are now operating in their own hometown one of the largest micro manufacturing businesses in the country adams mass b b micro manufacturing owners jason koperniak christopher st cyr and mitchell bresett grew up attending school together from preschool and through graduation from hoosac valley high school the three also worked for bresett s father gaining experience in home building before koperniak and st cyr decided to step onto different career paths chris and i studied finance in college and i worked at the new york and chicago stock exchanges while mitch stayed in the trades koperniak says soon enough a contact at the nyse provided the three friends with an opportunity to build for one of their first clients with mitch beginning the building process we learned a lot from that project and then took the time to accumulate more knowledge and become professionals in the tiny house space starting with a team of five people now we re at fifty the tiny house movement started in the 1970s but took off in the early 2000 s when building companies and diyers were creating all types of models for small affordable homes both on or off wheels and including the basic necessities a functioning bathroom kitchen sleeping area and storage as well as individual customizations driving the movement is a push toward a simpler lifestyle where physical objects are no longer equated with happiness advocates have a desire to live sustainably and interactively with nature perhaps influenced by henry david thoreau s famous cabin on walden pond in concord mass for their part koperniak st cyr and bresett wanted to bring this idea of simpler living to the berkshires only on a larger scale we firmly believe in the mission and the product lines even if we all live in regular sized homes koperniak admits laughing for us b b is an opportunity where we can help the customer be more minimalist with our tiny homes we provide people the opportunity to have less clutter and attain a clearer mind we promote the idea that you should keep your life as simple as possible in 2015 b b micro manufacturing opened its doors for business in the former berkshire gas building off curran highway in adams where they quickly realized the difficulty in creating a 13 foot high product with a 12 foot high door in what was essentially a three car garage having outgrown that initial space they relocated to the windsor mill in north adams for a couple of years before again sizing up and purchasing the old brown packaging building and returning to adams so far we ve already grown into this location as well koperniak says we re making the most out of what we have their current space is approximately 20 000 square feet allowing the business to have about ten houses in production at any given time b b has a unique business to business model and its name reflects that approach by focusing on the mass production of three to six tiny house models for other companies they can produce efficiently from frame to finish approximately 1 75 homes a day so rather than serving individual clients b b s model maximizes production time and has consistently resulted in lower customer acquisition costs and higher revenues because there are so many ways to design a tiny home designing for a specific customer can be trickier than sticking to a standard model instead b b works with larger companies whether it s a hospitality company that uses the product as a short term rental or through its restroom trailer business selling to marinas and campgrounds primarily our customers buy multiples of a specific product line and that efficiency of scale has made our lives a bit easier because we can produce the same thing over and over for the same people koperniak explains in the beginning we just wanted to build so we took all kinds of projects to learn and increase revenues but we concluded that this model is the best for us whether it s our style of management or the labor force that we have it s been incredibly successful even so b b does continue to offer customizable one off productions but they re already booked solid until the summer of 2023 operationally speaking tiny home construction is essentially the same as average home building for b b one of the advantages of building on a smaller scale is that it can be done indoors eliminating the weather constraints that prevail in outdoor construction we essentially build tiny house recreational vehicles inside a climate controlled warehouse koperniak says whether it s rain or shine cold or hot we have a consistent workplace environment unlike a typical home builder on the other hand some challenges in manufacturing tiny homes come from another part of what makes them unique they re mobile according to koperniak 95 percent of b b s products are built on trailers and have to be built to be easily transported the idea of things in motion the different acclimation of wood to different climates there s a lot that goes into making a vehicle that s going to be traveling to different places supporting the local economy b b micro manufacturing currently has around 50 employees almost all from adams cheshire north adams or southern vermont we have a great team it s been a pretty good labor pool in the berkshires especially since we know a lot of people from growing up here koperniak says we get quality tradespeople from northern berkshire county who don t want to travel all over to build homes besides providing employment to the local population b b does its best to source materials locally as well we do a lot of business with ribco out of clarksburg and source lumber from just over the border in vermont koperniak says this practice proved to be a major advantage during the pandemic where supply chain issues and shipment delays were plaguing home builders across the country we ve been blessed to have navigated the situation pretty well we have relationships with vendors who fought to get us our trailers windows and doors and other materials in a timely manner i think that being in a smaller town allowed us to get really great treatment during this difficult time not that the pandemic was smooth sailing b b had to close shop for two full months before regulations were lifted and it could reopen by then however things had shifted in the business s favor as lots of people decided to embrace the tiny house philosophy during 2020 nearly doubling b b s demand for production while koperniak says that most home builders experienced a similar panic to boom he sees it as a particular silver lining for b b whether the influence was more recreational camping moving from an urban to a rural area or simply a change in perspective and mindset we ve benefited greatly when it comes to implementing additional sustainable efforts into the building process koperniak says the clients call the shots it depends on the customers and how much they want to spend within the area of sustainability including solar panels and unique building materials like wool versus fiberglass insulation they all have the costs and benefits and efficiencies as far as passing the necessary tests and ratings but we do push consciously low chemical options solar panels and off beat materials aside b b has received some memorable requests for a custom build shortly after i left the nyse we built a tiny house for resideo a smart home technology firm putting it right outside the exchange building i think that was one of the cooler moments for us koperniak exclaims the finished showcase product featured the latest in smart home technology including remote lock changing a collapsible panoramic door and electrical features such as lights and outlets that talk to each other that was such an awesome build doing what they love and continuing to enjoy each day building koperniak st cyr and bresett have made waves in the micro manufacturing industry finding our current space was a blessing it brought us all back to our hometown and really made the business what it is

the lone ranger the sole survivor of an ambushed company of texas rangers he was nursed back to health by his steady indian companion tonto and together they fight crime and injustice the lone ranger embodies every myth of early twentieth century american morals and has delighted children and adults alike since the 1930 s but who was that masked man is the modern myth based upon some older more truthful legend no sorry it s all made up the lone ranger was created by detroit radio station owner george washington trendle and scriptwriter fran striker and first aired on wxyz and seven other michigan affiliates on january 30 1933 the radio show proved so popular that it was turned into a television show that had its debut on the fifteenth of september 1949 it was the first western produced for television hopalong cassidy had been the first western on the air but the telecast images were all old stock film footage the show lasted for 221 episodes and ran until 1957 running concurrently with the radio program until its demise in 1954 if you mention the lone ranger to any baby boomer they ll undoubtedly think of clayton moore moore was only one of many actors who portrayed the epitome white hat but he played the character the longest when the show was cancelled in 1957 moore continued playing the lone ranger at public appearances often visiting children in the hospital the wrather corporation bought the rights to the lone ranger from mr trendle in 1954 for 3 million dollars by the late seventies the wrather corporation was trying to get a lone ranger movie off the ground and asked moore to stop wearing the mask in public they had a younger man in mind for the role and didn t want his presence interfering moore refused and in 1979 the wrather corporation obtained a court order restraining moore from wearing the mask in response moore took to wearing sunglasses in the shape of the mask and begun an active public campaign to reverse the court order by appearing on numerous talk shows and news programs the wrather corporation released the legend of the lone ranger in 1981 it bombed badly losing more than 11 million dollars the actor contracted to portray the lone ranger was klinton spilsbury whose voice was pitched so high that the studio had all of his dialogue dubbed over badly after finally coming to grips with their loss the wrather corporation relented and in 1984 allowed moore to don the mask once again
christine short vp research at wall street horizon christine short what a first quarter it was the s p 500 notched a lone all time high on the first trading day of the year then pulled back significantly easily into correction territory the global aggregate bond market suffered one of its worst quarterly losses ever as interest rates vaulted and credit spreads widened a risk on appetite during the back half of march helped cushion the blow to investors though there appears to be some optimism on the geopolitical front and inflationary fears might be in the process of peaking amazon alphabet tesla gamestop oh my we spotted more hopeful news stock splits are on the rise people are talking about it too high profile companies like amazon amzn and alphabet googl recently announced 20 for 1 stock splits on march 28 tesla tsla too indicated it might split its shares again not to be outdone gamestop gme tossed its hat into the ring via a stock split announcement of the dividend variety gme plans to increase its share count from 300 million to 1 billion an important cue from financial execs stock splits are often used as a signaling mechanism by a firm s management team it s thought that by splitting shares whereby the stock price drops and the share count rises a company tells the investing public that they believe their stock will soon rise back to the pre split price splits can also improve liquidity by allowing smaller traders access to buy and sell although the rise of fractional share trading has likely reduced that impact traditional splits on the relative rise wall street horizon data shows that traditional stock splits have overtaken reverse stock splits in popularity we began tracking split events in 2006 in recent years reverse splits outnumbered those of the traditional variety a reverse split happens when a company seeks to increase its share price to a more attractive range a stock price too low might be a sign of a low quality high risk stock and it could also lead to de listing from an exchange across our coverage universe which now spans more than 9 500 companies worldwide reverse splits were more popular each quarter from 2016 through 2020 chart 1 traditional splits surged compared to reverse splits in 2021 source wall street horizon data 2016 2022 technology related stocks warm the stock split waters last year was the first to feature a mini boom in splits the trend change came after apple aapl and tesla tsla got the party going in the summer of 2020 apple announced a 4 for 1 split that july and tesla followed suit with a 5 for 1 split the following month the next year on may 21 2021 nvidia climbed aboard the split train perhaps those were the first big name companies to jump in the pool fast forward to today and more firms are taking the corporate action the prestige of having a share price above 1 000 may have lost its luster since so many stocks rose to that level after a huge rally in the last two years another plausible reason for the slew of recent splits is lower liquidity and less retail participation in markets versus early 2021 recall the popularity of meme stocks and options trading a year ago it s not surprising that that tech media consumer space features so many splitters that sector has performed very well over the last decade but optimism is not confirmed to the tmt area which includes the technology sector and media related firms wall street horizon data show that other sectors are participating recent splitters csx corp csx is considered a bellwether company in the industrials sector the dow jones transportation index is a key barometer of the domestic economy s health csx is the third largest stockin the transports index behind only union pacific and ups after

from 2015 through the 2021 highs after announcing a 3 for 1 split on august 5 2021 the stock saw an initial rally through early september but it then hit the skids isrg was caught up in the growth stock selloff last november it fell about 30 over the ensuing months but rebounded recently to a fresh two month high it goes to show that splits are no sure thing for traders and other corporate events and macro factors should be weighed when managing risk chart 3 isrg stock price history august 5 2021 march 30 2022 our final pit stop on the stock split road brings us to toyota motor corporation jp 7203 us tm japan s largest automaker announced a 5 for 1 split on may 12 2021 shares indeed rallied on the news the nikkei listed stock rose from 1 700 to above 2 000 in short order the stock managed to hit an all time high in january before the broad market selloff took it lower still that corporate optimism signaled last may appears to have been a true harbinger as toyota s value has increased strongly off the march 2022 lows chart 4 toyota stock price history may 12 2021 march 30 2022 returns and what to watch for it s common knowledge on wall street that stock splitters often exhibit solid performance research from bank of america shows that there is a large abnormal positive return trend among firms that perform a traditional split using data going back to 1980 more recently however performance is mixed schaeffer s investment research found that since 2010 returns are nothing to write home about the bottom line here is that investors should still tread cautiously when it comes to splits conclusion stock splits might finally be back in fashion after a decade of low activity reverse splits were more common before the post covid bull market but traditional splits have caught back up splits are one of many pieces of corporate body language that traders should pay close attention to as earnings season begins later this month investors could consider eyeing potential stocks that might announce stock splits such as those with share values north of 500 after the moves from alphabet and amazon earlier this year and what appears to be a split from tesla too managers of other companies might feel compelled to take similar action to buoy investor sentiment which has dropped hard this year
