a defiant max verstappen has rejected suggestions from lewis hamilton that he may be feeling the pressure of their title fight and said it showed that the defending champion simply did not know him the red bull driver who leads the championship by five points but has a three place grid penalty for this weekend s russian grand prix added that he had put his italian crash behind him and would continue to race as hard as ever yeah i m so nervous i can barely sleep said the dutchman with heavy sarcasm i mean it s so horrible to fight for a title i really hate it those comments it just shows you that he really doesn t know me which is fine i also don t need to know him how he is i m very relaxed about all those things and i really can t be bothered i m very chilled seven time champion hamilton 36 had earlier recalled his own first championship fighting season in 2007 when he was also 23 and said he had succumbed to the pressures but a bullish verstappen 24 next week who was apportioned most blame for the pair s dramatic monza collision maintained that he was not feeling any strain this year after winning seven races to hamilton s four for mercedes advertisement it s the best feeling ever to have a car a great car where you go into every weekend and you can fight for a win he told reporters it doesn t matter if you re just leading a championship or not he added that he was not dwelling on their crash at monza and would not be looking back we are professional enough just to handle the situation at the time i think we are both upset with what happened but it s also important to move on you can t always look back because if you have to do that with every single moment in your life not only formula one then i think you will be a very sore person you should be able to forget stuff forgive stuff in general in life otherwise i don t think you will live a very happy life that s also what you do in racing and we just move on and try to again have a good fight here in sochi a feisty verstappen also attacked his critics who accused him of walking away from the scene of the monza crash without checking that hamilton was unhurt he said he could see that hamilton was trying to reverse his car out from underneath the dutchman s red bull indicating that he was fine there are a lot of hypocrites in the world that s for sure he said i jumped out of the car and looked to the left and he was still trying to reverse shaking the wheel trying to get away from under my car he added that by flying to attend the met gala in new york on the following day hamilton demonstrated he was not hurt you only do that if you feel fine said verstappen hamilton is seeking an unprecedented 100th f1 victory on sunday to regain the lead in the title race afp 2021 bernard jackman murray kinsella and gavan casey look ahead to the inaugural united rugby championship and a massive weekend for ireland in their bid to qualify for the women s rugby world cup the42 rugby weekly soundcloud
the pandemic is leaving its imprint on all of us but some experts suggest it may be most keenly affecting babies and toddlers a new study by researchers at five universities found that babies born during the pandemic may have lower iq scores than those born before it babies who came into the world before the coronavirus had a cognitive score hovering around 100 according to this study but the test scores of babies born during the pandemic fell sharply to around 78 that s 22 points lower than what s considered normal it was shocking said lead study author sean deoni associate professor of pediatrics research at brown university the drop from a mean of 100 to a mean of 78 is large when you think of breastfeeding for example we re usually talking about 5 points difference we expect most children to be between 85 115 with only 16 percent being less than 85 almost all of our kiddos born since the pandemic are now at that lower level the first 1 000 days of a child s life are often referred to as the brain s window of opportunity experts say a time of great potential but also great vulnerability the most explosive growth comes first with the brain doubling in the first year researchers are concerned that less parental stimulation coupled with a lack of engagement with other children may be partly to blame this decreased interaction may inhibit the growth of neural connections that drive child development however they are hopeful that the cognitive decline may be reversible if the stimulation increases it should be noted that impact of the covid 19 pandemic on early child cognitive development is a preprint study that has not yet been peer reviewed some observers have noted the imprecision of reactions elicited by masked researchers interacting with babies but given the critical nature of early childhood development and the chronic nature of the pandemic experts say the data remains well worth examining effects becoming visible there is already abundant evidence that the pandemic has impacted children on a variety of fronts ranging from literacy lags and mental health issues to deepening poverty all of which can profoundly influence their education in this study researchers from rhode island hospital and brown university compared childhood cognitive scores from 2020 and 2021 with those from the decade before roughly 2011 2019 they examined about 700 healthy children aged between 3 months to 3 years using a system called the mullen scales of early learning which evaluates the cognitive and motor development of babies and converts that score into iq numbers children were assessed on key metrics such as fine and gross motor control visual reception and language babies were evaluated on developmentally appropriate benchmarks like babbling crawling and rolling over while keenly aware of the upheavals of the pandemic the researchers said they were nonetheless surprised to find such a steep decline in cognitive ability they had assumed that babies would be more insulated from disruptions than school age children for example though there has been a lot of talk and speculation by child health and development experts over the past 18 months or so on the effect lockdowns and such would have on kiddos said deoni a father of two people thought it would be primarily limited to school age children and really due to lack of schooling whereas we seem to be saying even the youngest might be impacted while the underlying causes of the lower cognitive scores are still unknown experts suggest that the pressures of the covid era may be having a profound impact on babies their development and the very architecture of the brain just as a weak foundation might undermine the strength of a house experts say adverse experiences early in life can damage the pillars of the brain every experience positive or negative major or minor impacts how we see the world and how we develop said heidi m feldman professor of pediatrics at stanford school of medicine who was not involved in the rhode island study when we are young and have accumulated relatively few experiences each one has a big impact on our thinking and feeling pandemic stress takes a toll even in families where no one contracted covid researchers found the turmoil of the pandemic may have negatively affected child development particularly during those vital first 1 000 days of life in that sense the pandemic might have an outsize impact on infants the brain s adaptive plasticity the study says is a double edged sword while positive and enriching environments can promote healthy brain development neglect insecurity stress and lack of stimulation can impair maturing brain systems and disrupt cognitive and behavioral outcomes among the environmental factors that may have played a role are a decrease of stimulation from parents a lack of engagement with other children and increased exposure to tv and computers researchers say these reduced social interactions may be the culprit experts say infants may be learning the wrong lessons just as the foundation of their brain is being laid in this pandemic the parents are present at home but they are unavailable to their children because of remote work said feldman if they cry or flirt or laugh their parents may not respond as they had expected that is so confusing to children deoni doesn t want to point fingers at parents admitting that he too has struggled to juggle work and parenting during the pandemic but he suspects that diminished parental attention is key in this pandemic the parents are present at home but they are unavailable to their children because of remote work if they cry or flirt or laugh their parents may not respond as they had expected that is so confusing to children heidi m feldman professor of pediatrics at stanford school of medicine parents are stressed and frazzled and that interaction the child would normally get has decreased substantially deoni said i think we ve all suffered particularly those who are balancing multiple jobs and child care in trying to find playtime or reading time but it s so important trauma can shape the way a person looks at the world long after a crisis has passed experts say and that influence may be heightened with babies who are like radar dishes for the emotional states of their parents and caregivers toxic stress can derail child behavior and brain development especially for infants and toddlers whose brains are extra sensitive and disproportionately receptive to input said rahil briggs national director of healthysteps a pediatric care program infant brains are like recording devices and they pick it all up the good and the not so good babies are social animals who crave stimulation while parents often spend endless hours cuddling and cooing at their newborns the heightened trauma of the pandemic from fear of disease to economic hardship may have detracted from that quality bonding time a sense of serenity and emotional stability has been in short supply since the virus upended society researchers suggest infants are inherently competent in their ability to initiate relationships explore seek meaning and learn says the study but are vulnerable and depend entirely on caregivers for their survival emotional security modeling of behaviors and the nature and rules of the physical and socio cultural world that they inhabit families fear for mental health the trouble is that babies may not be getting enough of the crucial serve and return interactions that help shape brain architecture experts say when an infant babbles gestures or cries and an attentive adult responds with words or touch neural connections are built and reinforced in the child s brain this back and forth exchange helps build foundational neural connections that drive child development while parents are generally hard wired to put their children first the pandemic has strained many families almost 3 out of 4 california parents with children age 5 and under fear their development will suffer because of the pandemic one survey found while 70 percent of parents also worry about their family s mental health those with babies and toddlers may be hurting the most due to younger children s need for intensive caregiving briggs said moms dads and other caregivers are being asked to hold their fingers in the dam and it s threatening to burst this additional stress on adults impacts their capacity to be attentive and engaged caregivers the long and grueling nature of the pandemic also means that even caregivers with considerable resilience might be showing signs of fraying at this point school closures breakthrough infections and vaccine resistant variants add to the malaise parents are becoming worn down many adults have lost friends or family to covid they are grieving feldman said our coping resources are getting used up and are not being moderated by frequent warm and nurturing social interactions this situation leaves people raw and unprotected to the relentlessness of their plight poverty is also one of the aggravating factors here as with so many issues during the pandemic low income children fared the worst in this study that s alarming because nearly 1 in 5 babies in america live in poverty according to a new report from zero to three a national nonprofit organization babies need stability to thrive but for families living in poverty food clothing and housing are often hard to come by despite the significant obstacles the researchers remain hopeful that the data will motivate parents and other caregivers to rise to the challenge of infant and toddler engagement providing ample opportunities for play exercise and social interaction is more important than ever experts say cognitive decline may be temporary one bright spot may be that because young children are so deeply influenced by stimuli experts say they may be able to rebound quickly from adversity the hope is that if we can increase the amount of intellectual and physical stimulation they get from bedtime stories to playground visits we can boost their brain growth any cognitive decline may be temporary i would certainly hope that the gap in cognitive abilities can be remedied and that it doesn t have long lasting impacts deoni said the kiddos in our study are still 1 to 1 5 years of age so there s quite a bit of time through toddlerhood and childhood left to develop but that doesn t mean we should sit back and do nothing as society takes stock of the impact of the pandemic the researchers are hoping their results will shape the scope of help children get we can t be cavalier about this deoni said what this means is that we really have to redouble our efforts at ensuring kiddos are able to get out and play as well as spend time with their parents briggs for one believes one of the best ways to help children may be to help their parents she hopes to raise awareness that stress management is more a necessity than a luxury as the public health crisis drags on overburdened caregivers she fears may not have the patience for enough of those crucial serve and return exchanges babies interactions with their closest caregivers are so foundational to lifelong learning health and well being she said when asked what to do for young children during covid the answer is always to focus on parental well being and self care if there was another way to ensure young children s well being without focusing on their parents behavior i d definitely shout it from the rooftops because parents have enough on their plates right now this story originally appeared in edsource

the white house and congressional democrats have agreed to a framework of options to pay for their huge emerging social and environment bill top democrats said thursday now they face the daunting task of narrowing the menu to tax possibilities they can pass to fund president joe biden s 3 5 trillion plan senate majority leader chuck schumer of new york and house speaker nancy pelosi of california announced the progress as biden administration officials and democratic congressional leaders negotiated behind the scenes the package aims to rewrite tax and spending priorities to expand programs for americans of all ages while upping efforts to tackle income inequality and fight climate change staring down a self imposed monday deadline lawmakers said they would work nonstop to find agreement on specifics democrats views on those vary widely though they largely agree with biden s idea of raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy to fund the package we certainly think it s progress biden press secretary jen pskai said at the white house we re making it easier for you to find stories that matter with our new newsletter the 4front sign up here and get news that is important for you to your inbox biden has been putting his shoulder into the negotiations inviting more than 20 of his party s moderate and progressive lawmakers to the white house for lengthy meetings this week he s working to close the deal with congress on his build back better agenda at a time when his presidential campaign promises are running into the difficulty of actually governing but the party has been divided over many of the details moderate democrats most prominently sens joe manchin of west virginia and kyrsten sinema of arizona are demanding that the massive dollar total be reduced the revenue options to pay for it that mostly means taxes being considered can be dialed up or down the leaders say the ultimate price tag may certainly slip from the much publicized 3 5 trillion republicans are solidly opposed to the package calling it a reckless tax and spending spree so democrats will have to push it it through congress on their own which is only possible if they limit their defections to a slim few in the house and none in the senate we re proceeding pelosi said we intend to stay the course and pass the bill as soon as possible the congressional leaders huddled early thursday with the chairmen of the tax writing committees to agree to the framework pulling from work already being done on those panels they are intent on sticking to biden s pledge not to raise taxes on people making less than 400 000 a year rep richard neal d mass the chairman of the house ways means committee has already drafted his version which would raise about 2 3 trillion by hiking corporate tax rates to 26 5 for businesses earning more than 5 million a year and increasing the top individual tax from 37 to 39 6 for those earning more than 400 000 or 450 000 for married households the house panel s bill also includes a 3 surtax on the adjusted incomes of very wealthy people making more than 5 million a year the senate finance committee under sen ron wyden has not yet passed its bill but has been eyeing proposals that further target the superrich including efforts to curtail practices used to avoid paying taxes i m not going to get into any specific stuff today but i ve made it very clear as chairman of the finance committee a billionaire s tax will be on the menu wyden said those tax goals align with the biden administration which is marshaling arguments that the increases are fundamentally about fairness at a time of gaping income inequality according to a new analysis released thursday by the white house the wealthiest 400 families worth more than a billion dollars paid an average tax rate of just 8 2 between 2010 and 2018 treasury department tables show that is lower than the average tax rate of families with an income of roughly 142 000 the analysis suggests two clear reasons why billionaires pay a lower rate than the upper middle class they derive income from stocks dividends and other assets that are taxed at lower rates and they can permanently avoid paying tax on certain investment gains that by law are excluded from taxable income without divulging a framework wyden indicated he is in agreement with the house s plans for certain retirement savings accounts used by the wealthy to shield liabilities targeting mega iras democrats hope to correct what they see as a flaw in the retirement savings system enabling billionaires to amass millions in independent retirement accounts without ever paying taxes under some proposals individuals earning beyond 400 000 would be barred from contributing to their iras once their account balances top 10 million the biden administration has also shown interest in one climate change tax a so called pollution importer fee which would essentially impose a tariff on goods coming from countries without certain emissions controls and seen as a way to pressure china gaining less traction seems to be a carbon tax that could fall on households and stray from biden s pledge not to tax those earning less than 400 000 another big unknown whether democrats can coalesce around a plan to rein in prescription drug costs which could save the government hundreds of billions that could be used for biden s goals thursday s sudden announcement of framework options caught key lawmakers off guard including sen bernie sanders i vt the chairman of the budget committee and others playing leading roles in assembling one of the biggest bills congress has ever attempted schumer later acknowledged about the emerging framework it s hardly conclusory but it was a good step of progress yet the framework could help the congressional leaders show momentum as they head toward crucial deadlines and start to address concerns raised by manchin and other moderates who want a more clear cut view of what taxes are being considered before they move forward aides said on monday the house plans to begin considering a separate 1 trillion package of road and other infrastructure projects as a first test of biden s agenda that public works bill has already passed the senate and pelosi has agreed to schedule it for a house vote to assuage party moderates who badly want that legislation passed but are leery of supporting the larger 3 5 trillion measure but progressives are threatening to defeat the public works bill as inadequate unless it is partnered with the broader package to make sure both bills can pass democratic leaders are trying to reach agreement on the bigger bill meanwhile the house and senate remain at a standstill over a separate package to keep the government funded past the sept 30 fiscal year end and to suspend the federal debt limit to avert a shutdown and a devastating u s default on payments senate republicans are refusing to back that house passed bill despite the risk of triggering a fiscal crisis ___ associated press writers marcy gordon and josh boak contributed to this report

denver sept 23 2021 globe newswire farm supply cooperatives and independent ag retailers are enjoying strong financial returns as the upturn in u s grain prices enters its second consecutive year the extended period of above average crop prices is leading farmers to increase spending on agronomic inputs and services however while profits for the ag retail sector are expected to remain favorable over the next 12 months emerging structural challenges will bring increased competition and pressure profitability in the years to come major crop input suppliers wielding greater market power larger farm enterprises with a growing appetite for more sophisticated technologies and competition from ag equipment dealers competing for those services are among the key challenges facing ag retailers over the long term according to a new report from cobank s knowledge exchange the ag retailer of the future has an opportunity to earn more income from precision agronomy services and emerging sustainability management programs in addition to traditional crop input sales the report suggests the current operating environment provides a timely opportunity for ag retailers to invest in new technologies and position themselves for success in a marketplace that is evolving rapidly the traditional approach for farm supply cooperatives is to save above average profits when times are good and then manage costs rigorously during the inevitable downturn which we expect will begin in 2023 said kenneth scott zuckerberg lead grain and farm supply economist with cobank unfortunately this approach exposes cooperatives to revenue volatility and declining earnings during down cycles which can often last five or more years instead of relying on product commissions and rebates alone zuckerberg sees farm supply cooperatives path forward is to expand their precision agronomy service offerings and capture more income from consultative service and software fees putting technology and information to work to help farmers manage their inputs and production is where farm supply co ops excel he said tailwinds continue for ag retail near term ag retailers have enjoyed three consecutive profitable agronomy seasons and are generally well positioned for fall 2021 given high grain prices and favorable farm economics the short term outlook remains generally positive based on strong farmer income steady demand for crop inputs and favorable cash flows partially offsetting this retailers may face shortages of certain protection chemicals sourced from asia as well as high wholesale fertilizer costs which they may not be able to fully pass on to growers growing global demand for feed grains and vegetable oil generally positions u s farmers and retailers for continued success in 2022 u s corn and soybean stocks remain very tight and the demand imbalance in stocks and usage should persist until at least 2023 forces driving change over the next several years ag retailers are facing risks that will accelerate over time the number of u s farms continues to decline due to consolidation as family and non family farms seek greater economies of scale to boost profitability as the new class of commercial farming enterprises hire their own agronomy staff and demand more data intensive precision ag services ag retailers could lose their edge as agronomic service providers recent acquisition activity confirms that ag equipment manufacturers are accelerating their offerings of autonomous and precision farming services which compete with traditional agronomic advice provided by ag retailers consolidation among agro chemical and seed suppliers and the maturation of disruptive ag tech startups represent additional structural obstacles getting paid properly for advice beyond providing farm customers with enhanced tools to farm more profitably the business case for ag retailers expansion of precision agronomy services is financially compelling precision capabilities can help cooperatives attract and retain high value customers while recurring service fees provide a new source of income from a risk reward standpoint zuckerberg sees revenue sharing partnerships with proven technology service providers as a solid opportunity for ag retailers the current environment is ideal for partnership structures as a revenue sharing opportunity between retailers and suppliers he said the opportunities associated with technologies for everything from drone imagery and remote sensing for crop scouting to precision seed recommendations and prescriptions are continually expanding read the report precision agronomy services will factor heavily in the future of ag retailing about cobank cobank is a 158 billion cooperative bank serving

cybertruck make tesla segment sports car a lot of people love elon musk he s responsible for the mass production of the ev which forced other manufacturers to finally pull up their socks to compete he sends people and cargo into space for a fraction of the price nasa charged he also makes solar panels set up a network of fast chargers and he gave the world paypal all of these stellar achievements will ensure his name goes down in history as one of the all time greats but what about the bs the blatant nonsense he constantly feeds to hungry press outlets and the so called teslarati the several broken promises the unfortunate pedo tweeting incident after which you d think someone in the pr department would take his phone away we ve covered elon musk for several years since way back in the day when he announced his sexy car strategy odd we thought but all geniuses are in some way but we ve had enough the stupid dancing robot was the last piece of straw on an old camel s back any other ceo would have joined the unemployment line by now why does elon get away with so much is it because we ve lost the ability to think critically in other words look at a subject objectively from various angles before formulating your very own opinion on it unfortunately critical thinking is in short supply these days and the best example i can think of is how easily we give elon musk the benefit of the doubt before someone starts typing another tirade against carbuzz i d like to invite you to read our reviews on tesla products and their competitors i m a big fan of the tesla model s plaid i honestly believe it is the new s class of the automotive industry for decades we looked at the s class to see what would happen ten or twenty years down the road but now we look at the plaid to get some idea of what this electrified future will hold apart from the stupid yoke steering wheel naturally close still that stupid dancing robot is unforgivable it has a cringe factor i don t think i ve ever felt before i imagine it s like watching the wolf of wall street with your parents the first rendering of the robot was promising but then some person in an ill fitting suit got up on stage and started dancing it looked like a power ranger ordered from alibaba this brought back memories of all the unfulfilled promises ridiculous yet awesome sounding ideas and product presentations that continuously go wrong who can forget the cybertruck demonstration a supposedly bulletproof car was easily defeated by a man throwing a metal ball at it i m so sick of all the bs despite knowing the tesla fanatics will most likely fill up my twitter feed with great vengeance and furious anger good luck to you i haven t been on twitter in years it s where good ideas and reasonable debate go to die a painful death let s list all the bs out there shall we close full self driving let s clear the air your tesla can t drive itself even tesla has a small disclaimer on its website stating so but still you have idiots getting in the back seat on the highway usually i d chuckle and thank darwin but these irresponsible idiots are hazardous to other road users according to most experts fully autonomous vehicles are decades away even if it is possible to build a car that can drive itself no legislation allows it creating this legislation will require more than just lawyers it will require politicians automotive executives lawyers and philosophers allow me to create a scenario to illustrate the problem your tesla is happily driving along when suddenly an irresponsible driver comes barreling down on it a head on collision is inevitable so the car will have to swerve right or left on the left side there is a tree if it goes that way it will hurt you the owner on the right side is a crowd of kids waiting for a bus kids are squishier than trees so the chances of the owner getting hurt are less which side should it go to and who makes that decision who s liable for the damage close empty promises back in 2016 he promised fully autonomous taxis that would take you cross country then he promised a million robotaxis on the roads by 2020 it s 2021 and i haven t seen a single one my second favorite was the recent promise that tesla is exceptionally close to building a completely autonomous vehicle stock prices jumped by 43 in one day though no one thought to ask how the sudden jump from level two to level five autonomy could happen so quickly and what happened to the tesla roadster revealed back in 2017 we only receive the slightest of updates every few months tesla claimed a 0 60 mph time of 1 9 seconds in addition you could order it with a spacex package with cold air thrusters it has been moved below the cybertruck on the list of priorities and we all know how that s been going you can still pay tesla some money and reserve one however other undelivered promises include the tesla semi battery swapping for the model s and that snake like intelligent charger close the cybertruck let s move on to the cybertruck it made its in famous debut in 2019 with deliveries scheduled to happen in 2021 but the factory meant to build them is still under construction and we still don t know how the truck could pass us safety legislation that s apart from the dismal product presentation where elon himself smashed the supposedly bulletproof windows with a metal ball still people were more than happy to pay a reservation fee netting tesla a rather neat 79 billion what i find most satisfying of all is ford getting there first tesla used an f 150 to demonstrate the cybertruck s impressive pulling power anybody who knows anything about cars knows that tesla cheated in that famous video yet ford must have been angry and the result of that ire is the f 150 lightning close the everyman tesla since 2006 tesla has promised an electric vehicle for the average american it would sell for around 35 000 and finally bring electric cars to the masses to be fair the model 3 was briefly available at around 35 000 but only for a very short period it wasn t around for long enough to make any meaningful impact or for the masses to take advantage the problem is every time tesla promises something like this stock prices soar and then nothing happens and we let it slide by while waiting for tesla to fulfill that promise mini introduced an ev below that price point the mini se is far from perfect but let s not forget that a legacy manufacturer got there first all we have now is more promises of a 25 000 tesla fully autonomous small car and a van nobody can catch up sorry teslarati hate to be the one to break it to you but just about everyone is starting to catch up lucid air recently became the first ev manufacturer to get an epa confirmed all electric driving range above 500 miles it happened the same week the first rivian r1t rolled off the factory floor making it the first mass producer of an electric pickup truck the go to argument has always been range and it s still true tesla remains for the most part the leader but competitors are inching closer hyundai s ioniq 5 is a prime example around 300 miles of driving range but coupled with acceptable repeatable build quality the same goes for the ford mustang mach e what it lacks in driving range it makes up for by being a solid well built product finally the recent merger between rimac and bugatti porsche also happens to own a stake what happens once rimac s battery tech starts filtering through the vag group one of the oldest manufacturers with the latest battery tech sure keep on believing nobody can catch tesla close that stupid robot my final criticism is the stupid robot presentation once again the experts say that we re years away from having robot servants yet musk parades a dancer in an ill fitting suit in front of a crowd and he s hailed as a hero tesla stock goes up as a result as a journalist i could not believe how easily the mass media bought into this ridiculous concept without asking any questions seriously a man was dancing around in a suit why did nobody raise their hands and go wtf i m not suggesting elon musk retire from his various enterprises but we need to stop gargling up all of this obvious bs we need to start asking the tough questions and not just believe everything he feeds us every other ceo gets roasted when they do something ridiculous when bezos shot his penis into the sky the media came down on him hard for spending so much on a hobby whenever mark zuckerberg opens his mouth the internet is flooded with alien memes bill gates is spying on us via the covid 19 vaccine why does musk get a pass
salem ore ktvz oregon health officials said thursday they are ready to make booster shots available to people who are eligible to receive one if the western states scientific safety review workgroup approves a federal recommendation to make booster shots of the pfizer vaccine available to seniors and people in high risk categories while oregon currently has an adequate supply of pfizer vaccines state health officials cautioned that provider capacity could mean that booster shots may not be available on demand in some communities health officials continued to emphasize that medical evidence shows that all three covid 19 vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing severe covid 19 illness and death the recommended pfizer booster maintains the pfizer vaccine s long term effectiveness especially for older adults public health officials also urged all unvaccinated oregonians to talk to their health provider about getting immunized against covid 19 dr tom jeanne deputy state epidemiologist said the delta variant continues to spread putting more people at risk including younger people a vaccination is the best way to keep yourself and the people you care about safe from covid 19 earlier today a panel of medical and public health experts convened by the federal centers for disease control and prevention cdc recommended a booster dose of the pfizer vaccine for people aged 65 and older as well as residents of long term care facilities and people 18 and older who have certain underlying conditions all of whom had received their second dose of the vaccine at least 6 months ago the western states scientific safety review workgroup convenes later thursday to consider the federal recommendations people vaccinated with the moderna and johnson johnson covid 19 vaccines are not currently eligible to receive a booster though federal health officials expect to consider a booster recommendation in coming weeks based on more data dr melissa sutton medical director of respiratory viral pathogens at oha said current evidence tells us that the moderna and johnson johnson vaccines continue to offer strong protection against the most serious covid 19 outcomes people who are immunocompromised and were vaccinated at least one month ago currently qualify for a third dose of the pfizer or moderna vaccines based on previous recommendations approved by federal and western states medical experts according to the cdc s panel people who are recommended to receive a pfizer booster are people 65 or older who received their second dose of pfizer vaccine at least 6 months ago residents of long term care facilities who received their second dose of pfizer vaccine at least 6 months ago people 50 64 who have medical conditions that put them at risk of developing severe covid 19 disease and received their second dose of pfizer vaccine at least 6 months ago people 18 to 49 years old who have underlying health conditions that make them vulnerable to covid 19 and who received their second dose of pfizer vaccine at least 6 months ago would also be eligible based on their individual benefits and risks state public health doctors emphasized that findings from current data show that vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization and death remains high in people under the age of 65 state health officials estimate the population of oregonians who are potentially eligible for a pfizer booster immediately could exceed 230 000 people with more becoming eligible as they reach the 6 month threshold since they completed their vaccination series across oregon vaccination sites currently have approximately 460 000 pfizer doses in stock eligible oregonians in these categories could seek booster shots through their health care provider or local pharmacy once approved by the western states safety review panel eligible residents in long term care facilities including seniors should receive their boosters through vaccination plans developed between their homes and pharmacies state officials are also planning ways to reach home bound seniors people with disabilities and other vulnerable populations in some regions of the state providers and local public health officials again may set up large mass vaccination sites however state officials urged eligible oregonians to be patient as public health and health care providers administer vaccines and fight the most recent wave of covid 19 cases hospitalizations and deaths brought on by the highly transmissible delta variant oha director patrick allen said our ability to deliver pfizer boosters isn t limited by the availability of doses but by capacity of health care providers to administer them at the same time they re treating hundreds of new cases each day driven by the delta variant which is running rampant largely among unvaccinated oregonians i m grateful for the dedication and resilience of oregon s health care community i ask oregonians to recognize that you may not have a booster appointment waiting for you the day you become eligible but you will get one in the meantime your vaccine continues to protect you from covid 19 no matter what vaccination you ve received

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video east moline has been given a credit score just two notches above junk after voting to take out over 40 million in bonds to pay for police and fire pensions east moline ill east moline has been given a credit rating just two steps above junk after the city voted to approve general obligation bonds for police and fire pensions moody s investors service said the move carried risk and increased east moline s chances of investment loss but said the rating had been revised to stable from negative on sept 7 the city voted to take out 41 2 million in general obligation bonds at historically low interest rates to cover unpaid police and fire pensions the idea is to invest the bonds then hopefully see a 4 7 investment return currently east moline has nearly 18 3 million in unfunded firefighter pensions as well as roughly 22 million for police according to 2011 reforms to illinois public workers pension system city governments have to fund 90 of those liabilities by 2040 a baird financial report found that at its current rate the city would have to pay 3 030 100 into the pension fund this year with that amount going up annually by 2039 east moline would be paying 6 772 300 a year just to meet their deadline and necessary funds city administrator doug maxeiner argues that with the invested bonds east moline will pay a fixed rate of 2 8 million a year without raising taxes by the 2040 deadline those figures show nearly 30 million dollars in savings as opposed to rising annual payments however the move does carry risk which might have an impact on future investments in the city according to wirepoints a not for profit research and commentary group focused on improving illinois moody s is giving a credit score to east moline saying hey it s two notches away from junk it s a really bad rating said ted dabrowski president of wirepoints it s a very bad signal for a very bad idea dabrowski argues that municipalities should never take out bonds against taxpayer money to gamble in the stock market that s a risk that moody s doesn t like he said it increases the cost of borrowing for east moline in the future if the city was ever in trouble it might lose its capacity to borrow when it needs the money the most he also said it sends a worrying signal to investors they say why do i want to invest in a city that s close to being rated junk and is borrowing lots of money and gambling with taxpayer dollars he said think of it like a credit score that the worse your credit score gets the more you have to pay on interest the worse your credit score is the less you can borrow in the future the lower your credit score is the less people trust you or businesses trust you instead dabrowski is in favor of cities like east moline working to change the law and pushing illinois government to find a new solution to the state s pension issues what you re doing is you re funding the pensions but then putting the taxpayers on the hook for the 40 million he said if the stock market crashes guess who s going to be on the hook if this doesn t work ordinary people from east moline in a statement east moline city administrator doug maxeiner said the city was moving in the right direction regardless of the credit score report i am disappointed in the moody s downgrade and do not feel as if it captures the current state of financial affairs of the city of east moline they based their downgrade on pension burdens and high opeb other post employment benefit costs the pension obligation bonds pobs we are getting prepared to issue is an effort to stabilize the growing pension burden through level debt service to address these concerns we have also received cooperation from our police and fire unions on limiting retiree health insurance benefits for future employees which will help reduce our opeb liability we are confident we are heading in the right direction regardless of moody s rating decision also i would point out that moody s position on the pobs is neutral recognizing the effort to stabilize growing pension burdens while also recognizing the investment risk of the strategy taking out bonds with the intent on investing is nothing new for cities and counties rock island county was considering a similar move earlier this week as officials debated taking out 30 million in bonds to cover unpaid retirement funds however on thursday morning rock island county administrator jim snider revealed those discussions had been tabled in a statement to news 8 he said our on further review from our actuary this week our unfunded imrf pension liability looks to be down to around 2m instead of the estimated amount report last tuesday of 23 7m this is due to very strong recent stock market performance on our imrf estimated funding level obviously future stock market performance could cause this unfunded portion to increase however at this juncture there is no need to continue the consideration of the pob the county had been dealing with funds through the illinois municipal retirement fund imrf and said the unfunded portion had been found to be negligible snider said there was no longer a need to consider a general obligation bond pob due to overperforming stocks from the imrf

the outlines of the clash that brought america to the brink of default in the fall of 2013 were straightforward claiming the mantle of fiscal rectitude republicans stood firm against an increase in the federal borrowing limit democrats lambasted the gop for playing politics with the nation s credit risking a calamitous default on the surface not much appears to have changed in the eight years since the last congressional debt crisis roiled capitol hill but as leaders of the two parties settle into familiar roles this week they are doing so against a markedly different political landscape while both parties continued to advance policies that add substantially to the debt roughly 10 trillion the public s interest in the issue has dramatically waned a gallup poll in 2013 found that one fifth of americans saw the federal budget as the nation s top problem in august only 2 percent of americans thought the same after raising the debt limit for decades republicans in recent years have leveraged it to enact spending cuts while also threatening government default video jm rieger the washington post advertisement lawmakers and strategists for both parties said this week that despite the change in public opinion the political approach has not changed much for either party republicans who have played a major role in growing budget deficits still see federal spending as a potent issue with both their conservative base and with swing voters many democrats still fear that voting for a debt ceiling increase will prove to be a potent attack against them in tight races in next year s midterms but as the gallup poll indicates the data underpinning those assumptions is sketchy at best raising the possibility that lawmakers are risking a catastrophic economic meltdown for meager political stakes i think this is a very dangerous exercise that we re in right now said sen jon tester d mont yet the cycle continued thursday senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky reiterated that republicans would play no part in voting to increase the debt limit advertisement this could not be simpler if want to tax borrow and spend historic sums of money without our input they ll have to raise the debt limit without our help he said this is the reality senate majority leader charles e schumer d n y in turn accused republicans of embracing alice in wonderland logic and solidifying the gop as the party of default both sides incurred the debt both sides should pay it he said on the sidelines of the clash however some lawmakers questioned whether the public truly cared about the issue while numerous democrats said they were incensed at what they called republicans hypocrisy for essentially running up a credit card bill and skipping the payment many said they were prepared to eliminate the debt ceiling entirely and a few including sen tim kaine d va said a standoff with republicans over the borrowing limit was not worth distracting from the party s push for sweeping new tax climate health care and safety net legislation advertisement kaine said he was much more focused on writing that bill known as build back better than on the debt ceiling i hope leadership figures it out he said i get that we want republicans to do the right thing but i don t think there s a downside i think there s less of a downside to voting on a debt ceiling increase than there is on not getting action on the reconciliation priorities because people are hurting still sen jeanne shaheen d n h said she had seen no evidence that the public is engaged in the debt debate it s been in the news for a week or so we track our calls and emails to the office every day and it hasn t come up once she said some republicans such as sen james lankford okla fully acknowledged the public apathy while saying they saw it as a matter of principle anyway advertisement we have 28 trillion in debt our economy is still growing we re still getting people hired so why are you worried about this said lankford who was first elected to congress in the 2010 tea party wave that was fueled by dire warnings of fiscal collapse and myself and a couple others continue to say you have to worry about debt because one day it will be a very big deal lankford like almost all republicans voted for president donald trump s 2017 tax cut package that is projected to add 1 9 trillion in debt and consistently supported increased defense spending republicans also supported pandemic relief bills passed during the trump administration that adding significantly to the debt share this article share gop voters concerns about the deficit have risen since president biden was elected while democrats have dropped a pew survey found 71 percent of republicans calling federal budget deficits a big problem in april 2021 up from 49 percent in june 2020 under trump overall the poll found about half of americans listed deficits as a big problem on par with violent crime illegal immigration and gun violence advertisement the stakes for raising the debt limit are considerable an analysis from moody s analytics released this week found that a prolonged debt ceiling crisis could spark a recession costing as many as 6 million jobs and sending unemployment up to as much as 9 percent the treasury department estimates the limit will be reached sometime in mid october giving lawmakers only a matter of weeks to hash out a way forward republicans are calling on democrats to use the special senate budget rules known as reconciliation to raise the ceiling the same procedures they are planning to use to pass the sweeping build back better bill democrats have so far refused arguing that it s not their sole responsibility to pay bills that republicans helped incur and continue to help incur the bipartisan infrastructure bill that passed the senate in august for instance is expected to add 256 billion to federal deficits over the coming decade according to the congressional budget office and mcconnell and 19 other republicans voted for it advertisement still republicans appear eager to use the vote to advance a broader narrative of democratic economic dysfunction connecting a debt ceiling vote to broader attacks on rising inflation and the party s plans for a significant expansion of federal spending unlike during the 2011 and 2013 debt standoffs republicans are not pushing democrats for concessions on spending they are simply demanding they own the vote politically mcconnell on wednesday appeared alongside sen rick scott r fla chairman of the gop s senate campaign committee to deliver yet another ultimatum that democrats would have to act on the debt ceiling themselves scott declined to directly address the political implications of a vote to raise the debt limit but said democrats were acting as if they were serious the democrats must be worried about it though or they d be doing it on their own he said so they must have a big concern that it will hurt their campaigns raw political tactics appear to be shaping at least part of the current standoff while recent debt ceiling increases have simply suspended the limit to a future date many lawmakers and aides believe that the current republican position forcing the debt ceiling increase into the reconciliation process would foreclose the possibility of a suspension and force democrats to raise the actual dollar figure that number which could approach 30 trillion at a minimum could play directly into next political year s political advertising advertisement democratic aides familiar with the issue who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal talks said that while it appears that the debt limit would have to be raised to a set number in reconciliation rather than suspended the question is not fully settled and could still be litigated with the senate parliamentarian many democrats say they believe that as in 2013 republicans will ultimately shoulder a greater share of the blame as the showdown proceeds for precipitating a potential financial crisis it is already clearly the case that republicans are going to attack democrats for being fiscally reckless big spenders and having a debt ceiling vote doesn t really add to that said democratic pollster geoff garin but mcconnell s ploy puts republican fingerprints on the dagger that is being stabbed into the back of the economy advertisement but former congressman steve israel d n y who led the democratic house election efforts during the 2011 and 2013 debt limit standoffs warned that a potential government default could further complicate biden s efforts to convince the country that his election would help move beyond the political turmoil of the trump administration it conflicts with the narrative that we are getting healthier and stores are opening up and the economy is getting better israel said it becomes part of a narrative of chaos and instability some democratic senators said that they believed at least a touch of chaos was in order we re going to keep voting to increase the debt ceiling and at some point the american public will see that republicans are cratering the economy said sen chris van hollen d md who compared the potential drama to 2008 when wall street imploded as congress dithered on providing bank bailouts if you want to see the stock market and the economy crash before your eyes watch what happens when republicans block the debt ceiling meanwhile a growing number of democrats say the party should explore options for eliminating the need for routine debt ceiling hikes entirely by perhaps automatically raising the limit to meet the authorized level of federal spending or by setting the debt ceiling to such an absurdly high amount that it would never be breached again i want to raise it to a gazillion dollars and just be done with it house budget committee chairman john yarmuth d ky told reporters this week but removing a sloppily handled hand grenade from the american political system stands to be a tricky proposition one that could open some vulnerable democrats to attacks for eliminating one of the few mechanisms for enforcing fiscal discipline sen mark kelly ariz one of the democratic incumbents who will be seeking reelection next year demurred this week when asked whether he would support permanently defusing the risk of default we shouldn t be going up to the line on this and putting the full faith and credit of the united states at risk he said we ve had this and we should be able to come together in a bipartisan way to raise the debt limit like we have in the past
even with thursday s jump in yields confidence is building that markets can ride out a pullback in fed stimulus unlike 2013 when the so called taper tantrum triggered large losses in bonds and equities investors are betting that the economic and profit recovery will be strong enough to outweigh a reduction in asset purchases while ultra low rates will continue to support riskier assets even as concerns linger about contagion from china s real estate woes the turbo charged taper a little bit of a surprise it was coming in a relatively short period that they re planning for this but the markets are ok with that at the end of the day paul donovan ubs s global chief economist said during a bloomberg tv interview meanwhile the british pound rallied and gilts declined as traders brought forward wagers on a bank of england rate hike to 0 25 after officials said developments since its august meeting appear to have strengthened the case for modest tightening stocks briefly pared gains during european market hours after a report that chinese authorities signaled reluctance to bail out evergrande even as beijing injected more cash into the financial system and regulators instructed the embattled property developer to avoid a near term default fears of an evergrande failure have caused a sharp rise in borrowing costs for other junk rated chinese developers and cast doubt on the health of some smaller chinese banks

aside from diesel fuel engine oil might be the most critical fluid in a truck because it influences two of the top three equipment related costs for fleets fuel and maintenance and with various weights blends and formulations available proper selection is a key enabler of driving down cost of ownership engine oils are formulated with two primary components base stocks and additives base stocks or base oils serve as the building block for the formulation and can account for 70 to 80 of the total lubricant composition said mobil delvac applications engineer nicolas rivera very high performing lubes are formulated made using synthetic base stocks from specially tailored and selected materials which have no impurities mineral base stocks are produced from crude oil and depending on final application can undergo different refining methods in order to remove impurities and achieve the desired properties chevron lubricants staff engineer shawn whitacre noted that synthetic oils feature a base oil that is more highly refined which produces a less volatile oil with increased temperature performance viscosity index vi also lower volatility means lower consumption and less top off synthetic oils may cost more upfront but there are savings on the backend find out more in the video above oils thicken at low temperatures and thin at high temperatures added karin haumann oem technical manager for shell global solutions synthetic oils are made with base oils that have a higher vi meaning that they are more temperature stable with less dramatic viscosity changes with temperature because synthetic oils offer more temperature stability whitacre said they are optimal selection for applications that operate in extreme environmental or severe duty conditions synthetic and highly refined mineral based oils are designed to be more resistant to thermal breakdown which helps them retain their new oil properties longer added rivera this helps the customer realize an oil s fuel efficiency advantages across the oil drain cycle and also ensure engine cleanliness and long term durability in a cold climate synthetics allow for better flow and protection on start and warm up according to darryl purificati oem technical liaison at hollyfrontier lubricants specialties which includes the petro canada lubricants brand using synthetic fluids also means less work is required from the engine which improves the overall health of the vehicle synthetic oils also tend to have better oxidation stability which can lead to a longer oil life oxidation is driven by high temperatures which make severe operating conditions an excellent application for synthetic oils haumann said synthetic oils cost more upfront than conventional but whitacre noted there are savings to be had in that synthetics can enable longer service intervals on top of fuel economy benefits heather wales north american brand and communications manager for shell rotella posed the following example truck one runs a conventional 15w 40 at 20 000 mile drain intervals truck two runs a full synthetic 5w 40 at 60 000 mile drain intervals both trucks run 120 000 miles per year and require 15 gallons of oil per oil change that means truck one will be off the road for service five times per year using 75 gallons of oil and truck two will be off the road two times per year using only 30 gallons of oil add that to the benefits of fuel economy uptime and longer engine life and the savings could be significant wales said so while a lower viscosity synthetic engine oil might seem like a bigger investment it pays off in the long run there s also environmental considerations because as purificati points out reducing the number of drains also reduces the waste oil that needs to be processed and disposed of at the same time rivera said a full synthetic oil may not make economic sense for fleets with older equipment or limited pm optimization potential regardless of the application these are all situations where an oil analysis program can add value in evaluating the condition of the oil condition of the equipment and whether or not the correct oil is being used he said should you change your oil type check out the video above synthetic blend formulations act as a step between full synthetic and conventional products in this case manufacturers blend specific cuts of highly refined synthetic base stocks with conventional base oil to achieve a certain performance level rivera said and these can strike a perfect balance between enhanced wear protection fuel efficiency extended drain potential and value while synthetic blend products could be seen as a bridge because of their lower price point compared to full synthetic wales said they are great products in their own right adding synthetic blend engine oils offer protection for longer engine life extended oil drain capabilities and up to 2 fuel economy compared to a conventional 15w 40 heavy duty engine oil has become probably the number one choice of large fleets who are looking for that fuel economy advantage and really that combination of price and performance whitacre said it s also a very key consideration for fleets that operate in a variety of operating climates

the white house and congressional democrats have agreed to a framework of options to pay for their huge emerging social and environment bill top democrats said thursday now they face the daunting task of narrowing the menu to tax possibilities they can pass to fund president joe biden s 3 5 trillion plan senate majority leader chuck schumer of new york and house speaker nancy pelosi of california announced the progress as biden administration officials and democratic congressional leaders negotiated behind the scenes the package aims to rewrite tax and spending priorities to expand programs for americans of all ages while upping efforts to tackle income inequality and fight climate change staring down a self imposed monday deadline lawmakers said they would work nonstop to find agreement on specifics democrats views on those vary widely though they largely agree with biden s idea of raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy to fund the package we certainly think it s progress biden press secretary jen pskai said at the white house biden has been encouraging the negotiations inviting more than 20 of his party s moderate and progressive lawmakers to the white house for lengthy meetings this week he s working to close the deal with congress on his build back better agenda at a time when his presidential campaign promises are running into the difficulty of actually governing but the party has been divided over many of the details moderate democrats most prominently senators joe manchin of west virginia and kyrsten sinema of arizona are demanding that the massive dollar total be reduced the revenue options to pay for it that mostly means taxes being considered can be dialed up or down the leaders say the ultimate price tag may certainly slip from the much publicized 3 5 trillion republicans are solidly opposed to the package calling it a reckless tax and spending spree so democrats will have to push it through congress on their own which is only possible if they limit their defections to a slim few in the house and none in the senate we re proceeding pelosi said we intend to stay the course and pass the bill as soon as possible the congressional leaders huddled early thursday with the chairs of the tax writing committees to agree to the framework pulling from work already being done on those panels they are intent on sticking to biden s pledge not to raise taxes on people making less than 400 000 a year representative richard neal the chairman of the house ways and means committee has already drafted his version which would raise about 2 3 trillion by increasing corporate tax rates to 26 5 for businesses earning more than 5 million a year and increasing the top individual tax from 37 to 39 6 for those earning more than 400 000 or 450 000 for married households the house panel s bill also includes a 3 surtax on the adjusted incomes of very wealthy people making more than 5 million a year the senate finance committee under senator ron wyden has not yet passed its bill but it has been eyeing proposals that further target the superrich including efforts to curtail practices used to avoid paying taxes i m not going to get into any specific stuff today but i ve made it very clear as chairman of the finance committee a billionaire s tax will be on the menu wyden said those tax goals align with the biden administration which is marshaling arguments that the increases are fundamentally about fairness at a time of gaping income inequality according to a new analysis released thursday by the white house the wealthiest 400 families worth more than a billion dollars paid an average tax rate of just 8 2 between 2010 and 2018 treasury department tables show that is lower than the average tax rate of families with an income of roughly 142 000 the analysis suggests two clear reasons why billionaires pay a lower rate than the upper middle class they derive income from stocks dividends and other assets that are taxed at lower rates and they can permanently avoid paying tax on certain investment gains that by law are excluded from taxable income without divulging a framework wyden indicated he is in agreement with the house s plans for certain retirement savings accounts used by the wealthy to shield liabilities targeting mega iras democrats hope to correct what they see as a flaw in the retirement savings system enabling billionaires to amass millions in independent retirement accounts without ever paying taxes under some proposals individuals earning beyond 400 000 would be barred from contributing to their iras once their account balances top 10 million the biden administration has also shown interest in one climate change tax a so called pollution importer fee which would essentially impose a tariff on goods coming from countries without certain emissions controls the tax is seen as a way to pressure china gaining less traction seems to be a carbon tax that could fall on households and stray from biden s pledge not to tax those earning less than 400 000 another big unknown whether democrats can coalesce around a plan to rein in prescription drug costs which could save the government hundreds of billions that could be used for biden s goals thursday s sudden announcement of framework options caught key lawmakers off guard including senator bernie sanders an independent and the chairman of the budget committee and others playing leading roles in assembling one of the biggest bills congress has ever attempted schumer later acknowledged of the emerging framework it s hardly conclusory but it was a good step of progress yet the framework could help the congressional leaders show momentum as they head toward crucial deadlines and start to address concerns raised by manchin and other moderates who want a more clear cut view of what taxes are being considered before they move forward aides said on monday the house plans to begin considering a separate 1 trillion package of road and other infrastructure projects as a first test of biden s agenda that public works bill has already passed the senate and pelosi has agreed to schedule it for a house vote to assuage party moderates who badly want that legislation passed but are leery of supporting the larger 3 5 trillion measure but progressives are threatening to defeat the public works bill as inadequate unless it is partnered with the broader package to make sure both bills can pass democratic leaders are trying to reach agreement on the bigger bill meanwhile the house and senate remain at a standstill over a separate package to keep the government funded past the sept 30 fiscal year end and to suspend the federal debt limit to avert a shutdown and a devastating u s default on payments senate republicans are refusing to back that house passed bill despite the risk of triggering a fiscal crisis

the new school year brings all kinds of concerns for students even without the threat of an ongoing pandemic and while some concerns require specific solutions the need for clothing is being met thanks to a mobile boutique courtesy of kisha beaner howcott and her group clothed by love mentoring ms howcott a richmond native and special education teacher in caroline county hosts the boutique that has the feel of a store inside a trailer it allows students to shop for new clothes free of charge the organization also pro vides mentoring giving students in all grades tools for learning as part of its mission to provide youths with great fashion life skills and the ability to build a positive self image anytime i welcome students into our mobile boutique and give away clothes at community events big or small is a touching moment for me ms howcott says i am thankful god is using me in this way clothed by love was founded april 8 2020 with its beginning tied to ms howcott s work with her former nonprofit victorious ladies ministry and its outreach program blessed to be a blessing distribution ms howcott combined the passion the former program fostered with her life experiences to create what she saw as a god given vision to provide support in helping our students overcome barriers while encouraging them to reach their full potential when i was a single mother i learned the importance of having a good support system and how to utilize my resources to meet needs ms howcott says then as an educator i was able to see the needs of my students firsthand and i wanted to make a positive difference in the lives of students especially those who were working so hard for a better outcome in life clothed by love mentoring began out of the back of ms howcott s truck with bins full of clothes the mobile trailer acquired more than a month later is easier and provides a better experience for those selecting clothes ms howcott says further change has come as the group which includes eight consistent volunteers has expanded its services to providing life principles and skills to those they assist the program includes a reading enhancement program for students with a virtual reading group for elementary and middle school students and a driver s education study group for high schoolers and recent graduates to help them obtain a driving permit i believe that god gave me a new vision so our name reflects what we do clothing our communities with love ms howcott says we recently added mentoring to our name because we wanted our communities to know that we offered other services besides giving away clothing from our mobile boutique on friday sept 24 clothed by love will host its first girls night in to assess the social and emotional well being of high school girls and provide them with an outlet for advice ms howcott already is looking toward expanding the program to include other age and gender groups a testament to her commitment to clothed by love and the communities it serves we are here to be a blessing so if we see a need then we try to meet that need ms howcott says if it is a service that we provide we ask that people reach out to us let us help the best way we can meet a person dedicated to meeting the needs of young people and this week s personality kisha beaner howcott no 1 volunteer position founder and chief executive officer of clothed by love mentoring date and place of birth july 21 in richmond where i live now varina in henrico county education washington and lee high school westmo reland county bachelor s in psychology liberty university master s in special education grand canyon university occupation special education teacher caroline high school in caroline county family husband mike son mike jr 29 daughter keyonna 27 daughter kiya 15 and daughter kaliyah 7 clothed by love s mission clothed by love teaches christian principles to support youth enrichment through mentoring programs that help youth dress for success develop life skills and build positive self image how clothed by love chooses the communities it serves we are here to be a blessing so if we see a need then we try to meet that need we have had the opportunity to work with some wonderful organizations to combine our resources to meet the needs of the community let us help the best way we can you can contact us on our website clothedbylove org facebook clothed by love va or instagram clothed_by_love how a community knows clothed by love is present at community events we usually pull up with our mobile boutique which is a 7x16 enclosed trailer you can t miss us reason for being mobile i use to give away clothing before to help families in need but i was doing it out of my truck it was hard work carrying around bins and loading them in and out of places having a mobile boutique is an easier way to manage and transport the clothes i would say being mobile has it advantages because i can transform my trailer to cater to whatever need we are meeting why being mobile is better than having a brick and mortar shop that s easy i can reach those who might not have the means to reach me and they can still have the full experience of what we have to offer how clothed by love gets its clothes i purchased a lot of the clothing in the beginning we were able to find really good sales and deals so we would stock up on items i got a lot of items from wal mart justice and rainbow when we first started out i did some research and came across an organization called good 360 which connects nonprofits with stores that donate products thank the lord we are starting to get in donations and grants but support is still needed we still need to make connections and i pray that people will donate is all of the clothing new all the clothes in our mobile boutique are new we do collect gently used items but we plan on doing what we call a vintage pop up in different areas to give those clothes away it will be set up just like a yard sale but the items are all free clothed by love s most touching moment anytime i welcome students into our mobile boutique and give away clothes at community events big or small is a touching moment for me i am thankful god is using me in this way the families and community members have been so nice for the most part another touching moment was when a little girl told me she wishes she lived in the boutique i felt honored that she enjoyed her experience with us upcoming events we are kicking off our first girls night in on friday sept 24 the purpose of this program is to check on the social and emotional well being of our high school age girls we will provide them with an outlet to share and receive advice in a safe non judgmental environ ment through girl chats we will have a theme each meeting that will educate them on a desired topic on sept 24 our theme is skin care and how to apply makeup that is age appropriate because our teen girls are into makeup we will have a makeup artist share her expertise with the participants we look forward to expanding this program over time to include other age and gender groups how i start the day i usually start my day with my morning devotion i meditate on scrip ture pray and or read three words that best describe me encourager considerate and trustworthy best late night snack ice cream

jumped 8 4 on an announced buyback and whitehaven coal whc which trades on coal prices and rose 7 2 while the banks did the heavy lifting yesterday technology topped the percentages with a 3 0 gain led by square and zip co z1p post indian acquisition announcement while energy 2 9 and utilities 2 1 chimed in on higher oil prices and supposed china relief you know it s a buy everything day when agl energy agl gets a bid 5 3 all sectors closed in the green yesterday but rather bizarrely the big underperformer was called materials up a mere 0 2 with iron ore up 14 but that is after a 60 correction staples 0 3 did what staples do iron ore has since held its ground base metal and oil prices were higher overnight but a leap in us bond yields has turned the lights out again for gold wall street has surged but as was the case on the way down earlier in the week our market has been leading on the evergrande news given the time zone rather than following as usual thus while the dow was up over 500 points our futures are up a mere 8 points this morning taper titillation it is a truth universally acknowledged that smart investors stay out of the stock market in the last hour and a half post a fed statement rather making their move the next day it appears that on wednesday night bond investors made the same call the us ten year yield did not move post statement last night it jumped 7 basis points to 1 41 if this had been six months ago it would have been curtains for the nasdaq but last night the nasdaq jumped 1 0 there was nonetheless a bias towards value and cyclicals with the dow up 1 5 and s p500 1 2 but long duration growth stocks many yet to post a profit are beholden to the longer term discount rate so why the change of heart for months wall street has been worried about a taper tantrum yet over the same period many on wall street have been calling time on massive emergency bond purchases given the economy s spectacular bounce out of the covid crisis so for months expectations of the beginning of tapering have been gradually priced in all that remained was the uncertainty from when and how fast that uncertainty was put to bed on wednesday night markets don t like uncertainty now that wall street knows where it stands vis a vis monetary policy it s safe to pile back in on the other hand there remains concern the fed is behind the curve when it comes to inflation the prime reason is that of company after company reporting supply and labour shortage issues resulting in price pressures fedex reported earnings on wednesday night and copped a hiding for those reasons last night the ceo of ups suggested the same issues will still be evident in a year s time nine fomc members have forecast at this stage the first rate hike will be in 2022 far sooner then the chair continues to insist forget the taper tantrum the fear now is the fed will be forced to act a lot faster than it currently expects but for now it s back to normal programming last night the s p500 closed above its evergrande tipping point the banks led the charge on the jump in bond yields while the rebound in oil prices again has energy hot on their heels all s p sectors closed in the green bar property and utilities which did not get hit earlier in the week that was the week that was assuming wall street doesn t fall in a heap tonight it will be the first week in four the s p has closed higher we still don t know what s going on with evergrande commodities all discussed above it is understandable that us bond yields should rise on taper anticipation it does not compute that the us dollar should then fall down 0 4 last night but given the greenback is a safe haven in times of uncertainty clearly that trade was unwound last night on supposed evergrande relief the aussie has thus shot up 0 9 to us 0 7299 on a combination of both spot metals minerals energy futures gold oz 1742 80 25 10 1 42 silver oz 22 50 0 16 0 71 copper lb 4 22 0 01 0 29 aluminium

effective backlog which includes all orders announced since the end of the first quarter is over 36 million an explanation of the use of non gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of aehrâ s non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures can be found in the accompanying tables gayn erickson president and ceo ofâ aehr test systems commented â œwe are off to a strong start for fiscal 2022 finishing the first quarter with record bookings for a single quarter of 20 7 million since the end of the quarter we have announced an additional 19 4 million in bookings bringing our total bookings for the fiscal year to over 40 million as of todayâ s date â œour strong bookings include several sizable orders received over the past few months from our lead silicon carbide test and burn in customer for our fox xpâ systems and waferpakâ contactors to support testing of silicon carbide power devices for electric vehicles each of these silicon carbide focused fox xp systems is configured to test eighteen silicon carbide wafers in parallel in the footprint of a typical single wafer test solution while contacting and testing 100 of the devices in parallel on each wafer this fortune 500 customer is a major automotive semiconductor supplier and we continue to work closely with them to achieve their test and burn in requirements and capacity needs they continue to forecast orders for additional fox systems and waferpaks this fiscal year and a significant number of systems and waferpaks over the next several years driven by electric vehicle semiconductor test and burn in demand â â œin addition to this large opportunity with our lead silicon carbide customer we are currently in detailed discussions with multiple other major silicon carbide suppliers regarding their wafer level test and burn in needs we believe we will add several new silicon carbide customers over the next 18 months that will ramp into production on our solutions â œwe are seeing very strong demand across the industry for wafer level burn in of silicon carbide devices and continue to ramp our fox multi wafer test and burn in systems and full wafer waferpaks to meet this silicon carbide market opportunity which we believe is only just beginning we believe silicon carbide power semiconductors have emerged as the preferred technology for the electric power conversion and control of the electric engines in what are called traction inverters as well as the on board electric vehicle battery chargers â œthe silicon carbide power semiconductor device market is expected to increase over 500 between 2020 and 2026 growing at a compound average growth rate â œcagrâ of 36 to 4 5 billion according to yole researchâ s latest forecast â and a report from deloitte forecasts that the total electric vehicle industryâ will likely grow at a cagr of 29 from 2020 to 2025 before reaching 31 1â million vehicles by 2030 and securing approximately 32 of the total marketâ share for new car sales market research firm exawatt exa watt com estimates that the total market for silicon carbide wafers for power semiconductors for electric vehicles in 2021 will be 133 000 150mm equivalent wafers and the total market will exceed 1 23 million 150 mm equivalent wafers in 2030 these stats highlight the tremendous opportunity aehr test has in front of it with its wafer level test and burn in solution for electric vehicle semiconductors â œin addition to the devices in the electric vehicles the energy infrastructure market that includes charging stations wind farms and solar panels in both solar farms and for individual homes and businesses allâ are markets that are consuming more silicon carbide devices than electric vehicles today and are growing at a rapid rate over the next decade we believe it is very clear that this infrastructure is going to need to grow to support the electric vehicle demand many countries including the united states are putting in place government subsidies and infrastructure for these charging stations wind farms and solar farms to be installed to support a greener more sustainable and reduced carbon emission world â œour fox family of products are cost effective solutions for ensuring the critical quality and reliability of devices in these markets and we anticipate that wafer level test and burn in will become the industry standard for quality and reliability screening of silicon carbide devices with the most cost effective solution in the market to address this opportunity we believe that aehr has the chance to achieve a significant market share â œin addition to our success in the silicon carbide applications we continue to see signs of strengthening in the silicon photonics test and burn in market during this quarter we received and shipped our first order in china for our fox solution for production test of silicon photonics devices expanding our customer base for silicon photonics with this new customer that serves international as well as china markets â œseveral other customers addressing the silicon photonics market have also forecast additional system and contactor capacity needs this fiscal year these include needs to address incremental production capacity as well as capacity to address new customer and new product qualification and engineering silicon photonics devices address the 5g and data center infrastructure industry as well as several other key markets and yole research predicts that the silicon photonics market will grow at a 36 cagr from 2020 to 2025 â œour customers are using our fox wafer level solutions for 100 test and burn in rather than just sampling of their integrated silicon photonics devices and we currently have five silicon photonics customers that are shipping products to their customers using our fox solution we see a significant opportunity for growth as we expand within these customers and add additional new silicon photonics customers â œwe also continue with multiple programs using our fox systems for production test and burn in of new applications for 2d 3d sensors for mobile devices we expect to see meaningful bookings and revenue from these programs this fiscal year and continue to be optimistic about this market space â œas we discussed and anticipated last year during the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic we have emerged a stronger company with more production customers more markets and applications and higher value products than we had before the start of the pandemic with our record bookings and the strength of our semiconductor test and burn in solutions as well as the positive response we are getting from multiple new potential customers in the silicon carbide space we are confident in our growth and are raising our guidance for revenue for the year â fiscal 2022 financial guidance for the fiscal year ending may 31 2022 aehr is raising its previously provided guidance

aside from diesel fuel engine oil might be the most critical fluid in a truck because it influences two of the top three equipment related costs for fleets fuel and maintenance and with various weights blends and formulations available proper selection is a key enabler of driving down cost of ownership engine oils are formulated with two primary components base stocks and additives base stocks or base oils serve as the building block for the formulation and can account for 70 to 80 of the total lubricant composition said mobil delvac applications engineer nicolas rivera very high performing lubes are formulated made using synthetic base stocks from specially tailored and selected materials which have no impurities mineral base stocks are produced from crude oil and depending on final application can undergo different refining methods in order to remove impurities and achieve the desired properties chevron lubricants staff engineer shawn whitacre noted that synthetic oils feature a base oil that is more highly refined which produces a less volatile oil with increased temperature performance viscosity index vi also lower volatility means lower consumption and less top off synthetic oils may cost more upfront but there are savings on the backend find out more in the video above oils thicken at low temperatures and thin at high temperatures added karin haumann oem technical manager for shell global solutions synthetic oils are made with base oils that have a higher vi meaning that they are more temperature stable with less dramatic viscosity changes with temperature because synthetic oils offer more temperature stability whitacre said they are optimal selection for applications that operate in extreme environmental or severe duty conditions synthetic and highly refined mineral based oils are designed to be more resistant to thermal breakdown which helps them retain their new oil properties longer added rivera this helps the customer realize an oil s fuel efficiency advantages across the oil drain cycle and also ensure engine cleanliness and long term durability in a cold climate synthetics allow for better flow and protection on start and warm up according to darryl purificati oem technical liaison at hollyfrontier lubricants specialties which includes the petro canada lubricants brand using synthetic fluids also means less work is required from the engine which improves the overall health of the vehicle synthetic oils also tend to have better oxidation stability which can lead to a longer oil life oxidation is driven by high temperatures which make severe operating conditions an excellent application for synthetic oils haumann said synthetic oils cost more upfront than conventional but whitacre noted there are savings to be had in that synthetics can enable longer service intervals on top of fuel economy benefits heather wales north american brand and communications manager for shell rotella posed the following example truck one runs a conventional 15w 40 at 20 000 mile drain intervals truck two runs a full synthetic 5w 40 at 60 000 mile drain intervals both trucks run 120 000 miles per year and require 15 gallons of oil per oil change that means truck one will be off the road for service five times per year using 75 gallons of oil and truck two will be off the road two times per year using only 30 gallons of oil add that to the benefits of fuel economy uptime and longer engine life and the savings could be significant wales said so while a lower viscosity synthetic engine oil might seem like a bigger investment it pays off in the long run there s also environmental considerations because as purificati points out reducing the number of drains also reduces the waste oil that needs to be processed and disposed of at the same time rivera said a full synthetic oil may not make economic sense for fleets with older equipment or limited pm optimization potential regardless of the application these are all situations where an oil analysis program can add value in evaluating the condition of the oil condition of the equipment and whether or not the correct oil is being used he said should you change your oil type check out the video above synthetic blend formulations act as a step between full synthetic and conventional products in this case manufacturers blend specific cuts of highly refined synthetic base stocks with conventional base oil to achieve a certain performance level rivera said and these can strike a perfect balance between enhanced wear protection fuel efficiency extended drain potential and value while synthetic blend products could be seen as a bridge because of their lower price point compared to full synthetic wales said they are great products in their own right adding synthetic blend engine oils offer protection for longer engine life extended oil drain capabilities and up to 2 fuel economy compared to a conventional 15w 40 heavy duty engine oil has become probably the number one choice of large fleets who are looking for that fuel economy advantage and really that combination of price and performance whitacre said it s also a very key consideration for fleets that operate in a variety of operating climates

although today we live in a fractious political environment there is one area of widespread agreement among individuals and groups of differing political perspectives it is that economic growth is good administrations and elected officeholders of both major political parties praise economic growth especially when it happens on their watch cheers are heard and positive statements to the press are released when job growth is strong the unemployment rate plunges and companies production and sales are good when the opposite occurs fewer jobs higher unemployment or weak production worries are heard and economists are asked what can be done to put the economy back on track it s easy to understand why economic growth is the accepted goal growth means more jobs and more income for many workers and companies additionally firms with higher sales will be more willing to hire and to offer higher pay to workers for investors economic growth usually leads to higher stock values however there are critics who point to problems resulting from economic growth waste rising prices pollution more traffic and congestion and the psychological negatives from being pushed to be bigger and better are some of the downsides raised by doubters those who question economic growth have often been heard in north carolina s fast growing metropolitan regions so who s correct the growth supporters or the growth doubters or is there a middle ground growth supporters argue boosting the size of the economy is necessary in a country increasing in population and desiring higher standards of living for its residents with more people more jobs are needed additional products and services must to be provided and consequently more spending will occur plus to improve their lifestyles workers will pursue occupations with higher salaries which in turn generates even more spending growth supporters reply to some of the complaints of the growth doubters by pointing to one simple fact countries with higher standards of living tend to spend more creating pollution abating technology developing improvements in health care contributing to charities and providing larger social safety nets for struggling individuals this makes sense as economic growth pushes standards of living higher societies can move away from focusing mainly on staying alive to worrying about broader issues like pollution and the environment plus richer societies will have more available income and wealth to devote to these problems while growth doubters may acknowledge these benefits from faster economic growth they say it isn t enough in rich countries roads are still congested pollutants continue to be released into the air and waters landfalls are clogged with thrown away products and open fields are being replaced with subdivisions growth doubters worry the future is still threatened by economic growth economists are trained to recognize these issues indeed economists have a term for these by products of growth negative externalities a negative externality occurs when i do something that benefits me like purchasing a new washing machine yet doing so creates harm for society such as adding my discarded washing machine to a landfall fortunately economists have created an approach for addressing negative externalities and using it can create a middle ground between the growth supporters and the growth doubters the idea from economists is simple have the generator of the negative externality recognize it by paying a fee for the harm it creates imposing such a fee can have two beneficial results for those who still engage in the activity or purchase the product that causes the negative externality the fees will create funds to help mitigate the adverse results however others may react by deciding the additional fee makes the activity or product too costly thereby encouraging them to use alternatives that do not produce negative externalities examples of these negative externality fees are fees on fuels that generate carbon dioxide fees to drive in congested areas disposal fees added to the purchase price of limited life products like electronics and appliances and development fees to purchase and preserve open space while these fees make the cost of living higher today they can make the harmful by products of a prosperous and growing economy lower both today and tomorrow hence there can be three alternative approaches to economic growth promote it curtail it or promote it but have policies in place to deal with growth s potential negative consequences you decide which is the best walden is a william neal reynolds distinguished professor emeritus at north carolina state university

holds good numbers of bluegills perch crappie catfish carp walleye and largemouth bass on rare occasions one might even catch a trout a smallmouth bass or a northern pike which must be killed if it doesn t have a tag or released and reported to the utah division of wildlife resources if it has a tag you could also catch a june sucker an endangered species found only in utah lake if you do make

washington ap the idea of the u s government breaching its debt limit sounds scary but what exactly are lawmakers in washington fighting about the debt limit is a nearly century old artificial cap that congress placed on the u s government s ability to borrow lawmakers have raised or suspended it nearly 80 times since 1960 but there is a deepening partisan standoff this time underscoring how the debt limit has evolved into a political weapon house democrats voted tuesday to suspend the debt limit through the end of 2022 that proposal is likely to meet fierce resistance in the evenly split senate where republican lawmakers say president joe biden and the democrats in power should go it alone as they also try to move on a multitrillion dollar package of tax increases on the wealthy and new spending on children health care infrastructure and the environment the biden administration insists on bipartisanship on the issue it is not a partisan issue to want to protect the full faith and credit of the united states white house press secretary jen psaki said wednesday aboard air force one watch extending government funding and raising debt ceiling face uphill senate battle the issue is time sensitive because the extraordinary measures used by the treasury department to keep the government running would be exhausted in october if congress fails to act it creates the possibility of a default that could send financial markets crashing and the economy plunging into a recession the house passed bill also ties the suspension to a measure that would continue to fund the federal government through dec 3 republicans despite their refusal to help agree with democrats that a default must be avoided america must never default we never have and we never will senate republican leader mitch mcconnell declared wednesday as he then voiced his opposition to a bipartisan increase here is an explainer on the problem why is there a debt limit before world war i congress needed to approve each bond issuance the debt limit was created as a workaround to finance the war effort without needing a constant series of votes since then a tool created to make it easier for the government to function has become a source of dysfunction stoking partisan warfare and creating economic risk as the debt has increased in size over the past 20 years the congressional budget office estimates that annual budget deficits of 1 trillion or more will be routine for the next decade so the issue will be recurring the debt rose in large part to fund the recoveries from the great recession and the coronavirus pandemic the imbalance over the coming years increasingly reflects government expenses for programs such as medicare and social security that are outstripping tax revenues how big is the debt limit the cap is now 28 4 trillion during the trump administration the debt limit was suspended three times the last suspension passed on a bipartisan basis in 2019 when the debt stood at 22 trillion ended in july the treasury department has since been engaging in what it calls extraordinary measures to keep the government operating the 28 4 trillion debt is bigger than the yearly u s gross domestic product the biden administration and congressional democrats say the next debt limit suspension should be bipartisan because it applies to previous spending approved by the government it s akin to paying a credit card bill and a signal to the financial markets that the united states will be fiscally responsible watch mcconnell refuses to help raise federal debt limit estimates from moody s analytics say that a potential recession from government cuts if the cap stays in place could lead to 6 million job losses and stock market declines that could eliminate 15 trillion of household wealth why do republicans oppose an increase put simply they re out of power and they dislike biden s policy agenda while the administration notes that the debt ceiling reflects prior spending choices mcconnell and the republicans are linking any increase to biden s multitrillion dollar plans to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations in order to fund programs and tax breaks that could aid the middle class mcconnell has said the tax hikes would ultimately hurt the middle class and lead to a socialist transformation of the country democrats control the senate the house and the white house mcconnell said wednesday if they want to ram through another reckless taxing and spending spree that hurts working families and helps china without any republican input they will need to raise the debt limit on their own democrats helped republicans suspend the debt limit when republicans controlled congress after democrats retook the house in 2019 speaker nancy pelosi negotiated a broader spending package with the trump administration that included a debt ceiling hike who is to blame for the rising debt everyone the debt limit was suspended three times under trump who used debt to fund his 2017 tax cuts and then needed to borrow even more when the economy tanked last year with covid 19 both biden and obama took office amid weakened economies and passed ambitious aid packages that required the government to borrow more investors enabled congress to run higher deficits because low interest rates made it easier to fund the government through debt interest rates on 10 year u s treasury notes are lower now than in fiscal 2001 when the government last ran an annual surplus polling by the pew research center suggests voters became less concerned about the debt as the pandemic raged just 47 last year said the deficit was a very big problem down from 55 in 2018 read more house pushes through debt and government funding plan will face pushback from gop why not just get rid of the limit one easy fix would be to completely repeal the debt limit so that it can no longer be used as leverage in congressional fights that step would allow the spending and taxes approved by congress and the president to determine how much debt the government issues instead of a legally binding but otherwise superfluous cap a biden administration official insisting on anonymity to discuss private conversations said the white house would only weigh in on the elimination if congress showed there was support for the idea there is some bipartisan backing among those who have previously dealt with this challenge harvard university professor jason furman formerly the top economist in obama s white house and rohit kumar a former aide to mcconnell advocated for removing the cap in a 2017 wall street journal op ed
the white house and congressional democrats have agreed to a framework of options to pay for their huge emerging social and environment bill top democrats said thursday now they face the daunting task of narrowing the menu to tax possibilities they can pass to fund president joe biden s 3 5 trillion plan senate majority leader chuck schumer of new york and house speaker nancy pelosi of california announced the progress as biden administration officials and democratic congressional leaders negotiated behind the scenes the package aims to rewrite tax and spending priorities to expand programs for americans of all ages while upping efforts to tackle income inequality and fight climate change staring down a self imposed monday deadline lawmakers said they would work nonstop to find agreement on specifics democrats views on those vary widely though they largely agree with biden s idea of raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy to fund the package we certainly think it s progress biden press secretary jen pskai said at the white house biden has been encouraging the negotiations inviting more than 20 of his party s moderate and progressive lawmakers to the white house for lengthy meetings this week he s working to close the deal with congress on his build back better agenda at a time when his presidential campaign promises are running into the difficulty of actually governing but the party has been divided over many of the details moderate democrats most prominently senators joe manchin of west virginia and kyrsten sinema of arizona are demanding that the massive dollar total be reduced the revenue options to pay for it that mostly means taxes being considered can be dialed up or down the leaders say the ultimate price tag may certainly slip from the much publicized 3 5 trillion republicans are solidly opposed to the package calling it a reckless tax and spending spree so democrats will have to push it through congress on their own which is only possible if they limit their defections to a slim few in the house and none in the senate we re proceeding pelosi said we intend to stay the course and pass the bill as soon as possible the congressional leaders huddled early thursday with the chairs of the tax writing committees to agree to the framework pulling from work already being done on those panels they are intent on sticking to biden s pledge not to raise taxes on people making less than 400 000 a year representative richard neal the chairman of the house ways and means committee has already drafted his version which would raise about 2 3 trillion by increasing corporate tax rates to 26 5 for businesses earning more than 5 million a year and increasing the top individual tax from 37 to 39 6 for those earning more than 400 000 or 450 000 for married households the house panel s bill also includes a 3 surtax on the adjusted incomes of very wealthy people making more than 5 million a year the senate finance committee under senator ron wyden has not yet passed its bill but it has been eyeing proposals that further target the superrich including efforts to curtail practices used to avoid paying taxes i m not going to get into any specific stuff today but i ve made it very clear as chairman of the finance committee a billionaire s tax will be on the menu wyden said those tax goals align with the biden administration which is marshaling arguments that the increases are fundamentally about fairness at a time of gaping income inequality according to a new analysis released thursday by the white house the wealthiest 400 families worth more than a billion dollars paid an average tax rate of just 8 2 between 2010 and 2018 treasury department tables show that is lower than the average tax rate of families with an income of roughly 142 000 the analysis suggests two clear reasons why billionaires pay a lower rate than the upper middle class they derive income from stocks dividends and other assets that are taxed at lower rates and they can permanently avoid paying tax on certain investment gains that by law are excluded from taxable income without divulging a framework wyden indicated he is in agreement with the house s plans for certain retirement savings accounts used by the wealthy to shield liabilities targeting mega iras democrats hope to correct what they see as a flaw in the retirement savings system enabling billionaires to amass millions in independent retirement accounts without ever paying taxes under some proposals individuals earning beyond 400 000 would be barred from contributing to their iras once their account balances top 10 million the biden administration has also shown interest in one climate change tax a so called pollution importer fee which would essentially impose a tariff on goods coming from countries without certain emissions controls the tax is seen as a way to pressure china gaining less traction seems to be a carbon tax that could fall on households and stray from biden s pledge not to tax those earning less than 400 000 another big unknown whether democrats can coalesce around a plan to rein in prescription drug costs which could save the government hundreds of billions that could be used for biden s goals thursday s sudden announcement of framework options caught key lawmakers off guard including senator bernie sanders an independent and the chairman of the budget committee and others playing leading roles in assembling one of the biggest bills congress has ever attempted schumer later acknowledged of the emerging framework it s hardly conclusory but it was a good step of progress yet the framework could help the congressional leaders show momentum as they head toward crucial deadlines and start to address concerns raised by manchin and other moderates who want a more clear cut view of what taxes are being considered before they move forward aides said on monday the house plans to begin considering a separate 1 trillion package of road and other infrastructure projects as a first test of biden s agenda that public works bill has already passed the senate and pelosi has agreed to schedule it for a house vote to assuage party moderates who badly want that legislation passed but are leery of supporting the larger 3 5 trillion measure but progressives are threatening to defeat the public works bill as inadequate unless it is partnered with the broader package to make sure both bills can pass democratic leaders are trying to reach agreement on the bigger bill meanwhile the house and senate remain at a standstill over a separate package to keep the government funded past the sept 30 fiscal year end and to suspend the federal debt limit to avert a shutdown and a devastating u s default on payments senate republicans are refusing to back that house passed bill despite the risk of triggering a fiscal crisis
